that the marriage of david latwell and his wife was a far from happy one.
which would have no bearing on this case even if it were so.
it would have bearing if she murdered her husband and donald briggs found out about it.
harry, you were there, you know i was in bed for a week.
it was taken from a newspaper dated the same night of david latwell's murder.
it shows david latwell in the crowd with a young woman who was the miss x of the ben deveraux trial, the present lois reed.
that clipping is identical with the one found in the possession of donald briggs.
it led briggs to believe that martha norris had murdered her husband.
mr. mason, there seems to be no probable cause for action against the defendant and he is ordered to be released from custody.
and i instruct the district attorney to take the necessary steps to instigate further investigation in this case as soon as possible.
i firmly believe that everyone should indulge now and then in some form of athletic sport, don't you?
personally, i don't require much exercise, since i lead a very spartan existence.
oh, he is just one of the most important men in our party.
fine record in state politics, third-term member of the legislature and i...
i very neatly and nicely shot mr. reeves in the back of the head.
no one saw me come in, no one saw me leave, so no one will ever know.
all you have to do is to find yourself another murderer.
no one will know that it was i. find someone else, that's all.
i always knew you were ambitious, richard, but i never realized it was a disease.
now, look, i went to a great deal of trouble for you and you don't appear to be very cooperative.
you taught him how to live, how to dress, how to spend.
and you taught him so well that he wound up exactly where you wanted him.
yes, it was good business to ruin a man, it was good business to kill a man, but what good is it going to do to kill laura?
i can't listen to this anymore, i don't want to hear it again.
the day that tommy kopeck is executed, i'll bring her back.
come, laura dear, we have a long trip ahead of us tonight.
needless to say, mrs. grant was brought to trial, but fortunately, the jury took into account many of the circumstances which we saw reenacted tonight.
on our next program, we shall present another story, and i will also be back to provide the marginalia.

it is said that the souls of the swamp ... are bewitched.
and the spirits took my uncle's body ... without anyone noticing.
you will stay here until we come back ... and then we'll see what will be done with you.
i only need a couple more clues to wrap up this case.
at first, that you killed him, then that you've moved the body.
and then, pictures in the newspapers, law suits, scandals, they discover you didn't pay your taxes, that you have a mistress, you're on coke, they tie you to the call-girls.
- they fling you inside all the same, and then they talk.
no, they don't fling me inside, because i'm a free citizen.
poor soul, they'd put him inside every time the king went out in his carriage.
you have to tell me everything, i must be sure i'm alright.
you know, alberto, i've got news you'll also be pleased about.
after 5 years of fighting the bureaucracy, the body of my husband...
before mass-producing it, we should find out how the public reacts to it.
we could repeat the experiment with the floppy tyrolian, d'you remember, sir?
so, we've lived together for three years without understanding each other?
but you're latin alberto, it's so easy figuring out a latino, kid's stuff.
exactly because i want to be loyal to this man, to this poor body.
he was stuck in brennero and we just couldn't free it, remember?
mr. menichetti, i'll be waiting for your resignation before the end of the month.
sir, it was moment of disbandment for which i'm to blame.
- yes, madam, but i can't appreciate them because, tomorrow, one of us will be fired.
as a matter of fact, here's your resignation letter, will you sign it?
then you're doing it on purpose, you want to get me into trouble.
it's not possible, i'm already running away from one person, a lady who's... .. following me, who's jealous, who, among other things, i've come to know, has shot her husband already.
i come with you, i take refuge close to an unexperienced girl, who doesn't know anything, and that's why i love her, i like her, and i find out she's expecting, that she's in love with fernando,
a big one, jealous, unemployed, who'll kill me if he sees us together, then admit you always want to scare me in this life...
you've come with me, and you go on talking about him!
i'm not fernando, i've got a situation to uphold in life.
tomorrow i'm going to work, but i bet my head i'll find him there.
i have to go, you understand, seeing my situation, what do you...
sure, and a revolution will break out and the police chief will take it on me.
once and for all, can't you understand that i'm charged without arrest?
it's better not to put me to sleep, i'm calmer awake.
and then, if you do it tomorrow, never even, i'd be much better, sister.
i've been operating for 6 hours and i'm exhausted and you can only apologise.
don't you understand i have to operate and i must have peace?
after a decade of democracy... .. the people of the capital is giving a peremptory demonstration of its maturity
as a matter of fact, this day, vibrant with contrasts and polemics, is ending without any incident having been noticed.
the police chief told me that every time a bomb goes off he'll be thinking of me.
don't you know that in this very moment the police chief is thinking of me?
aunt, do you know that if they find the socks i'll be indicted?
how could the police chief know that those are your socks?
you look like your uncle giustino when he died in the madhouse.
sure, careful you two, because me also i could go insane suddenly.
he said he was going to bergamo and it was the palermo train.
the young lady can bear witness i'm not making up anything.
i was with the here present dottor pedocchi, and with my colleague bilancia.
we lingered on at the exit from the "sistina" theater, waiting for the dancers
and then, would you see me going with a guy like him?
and, besides, he took advantage of you, and you being underage.
she has always lived abroad because she didn't love italy, you understand?
she killed him near cortina, her ambassador of a husband, during a boar hunt.
tell me, madam, what do you think about that young man?
i've always believed he was mean, but i thought he was redeemable.
now, you tell me, devils in charge of this boy, where should i go, what should i do?
where can i find a place where i can have peace, security, where i can feel protected, where do i find it?
vast riches were developed under french guidance until 1941, when japanese troops moved in and made the rice bowl red with blood of the defenders.
in 1945, when the japanese surrender was announced, a moscow-trained indo-chinese revolutionist who called himself ho chi minh began the drive to make his own country another target for chinese communists.
france was left alone to hold the hottest front in the world, and became the barrier between communism and the rape of asia.
members of the foreign legion imported from north africa fought valiantly under the french flag, but the ammunition pipeline from moscow could not be found.
her supplies have been ambushed, her ammunition depleted, but she fights as she starves.
her only chance of survival is the american food air-drop from the south.
the chinese say i'm this, the french say i'm that, the americans say i'm...
as far as i'm concerned you and the hammer and sickle boys can go fight it out among yourselves.
a notarized guarantee that the baby would be born with eyes aimed your way?
do you know why she volunteered to go on this mission?
that she was mixed up in murder, that she caused a man to take his life, that she operated in black markets and lived like a princess, and lived like a prostitute.
they say she's a traitor to france, they say she's a traitor to the chinese reds.
say, why did you leave your own army to fight here in indochina?
well, what i started out to do in korea, i didn't finish.
but i got sick of watching the way they took my church over.
i was going to the university of budapest when it happened.
you knew all about me, but i didn't know all about you.
sure, you'd traveled all over the world, but you hadn't learned anything.
this time the foreign legion mercenary is not fighting for money, nor for the french government alone.
this time they're fighting for the whole western world, against a common enemy.
when my wife was told we couldn't have one, we put in papers to adopt one.
but my wife got sick, eaten up inside, not bein' able to have one.
it's hard for me to believe how you can talk so indifferently about killing women and children.
i remember when you used to hate any kind of brutality.
the day i can report directly to moscow, instead of through peking...
that's the day i'll be in line to command the viet minh politburo.
the difference between failure and success is in doing a thing nearly right, and doing it exactly right.
if all this fails to convince you that you'd be marrying the winner,
france was left alone to hold the hottest front in the world,
and became the barrier between communism and the rape of asia.
you know the 100 miles from here to the border like you know your cognac!
you have made this trip, oh, a hundred times with your cousin.
we are interested in the major because he is the lock to the dump
and you are the only key that can open him up.
the chinese say i'm this, the french say i'm that, the americans say i'm... (sighs) as far as i'm concerned
you and the hammer and sickle boys can go fight it out among yourselves.
you're too sharp a soldier to swap lies and believe them.
(laughing) i was thirteen when hitler turned my ears into sponges.
but i got sick of watching the way they took my church over.
i was going to the university of budapest when it happened.
you knew all about me, but i didn't know all about you.
sure, you'd traveled all over the world, but you hadn't learned anything.
this time they're fighting for the whole western world, against a common enemy.
so it is only natural that time will change the interests of the men.
professional hunters, descendants perhaps, in the tradition, of those warriors to whom the ancient inhabitants would entrust the protection of their lives and their property in exchange for maintenance.
even now, when they kill a wolf, they take it with a cart around the villages of the mountain to gather the poor things that the shepherds can give them as payment.
the city of vischio makes known to all citizens that it will pay the sum of 20,000 lire to who will kill a wolf.
if it is a female, this will yield 5,000 lire more.
now my mother binds her to the donkey and drags her into the country.
so the wolf smells the sheep, follows her, and is caught in the trap.
you know, i don't wanna keep on running after wolves all my life.
if you stay poor, it means you're no good at it!
even now, when they kill a wolf, they take it with a cart around the villages of the mountain to gather the poor things that the shepherds can give them as payment.
silent and strong, like the mountains among which they grew up, wolfers a bit by need, and much by atavistic passion, these men have preserved intact, of their precursors, an indomitable spirit of independence that prevents them from having a master.
ah, sometimes i think i have two children instead of one!
the city of vischio makes known to all citizens that it will pay the sum of 20,000 lire to who will kill a wolf.
then, you have some money to lend to your little brother, huh?
you think i don't know where this is going to end?
my land starts at the oak and ends at the valley.
i give to eat for as long as there is snow.
you put in the money, and i'll teach you how to live.
even with mine and my father's money, you'd stay a drifter.
when i hug you, you're no longer good at being bully.
a true wolfer doesn't take a dog and passes him off as a wolf!
and then charlie, i mean mr. pohanka, became a headmaster, you know.
he was a teacher for a shorf while before, but had good connections.
nan, what would your reaction be to, er... making a night of it?
we could, er... have a drink and then some food, then another drink.
if we go on to this place, it might make us late driving back to london.
i'm sure they could put us up for the night, if it's all right with you.
i do my nearer visits on a bicycle, for the fresh air, you know.
we could make an arrangement by which you had part use of it.
apart from that and taking the dogs for walks and dealing with emergencies amongst the staff, your time is your own.
i'll give you a thousand a year and if you want any relief - and you look the type that would - there are plenty of pretty local girls.
- i'm as fit as a flea at the moment, and so are the staff.
i may drop dead at any moment, but that'll just be bad luck on you.
it's none of my business, but aren't you getting goose pimples?
it's lovely to have someone hold your hand, sympathise with you, tell you you're wonderful, even if you're not really very ill.
as a matter of fact, i wanted to be a surgeon, but i don't think i ever shall now.
so i've just got to be good as a different sort of doctor.
and when the lamb opened the seventh seal, there was in heaven a silence which lasted about the space of half an hour.
and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
then she saw that i'd seen her and she smiled at me.
i got tears in my eyes and when i wiped them away, she disappeared.
i can't help the holy virgin revealing herself and that angels and devils like to be with me.
haven't i said it once and for all that i need to sleep in the morning?
the strange thing is that people see the plague as a punishment from god.
supplicants trail through the land and whip themselves into god's favor.
through my indifference for people, i've been placed outside of their society.
now i live in a ghost world, enclosed in my dreams and imaginings.
is it so terribly inconceivable to comprehend god with one's senses?
why does he hide in a cloud of half-promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?
what will happen to us who want to believe, but cannot?
why does he live on in me in an humiliating way despite my wanting to evict him from my heart?
why is he, despite all, a mocking reality i can't be rid of?
have you got a year left to pollute the earth with your debris?
do you know, you confirmed idiots, that you are all going to die?
i'm going to pinch them in the nose with my pliers.
i'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.
if all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.
you're lucky to have such a fluid tongue that you believe your own twaddle.
...read soliloquies to one another until dust forms in the devil's ears.
careful i don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.
so no bears, wolves or ghosts can get hold of me.
i'll find jof and mia tomorrow, then we'll go to the all saints festival.
- god, you that exist somewhere, that must exist somewhere, have mercy on us.
i had an herb to purge your anxiety over the eternal.
they move away, away from the dawn, in a solemn dance, away to the dark country.
whilst the rain washes over their faces, cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.
why must he hide in a midst of vague promises... and invisible miracles?
how are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves?
you, woman, full of the lust of life... will you wither before the dawn?
you, with the swollen nose... will you pollute the earth for another year?
now to find a tree where i'll be safe... from bears, wolves and ghosts.
tomorrow i'll find joseph and mary... and off we go to the saints' festival.
i could have purged your worries about eternity... but now it's too late.
but feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!

you should see the boil on the neck of the sick.
see how the body contracts, until his limbs become a rope of madness.
why does he hide in a cloud of half-promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?
yes, i say so without bitterness or self-reproach, as i know that almost all of peopleâ€™s lives are made this way.
but i want to use my respite for one meaningful act.
i've read, heard and experienced most stories we tell one another.
even the ghost story of god, jesus christ and the holy spirit,
it's like loving someone in the dark who never comes, no matter how you call.
but all of that seems unreal when i sit here with you and your husband.
and i will carry this memory between my hands, as carefully as if it were a bowl brimming with freshly milked milk.
and this will be a sign for me, and greatly fulfilling.
- "why don't you kiss me?" - "why don't you sing?"
- "why don't you love me like before?" - "why don't you eye my new shift?"
i'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.
i'm going to crack them lightly on the head with the sledgehammer.
there are only a few poor dullards now and then who die of love.
if all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.
i'm so lonely and don't want to go home as they all laugh at me.
as long as you don't sob all the time or we'll leave you.
- you awful, cropped bastard of seven mangy mongrels, if i were in your infested rags,
i'd be afflicted by such boundless shame that i'd free nature from my embarrassing countenance.
careful i don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.
careful i don't smack you so you can't even play for turks and cannibals.

she wore a golden crown and a blue robe with golden flowers.
she was barefoot, and in her little brown hands she was holding the child and teaching him to walk.
they try to tear the boils right out of their flesh.
they bite their own hands, scratch open their own veins, and scream to high heaven.
remarkably, the poor wretches think that the plague is a punishment from god.
crowds of "sinners" wander the land whipping themselves and others to please the lord.
i want to confess as honestly as i can, but my heart is empty.
and the emptiness is a mirror turned toward my own face.
i see myself in it, and it fills me with loathing and horror.
my indifference to my fellow men has cut me off from their company.
why must he hide in a fog of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves?
he grins at death, scoffs at the lord, laughs at himself, and smiles at the girls.
he lives in a jons-world believable only to himself, ridiculous to all, including himself, meaningless to heaven, and of no interest to hell.
if all that's true, then we should enjoy life as long as we're still standing.
many have died trying to purge themselves in fire, but better to die pure than live for hell, the priests say.
it's like loving someone out in the darkness who never comes, no matter how loud you call.
how unreal that all seems now here with you and your husband.
i'll twist their noses off with pliers and bash their chests in with a hammer.
i'll give them a nice little tap on the head with a sledgehammer.
you stubble-headed bastard of seven mangy mongrels, if i were in your lice-infested rags,
i'd feel such boundless shame about my own person that i would immediately rid nature of my own mortifying countenance.
and i'll prod you in the belly so hard your guts will run out your ears.
and i'll punch you so hard that you'll never again perform your tricks for turks and cannibals.

and when the lamb opened the seventh seal there was in heaven a silence which lasted about the space of half an hour.
and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
then she saw that i'd seen her and she smiled at me.
i got tears in my eyes and when i wiped them away, she disappeared.
i can't help the holy virgin revealing herself and that angels and devils like to be with me.
haven't i said it once and for all that i need to sleep in the morning?
the strange thing is that people see the plague as a punishment from god.
supplicants trail through the land and whip themselves into god's favour.
why does he hide in a cloud of half-promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?
have you got a year left to pollute the earth with your debris?
do you know, you confirmed idiots, that you are all going to die?
- "why don't you kiss me?" - "why don't you sing?"
- "why don't you love me like before?" - "why don't you eye my new shift?"
i'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.
i'm going to crack them lightly on the head with the sledgehammer.
there are only a few poor dullards now and then who die of love.
if all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in it's perfect imperfection.
i'm so lonely and don't want to go home as they all laugh at me.
as long as you don't sob all the time or we'll leave you.
- you awful, cropped bastard of seven mangey mongrels, if i were in your infested rags -
- i'd be afflicted by such boundless shame that i'd free nature from my embarrassing countenance.
careful i don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.
careful i don't smack you so you can't even play for turks and cannibals.
"and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets" "prepared themselves to sound."
"the first angel sounded" "and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood."
how are we to believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves?
what will become of us who want to believe, but cannot?
why does he go on living in a painful, humiliating way?
i want to tear him out of my heart... but he remains a mocking reality... which i cannot get rid of.
you there, with the stare of a goat... will tonight see your last twisted smile?
you, woman, full of the lust of life... will you wither before the dawn?
now to find a tree where i'll be safe... from bears, wolves and ghosts.
tomorrow i'll find joseph and mary... and off we go to the saints' festival.
i could have purged your worries about eternity... but now it's too late.
but feel, to the very end, the triumph of being alive!
you should see the boil on the neck of the sick.
see how the body contracts, until his limbs become a rope of madness.
why does he hide in a cloud of half- promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe in the faithful when we lack faith?
yes, i say so without bitterness or self-reproach, as i know that almost all of people's lives are made this way.
but i want to use my respite for one meaningful act.
i've read, heard and experienced most stories we tell one another.
even the ghost story of god, jesus christ and the holy spirit,
i'm going to pinch them in the nose with my pliers.
i'm going to pound them on the chest with the little hammer.
if all is imperfect in this imperfect world, then love is most imperfect in its perfect imperfection.
you're lucky to have such a fluid tongue that you believe your own twaddle.
...read soliloquies to one another until dust forms in the devil's ears.
careful i don't poke your belly so your intestines flow out your ears.
so no bears, wolves or ghosts can get hold of me.
i'll find jof and mia tomorrow, then we'll go to the all saints festival.
- god, you that exist somewhere, that must exist somewhere, have mercy on us.
i had an herb to purge your anxiety over the eternal.
they move away, away from the dawn, in a solemn dance, away to the dark country.
whilst the rain washes over their faces, cleans their cheeks of tears of salt.

i've read, heard and experienced most stories we tell one another.
even the ghost story of god, jesus christ and the holy spirit,
it's like loving someone in the dark who never comes, no matter how you call.
but all of that seems unreal when i sit here with you and your husband.
and i will carry this memory between my hands, as carefully as if it were a bowl brimming with freshly milked milk.
and this will be a sign for me, and greatly fulfilling.

she wore a golden crown and a blue robe with golden flowers.
she was barefoot, and in her little brown hands she was holding the child and teaching him to walk.
and the emptiness is a mirror turned toward my own face.
i see myself in it, and it fills me with loathing and horror.
my indifference to my fellow men has cut me off from their company.
i live now in a world of phantoms, a prisoner of my own dreams.
must it be so cruelly inconceivable to know god through one's senses?
why must he hide in a fog of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?
how can we believe the believers when we don't believe ourselves?
what will become of us who want to believe but cannot?
why must he live on inside me in this painful, humiliating way when i want to tear him out of my heart?
why does he remain a mocking reality that i cannot shake off?
i say that without bitterness or self-reproach, knowing that most men's lives are the same.
but i want to use my reprieve for one meaningful act.
you, woman... blooming with lust for life and pleasure... will you grow pale and wither before the dawn?
you there... with your bulbous nose and idiotic grin... do you have another year to defile the earth with your refuse?
business should be good this time of year, but damn it, i haven't sold a thing.
they speak of judgment day, and there's all the evil omens.
i'll try to remember what we spoke of... and i'll hold this memory in my hands like a bowl of fresh milk full to the brim.
and it will be a sign for me... and a source of great satisfaction.
i'm so lonely, and they'll just laugh at me at home.
just don't blubber all the time, or we'll leave you behind.
now to find a tree i can climb up so no bears, wolves or ghosts can get me.
tomorrow i'll look for jof and mia, and off we'll go to elsinore.
and the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.
the first angel sounded his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth.
and a third part of the earth was burnt up... and a third part of the trees was burnt up... and all the green grass was burnt up.
and the second angel sounded his trumpet... and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea.

at the head goes the strict master... with the scythe and hourglass.

you'll waste 14 days up and down to the doctor, and you'll spend a lot of money.
maybe he'll make an injection and will leave him cripple for life.
there was a storm that night the wind and rain blew.
a few years later she left for poland to study piano.
the spirits of the people who pass by gets stuck in them.
so if you strip off a bit of the doorsill... make it into powder and eat it you'll get inspiration.

for those of you who have missed the earlier installments, or have lost your scorecards, i shall present a resume.
within a few hours after count victor mattoni was found dead in his london flat with a single bullet hole in his head, the detectives found themselves with three persons, each of whom confessed that he, and he alone, killed the count.
and it had better be a good one, i'll tell you that.
well, inspector, i've been working steady and going straight ever since the war, but not long ago a pal of mine put me on a scheme for the dogs.
do you think they might put them in the museum at the yard, sir?
raines, at this moment, i don't care if they put them in the museum or not.
i want you to take them all down to the yard, but arrange for separate transportation.
i don't want them to know about each other till they get there.
well, you know, before you had 12 murders but you'd only caught 11 murderers.
well, now you've caught three more murderers and only added one murder.
countess mattoni, it's very gallant of you to try and protect your father, but quite useless, i'm afraid.
even if you did see your husband last night, you could not have killed him.
i knew we'd finish that story if we kept at it.
i'm sure inspector davidson is longing for the good old days, when on investigating a robin's death, he simply went out and arrested the first sparrow he saw carrying a bow and an empty quiver.
i drew the black ace, but he was dead already when i got there, lying on the floor.
so i put him in the chair and left the clues for all of us as we'd planned, but i didn't do him in, sir.

you could find a gimmick for me-- a girl with your mind.
in case you forget, mr. warner, my mind is up here and you better get back up there.
there's moon that's big and bright in the milky way tonight
but the way you act, you never would know it's there
there was a guy in st. joe, missouri one time told me he'd pay me to sing in his show.
after i sung he run out on me and took my guitar with him.
they tell us one of longhorn county's own has got a different way with the song.
and if we persuade the boy he'll come up here and do a little number for us.
glenda, susan-- we all think it's about time you stopped getting up out of the audience.
beginning tomorrow you're starting right out on the stage with the rest of us.
i've got a rich oil widow dreamed up in oklahoma city.
she's always wanted a son like deke rivers, someone to take care of, buy him things.
this is just the kind of thing that will make front-page publicity.
and in a city as big as dallas, they've got a front page as big as your feature,
you're not like these punks you see around-- wise guys full of their own future, ready to spit in the first eye that doesn't light up to them.
you're a boy any man would be proud to have as a son.
if i didn't get out of the theater once in a while
i'd think the population of america was female and under 20.
and the next thing i remember is that crack in the ceiling above my cot at the home,
jagged like a cut of lightning in a summer electric storm.
even after the lights were out i could still see it.
sometimes i'd lay there crying and then miss whipshaw would come in and say, be still, tompkins.
funny, too... after the first five shots, it all came back to me.
you better struggle down to the barbershop across the street and have yourself restored.
i never realized how much i meant to her last night.
take a tip from somebody who's been there-- watch your self in the clinches.
this is freegate, texas, a town that dedicates itself to the american ideal of freedom.
a town that tonight is asking america to help it judge its own judgment.
it was here that a young, hitherto unknown entertainer made local headlines only two days ago.
i think that deke rivers should be allowed to sing anywhere that he pleases.
i think it's pretty silly to say that his performance has any kind of influence on kids or anybody.
you know, what grown-ups mean is that they don't like the same things we like, so we have no business liking them.
gosh, i've listened to some of the singers my folks are crazy about, and--
i sure wish their folks would have a little talk with them.
my boss was sorry to have let him go, but mr. warner needed him so bad that he knew he'd be better off singing than working in a store.
all of us back in delville are proud of the success he's made.
and whatever i let you believe was part of my job, to make it worth something to us and to yourself.
you been telling me one lie after another from the beginning.
i would like you and tex to take over and handle things for me.
if it wasn't for you, i wouldn't even be here, and i'd like for us to stick together.
well, all right, friends, shall we go inside and get on with the contracts?
i'm in a position, my boy, to offer you a deal that i think...
glenda, before we start, this is the way i see it.
we don't do guest shots-- we start with our own show.
3 years ago, he busted yoo the kingpin when he was green.
but during the interrogation names of those up there were mentioned.
i know that you had park killed over the shopping mall.
and that you have cho hiding who killed park and dong-jik.
one more weed gone, one more grain of rice for us. '
yoo isn't my lotto, but a weed on the rice field.
prosecutor oh jin-woo arrested mr. yoo kang-jin this afternoon for murder and organizing a crime ring.
the democratic people's party is claming that this is nothing but a political act to influence the election.
we learned that a large amount of money has been wired into an off-shore account.
it's too much for yoo to let slide, even if you're friends.
yang jumped from the 11th floor and died on the spot.
internal affairs arrested prosecutor oh jin-woo and detective jang do-young who interrogated the suspects.
a thorough investigation will follow to get to the bottom of the case.
it's said that there are signs of beatings on their bodies.

perhaps, but there are certain things that are not reflected in your figures.
as i understand it, mr. cole, you are presently involved in litigation, a case which comes up for final settlement tomorrow in santa barbara.
all in all, i think my client's price is most reasonable.
you may call a half a million dollars reasonable, i call it extortion.
i'm afraid it will have to be a little earlier than that, mr. mason.
i'm sure you are aware that court opens at 10 in santa barbara.
your, uh, uncle phillip was kind enough to let me use his bedroom.
that, uh, single bed in there is a little small for me, i, uh...
did anything unusual happen while you were watching doris cole's house?
i don't know if this means anything, but, uh, she had a phone call around 3:00 in the morning.
you think cole will tell you the truth if you find him?
have you ever asked a sleepwalker to tell you the truth?
all i want with you is 15 minutes in open court.
i think when i bring up that telephone call you received at approximately 3:00 this morning, the call from ralph duncan, it might prove rather embarrassing.
i'd hate to tell you what i think of you, mr. mason.
but if ever i'm in trouble, you're going to be my lawyer.
and where was your room in relation to the others, mr. duncan?
next to the other guest room, just across the hall from mr. kendall's and miss hammar's.
he opened the door when he questioned the witness about going to mrs. cole's home in santa barbara.
i have every right to know what mr. harris was doing there.
well, that would have given you an alibi for the time of the murder.
that way, you could pretend to be in santa barbara overhearing the conversation when actually, you'd be in los angeles telephoning.
almost everything i cross-examined him on, he was able to answer as a matter of opinion.
but when i asked him if he'd called doris that night, he couldn't work around that.
the island of santa marta is not very much different... from any of the other smaller islands in the caribbean.
towering mountains, white gold beaches... coconut palms and hot tropical sun.
it has a population of about 100,000... 9/10ths of it colored or of mixed blood.
its main industry is raising sugar, copra, cocoa... and exporting them.
well, that about sums up all the facts you'll find... in the tourist guides, mr. bradshaw.
of course, as a journalist, you'll want to see as much of our island as possible.
if you're in doubt about anything, get in touch with colonel whittingham here.
nothing like being on the right side of the police, eh, colonel?
no, mr. bradshaw, we don't intend to live the way our fathers did.
your father, if i remember correctly... worked on my father's plantation.
as a matter of fact, you were 12 years old at the time.
it was a party given for the children out at st. james lawn.
you remember those fancy, gold-tipped ones... that he has made up for him in cairo.
perhaps that's what i need to be more successful with my own wife- a special brand of tobacco.
- oh, i used to know the word for it- a- a cause.
that should depend a great deal on the person, i should imagine.
i wasn't even aware the island was going to the dogs.
boyeur has got a great deal of influence in your district.
it's death for a young girl like her on this island.
she ought to have the chance of meeting the right people, don't you think?
do you think he'd ever trust me to run the estate single-handed?
your father felt like that about the election because he was concerned for you...
we'll probably find a cake... going quietly stale in the bread bin.
oh, would you mind opening the shutters and letting some air in?
i wonder if you'd be kind enough to give me an opinion.
do you think it would be a good idea for someone like myself to be married here, or in england?
as a matter of fact, i have an odd feeling, you know, that my life wouldn't be-
well, it'd be sort of empty if i went back to england and you weren't there to go with me.
if you're in love with him, i see no reason why you shouldn't accept him.
after all, you won't be any hindrance... as far as his going up to oxford and his career is concerned.
to believe that you belong to one kind of a world, and then, suddenly-
when i asked you if there was any reason why i shouldn't marry euan, you said no.
that was a fine series of articles, the best things i've read about the island.
as for that one today, that was- that was the goods.
it seems a bit sad, though, a chap's life ending like that.
you'll see to it, won't you, that he's put under with full military honors?
yes, i know that sounds- sounds dull to you impatient chaps... but that's police work.
oh, he'll probably play into my hands, whoever the fellow is.
or did they tell you that you shouldn't be seen with me?
that i'm an upstart, a nobody who's gotten control of the union.
it's rather like a love affair... because the detective is the only man in the world who understands him.
and in his heart, the murderer wants to be found out by the detective.
now, this fellow in the carson case, you know... what i'd like to do is to go up to him... take him by the arm and tell him not to worry.
"i'll do my best for you," i want to say to him.
yes, he wanted to find out what sort of a gift your father wanted.
it was intended to be some sort of token of his services to santa marta.
i was as moved by mr. fleury's speech as anyone else.
and i agree when he says that the two worlds cannot exist separate from each other.
the question i would like to ask mr. fleury is this.
does he think that the only issue here is one of color?
is he saying that that is the reason why we should vote for him?
is he saying, "vote for me because i am one of you"?
wouldn't it also be true to say that the only reason that you seek the election... is to revenge yourself upon the whites whom you now think despise you?
that the only reason that you want to be black... is because you're afraid that the white world will not let you be white anymore?
because i've an odd feeling that if we don't get married now, we never shall.
you know, you're the most difficult person to get a wedding ring on.
if it will make you feel any happier, i feel quite guilty.
i thought euan's father wouldn't let us marry, so i settled for what there was.
their own wives look sort of dull when she walks into a room.
but if i were to walk in with you, or a girl like you as my wife-

and in his heart, the murderer wants to be found out by the detective.
now, this fellow in the carson case, you know... what i'd like to do is to go up to him... take him by the arm and tell him not to worry.
"i'll do my best for you," i want to say to him.
yes, he wanted to find out what sort of a gift your father wanted.
it was intended to be some sort of token of his services to santa marta.
i was as moved by mr. fleury's speech as anyone else.
and i agree when he says that the two worlds cannot exist separate from each other.
the question i would like to ask mr. fleury is this.
does he think that the only issue here is one of color?
is he saying that that is the reason why we should vote for him?
is he saying, "vote for me because i am one of you"?
wouldn't it also be true to say that the only reason that you seek the election... is to revenge yourself upon the whites whom you now think despise you?
that the only reason that you want to be black... is because you're afraid that the white world will not let you be white anymore?
because i've an odd feeling that if we don't get married now, we never shall.
you know, you're the most difficult person to get a wedding ring on.
if it will make you feel any happier, i feel quite guilty.
i thought euan's father wouldn't let us marry, so i settled for what there was.
their own wives look sort of dull when she walks into a room.
but if i were to walk in with you, or a girl like you as my wife-
the island of santa marta is not very much different... from any of the other smaller islands in the caribbean.
towering mountains, white gold beaches... coconut palms and hot tropical sun.
it has a population of about 100,000... 9/10ths of it colored or of mixed blood.
its main industry is raising sugar, copra, cocoa... and exporting them.
well, that about sums up all the facts you'll find... in the tourist guides, mr. bradshaw.
of course, as a journalist, you'll want to see as much of our island as possible.
if you're in doubt about anything, get in touch with colonel whittingham here.
nothing like being on the right side of the police, eh, colonel?
no, mr. bradshaw, we don't intend to live the way our fathers did.
your father, if i remember correctly... worked on my father's plantation.
as a matter of fact, you were 12 years old at the time.
it was a party given for the children out at st. james lawn.
you remember those fancy, gold-tipped ones... that he has made up for him in cairo.
perhaps that's what i need to be more successful with my own wife- a special brand of tobacco.
- oh, i used to know the word for it- a- a cause.
that should depend a great deal on the person, i should imagine.
i wasn't even aware the island was going to the dogs.
boyeur has got a great deal of influence in your district.
it's death for a young girl like her on this island.
she ought to have the chance of meeting the right people, don't you think?
do you think he'd ever trust me to run the estate single-handed?
your father felt like that about the election because he was concerned for you...
we'll probably find a cake... going quietly stale in the bread bin.
oh, would you mind opening the shutters and letting some air in?
i wonder if you'd be kind enough to give me an opinion.
do you think it would be a good idea for someone like myself to be married here, or in england?
as a matter of fact, i have an odd feeling, you know, that my life wouldn't be-
well, it'd be sort of empty if i went back to england and you weren't there to go with me.
if you're in love with him, i see no reason why you shouldn't accept him.
after all, you won't be any hindrance... as far as his going up to oxford and his career is concerned.
to believe that you belong to one kind of a world, and then, suddenly-
when i asked you if there was any reason why i shouldn't marry euan, you said no.
that was a fine series of articles, the best things i've read about the island.
as for that one today, that was- that was the goods.
it seems a bit sad, though, a chap's life ending like that.
you'll see to it, won't you, that he's put under with full military honors?
yes, i know that sounds- sounds dull to you impatient chaps... but that's police work.
oh, he'll probably play into my hands, whoever the fellow is.
or did they tell you that you shouldn't be seen with me?
that i'm an upstart, a nobody who's gotten control of the union.
it's rather like a love affair... because the detective is the only man in the world who understands him.
and in his heart, the murderer wants to be found out by the detective.
now, this fellow in the carson case, you know... what i'd like to do is to go up to him... take him by the arm and tell him not to worry.

i thought euan's father wouldn't let us marry, so i settled for what there was.
their own wives look sort of dull when she walks into a room.
but if i were to walk in with you, or a girl like you as my wife-
the loneliness, the desolation of her life were beyond belief for she herself was unaware of just how lonely and desolate it really was.
i imagine that long ago, she had found a way to escape into a world where emotion and feeling never intrude.
she had nothing to anticipate but retiring early, seldom later than 10:00 or 10:30.
did she hope that the young man in the flat above might come home one night and, by mistake, enter the wrong room?
did she ever dream of a life with a husband, a home and children?
how could julia, whose life had been so loveless, possibly have known that when love did come, it might lead to something dangerous and horrifying?
late one summer, as she was accustomed to do every saturday afternoon,
julia took the small son of a neighbor to the old music hall in fulham.
she did not know exactly what it was she felt for max collodi.
certainly if she had known, she could never have confessed it to herself, not that first night anyway.
she had read that the great collodi was going on tour of the provinces.
she had a small capital accumulated through many years of saving.
and she proposed living on this while she followed collodi about the country.
so, for a while at least, possibly forever, who could know, it was goodbye to the alarm clock, the narrow bed, the lonely meals, the faded wallpaper.
finally, he asked her to send him a photograph, and julia, with great trepidation, sent him a blurred snapshot taken long ago when she was 23.
as she grew more persistent in her letters, he grew more benevolent.
"i, too, have a certain amount of the theatrical within my makeup.
"therefore, you must forgive my exacting certain conditions for this, our first meeting."
you would not want me to go into details about the hour and a half julia spent that night before the mirror.
nor will i say anything about the agony she must have undergone before she could make up her mind what to wear.
then she would dress, go to work as a clerk for an old-fashioned solicitor, a man named maufry, who wrote to his clients by hand, making copies by the old moist-paper method.
and each day, like clockwork, she lunched cheaply at a teashop where she read steadily from the volumes of the tauchnitz edition of the best english authors.
fried some ham perhaps, or a chop and boiled vegetables, all on the same single flame, a complicated conjuring trick involving much juggling of pots and pans.
she had nothing to anticipate but retiring early, seldom later than 10:00 or 10:30.
did she hope that the young man in the flat above might come home one night and, by mistake, enter the wrong room?
did she ever dream of a life with a husband, a home and children?
late one summer, as she was accustomed to do every saturday afternoon,
julia took the small son of a neighbor to the old music hall in fulham.
and so all in a summer's day and night a warmth came to julia she had never known before.
she did not know exactly what it was she felt for max collodi.
she had read that the great collodi was going on tour of the provinces.
she had a small capital accumulated through many years of saving.
and she proposed living on this while she followed collodi about the country.

you would not want me to go into details about the hour and a half julia spent that night before the mirror.
nor will i say anything about the agony she must have undergone before she could make up her mind what to wear.
adulation is something one savors all too seldom at close quarters.
oh, forgive the darkness, but i have an aversion to strong light.
i was just thinking how lonely your life must be after all.
we, in the audience, never think of an artist as being lonely.
i mean, it ain't everybody that can work in charlie malik's gang.
i can remember when they didn't let guys like you work around here.
and i got this gimmick figured to pay me 6 billion.
so i gotta find out who's stealing from me, you know what i mean?
now, i'd say he's a hard man to get along with, now, wouldn't you?
i mean, of all the lower forms, he gets down under everybody.
andy got this car pop got him for his 21 st birthday.
i was only 17, i didn't have a license, but andy wanted me to drive the car.
how many times have i tried to teach you to spin the ball?
i'll spin you the next time you keep getting in my way.
i could hear the audience laughing while i was attending the baby.
if you wanna stay for coffee with us, you're welcome to.
man, it's too early in the morning to feel that good.
you know, i mean, it was 3:00 before i got to bed.
you know, a cat could get arrested for feeling so good so early in the morning?
oh, get that johnson stuff off first, because we missed it yesterday.
so, what's the difference if i work for charlie or not?
you're in trouble, but you got a couple of things mixed up.
now, i'd say he's a hard man to... get along with, now, wouldn't you?
i mean, of all the lower forms, he gets down under everybody.
and you know, whenever my old man got sore at me...
andy would come right by, boom, he'd joke him right out of it.
andy got this car pop got him for his 21st birthday.
i was only 17, i didn't have a license,... but andy wanted me to drive the car.
then this so-called expert from the... commission had the nerve to say:
"lf the puerto ricans are so concerned about sub-level housing... and lack of employment, they should... show more constraint in emigrating."
how many times have i tried to teach you to spin the ball?

say, tell me again how great you bowl when you're out with the fellas.

so, what's the difference if i work for charlie or not?
you're in trouble, but you got a couple of things mixed up.
i didn't mean to fall asleep, i was waiting for the morning shift.
well, you're looking at a cat that's exactly seven minutes late for that shift.
you go with the lower forms and you are down in the slime.
well, what happens if you don't want to go with anybody?
"you killed him," and he hit me right across the mouth.
it's funny, because that hurt me more than anything else when he hit me.
come on, i gotta hang around for a little while anyhow.
you ever tried to break up a game of red rover?
then this so-called expert from the commission had the nerve to say:
"if the puerto ricans are so concerned about sub-level housing and lack of employment, they should show more constraint in emigrating."

you're in trouble, but you got a couple of things mixed up.
so at midnight, when i was cleaning up, i got dizzy.
i couldn't bear it anymore so i stole some food to eat.
i heard you left home, so i was worried about you.
i heard that mother of yours went back to live with her child.
stop rubbing your face like an old man about to have a stroke!
don't take us too lightly or you'll pay for it dearly.
it'll be awfully different working at a biscuit factory after learning how to repair automobiles.
just hang in there for a while i'll find something good for you.
that's a result of the blood clotting from the low blood count.
i'll give you medication for it as well as an injection.
he said i was anemic, but he wouldn't tell me what's causing it.
a lot of the people were told the same thing as me.
with the two of us working, there'll be double the income.
i'll get well and find a job so that we can save money.
well, i wish i couid, but i have to let my family know i'm alive.
i mean, they're used to my disappearing, but not for 10 days.
i kept thinking you was just a mite of a thing that i couid take my time about schooling.
then one day, quicker than it takes to say it, you was all growed up.
it's the biggest, piumpest, reddest eariy-ripening tomato in the whole state!
they ought to run at ieast 30,000 pounds to an acre!
we dress up in costumes of the period and people come from all over just to gawk at us and they pay an admission fee, just like in a circus.
and if they're lucky, they might get to attend the rebel ball.
i reckon you don't want anybody around who's kin to somebody in jail.
so i thank you for the night's lodging and i'ii be going.
it's set well on solid ground, with rooms for living and cooking and to put the children in and...
and ground for farming and a garden and space for chickens.
something that'ii be strong enough to withstand anything this climate has to offer.
see, then i can get to the market weeks before any other grower.
if we'd just leave the blinds shut like we do the rest of the year, nobody'd see the dust!
i don't care how you keep house the rest of the year, renie, but pilgrimage week is my responsibility!
do you think i couid learn to talk so's it wouldn't sound different from other folks?
well, that's one of the things that can be learned, tammy.
i don't know what she calls it, but it sure stinks.
sort of hangs on like a spirit haunting some place when the body's gone.
miss renie, she's scared to do the things she always wanted to do.
your pa, he's afeard of coming out of his books, seeing the world.
there's two ways in which man comes nigh onto doing the work of god, the bringing of iife.
one's in the growing of things out of the soil, and the other's in having children.
if she did, she'd want to do what's best for pete, and not what's easiest for her.
if i was as pretty as barbara, know what i'd do?
you feel for people, and that's why they can pull you this way and that.
and when you love 'em and you can't go their way, it hurts.
i've been sleeping on the ground by night and walking all the day.
i come to this great house to sell fresh eggs, a-toting 'em in my bonnet.
of course, these people aren't born yet, but they don't know it.
now i know why my grandfather fell in love with her.
now's your chance to get peter to change his mind about the advertising business, barbara.
i don't think any man could say no to a girl who looks like that, eh, peter?
when they lit out, he followed through the swamp till he came to the edge of the trace.
and there was all the birds a-roosting whilst we was a-sieeping!
mammy and pappy and me and one crawling baby that had to be toted and some odd-sized sisters, two or three.
now, pappy used to hide his bag of gold in the same leather bag that he used for toting his fiddle.
and little harp sneaked in whilst we slept and stole the leather bag!
that's how little harp not only burgied pappy's horse-hair fiddle but stole our treasure and left us all a-weeping with nothing,
listen, tammy, the iast time i invited you out it was, well, for laughs.
but if you'd go out with me again, it wouid be different.
i'm slow at figuring things out, tammy, but this is plain enough even for me to understand!
i was crazy to think i couid make this place pay for itself!
you're just one of a line that goes back beyond the time of knowing!
a line of people that ever wrestled with the earth to get their living from it!
you won't treat it so lightly when you read what it says.
"at brentwood hall, an original touch was added to the usual pilgrimage routine
- well, she's a brave person to come here at all.
she can't be comforted in those poor quarters i have provided..
but i had an accident, a stupid one, but a bad one, so i gave it up.
and now your wife comes with you to make sure of that?
of course, this is wonderful news, but i had no idea they'd been see.
- they have not been seen, but they will be here in a few hours.
i'm sorry, i've had quite a lot of work to do.
i have been concerned for your comfort but your husband reassured me.
i followed them for a mile or so and then they finished in a bare rock face.
it was... it was just long enough to get a sense of what i might be tracking.
for a minute there, i thought we had an avalanche starting.
-and it might have been it, with him yelling like that.
they will be up this spring and will think that the earth devils have been here.
-go ahead and fill it up, or want to scare do you want to scare these poor natives to death?
if this is the way you planned the rest of our trip a caution is out of the call.
-you wouldn't get a meal like this out of an emergency pack.
we've got everything we need to get up above above this creature.
search it out in its own ground and track it down.
now, some millions of years that was a breeding ground of huge ape-like animals.
primitive anthropoids, their possible bones are dug up from time to time.
the radio and television, films, these things have gone in to the very homes of people
and stirred up a healthy curiosity about the earth that they live on.
waiting to see if they give us a weather forecast, doc.
and now short weather forecast in english for himalayan climbing party.
-yeah, well, he had good cause if he saw what did this.
with this and those footprints we should get a pretty good idea the weight of the thing that made it.
-can you rig that steel net up on the roof of that cave?
yeah, i guess some sort of little trap or anything if i go in there?
-oh, sure i'll do it, i told you that's what i wanted.
let's get to work while you still got me in mind.
-they know you've got a gun and what it can do.
-they knew ed had a gun and it didn't stop them.
thestrange,almostunbelievable, story of robert scott carey began on a very ordinary summer day.
i know this story better than anyone because i am robert scott carey.
here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days!
you will remember these sights for the rest of your natural life!
oh, scott, for people like you and me the world can be a wonderful place.
the sky is as blue as it is for the giants.
the report of the death of the so-called shrinking man comes from his brother.
carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat, a former pet in the carey home.
he was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.
thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive lasted until the the very end.
there was no possible way to cross, no matter how inventive, how resourceful i thought myself.
this time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if i must meet defeat.
i realised there was just this one chance, and i had no choice, i had to take it.
if i could leap from the paint stick and reach the other side...
i thought more clearly than i had ever thought before, as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light.
i recognised that part of my illness was rooted in hunger, and i remembered the food on the shelf.
more than a spider, it was every unknown terror in the world, every fear fused into one hideous night-black horror.
still, whatever else had happened, my brain was a man's brain.
but suddenly i knew they were really the two ends of the same concept.
the unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet, like the closing of a gigantic circle.

or if your height was taken in the morning, you'd measure out as taller.

something which, in layman's terms, so affected the insecticide that from a mildly virulent germ spray it created deadly chemical reversal of the growth process.

if i was to fight it, if i was to win the food, then it must be now while strength remained, while i was still of sufficient size to scale the wall.
it was not decision that drove me to the crate, but reflex, as instinctive as the spider's.
too heavy for me to employ as a weapon, they might have another use.

the report of the death of the so-called shrinking man comes from his brother.
carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat, a former pet in the carey home.
carey was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.

a man whose fantastic story was known to virtually every man, woman and child in the civilized world.
i had only to exist, to search out enough food to sustain me.
i was driven by hunger, and also by the horrible thought that without nourishment the shrinking process was quickening.
i thought more clearly than i had ever thought before, as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light.

carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat, a former pet in the carey home.
he was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.
thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive lasted until the the very end.
there was no possible way to cross, no matter how inventive, how resourceful i thought myself.
this time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if i must meet defeat.
i realised there was just this one chance, and i had no choice, i had to take it.
if i could leap from the paint stick and reach the other side...
i thought more clearly than i had ever thought before, as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light.
i recognised that part of my illness was rooted in hunger, and i remembered the food on the shelf.
more than a spider, it was every unknown terror in the world, every fear fused into one hideous night-black horror.
still, whatever else had happened, my brain was a man's brain.
but suddenly i knew they were really the two ends of the same concept.
the unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet, like the closing of a gigantic circle.
here is one of the greatest attractions you'll ever see in your born days!
you will remember these sights for the rest of your natural life!
oh, scott, for people like you and me the world can be a wonderful place.
the sky is as blue as it is for the giants.
carey's death was the result of an attack by a common house cat... a former pet in the carey home.
he was the victim of the most fantastic ailment in the annals of medicine.
thus ends the life of a man whose courage and will to survive... lasted until the very end.
a man whose fantastic story... was known to virtually every man, woman and child in the civilised world.
there was no possible way to cross... no matter how inventive, how resourceful i thought myself.
this time, in sight of my goal, it seemed as if i must meet defeat.
i realised there was just this one chance... and i had no choice, i had to take it.

i'll play simple game of dice, easily i'll win all their wealth and present it to you.
winning and losing in game is on god, what if we lose?
game of dice was played with bheeshma, drona, vidhura's permission and in their presence.
if there had been any foul play, would they keep quiet?
it's the natures wish ln this moonlit night, with cool gentle breeze blowing.
anyway we have come so far, let's also go for a boat ride.
you're kind hearted boon giver, don't know what boon you granted them.
may be he's here to remind you, lest you may forget it.
will you bring bad name to me by going against your uncle?
this is not rebelling against but standing bravely on my ground.
uncle, if kauravas are as brave as you say, tell them to come along with lakshmana kumara, i'll drive out duryodhana, dushyasana, karna and shakuni, and their armies to hastinapuram, i'll take sasi as my wife in open competition.
if you and your friends have the courage, announce an open challenge offight to marry her.
if you were really a brave man, would you stand here and throw challenges?
you're wife of great warrior, mother of a great warrior, i didn't expect you to be so weak.
no use of calling me boy and become elder, show me your power.
though you're teasing me, i feel only pity not angry on you.
i'm lord krishna's sister who rules over heaven and hell... i'm arjuna's wife who is the mightiest warrior...
may this arrow kill the enemy and protect the heir of pandavas...
marriage party has come crying this aloud... lt seems i'm maiden...
and very delicate... lt seems groom will get charmed on seeing me... lt's seems he'll come to tie the knot...
if pandavas attack us after the exile period, to keep you and your brother away from joining their ranks.
like as you sow so you reap, we did get a good stick for it,
i'll play simple game of dice, easily i'll win all their wealth and present it to you.
winning and losing in game is on god, what if we lose?
if there had been any foul play, would they keep quiet?
yes, winning in gamble is as just as winning a war.
you're kind hearted boon giver, don't know what boon you granted them.
may be he's here to remind you, lest you may forget it.
bheeshma, drona and vidhura wanted to happen at the earliest, they fixed this date and time of marriage.
if elders had fixed this, i'm sure it'll be very important.
this is not rebelling against but standing bravely on my ground.
uncle, if kauravas are as brave as you say, tell them to come along with lakshmana kumara, i'll drive out duryodhana, dushyasana, karna and shakuni, and their armies to hastinapuram, i'll take sasi as my wife in open competition.
you're wife of great warrior, mother of a great warrior, i didn't expect you to be so weak.
you know brother's idea, why are you making a scene here?
though you're teasing me, i feel only pity not angry on you.
mother, ask your son to tell his name and save his life.
if we strike off all the names and we four only go there, will it be grand fitting my status?
not just we four, you and your 99 brothers, hundred brothers are enough, it will be very grand, and we would've kept our word.
and the world is in chaos... lt seems mighty great warriors... lt seems richest of the rich...
marriage party has come crying this aloud... lt seems i'm maiden...
if pandavas attack us after the exile period, to keep you and your brother away from joining their ranks.
like as you sow so you reap, we did get a good stick for it,
first thing, you need a ladder to get up into that saddle.
if you manage that, you can whip him and spur him and cuss him out.
say, mister, one of them horses that you just run off belongs to mr. kane.
well, i imagine this will take care of rounding him up.
how does a man get hold of a town's water supply?
billy joe kane ran across an old land sale law that folks had forgotten.
so far you've gotten what you want without violence, without really breaking the law.
but you're being pushed now, and i wonder what that'll do to you.
i'll ride ezekiel back into town, send horses out for you.
and i think the townspeople might like a living monument to the day they got back their water rights.
in fact, i want to split you up in different rooms so that you won't say anything wrong in a freudian slip
i don't want other people to know so much about our family
if i hadn't gone to the new territories this wouldn't have happened so soon
daini, i did such thing in your house it'll damage your reputation
if you haven't made sister she wouldn't have died like this!
you have taken advantage of her until the moment she died and then you give up
there was a guy with a face in one of those planes today.
there was a guy with a face in all the other seven you shot down.
general webster`s had you assigned to the lnter-service aviation board over there.
which means you`ve got practically nothing to do... except, of course, marry the general`s daughter... who is arriving in kobe tomorrow.
and i want you to take a long look at her... because i believe that maybe you`ve forgot what an american girl looks like.
this girl l`m going to show to you... is first of all an american girl... a girl with fine character... a girl with good background... good education, good family, good blood.
l`ve been engaged to this girl for a long time, kelly.
now, she`s a girl of unusual character... and l`d like you to take a look at her, a close look, and tell me what you think.
if the friends i got are that kind, they won`t be friends of mine much longer.
look, major... l`m gonna marry my girl if i have to give up my american citizenship to do it.
i thought you could use a marilyn monroe here and there, you know.
unfortunately, miss monroes were barred... from kabuki in the 1 7th century.
you`ll never tuck me away in the corner of some little town.
go ahead and become the greatest general in air force history, but love me, too.
i don`t expect you to marry me just because it`s expected of you.
listen, sometimes i look at you, and i don`t understand you.
"to live together after god`s ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony?
"wilt thou love him, comfort him, honor and keep him, in sickness and in health...
"let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace."
do you realize you waive all your legal rights in this marriage?
because i don`t want to see lloyd gruver when you ask him to see me.
besides... i do have a date with that young lieutenant and his wife, from fort bragg.
i hate to admit it, but i guess that`s what i said.
i thought it sounded kind of strange... coming from a guy who shot down nine mlgs.
"lf l ever once had that idea, i shouldn`t let anything stop me."
she couldn`t come right out and say, "don`t go to the point."
except, just lately... l`ve had some old feeling come back on me.
i don`t know if i want to go on in the air force and buck for a star... and get married in the webster family and get swallowed up by all that.
you see, these girls that go over there are the matsubayashi girls.
they cross over there on the way to the theater... from those cells over there, those dormitories.
if they`re so strict with you girls over there... how come you go out with mike on dates and fool around?
it is very bad of me... but i cannot help myself.
-l was just going to say, you know... there`s kind of a polite thing you do.
you take the cup and you swish it around in the water... and you pour some sake in it for her.
everything perfect, except for that rat of a colonel l`m assigned to.
you wouldn`t be talking about a fellow named crawford, would you?
l`ve got to help katsumi with the.... lt looks as though everybody`s run off and left us alone here.
it certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.
but i figure, if you`ve come over here tonight... maybe you were interested a little bit in meeting me, too.
now, maybe l`m wrong, but if l`m wrong... then you`ve got to tell me.
there were an awful lot of americans that were killed, too.
i think it would be best if we forgot about that.
but i have been watching you, too... and you have not looked like a savage.
and when katsumi-san told me how gently you kissed her... the day she became a bride... how tenderly you kissed my sweet little friend... i realized the hate was of my own making.
i took the examination at matsubayashi... and now i am first dancer of all.
when i am too old to dance... i will become head teacher.
the danger that lies ahead of us... we must face now.
the danger of discovery, for both of us... danger of weakness... when it is over.
now listen, you two... this party isn`t given especially for you.
you`ve got to circulate around... and do more to cement japanese-american relations.
general, is it all right with you if i post an order... to keep these officers from being seen... with indigenous personnel?
then if they are seen, there`s something we can do about it.
we`re going to cook up some fine st. louis goulash... with a little memphis greens in there.
what are you doing tonight after dinner, when hana-ogi goes back to the theater?
listen, fool, hana-ogi and i are just as careful as we can be.
we never go anyplace where we`re gonna be seen by anybody that matters.
but not brave enough to face the censure... that would result from such a marriage.
as for our famous, honored hana-ogi... there are many japanese... most of them, in fact... who look upon marriage to an occidental with as much distaste... as your people do to one of us.
you know, i been thinking... that all my life... i been so busy... snapping to, and giving orders, and taking orders... and being a general`s son and doing the job... and all that, i just never took time to sit right down... and you know, think about what my reason for living is.
and i been spending some afternoons here just... being peaceful... and easy and thinking.
i admit kelly`s been a pain in my side for quite a while now.
could you tell me why i didn`t have the privilege of extending his tour of duty?
would you tell me, colonel, just exactly what you mean by that last remark?
that`s all l`m prepared to say at the minute... except, you watch your step.
three officers came to me today with identical requests for their men.
lt`s not our policy to interfere with decisions made by immediate commanding officers.
besides, she`s got her heart set on something she planned for us tonight.
wants us both to take the train to osaka and meet the girls at the puppet show.
i mean, it just has to be. l`m sure of it.
as a matter of fact, l`m so sure of it that i went downtown today... and i signed some papers here... that mean that you and i are gonna get married.
i been going round and round with that... every day for a long time.
and i didn`t feel i could speak about it until now.
yes, but i was saved from starting this life... by my best friend, fumiko-san.
her father paid money to free me... and she brought me to matsubayashi.
you were seen in public with her tonight, violating the orders of the area.
this has given me the right to put you under arrest.
most were professional troublemakers sent to your street... to create an incident, specifically with you.
if you`re important to those who hate us... don`t you see how important you are to us?
i hate to tell you something else, because it`s... almost too grotesque... almost unforgivable in your eyes, i imagine.
i got word today... that there`s a law being passed in a month or two... that will make it possible for men like kelly... to take their japanese brides back to the states.
and before i go, there was just... one thing i wanted to know.
you remember one time you said to me... that you could love me... and be a wife, and a mother?
nothing wrong with me a little bottle of beer isn't gonna fix up.
give him a bottle of beer and send him back up.
wouldn't you like to tangle with one of those beautiful japanese dolls?
if it's your prescription, doc, i'll certainly work at it best i can.
and i want you to take a long, long look at her, because i believe that maybe you forgot what an american girl looks like.
and this girl i'm gonna show to you is first of all an american girl, a girl with fine character, a girl with good background, good education, good family, good blood.
i think even your friends are gonna put you down if you marry this girl.
if the friends i got are that kind, they won't be friends of mine much longer.
am i to understand, sir, that you personally refuse to allow me to take this young lady into the club?
i understand how you feel, captain, and i'm very embarrassed, but i'm sorry.
we met mr. nakamura, the head actor, and he invited her to come.
isn't that where there's no dames and the men play all the women's parts?
well, i guess all i'm trying to say is that - and i really mean this, lloyd - if what you want is a family like our fathers have and promotion in the air force and position in society like our mothers have,
and you marry me because i'm pretty and smart and have guts and know the ropes... then i don't think you want to marry me, lloyd.
well, we do our best to prevent as many as possible.
we make the paperwork so difficult that a good many of them lose steam.
i'm pulled off that job and sent here and plonked down at a desk at this inter-service whatever it is.
as far as i can see, there's absolutely nothing to do.
because i don't want to see lloyd gruver when you ask him to see me.
besides, i do have a date with that young lieutenant and his wife from fort bragg.
i hate to admit it, but i guess that's what i said.
i thought it sounded kinda strange coming from a guy who shot down nine migs.
she said "we expected you to go to the point like your father and his father."
and i told her, i said i had an idea about a whole different way of life.
except, just lately, i've had some old feeling come back on me.
i don't know if i wanna go on in the air force and buck for a star, get married into the webster family and get swallowed up by all that.
like i told president truman "you was wrong when you sold the marines short."
see, i hate to be stuffy about this, but you air-force men wouldn't understand.
and i want you to ask her if she won't, you know, kinda introduce me.
she says the rules are very strict but she'll ask her.
certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.
i was just tickled to death when they told me you were coming over.
miss ogi, there were an awful lot of americans that were killed too.
i think it would be best if we forgot about that.
i took the examination at matsubayashi and now i am first dancer of all.
when i'm too old to dance, i will become head teacher.
i have never been in love... but i have dreamed and thought about it... and waited.
the danger that lies ahead of us, we must face now.
"this is a routine reminder of the recent orders issued by camp kobe:"
"any public display of affection for a japanese national by a member of this command is forbidden."
listen, fool, hana-ogi and i are just as careful as we can be.
we never go anyplace where we're gonna be seen by anybody that matters.
if you were gonna be smart, i'll tell you what you'd do.
you'd get your shoes shined and go out tonight, cos tonight is gonna be tanabata.
as for our famous, honored hana-ogi, there are many japanese - most of them, in fact - who look upon marriage to an occidental with as much distaste as your people do to one of us.
i do not feel that way, but then i have had the privilege of traveling in your country and knowing some great people there.
it's hard to believe me being the same lloyd gruver that came over from korea just a little bit ago.
i've been thinking that all my life i've been so busy... snapping to and giving orders and taking orders and being a general's son and doing the job and all that,
i just never took time to sit right down and... you know, think about what my reason for living is.
and i've been spending some afternoons here just... bein' peaceful and easy and thinking.
remember that house by the canal is off limits to all personnel.
would you tell me just exactly what you mean by that last remark?
a boy away from home for the first time, lonesome, often falls in love with the first girl he touches, in most cases with a girl from the streets.
it's up to the service in some measure to be fathers and mothers to these boys and try to head off these marriages.
a boy gets married impulsively, then feels caught, doesn't know how to get out of it.
change of duty gives them both a chance to think it over, to cool off.
i don't mean to imply that's the reason these men are being transferred but... well, the whole thing's a messy business.
general webster, there is no regret in the case of kelly and katsumi.
it's not our policy to interfere with decisions made by commanding officers.
the basic structure of the military service would collapse if we did things like that.
i want you to tell me why matsubayashi means more to you than i do.
lloyd, there is something about myself i have not told you.
she was gonna have it done tomorrow, by that quack doctor down by the docks.
for eight bucks he slashes her eyelids and sews 'em back up again.
don't you think it's time you got back to the mainstream of your life?
back to your roots, what you were born for and raised for.
and before i go, there was just... just one thing i wanted to know.
you remember one time you said to me... that you could love me and be a wife and a mother?
i wanna know - do you love me or don't you?
because if you don't, then i'm gonna have to find a way to live with it.
i don't want you to tell me anything more or anything less than you feel in the very deepest part of you.
because what you answer to me now is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.
nothing wrong with me a little bottle of beer isn't gonna fix up.
give him a bottle of beer and send him back up.
wouldn't you like to tangle with one of those beautiful japanese dolls?
if it's your prescription, doc, i'll certainly work at it best i can.
and i want you to take a long, long look at her, because i believe that maybe you forgot what an american girl looks like.
and this girl i'm gonna show to you is first of all an american girl, a girl with fine character, a girl with good background, good education, good family, good blood.
i think even your friends are gonna put you down if you marry this girl.
if the friends i got are that kind, they won't be friends of mine much longer.
captain bailey here is wanting to take her into the club.
general webster, sir, this young lady is one of japan's most famous dancers.
even so, don't you realise this club is only for american personnel?
now, we've been pretty easy about fraternisation in this area, even though there are strict orders against it.
well, i guess all i'm trying to say is that - and i really mean this, lloyd - if what you want is a family like our fathers have and promotion in the air force and position in society like our mothers have,
and you marry me because i'm pretty and smart and have guts and know the ropes... then i don't think you want to marry me, lloyd.
well, we do our best to prevent as many as possible.

like i told president truman "you was wrong when you sold the marines short."
see, i hate to be stuffy about this, but you air-force men wouldn't understand.
i am trying in the worst way to meet this hana-ogi.
and i want you to ask her if she won't, you know, kinda introduce me.
it looks as though everybody's ran off and left us alone here.
certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.
but i figured, as you came over here tonight, maybe you were interested a little bit in meeting me too.
maybe i'm wrong, but if i'm wrong, then you got to tell me where we go from here.
i am dedicated to matsubayashi, as you are dedicated to american military life.
i have never been in love... but i have dreamed and thought about it... and waited.
"this is a routine reminder of the recent orders issued by camp kobe:"
"any public display of affection for a japanese national by a member of this command is forbidden."
listen, fool, hana-ogi and i are just as careful as we can be.

besides, she's got her heart set on something she planned for us tonight.
wants us to take the train over to osaka and meet the girls at the puppet show.
i know it's hard, honey, but it's not gonna last long.
the army's gotta change that law next year, or the next one.
she was gonna have it done tomorrow, by that quack doctor down by the docks.
for eight bucks he slashes her eyelids and sews 'em back up again.
don't you think it's time you got back to the mainstream of your life?
back to your roots, what you were born for and raised for.
i'm goin' back to america on friday, and i probably won't get back in japan again.
and before i go, there was just... just one thing i wanted to know.
the first obligation we have is to love each other, to become man and wife and raise some clean, sweet children, and give them the very best that we know how.
and if we don't meet that obligation, we ain't gonna be any good to anybody.
nothing wrong with me a little bottle of beer isn't gonna fix up.
give him a bottle of beer and send him back up.
wouldn't you like to tangle with one of those beautiful japanese dolls?
if it's your prescription, doc, i'll certainly work at it best i can.

change of duty gives them both a chance to think it over, to cool off.
i don't mean to imply that's the reason these men are being transferred but... well, the whole thing's a messy business.
general webster, there is no regret in the case of kelly and katsumi.
it's not our policy to interfere with decisions made by commanding officers.
the basic structure of the military service would collapse if we did things like that.
i want you to tell me why matsubayashi means more to you than i do.
lloyd, there is something about myself i have not told you.
she was gonna have it done tomorrow, by that quack doctor down by the docks.
for eight bucks he slashes her eyelids and sews 'em back up again.
don't you think it's time you got back to the mainstream of your life?
back to your roots, what you were born for and raised for.
and before i go, there was just... just one thing i wanted to know.
you remember one time you said to me... that you could love me and be a wife and a mother?
i wanna know - do you love me or don't you?
because if you don't, then i'm gonna have to find a way to live with it.
i don't want you to tell me anything more or anything less than you feel in the very deepest part of you.
because what you answer to me now is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.
nothing wrong with me a little bottle of beer isn't gonna fix up.
give him a bottle of beer and send him back up.
wouldn't you like to tangle with one of those beautiful japanese dolls?
if it's your prescription, doc, i'll certainly work at it best i can.
and i want you to take a long, long look at her, because i believe that maybe you forgot what an american girl looks like.
and this girl i'm gonna show to you is first of all an american girl, a girl with fine character, a girl with good background, good education, good family, good blood.
i think even your friends are gonna put you down if you marry this girl.
if the friends i got are that kind, they won't be friends of mine much longer.
captain bailey here is wanting to take her into the club.
general webster, sir, this young lady is one of japan's most famous dancers.
even so, don't you realise this club is only for american personnel?
now, we've been pretty easy about fraternisation in this area, even though there are strict orders against it.
well, i guess all i'm trying to say is that - and i really mean this, lloyd - if what you want is a family like our fathers have and promotion in the air force and position in society like our mothers have,
and you marry me because i'm pretty and smart and have guts and know the ropes... then i don't think you want to marry me, lloyd.
well, we do our best to prevent as many as possible.
we make the paperwork so difficult that a good many of them lose steam.
i'm pulled off that job and sent here and plonked down at a desk at this inter-service whatever it is.
as far as i can see, there's absolutely nothing to do.
because i don't want to see lloyd gruver when you ask him to see me.
besides, i do have a date with that young lieutenant and his wife from fort bragg.
i hate to admit it, but i guess that's what i said.
i thought it sounded kinda strange coming from a guy who shot down nine migs.
she said "we expected you to go to the point like your father and his father."
and i told her, i said i had an idea about a whole different way of life.
except, just lately, i've had some old feeling come back on me.
i don't know if i wanna go on in the air force and buck for a star, get married into the webster family and get swallowed up by all that.
like i told president truman "you was wrong when you sold the marines short."
see, i hate to be stuffy about this, but you air-force men wouldn't understand.
i just got to take a look at my grass now.
are we gonna be, all four of us gonna be together all evening long?
certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.
i was just tickled to death when they told me you were coming over.
miss ogi, there were an awful lot of americans that were killed too.
i think it would be best if we forgot about that.
i took the examination at matsubayashi and now i am first dancer of all.
when i'm too old to dance, i will become head teacher.
i have never been in love... but i have dreamed and thought about it... and waited.
the danger that lies ahead of us, we must face now.
we gonna cook up some fine st louis goulash with a little memphis greens.
what are you doing tonight after dinner when hana-ogi goes back to the theatre?
"any public display of affection for a japanese national by a member of this command is forbidden."
"officers should not even appear on public streets accompanied by indigenous female personnel."
i think major gruver is brave, but not brave enough to face the censure that would result from such a marriage.
as for our famous, honoured hana-ogi, there are many japanese - most of them, in fact - who look upon marriage to an occidental with as much distaste as your people do to one of us.
i do not feel that way, but then i have had the privilege of travelling in your country and knowing some great people there.
and i am especially conscious at this moment that beauty is not confined to any one race.
i've been thinking that all my life i've been so busy... snapping to and giving orders and taking orders and being a general's son and doing the job and all that,
i just never took time to sit right down and... you know, think about what my reason for living is.
remember that house by the canal is off limits to all personnel.
would you tell me just exactly what you mean by that last remark?
a boy away from home for the first time, lonesome, often falls in love with the first girl he touches, in most cases with a girl from the streets.
it's up to the service in some measure to be fathers and mothers to these boys and try to head off these marriages.
a boy gets married impulsively, then feels caught, doesn't know how to get out of it.
change of duty gives them both a chance to think it over, to cool off.
i don't mean to imply that's the reason these men are being transferred but... well, the whole thing's a messy business.
general webster, there is no regret in the case of kelly and katsumi.
it's not our policy to interfere with decisions made by commanding officers.
the basic structure of the military service would collapse if we did things like that.
i want you to tell me why matsubayashi means more to you than i do.
lloyd, there is something about myself i have not told you.
this has given me the right to put you under arrest.
and for your own sake, i think i better do it.
they were troublemakers sent to your street to create an incident specifically with you.
if you're important to those who hate us, don't you see how important you are to us?
i hate to tell you something else, because it's almost too grotesque... almost unforgivable in your eyes, i imagine.
i got word today that there's a law being passed in a month or two that will make it possible for men like kelly to take their japanese brides back to the states.
back to your roots, what you were born for and raised for.
you'll feel better about everything when you get back home, back to your work.
and before i go, there was just... just one thing i wanted to know.
you remember one time you said to me... that you could love me and be a wife and a mother?
i wanna know - do you love me or don't you?
because if you don't, then i'm gonna have to find a way to live with it.
i don't want you to tell me anything more or anything less than you feel in the very deepest part of you.
because what you answer to me now is gonna affect us for the rest of our lives.
he's got permission to go back and marry that japanese girl.
i told him - he can't take her back to the states.
there was a guy with a face in one of those planes today.
there was a guy with a face in all the other seven you shot down.
general webster's had you assigned to the inter-service aviation board, which means you got practically nothing to do.
except, of course, marry the general's daughter who arrives in kobe tomorrow.
if the friends i got are that kind, they won't be friends of mine much longer.
major, i'm gonna marry my girl if i have to give up my american citizenship to do it.
am i to understand, sir, that you personally refuse to allow me to take this young lady into the club?
i understand how you feel, captain, and i'm very embarrassed, but i'm sorry.
we met mr nakamura, the head actor, and he invited her to come.
isn't that where there's no dames and the men play all the women's parts?
i should be happy to help you know my country better, if at any time i can.
you did not enjoy the evening so much, i fear, major gruver.
i thought maybe you could use a marilyn monroe here and there, you know, to...
unfortunately, miss monroes were barred from kabuki in the 1 7th century.
katsumi, wilt though have this man to thy wedded husband, to live together after god's ordinance in the holy state of matrimony, love him, comfort him, honour and keep him, in sickness and in health,
and forsaking all others keep thee only unto him, so long as you both shall live?
almost any old place that's got an army post on it.
i was all set to take the exams for west point and there was a teacher there who made me take a part in the school play.
she said something like... if i ever once had that idea, i shouldn't let anything stop me.
and she couldn't come right out and say "don't go to the point", but i knew what she meant.
he just looked at me and said "if you don't wanna go to the point, don't go."
"the unhappiest men i know are those who... were forced into something they got no inaptitude for."
i never once had any regrets about going to the point.
except, just lately, i've had some old feeling come back on me.
see, i hate to be stuffy about this, but you air-force men wouldn't understand.
the marines have got "i'amour," and these girls, they got fame, wealth, bright lights.
i just got to take a look at my grass now.
are we gonna be, all four of us gonna be together all evening long?
certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.

and i want you to ask her if she won't, you know, kinda introduce me.
it looks as though everybody's ran off and left us alone here.
certainly was nice of you to come over here this evening, miss ogi.
but i figured, as you came over here tonight, maybe you were interested a little bit in meeting me too.
maybe i'm wrong, but if i'm wrong, then you got to tell me where we go from here.
i took the examination at matsubayashi and now i am first dancer of all.

though i admit kelly's been a pain in my side for quite a while now.
could you tell me why he didn't have the privilege of extending his tour of duty?
change of duty gives them both a chance to think it over, to cool off.
i don't mean to imply that's the reason these men are being transferred but... well, the whole thing's a messy business.
lloyd, three officers came to me today with identical requests for their men.
it's not our policy to interfere with decisions made by commanding officers.
besides, she's got her heart set on something she planned for us tonight.
wants us to take the train over to osaka and meet the girls at the puppet show.
i know it's hard, honey, but it's not gonna last long.
the army's gotta change that law next year, or the next one.
this has given me the right to put you under arrest.
and for your own sake, i think i better do it.
they were troublemakers sent to your street to create an incident specifically with you.

back to your roots, what you were born for and raised for.
you'll feel better about everything when you get back home, back to your work.
i'm goin' back to america on friday, and i probably won't get back in japan again.
and before i go, there was just... just one thing i wanted to know.
the first obligation we have is to love each other, to become man and wife and raise some clean, sweet children, and give them the very best that we know how.
and if we don't meet that obligation, we ain't gonna be any good to anybody.
i'll see you get your money the moment i step in the courtroom.
and what do you think the chances are of my employer here being lynched?
he didn't have a gun and he didn't have a trial with a smart lawyer to trick him to freedom or a prison sentence.
the man that killed your brother will have a trial, miss bender.
now that you've got the honey in the hive, the bees will be swarming around soon enough.
sheriff i'll bed down in one of your office cots until the trial.
miss bender, i wonder if you'd hold some money for me.
you're not to give it to me until holgate steps into the courtroom.
as i'm in charge of "operation harvest" among the nsdap's youth movement in hamburg and schleswig-holstein,
it's my duty to urge you... to urge you: keep it up!
let's cut to the heart and get to your comrades' offering.
a pound of hard wheat, and a pound of rye wheat.
"our grief shall be pride, emmi." you gotta be out of your mind, willi.
how are we supposed to go on like this without supplies, without income?
north to south and east to west soldiers fight for the reich's survival and...
and you're right in the middle of it, including 32 slices of bacon!
american bombers have crossed the reich's borders and attacked west and south germany.
in the residential districts of munich, mannheim and karlsruhe, we suffered important damages.
which means this bottle is of no use, so to speak.
i suggest to raise our glasses to our beloved führer and to his inevitable final victory.
look, mr lehmann is too weak a man and the lady has tuberculosis.
well, i was paid to make the delivery and i'm a man of my word.
but as soon as you check his family history, you stumble upon an uncle who ended up in an asylum or a grandfather who died of alcohol poisoning.
in any case, we're looking for a village idiot, someone who's mentally and physically impaired.
and that's only possible through a stringent if somewhat cruel selection.
we should abide by the laws of nature and dispose of the weaker, impaired species.
that's quite an act you showed me there, popping the cork without a sweat.
it seems like you impressed a few people in hamburg as well.
that monster has been on the loose ever since we seized power.
imagine the mess if people lost their confidence in the police.
you will not be prosecuted before a secret military court as i first had in mind.
however, i have to forgo my plans as our country's military situation is at stake here.
there's been a lot of accidents on this highway lately and this could cause another one.
you know, sometimes you can spring these open on these old cars.
why is it people always think they're being stopped for speeding?
you know, the way you shot out of that gas station anybody would've thought you were on fire.

i am afraid it is time for our play, and i wouldn't want everyone to watch this standing on his head.
well, we seem to have lost the dog, but it's nice to feel the blood rushing to my feet again.
you see, i didn't know it was her dog because she never brought it before.
well, maybe i should've known because it was outside her cabin, but...

i'll take you away from here as soon as i can.
let me get on with my work instead of searching waste paper.
there's a gathering at our old college tonight; you must come.
now i'll have to chase him for a mile. i'll leave
you can hardly keep yourself, how can you feed me, too?
my hunger will be satisfied by seeing you in my house.
"lf this is called living, then i'll live my life somehow"
"l shall not sigh, i'll seal my lips, i'll dry my tears"
on this day last year a terrible event took the great poem from us.
if i could have saved vijay, i would have given my fortune and my life.
i'll take you away from here as soon as i can.
let me get on with my work instead of searching waste papers.
you can hardly keep yourself, how can you feed me, too?
my hunger will be satisfied by seeing you in my house.
who are the fortunate ones who gain the love they seek?
if this is called living then i'll live my life somehow.
i shall not sigh, i shall seal my lips, i shall dry my tears.
why should i fear grief, when i have encountered it so often?

if vijay were alive he would see... the world which starved him is ready to shower wealth on him.
the world in which he died unknown, would treat him as a king.
- and i wondered which of your friends in the headquarters staffel of the second gruppe of
number three fighter geschwader will look after simba, your lion cub, now that your deathless exploits with that unit have come to an end.
you've come a long way since you joined the luftwaffe in 1936, haven't you?
from obscure private, to oberleutnant franz von werra, cover boy of the magazines.
with competition for promotion so keen in the luftwaffe, your flair for publicity has served you well.
while other pilots keep dogs, falcons, pigs as pets, you have a pet lion cub.
a german radio magazine, hor mit mir, dated 24th of august, 1940.
with german bombers overhead, it's a pity you are so concerned with the lion cub of a captured pilot.
"i hit on the idea of pretending to be part of the english squadron."
as i understand it, you claim that while you were over a british airfield, you shot down three hurricanes, possibly four, as they were going in to land, and destroyed five more on the ground.
now, you could persuade the german public to swallow such rubbish, but you never dreamed of being faced with it by the british, did you?
but even your own people, do they really believe you could tag along behind six hurricanes and not be noticed?
have they never heard of the tail-end charlie, whose job it is to protect the rear?
do they think we can't tell a hurricane from a messerschmitt?
some damage was done in a town in the south west of england, and a balloon barrage at dover was twice attacked.
a german air force officer escaped from a military camp in the north west of england at 3.:15 this afternoon.
this man has fair hair, blue eyes, is clean-shaven and the forefinger of the right hand is stiff and straight.
any information about this prisoner should be given immediately to the authorities.
he was last reported four miles from the coast, but he may have doubled back, of course.
oh, yes, we're combing the entire area between coniston and duddon river tomorrow.
- oh, it will be in the fields, west of langley mill.
there was one crashed there a month or two back, remember?
perhaps they have news of the plane that comes for me from aberdeen.
sorry, sir, my orders are to take you straight to hq.
they were angry with the station man because he wasted their time.
but then they wished good luck to me and everybody friends.
yes, of course, we know, but the duty officer said i must come to see you.
you're one of the ferry pilots from white waltham, are you?
oh, i wouldn't want to deprive him of a nice healthy sea voyage.
in fact, i'd recommend a special escort for von werra to make quite certain he gets there.

so, it is his word, the word of a german officer and fellow prisoner, against yours, an enemy interrogator.
a german air force officer escaped from a military camp in the north west of england at 3.:15 this afternoon.
he was dressed in a blue shirt, black leather jacket and trousers, and black boots or shoes.

the army from the north, and the police from the south and east.
oh, it won't be long, i just want to know the controls.
well, you can't do anything until you've signed the visitors book.
the parachute and the papers shall come with the plane due to land any moment now.
i think i'll have the instructions on the controls, to save some time, all right?
you're going to be on this train for at least four days.
if any of you got ideas about jumping out, forget them.

- that you forced yourself into miss miller's room last night.

don't fool around with one during the day and the other at night.

if i didn't know any better, i'd take the bird, which i know isn't there, ...

you demonstrated that devotional love is above all scriptures, all learning and all wisdom.

the course that leads all creatures to salvation is also for you.
chant the holy name, only the holy name of the lord.
for the sake of the kingdom, i have to do everything on behalf of the king.

one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige, and ready to offer all respects to others.
in such a state of mind one can constantly chant the holy name.

all the mares of my family have been in the military, or lawmakers, or leaders in other fields.
if pride of family be a sin, then i plead guilty, sir.
well, i suppose every boom town had its gloria morgan as a sort of symbol of its success.
no, as i understand it, she was a great deal more than that.
gloria morgan was the high priestess of a cult made drunk by wine and sudden wealth.
she was beautiful and mysterious, exotic, exciting, sort of a living flame.
i'm not sure she was a lady, judging by the things i hear about her.
well, mister, nobody ain't ever going to hear of you, if you don't clear out.
gloria morgan was a young girl abandoned in a mining camp by a man who brought her there under false pretenses of marriage.
she had no friends, no one to turn to, so she did the best she could.
she borrowed it from the privately printed family history of a friend.
and under that name, she met, fell in love with, and married a man.
and then, recently, someone sent her husband a poison pen letter, exposing her past in the worst possible light.
out of hurt and arrogant pride, he decided to punish her, by getting a third party to confront her with proof of her identity in his presence.
i promise i'll never try to kill you again, as long as i live.
and don't you ever try to lie to me again, either.
# in a little cottage cozy # # the world seems rosy at sundown #
# where a loving smile will greet me # # and always meet me at sundown. #
# now i found two eyes # # just a little bit bluer #
# and i found a heart # # just a little bit truer, #
# now i found two eyes # # just a little bit bluer #
# and i found a heart # # just a little bit truer, #
because i could get the perfect picture of a guy with his two feet in his mouth.
i was just so bad tonight that next week i open at the valencia.
well, it means i got a right to work anywhere i want to.
what you got a right is to be buried anywhere you want to.
mr. mack, you read too many newspapers, you believe too much in what you read.
look, the joint is doing good and they didn't want me to leave.
now, look, i know you're trying to be a pal, but if you don't go in there with me, i'll go it alone.
if you open at the valencia, we split up for good.
when the machine-gun fire starts, i'll meet you under the piano.
# if i could be with you # # i'd love you strong #
# if i could be with you # # one hour tonight #
# if i were free to do # # the things i might #
# until i told you, honey # # why i love you so #
# if i could be with you # # one hour tonight #
# if i were free to do # # the things i might #
# i'm tellin' you true # # i'd be anything but blue #
he told me i was strictly from hunger tonight and he's glad i left the other joint.
and by the way... he didn't think you were so hot either.
there you are, mr. mack, if you have to worry about something, worry about what songs we record for mr. marshall.
yeah, you know, record... those little black things that go round and round...
the doctor wants him to take it real easy and don't stare at his scars.
for he's a jolly good fellow, for he's a jolly good...
young man, i do believe there's something wrong with your hearing.
i told you not to play and i mean don't play.
ladies and gentlemen, i'd be happy to finish the song, but... it might be one of your favorites and i'd like to leave it that way.
but nothing's been lost because... after all, tonight you've heard al jolson, george jessel,
but that's all behind me now, it's past, it's all in the past...
i'm doing pretty good these days, with mr. zig's playhouse... and this week we're doing shakespeare.
and the costumes, you should see the costumes in the show.
the leading lady comes out on the stage with a gown and...
i came out here in kind of in a hurry and i didn't have time to dress properly so, i'd like to thank miss tucker for lending me a pair of her slacks.
most of all, i want to thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being so kind and so understanding.
well, in some of the movie houses there, they... the screen is in the middle of the theater to divide the audience.
the untouchables sit on one side and on the other sit the...
i'll meet you in the little bar across the street from the theater.
when i meet you there, we'll get out like the place is contaminated.
walking up broadway the other day he introduced me to one of the skyscrapers he built.
then, coming out of lindy's last week, there was another one of his buildings looking down on us.
well, since you won't come to meet him, he's going to come and see you.
in fact, we're both going to come down to the theater tonight.
look, we've been seeing each other almost every day for a month now.
we... we meet under a clock in a restaurant... in a bar.
what kind of a life do you think it would be?
it could be any kind of a life you want to make it, joe.
i know that you're ladies and gentlemen because this club only caters to a special clientele.
you can't get in with money... and i might add that you can't out without money either.
i seem to have a knack of taking a joke that can't possibly get a laugh and proving it.
please, i know you're not laughing, but let us not make it a crusade.
there's a guy can brighten up a room by just leaving it.
you know, this is my first appearance in a nightclub in a long time.
# you know a guy making bets # # without a dime in his kick # # is liable to wind up very sick. #
# you can't collect # # the day your horse comes in # # and sing a ballad when it doesn't win #
he's never talked to me in my life the way he did tonight.
he said my behavior is no better than that of a camp follower.
there was one race i bet on could be a photo finish.
by the time my horse came in it was too dark to take the pictures.
but, uh, i was going in that direction anyway, it wouldn't have taken too long.
as a matter of fact, i woke up this morning at the crack of ice and i've been half stiff all day.
austin stuck his head in to say good night over an hour ago.
he doesn't have to close up the bar every night like i do.
i know no promises have been made aloud but... promises have been made.
i just couldn't figure a way to tell you and get a laugh at the same time
as you know, tonight we wind up our engagement here in miami, and the manager's been very kind.
he's invited us back next season with a much better deal.
i'd like to thank my accompanist, mr. austin mack, at the piano.
mr. mack has been dead for a week now, but i haven't had the heart to tell him yet.
i'd like you to share with me a piece of wonderful news.
in a couple of weeks, the entire cast... the girls, austin mack and myself, we'll all open in new york city at the world famous copacabana.
i think if you look at these x-rays, joe, it'll be a little easier for me to explain.
doc, don't ask me to look at the x-rays and i won't ask you to tell any jokes.
i look around and i see a lot more old drunks than i see old doctors, you know.
joe, at the rate you're going, you'll never be an old drunk.
getting to bed at 6 o'clock in the morning and getting up at 2:30 in the afternoon and... hanging around a lot of smoke-filled joints... with a bunch of drunks like me.
listen to the same material, the same jokes, the same songs year in and year out, it's no good.
joe and i are scared stiff of flying but joe had a long talk with this (censored) officer.
major, i refuse to fly in anything smaller than a four-motor plane.
i missed you so much i couldn't sleep just thinking about you.
i won't be here long, unless you get me a sleeping pill.
don't worry about me, i only drink to steady my nerves.
yes, ladies and gentlemen, i only drink to steady... and i wanna tell you something.
mr. mack here, he took up drinking when he was overseas.
you know, there were some days he was so drunk i could hardly see him.
you might be interested to know that my doctor told me that i would have to cut down on my drinking, smoking, and running around with a lot of girls.
well, there was only one thing i could do about that.
do you mind if i sit down doing this, because uh...
i don't like the room spinning around while i'm standing up.
believe me, i'm so patriotic i get up every day with red, white and blue eyes.
if you think they look bad from where you are you should be on this side of them.
my thought for tonight, ladies and gentlemen, marriage is a wonderful thing.
after all, without marriage, husbands and wives would have to fight with strangers.
i'd like that, joe, but i don't think i can get away.
oh, well, we'll bump into each other from time to time.
yeah, i did, honey, but when you were a little late
i figured i'd have the boys come up for a few laughs.
will you please tell me how to relax to standing room only.
if i wanted to take a nap, i'd have to do it standing up!
mr. mack, ladies and gentlemen, mr. austin mack, my accompanist, uh... thank you...
recently mr. mack has had many offers to leave me, and i know... because i made most of them.
that's a good joke, where did you get that, in a cut-rate store.
ladies and gentlemen, don't let him bother you, don't pay too much attention, because in a little while he'll be leaving soon as they clean up his cage.
from the clinical point of view, he could speak... he could hear, he could see.
all i know is that organically there's nothing wrong with him.
that he's physically normal... and yet there is something wrong with him.
he's probably in a plenary trance under a mental block... the origin of which is beyond my knowledge.
and then there was the case of the sea monster... off the coast of nantucket.
the local merchants did a thriving tourist trade until i debunked that fraud.
my dear carlton... you've spread your name all over the world by means of your hotels.
now what more perfect way to lure the vacationing tourist... to your new hotel than to cover the island with a spell of voodoo?
if i said yes, you'd put me in your television show... and have me masked so the people couldn't identify me as a sorceress.
then you'd try to debunk everything i'd say... to prove that voodooism has no religious significance... but is only practiced to superimpose fear on superstitious people.
we've traveled a long way to find the answers to certain questions.
you help us find those answers... and you'll profit very handsomely, i promise you.
the natives here don't have much sense of humor... when it comes to anybody breaking their taboos.
why, mr. gunn, i had visions of you being a realist.
they never talk about their magic for effect, they live it.
they use it to fight off starvation, disease... anything they think evil.
mr. skyler, have you any idea what will happen to your island... if carlton builds his hotel out there?
of course, you'll play a big part in the book that i'm going to write on how i...
you stay with him, you cut yourself in for a piece.
who knows, you may even own yourself a boat to go with that cap.
we'll split up in the morning and see if we can find their trail.
right now, we'll go back to the boat and pack in more supplies.
clare would be alive now if she hadn't wandered away by herself.
i tell you we have no choice but to go on.
with all that happened today and everything, i never thanked you.
i have a long way to go to even things up.
i'll not be robbed out of my part of this island.
not by a pack of inferior creatures who don't deserve to live.
if we start to fix your ship tonight that means we have to turn on the lights.
and if we turn on the lights that means we have visitors.
when i was very young, some older kid sold me a key to the pitcher's box.
my old man walloped the daylights out of me for being so stupid.
i've often thought about getting out and maybe someday i will.
and that fat job you offered well, that's a pretty tempting offer, i'll have to admit that.
dad, you'd look handsome and we'd belong to the country club.
and i could go out dancing with all your vice presidents.
so that makes just three months before we receive the first b-52.
after that we've got nine months to convert entirely from b-47's to b-52's and be combat-ready.
a $9 million airplane, we're gonna prove it's worth every dollar.
if we can prove that, then we can keep it, keep the peace.
look, chuck, this twx just came in to send my key-master sergeants to boeing for b-52 schooling.
then to edwards air force base for the phase 6 test program.
it can fly over 600 miles an hour, over eight miles high and over 6000 miles distance without refueling.
on a single mission one of these airplanes, just one, can carry greater destructive force than that of all the bombs dropped by the allied air forces during the whole of world war ll.
we got there just in time to see it back out of a hangar.
and i took one good look at it, and i've never seen an airplane like it.
castle tower, nelson 1 -5 on local test returning to base.
present position, 50 miles south of the station at 1 0,000 feet.
with packs 1 and 2 out we don't have hydraulic power to the air-reflli system.
jumbo 4, nelson 1 -5 we just found out we're unable to receive fuel.
at least, up to a certain point, it's your own affair.
when it gets in the way of the wing, it's our affair.
[phone rings] ...that will keep you and your children alive, if you ever have any.
dad, you've been against him because he's important and you're not.
now, for centuries, it's been the job of a successful general to win wars.
but in this nuclear-air age it's the job of a successful general to prevent wars.
the secret panel you've installed and have been testing locally is one such vital improvement.
now is the time to test that improvement, to test that panel.
colonel herlihy, you and your crew have been selected to make that test.
your line chief has been chosen to accompany the mission and take the panel readings.
the mission commander has ordered all search aircraft to return to castle.
we better take off before the weather closes in here completely.
and it we tum on the rights that means we have visitors.
they'll pour enough lead into us to sink this place 4 feet.
some older kid sold me a key to the pitcher's box.
my old man walloped the dayrights out of me for being so stupid.
gonna be 2 miles long and half again as wide as it is now.
sixteen inches of new concrete laid on top of the old 11 inches.
oh, see the look on lois's face when i told her?
i haven't seen her look this happy in a long time.
this twx just came in... to send my key-master sergeants to boeing for b-52 schooling.
then to edwards air force base for the phase 6 test program.

these fell out of your pocket, or maybe they belong to some passing indian.
now if you'd had them on, you wouldn't have missed your footing, and you'd be dry.
about two years ago, and then when my mother died, he sent me all the money to pay the debts.
then he wrote and asked me to come out and marry him.
and you are here now, so i'll be on my way.
oh, well, uh... couldn't you stay with us for just a day or two?
neri, a youth of noble stock, was deeply in love with silvestra and she with him.
the young lover was mortally wounded, came in this room and went to silvestra.
the legend says whoever sits in it will marry within a year.
silvestra was sitting there when nerio entered and cast himself at her feet.
they've been following me for an hour and i can't get rid of them!
they must be stupid because they should know that i'm not happy!
- i don't know if you noticed but the french prefer rome, the americans, venice and the english, florence.
have you been to florence or is this your first time?
oh, they have things that cartier has never even dreamed of!
in fact, i intended to buy many things, but i had an automobile accident.
i was a fake foreigner or else i wouldn't get a ride.
they ask, "are you italian?" so the italian works while the foreigner enjoys..
and you, as art history teacher, have the clear task of guiding us.
excuse me, miss, even this concerns you, i've nothing against you.
and the kids don't care what you teach, because they sense that you don't care.
and the afternoon coffee with the usual faces, with the usual talk about salaries, raises, staff, bonuses!
i have a few ideas in my head which i'm sure i can write down.
and if i'm wrong.. well, i can always find a temporary job.
you were headed for the virgin soils and hopefully found your happyness.
your comrades often come to us and ask of you, and tell us they are jealous of all the people that left for the virgin soils.
the results of the fantastic job our youths have done on the virgin soils!
obviously you want to know which place you took in sowing the virgin soils.
# in my golden boat, # # my beloved dream, #
# in my golden boat, # # my beloved sleeps. #
# i roam the looming abyss # # among the rusting anchors. #
# in the murky crossroads # # was sadly drowned # # the burning... # #of love!
i don't know what you did, but i won't be mixed up in it.
if louise learns about eva, there'll be hell to pay at home.
# come, i will be there, # # away from the noise, away from the din. #
# a roof of straw, where the phantom # # of our love reaches out its arms. #
# come, i will be there, # # away from the noise, away from the din. #

this mr. raphaël hasn't seen you, but he saw me coming down.
he thinks i killed her, and he wants a million to keep quiet.
after the sudden death of my dear bob, the police may be interested in you.
and even more on certain crates of art that you receive, mr. o'brien.
when i stop worrying about a compound fracture and i start acting like a policeman,
lock, i don't mind telling you, i get pretty wound up.
"you have brought back to me the memories of my own great love.
"and to see the look in your eyes when you look at each other,
now, the soldier's manner, you wouldn't say it was disrespectful, would you?
i mean, you weren't offended by what he said, were you?
to the best of my knowledge, sir, it was a simple statement of fact.
she just seemed beautiful at the time, and i said so.
before the argument was over, did you see what was left of my place?
and not only damage to my property, to my own property, to my home.
but unfortunately in our army, nurses are considered to be officers.
and a plain soldier and a nurse cannot love each other,
by allowing them to meet here, to have dinner, just spend the evening together, madame, you would be striking a blow for love.
if not for i'amour, madame, then strike a blow for liberté, égalité and fraternité in the medical department of the united states army.
i think it can be done, madam, if you get the right man for the job.
yes, but no doubt general eisenhower has other things on his mind.
to me, just look like a private in the us army.
madam, in a case like this, a private can do more for you than eisenhower, especially if his name happens to be hogan.
monsieur, the wine we have left is really not fit to drink.
all the best has been requisitioned, first by the german army, then by your army.
i think she knows i'm interested and is interested in my interest.
well, i'd hate like the devil never to get the chance just once to talk to her as if i were a human being.
well, yes, as a matter of fact, i need help, lieutenant.
isn't it customary to go to the chaplain when one needs help?
saturday night, lieutenant, the enlisted men are having a big time.
now, with this outfit due to break up very soon, this is the last chance
i'm gonna have to see guys i've been soldiering with for three years.
and all i need is just a few more days, lieutenant.
the way you've been abusing yourself, i know you need a lot of milk and cream.
i'll put this in the file, and we'll check on it every week.
i was thinking that we could get the whole officers club fixed up like the crow's nest.
well, i'll get the boys in utilities on it right away.
she's merely asking to have a few holes repaired in her roof.
but madame, the paratroopers did not climb up there and fight.
well, i've got to get down for inspection in the mortuary, ma'am.
i can understand your leaving my office with captain lock showing up like that,
hey, hogan, now listen, all we got for a band is a piano, a banjo, a flute, a violin, a bugle and an ocarina, six harmonicas and one bird whistler...
hogan, if i could build ships, i never would have been drafted.
listen, boys, when i get back, let's have a meeting of all the department heads.
we put in too much work together to lose this thing to lock now.
i agreed to keep your condition unofficial only as long as you kept your part of the bargain.
i tried to get here earlier, but i had a very busy day, lieutenant.
i realize that, ma'am, but the men are counting on me.
if i've been neglectful, it's only because the ball is so important.
i was looking for it inside when you started making all the racket at the window.
what was general stuckey's x-ray doing in bixby's office, for crying out loud?
never look a gift horse in the mouth, that's what i always say.
lock, i've been going over the forms 20 and we can have a band.
if it was one little guy who wanted to get on a ship ahead of schedule maybe with a french pop at his heels, but, la-da-dee-doo, a whole regiment.
it's got to be the whole regiment, yancy, including the commanding officer.
he only has one interest in france and this isn't it.
when it comes to running this harbor, he don't wipe his nose without consulting me.
all i wanted to do was see you alone and i couldn't do it unofficially, so i used an x-ray.
and if you stop hiding behind your brass for one minute...
i thought you were the girl i'd always dreamed of, and if that didn't get through to you, then, i tried.
but if it did, and you're trying to duck it by hiding behind your commission, then i really feel sorry for you.
tonight, we've got a chance to be just you and me.
if you change your mind about the ball, you be at supply at 1900.
you fail me this time and you're through as g2 and otherwise, you understand?
you mean, i won't get to go to washington with you, sir?
those vehicles that were seen on the highway, sir, they were delivering supplies to this here ball hogan's running.
from what i gather, sir, this is gonna be one of them rooting, tooting, big, mad balls, nurses and everything.
i know it's gonna be tonight, sir, but i don't know where.
i called you everything i could think of, sir, but i just couldn't gain the confidence of the men.
i can just see joe, standing up there on his head.
did i ever tell you about the time in holyoke when joe and me...
and in a year or two, sergeant, in a year or two i may be a member of the senate.
let's get this guy out of here before he makes the white house.
officers, non-commissioned officers, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you the hippest, the greatest, the mostest combo that you have ever heard in your entire cotton picking lives.
sharps and flats, play like dogs, go on in there and get those cats.
i mean, just having you around to look at, lieutenant, is going to give my morale one whale of a big charge.
well, that's not why i'm here... i've been with the outfit quite a while, now...
how dare you speak to an officer in that disrespectful manner.
sir, i may have been a little friendly but i was not...
well, i can't make head or foot out of them anyhow.
look, lock, i don't want headquarters staring down our throat. it's bad for morale.
when i stop worrying about a compound fracture and i start acting like a policeman,
lock, i don't mind telling you, i get pretty wound up.
"you have brought back to me the memories of my own great love.
"and to see the look in your eyes when you look at each other,
my cousin yancy skibo was pumping gas at the shell station back home when i made t5.
today my cousin yancy is a master sergeant right down there in le havre,
all the time he's been looking me right in the eye and promising me the moon.
now, the soldier's manner, you wouldn't say it was disrespectful, would you?
hogan, before i make a decision and disposition of this matter, i'd like to hear your story.
you're accused of quitting your rifle while on guard duty and of being disrespectful to an officer.
to the best of my knowledge, sir, it was a simple statement of fact.
she just seemed beautiful at the time, and i said so.
i tell you, we are going to find a place for you and lieutenant schmidt to get together yet.
somewhere in france, there has got to be that little inn run by the little, white-haired old lady.
last night, 50 of your parachutists, drunk like pigs, came over to my hotel and made an argument.
before the argument was over, did you see what was left of my place?
for example, my friend berryman, he is in love with a nurse.
but unfortunately in our army, nurses are considered to be officers.
if not for l'amour, madame, then strike a blow for liberte, egalite and fraternite in the medical department of the united states army.
you speak very well, my young friend, but striking such a blow will not repair all the damage to my hotel.
i think it can be done, madam, if you get the right man for the job.
yes, but no doubt general eisenhower has other things on his mind.
to me, just look like a private in the us army.

monsieur, the wine we have left is really not fit to drink.
all the best has been requisitioned, first by the german army, then by your army.
well, ever since the outfit came overseas, i've had sort of a special interest in lieutenant eaton.
i think she knows i'm interested and is interested in my interest.
saturday night, lieutenant, the enlisted men are having a big time.
now, with this outfit due to break up very soon, this is the last chance i'm gonna have to see guys i've been soldiering with for three years.
i'll put this in the file, and we'll check on it every week.
now, i'll go get some milk and cream, you wait here.
as intelligence officer of this hospital, it's my duty to know what's going on all over.

she's merely asking to have a few holes repaired in her roof.

hogan, if i could build ships, i never would have been drafted.
and you see to it by staying on the tails of your cooks, boy.
every time lock lifts a lid, he's gonna see nothing but rinds, grounds, peels and egg shells.
sir, if i may say so, now is the time to think of the good of the service.
by the time they dug him up, it would probably be too late.
if your condition is neglected, it could become very serious and i'd be responsible.
i realise that, ma'am, but the men are counting on me.
major wood chewed out my captain, and me, i'm hiding out.
all the time that you're talking to me, i could be in there looking for it.

it's got to be the whole regiment, yancy, including the commanding officer.
-fiddly doo, you bet i do, but for every man in the regiment i move out, i have to juggle ten more.
and the last man down better find a ship underneath him, or twiddly dee he winds up in the sea.
given they've just arrived today, it's gonna take days and days for them to get processed, pal.
sure, and if i don't see them for days and days, i won't be able to move them out.
i thought you were someone very special, i thought you were the girl i'd always dreamed of,
and if that didn't get through to you, then, i tried.
if you change your mind about the ball, you be at supply at 1900.
if you don't change your mind, i hope you have a brilliant military career, lieutenant.
you fail me this time and you're through as g2 and otherwise, you understand?
you mean, i won't get to go to washington with you, sir?
i'm telling you, hogan, that old hound dog man has got the scent.
with him checking all the vehicles, how are we gonna get to the ball?
after all, transporting pws without proper... i'll explain about that, sir.
i didn't know there were any pws in that ambulance, sir.

he hits camp chesterfield on friday and i was wondering if we could throw the general and his crew a little party.
and go to le havre and pick up an anchor, a big one...
i tell you, hogan, this dame would tear the stars right out of the sky if she could just get a grip on them.
in pw ward 38, a pan bed enamel is urgently required.

what's the difference if he gets shipped back a couple of days early?
given they've just arrived today, it's gonna take days and days for them to get processed, pal.
sure, and if i don't see them for days and days,
now, if'n the typewriters was to start singing today, and if'n the medicals were medicking today, and my ships arrived on time, and i was to get a hold of the boys, say, tomorrow,
of course, that's a lot of if'n but if'n i did, then, whammy!

oh, we found most of him, his arms, and legs and liver all except his head.
he realizes now how important you and your shipyard are to the war effort.
if it will help the absentee problem they're willing to talk their fool heads off.
he's alive, and he'll still be alive at the end of the war.
he's filthy rich now, and he'll be even filthier rich then.
i hear ice cubes rattling in glasses, i hear people talking, i hear people laughing.
i can hear your heartbeat, but i cannot hear that trumpet.
you don't know how hard i tried to get into a uniform like that.
but the fools in washington say the scrap business is essential.
oh, well, there's the war between the army and navy and one between the navy and the marines, and the marines and the army.
then there's the global conflict between the fighting navy and the paper navy.
if you can think up a good slogan, you're a cinch for the navy cross.
things like, "send me more japs" or, "my only regret is that i have but one life to give. " stuff like that.
still, i wanna get back there, even if i'm just as certain i'll never return.
most of the fellows realize they can't come back from all the missions.
a man's ship is torpedoed, he loses all his uniforms, the pay accounts get lost he can't get paid.
then shore patrol expects him to own blues or stay indoors.
crewson, by the way i put that young ensign to sleep in your suite.
just before i left, there was a telephone call for you.
i rolled into a controlled spin hoping to break the pressure.
when it was right, i hit the hatch and was out.
i don't care who you're really thinking about when you kiss me.
like i told you, i never do it for any reason if i don't want to.
you know, a couple of months ago, i got a letter from a friend.
not what you'd call a close friend anymore but he writes to me, and i answer him.
type a is just to see whether you're male or female.
what do they think i'll tell gwynneth, the disposition of our fleet?
naturally, i didn't know the ship or any of its gallant men but i'd be honored to drink to them.
- i ask each and every one of you to- crewson:
if that isn't the nicest way of saying "i love you" i've seen.
pardon my language, miss kratchna but those two are the biggest horses' rear ends i ever-
is not about the servant problem, nor is it a puff for imported wines.
it is concerned with some mysterious doings in a family of three.
well, i can't have a dog that big in an apartment.
well, you couldn't have given us anything that carl would like better.
afraid he'll become so entranced with the dog, he'll never finish his book.
come september and we'll have your publishers howling across the country.
i think lorna's really very glad she's going to san francisco, don't you?
well, i suppose if the firm's sending her, she can't do much about it.
well, if i intend doing any work today, i'd better get on home.
oh, perry, i'm going to pay you a professional visit in the next few days.
well, if it had to happen, i'm glad it happened this way.
you wouldn't let me take care of you, but the fates did.
it's getting so a man can't even trust his best friend.
this concludes this session of our little court of inhuman relations.

i propose that comrade karas, of the regional committee, should chair this meeting.
since we do not know much about this, i think comrade tuszka should start.
maybe you should have gone to them, if they weren't coming to you, to check out what was happening.
you were quick to fire him after 40 years of work.
he turned off the light to kill zapora and to derail the train.
he's worked on the railway 20 years longer than you have.
...robbing themselves of a good pay, not only by earning less,
but also by wasting valuable property which belongs to the people's republic.
even my wife was surprised that he was drunk at noon.
then a train passed by and the wind knocked him over.
i had to teach coal efficiency, longer runs, and limit repairs.
the longer you're here, mr. supervisor, the more you'll be convinced.
and i began to suspect that he was setting all the men against me.
i decided to change his assistant thereby breaking up his little team.
there are still those among us, who don't follow what is in their best interest.
by wasting coal, they are robbing themselves of good pay, not only by earning less,

you and 26 of your men tried to take the town of perdido in mexico.
only six of you came back and not in very good shape, either.
i asked a man for his gun, and he hands it to me.
why, you overdressed tin soldier, you have about as much chance against enderby as a ribbon clerk.
you go west from portalis until you get to twin peaks.
then head dead south... through the brush country about a half-day's ride from here.
well, i want to thank you for reminding me of that.
we're just having a little fun here, and, well, i ain't going to be the one to spoil it.
all he wanted, i guess, was to set you against dave.
i don't suppose he told you that every time dave fought, he was forced into it.
not out of any feelings for you, but because of his brag that no one takes anything from him.
was it one of your lies about dave shooting my father?

at a time when the shadows of the third reich were already darkening germany's skies,
f. c. weiskopf wrote a book that is not only an account of our recent past, but also relates a shocking chapter from the history of the human heart...
the need for dreams was great, and they were cheap and easy to come by.
much easier to come by than work or a loaf of bread.
for just 30 pfennigs you could spend a whole afternoon with greta garbo.
and if you were out of work, for no charge at all, the "palm trees of valencia" and "elisabeth's lovely legs"
i want to get away from these stinking proles, not move closer to them.
once we've got a roof over our heads we can look for something else.
as i can't find a job and there's no sense in waiting,
i'm moving out, so as not to be a burden anymore."
a few of her regular customers had bought ten-pfennig cigarettes, jovial, well-situated gentlemen.
and if i say i'll see what i can do, then i'll definitely find something, you can depend on that.
with an iron hand... he'll destroy everything harmful to our people.
in the new reich... every member of the german nation will have his honor guaranteed.
if you must put on such a show, close the window.
after freddi joined the brownshirts, life improved a little for lissy and her family.
but the ground beneath her feet seemed shakier to her than ever before.
she would have liked to run away from her fear, her anxiety and her doubts.
how else are we supposed to get out of the hole we're in?
it's not just about freddi and me, we've got a baby to feed.
for a man with spunk like me, the red youth front's no good.
i've had enough of all that baloney about discipline and grass-roots work.
she had almost the same blonde mop of curls as you and the same walk.
but later, when money was short... and i didn't have enough to pay for movie tickets and pastries... she simply upped and left me.
always retreating from one lesser evil to another, always sticking to the democratic rules of the game, even though the others don't give a damn about them.
now the bandits in brown are on top, and they'll tear the skin from our bodies.
she knew there was a way, a difficult and arduous way, but an honest way.
each one of us has to walk this path for himself, but no one walks it alone.
- i wonder if you could give me a ride to town, sir.
i know i don't look very nice but when you hitchhike, sometimes you don't ride with the nicest people so i chose to walk the last five miles.
at your age, the reason would sound just a little square.
i wish there was some way that i could thank you.
well, for one thing, it looks like she wanted to get herself arrested.
i was going to call you this afternoon when i got your message.
well, she seemed like a nice girl and she said she needed work so i told her to contact myrtle northrup and something could be worked out.
you must admit that a person who is out for blackmail wouldn't be interested in a job.
you can't pay off a blackmailer with that kind of a cheque.
there are all kinds of ways to pay off a blackmailer, mr. addison.
but now i'm afraid his story is gonna help the police pin a murder charge on one of our clients.
well, do the police know that this guy, handsell, can be such a big help?
- i guess it is but i've got to tell the truth.
yes, along with an understanding from the district attorney that you will be granted immunity in this matter?
counsel has the right to ask this man if he's ever been convicted of a felony.
but once the witness has answered in the affirmative, counsel has no right to question him further.
and now counsel is using this court as a sounding board for his highly conjectural conclusions.
as the hearing progresses, mr. burger, we shall see how conjectural those conclusions are.
my mother lives in new mexico and i left town to try and better myself.
i had just gotten here when all of these things happened to me.
i'd babysit or wait on tables, any job i could get.
would you give us the names of some of your employers?
mr. burger, i assume that you are aware of the contradictions in this witness' testimony.
i would suggest you begin an immediate investigation for possible charges of perjury.
and then there's addison's fight with ferrell over control of the studio.
and addison was seen in the vicinity of the murder house the night ferrell was killed.
i was going to use it as a threat, force him to keep mr. addison in the studio.
didn't you realise the district attorney could accuse mr. addison of the same motive?
after all, she did say that ferrell came at her with a poker.
you know, with a good attorney she might get off with a self-defence?
excuse me, you buy a suit just to get a date?
so, if you want to go out with me, do you get a full wardrobe?
are you still of the idea that you don't care for my kisses?
hey, are you getting big headed just because i kissed you?
i kiss boys to find out which one i like better.
ok, tomorrow let me know if i am the right watermelon for you!
you said it yourself, you don't want to see her again.
i want to see if you can pass by her shop without stopping.
'cause, what happened tonight, that you came back at 9 in the morning must not happen again, ok?
tell me... do you come up with these ideas on your own or somebody helps you?
i learnt that it's more important to love than being loved.
it might be nonsense... but to love means having something inside... perhaps being poor outside, but rich inside! don't listen to him, he'll never marry you!
if you let me slap you, we would have made up.
so you dumped me because i didn't let you slap me?
get up, puppet! don't hit my face or i'll kill you!
- who cares, i hit what i hit! that'll teach you all a lesson!
are you still of the idea that you don't care for my kisses?
hey, are you getting big headed just because i kissed you?
i kiss boys to find out which one i like better.
ok, tomorrow let me know if i am the right watermelon for you!
after all i am the father and i can advice you.
actually, if you allow me i need a word with you!
'cause, what happened tonight, that you came back at 9 in the morning must not happen again, ok?
tell me... do you come up with these ideas on your own or somebody helps you?
i learnt that it's more important to love than being loved.
it might be nonsense... but to love means having something inside... perhaps being poor outside, but rich inside!
you were running around the table and didn't let me catch you!
if you let me slap you, we would have made up.
roger, can't you forget you're an expert on territorial labor relations?
if this is the sloppy way that folger and the other planters run their business, no wonder they had to call me in to straighten out their labor.
at least they don't stare at us like we stare at them.
they see more without looking than we do by staring all day.
island natives are only a few steps removed from their primitive ancestors.
their leaders were strong, domineering men who told them what to do and when to do it.
he started practice in the jungle five years ago with a tent and thermometer.
now, why would a man of science in this modern age choose to practice primitively?
our first job is to ferret out the ringleaders under agung.
i want a meeting with all the planters first thing tomorrow.
well, she told me that japanese girls hardly ever buy new dresses, just new sashes.
this was too good a bargain to pass up, so i married her.
isn't major grey more of an authority around here than mr. mathews?
mathews threatened to pull wires to have kimi-chan shipped back to japan if dick made a fuss.
keep the eye distracted so it can't see what the hand does.
well, if this is true, what are the authorities here doing about it?
well, so the authorities will hound him, jail him, eventually put him away for good.
how would you feel toward anyone who... destroyed something you loved?
get the planters and workers together fighting a common enemy, and you'll lick this thing in a minute.
like this, you're playing right into their hands, believing what they want you to believe.
(chuckles) surely you don't have to pay any attention to the hippocratic oath with these primitive people.
when hippocrates wrote that oath, the people were a lot more primitive than they are now.
i need someone to make an example of, and he's an excellent choice.
while you're making an example of him, be sure you don't make him a martyr
mr. mcrae will be our witness that we were expecting a night attack from the natives.
how could we know that two such distinguished americans as dr. ransom and major grey prowl the jungle at night?
i have found your name and position most profitable and exploitable.
then you are the one who has arranged for all these things for which i have been persecuted.
come with us now to watch with all the grandeur of her seasons' change.
and marvel at the wondrous ways in which she has arranged a time for everything.
we call it wildwood heart, and this shall be the setting for our play.
our plot is nature's own, our theme, the endless stream of life that in this time of spring finds new beginnings everywhere.
the miracle of mother love, a vital force that, even in a savage breast, protects the young until their age of helplessness is past.
and nature's greatest gift is here, a warm and precious thing.
the deep compelling urge of kind for kind from which all life must spring.
but now the mating season, the time of together, has come and gone.
still, between the red fox and his vixen, there is a bond that holds them in a close companionship.
so shall they stay through all of life, for this is nature's way.
but nature's mating ways are sometimes strange, and in her treetop world, she's arranged the very opposite design.
the pine squirrel, once his mating time has passed, lives out a life of bachelorhood inside a ragged nest of shredded bark and grass, and yet he always keeps a watchful eye on a pine-tree snag nearby.
the mother marten, with her young to feed, is driven by a constant need of flesh and blood.
she must make many kills today, and the pine squirrel is her natural prey.
the distant cry that makes the marten turn away comes from her nesting place.
a mother raccoon has happened by, and now the marten's babies are in peril.
to keep her world in balance, nature has decreed that in this time of hunting, death shall take many forms.
the beaver kills the living aspen tree and dines upon its flesh.
from the bare, bleak skeleton that remains, he fashions and maintains his dam.
all through the day, in wildwood heart, the search for food continues everywhere.
you just dig in, hang on and try to do your best,
and if, alas, you just haven't got the answers, there's only one thing left to do.
she knows by instinct that survival of her young depends upon her watchfulness and tender care.
as late spring turns to early summer, the time of learning still goes on.
down at the beaver pond, the beaver kit is on his way to school.
as a rule, it's mother who supplies the transportation here, while father, as the chief construction engineer, provides the object lesson.
the young raccoons are nimble-footed now and strong, and they've long since entered the second phase of their training.
mother's teaching them to forage for themselves, and this is a hunting trip.
mother raccoon has three, all right, but not three of a kind,
and as for mother skunk, well, she drew the wrong suit, too.
to them, the time of adventure is a time to play, and so begins a treetop circus, an aerial ballet.
a magpie, on thievery intent, presents a pointed argument that stops the show.
the ruse succeeds, for here's a barrier that makes the marten pause.
she hates the water and never swims except in direst need.
the litter of shells and husks around the log form the midden waste,
and this in turn becomes a perfect place for hiding food supplies.
it takes some time for perri to lose her lethargy of fear, but with the danger gone, she's aware that now she, too, is on her own.
obedient to a natural law, she will not intrude upon the realm of porro.
autumn is a time of preparing, and porro, in a perfect frenzy of haste, is determined that not a single pine cone shall go to waste.
perri, too, is busy gathering winter stores, and on one of these crisp autumn days, she goes beyond the limits of her own territory, deep into a part of wildwood heart she's never seen before.
the winds of late autumn, as though jealous of the lovely leaves, rip through wildwood heart and tear them in a golden fury from the trees.
and these winds blow ill for more than one, for now down comes his castle, porro and all.
well, this time, it's too late to try again, so porro takes refuge inside his midden log.
after all, it's well supplied and probably safer than his tree.
and so for poor, proud porro, there remains but one alternative.
although he is by birth a treetop dweller, now must he live all winter long beneath the earth.
now, through many days and nights, nature, grand mistress of design, redecorates her stage in white,
and with each dawn, another time of beauty lies upon the land.
at first, this is a time of silence, too, but as the morning sun grows warm and bright, it wakens every sleeping bush and tree, creates a rhapsody in white.
for perri, with her store of winter food, winter is a time of waiting, but not for the marten.
only wildwood heart will wear the mark of fire, and this, too, in time, nature will repair.
it's no surprise, of course, that porro rises from the ruins safe and sound.
porro should have waited just a little longer, for perri, too, remembers she has a rendezvous to keep.
and so she preens, prepares and then sets out to find the midden log,
quite unaware that all the while, there's been a witness here.
and this time, the forest fire has supplied the bridge so long denied.
one instant more may be too late, and so porro makes the utmost sacrifice.
though death may be the price, he will attract the marten to himself.
nor will perri grieve for porro very long because, you see, there is no need.
he always could outwit that cat, and here's the living proof of that.
perri hears and feels within her breast a warm, upwelling happiness.
and so nature in her wondrous way writes the happy ending to our play.
...therefore my older brother naturally inherited the family estate and the title, the earl of brunswick.
my father had invested money in this ranch in montona and his share came to me.
i've only been on the kill of a full-size montana bear only once, on an expedition with an army group when we run across one.
it took a ten-pound shot from a cannon to bring him down.
and you shall sit back and be the lady of the manor.
thanks, jamie, but for a while, you just sort of take it easy and don't bother yourself none.
everything a cowboy needs for a working day is right here.
tie and post for roping, high cantle to give a man support and comfort during that long, hard working day.
you kill any one of them and the word will reach every lodge in this region.
there won't be an indian within 500 miles not wearing war paint.
we could have killed your braves before this, but that would mean a war.
you kill this man and the soldiers will come anyway and you don't want that!
you're the only one who understands how i'm made on the inside.
even better than i do myself... .. who am a fool.
anyway, if i don't want to go to that school, you can't make me!
i don't care what you'll do, only that you don't stay here and raise a scandal.
i can get all the fiancees i want, dear mister emilio.
i only have to raise a finger, and i've got a regiment around me!
and now... and now... and now, that hooked to it i am,
don't know... don't know... don't know, how free to be again,
then, when you die, they'll you take to the cemetery on the town's money.
then they'll put you in the hole, and you won't even know.
my father has a little farm down there, on the giglio island.
the last time i was there i painted it all over, with green shutters.
and what is it you wish to sell me today at an exorbitant rate, i'm certain ?
an inedible clam with which you are willing to part for very little money, i am sure.
and i want to thank your government for expressing its desire to cooperate.
i must beg you, however, for the moment, to observe strict secrecy.
would you have your men bring it in the barn ?
[ italian ] now will you get me a long wooden pole ?
and what is it you wish to sell me today at an exorbitant rate, i'm certain?
an inedible clam with which you are willing to part for very little money, i am sure.
- will you leave this man alone and go back to your bed!
listen, nurse, i am in no mood to argue with you!
and i want to thank your government for expressing its desire to cooperate.
i must beg you, however, for the moment, to observe strict secrecy.
it is only if i speak of the thing from the ship...
that you must promise to me that i may keep my hat from the great country of texas.
now, i'm gonna try and prod the creature right into that cart.
if i can get him in there, be ready to shut that gate.
we'll need the cooperation of the italians, so get the state department on the phone.
tell them we've got a green light, and get the italian embassy to clear a path.
we saw one more man but it was a certainty he was dead.
but, signor commissario, the ship of the air, she was so big, so vast.

they are the two men who went inside the ship before she sank.
the american general wishes to speak to you of an item of great importance.
we are looking for a cylinder about this high and about this round.
probably, it went down with the ship, but there's the possibility it was knocked loose and may drift ashore somewhere today, tomorrow, who knows?
all you've done is try to help and all i've done is snarl at you.
i hope, when this is all over, you'll let me try to make it up to you over a table for two in a dark café.
on venus, we discovered by accident that these creatures are susceptible to electric shock, and that controlled voltage can paralyse them.
if we could have two helicopters and a squad of armed paratroopers we might be able to drop a charged wire net on the beast.
i am fully aware of the rumours that began with an air crash ten days ago off the coast of sicily.
not until now have i received permission to make known the facts exactly as they are.
i ask you to select three of your number to accompany colonel calder to the zoo.
those selected by you will, of course, pool their interviews with the entire press corps and we will furnish you all necessary photos.
the scientists here believe the earth's atmosphere has upset its metabolic rate.
the more it breathes, the more tissue it builds, the bigger it gets.
now, you'll note the wire running down to the creature's wrist.
dr. blankfurt keeps 1,800 volts of electricity coursing through the body.
we hope this electro-dynamometer will enable us to complete our examination of the oral passages.
could you give us any positive statement on your progress so far, doctor?
why is it always so costly for man to move from the present to the future?
great scientific advances are often sudden accomplished facts before most of us are even dimly aware of them.

those selected by you will, of course, pool their interviews with the entire press corps and we will furnish you all necessary photos.
well, i guess that's all, and thank you for your patience.
it's the doctor's job to keep the creature unconscious during the examination.
now, you'll note the wire running down to the creature's wrist.
general mcintosh has told us the importance of knowing how this animal survives on venus.
we discovered the creature's respiratory system includes sort of a fibrous filtering element which blocks out all of the poisonous vapors on venus.

i was on my way to his wife's cabin just now.
so was he, when we caught up with him - as you can see.
you rode the pack horse under the branch, swung up without your feet touching the ground again.
say, how did you get that pack horse to keep running?
you know, we've got two weeks on the trail to laramie.
now, i figure to give you some trouble in that time.
you know, i don't like someone, i just reach for a gun, just about as natural as you'd reach to scratch an itch.
well, you can let off a lot of steam just using your fists.
what's the sense to fighting when you're going to get licked?
well, unfortunately, you can't be allowed to go around killing everybody you don't like.
but manfred the way a man dies is less important than the way he lives.
oh, i figured it'd be my finish he'd be remembering most.
you wanna change anything you said before when you were out here?
like the part about whether or not you had a gun?
well, if i use my dirty look, it wouldn't have made much sense to use a toy gun, now, would it?
didn't you tell that old man to open up that cash register, or you'd give him the barrel of that gun over his head?
occasionally, in our series, we touch on a subject that is far too real to be made the butt of my usual flippant remarks.
tonight's story of juvenile delinquency is certainly a case in point.
and we have presented it with a hope that it might, in some small way, throw a little light on what has become a serious national problem.
here desperate criminals who have been brought to bay appear before the detective force and are questioned by the chief detective.
then no matter how long you been at it, don't admit nothing else.
tell them you did it, but you don't know why you did it, and you'll never do it again.
like the part about whether or not you had a gun?
when i picked him up, he was carrying a. 45 automatic.
he threw a garbage can through the window of a clothing store.
i found him inside the place with a bundle of overcoats.
tonight's story of juvenile delinquency is certainly a case in point.
and we have presented it with a hope that it might, in some small way, throw a little light on what has become a serious national problem.
then no matter how long you been at it, don't admit nothing else.
tell them you did it, but you don't know why you did it, and you'll never do it again.
like the part about whether or not you had a gun?

well, anyone would think, to hear you two, i never did anything!
let me tell you, i've been on my feet since seven while you were snoring.
i mean, well, just look round this room for a start.
oh, it's a bit of a muddle, but you can't say i don't try.
it's just i wanted to tell you i was on my way.
for a moment i thought you were going to say you couldn't make it.
you see the same person every day, you don't see them at all.
but women shouldn't be like that, not bothering once they're married.
i know you wouldn't hurt anyone if you could avoid it.
it ought to be possible to be happy without trampling on people.
if i left her and that happened, how could i ever forgive myself?
if that did happen, which it won't, you couldn't be held responsible.
oh, i can write a good business letter, and get the words out, click, click, click, just like that.
but in my family, feelings... love and all that, were things you just didn't talk about.
i just want to know what kind of a... woman you are.
what kind of a woman could do this to my mother, to our family?
i have to earn back the money that i spent for the ex- wifes hospitalization and for sending her to the seashore and all.
shima worked like a horse for the adoptive family since she was seven.
they are too old fashioned for me, although the quality is good.
i can't wear something a woman ten years older than me woman wore.
you know that i sneaked out from home on the night before the wedding.
but, why do your legal documents say you married, though you escaped from the wedding?
he does whatever he wants but he wants to save his face at the same time.
he calls me "peak belly" i didn't have my belly stuck out when i was born.
soon he will come to take you back from working here.
i feel sorry for the troubles that he caused you and the master of the rice mill.
i don't want to leave them just before it gets busy.
so, i will stay here till june and i will be ..
now, she is complaining the job is too easy for her.
it is no use if i learn how to play the shamisen from now.
it'd be like as if you came back from the west.
what are you going to do if i go back there?
we should have let you know, but we were pretty busy, then.
we couldn't be troubled to send a telegram to one of our ex-maids.
how often have you seen that statement at the beginning of a picture?
it sometimes means that there was a man named napoleon... but that any similarity between what he did in life... and what he's going to do in this movie is strictly miraculous.
in fact, a modern writer has said... that inside every fat man... a thin man is struggling to get out.
well, in a literal and terrifying sense... inside this demure young woman... two very vivid and different personalities... were battling for the mastery of her character.
she was, in fact, a case of what is called multiple personality... something that all psychiatrists have read about... and very few have ever seen... certainly not dr. thigpen and dr. cleckley... of the medical college of georgia... who one day were confronted with a woman... who had one personality more than dr. jekyll.
now, their account of the case was delivered... to the american psychiatric association in 1953... and it's already a classic of psychiatric literature.
so this movie needed no help... from the imagination of a fiction writer.
the truth itself was fabulous enough... and all the episodes you're going to see... happened to this girl whom they call eve white... and much of the dialogue is taken from the clinical record... of the doctor that we call dr. luther.
first i get this terrible headache... and then i get this spell.
now, when you say spell, do you mean you faint or anything like that?
i was playin' out in the backyard with bonnie... and all of a sudden i got this splitting' headache... and then the next thing i knew...
i mean, the next thing i was conscious of, it was the next mornin'.
you've been frightened by this voice... because you recognize it as a symptom of illness.
people who are actually losing their minds... rarely find anything extraordinary about the hearing of voices.
they almost invariably assume... it's some sort of extra privilege that they enjoy... like personal radio reception... or built- in radar.
yeah, but what if sometimes... it sounds like my own voice?
and the thing is, she don't really even care anything about him.
she just tells herself she does 'cause she thinks she ought to.
boy, i can tell you, though, i'm gonna fix his wagon.
i ain't gonna go through the rest of my life with that creep.
you're not gonna be subdivided by any court or board i've heard of yet.
where mrs. white goes, you go... and that means into an asylum if you misbehave and mrs. white has to be committed.
i'm afraid that is a possibility... but that's a chance i think we're gonna have to take.
if we're ever gonna reunite these two personalities, to put it simply...
at some point in the past... apparently when she was a little girl... her personality became divided... into two different personalities.
in effect, she's now two different women... entirely different in character.
to be more specific about it... the girl you married, bonnie's mother... sweet, quiet girl you fell in love with, that's one of the women.
the other is the one that scared bonnie, the one who bought all the clothes... the one that had that row with you in atlanta.
during those two weeks, ralph had left their daughter bonnie... with the grandparents and found for himself a better job... in jacksonville, florida... but mrs. white was not to go with him... for, on the advice of dr. luther... she decided to stay in town in a furnished room... for further and more regular treatment.
this decision caused a separation... that was to have unexpected consequences.
if i don't check out of dixie motel by 10:00... they'll charge me for another six hours.
ralph, i won't leave here until i'm well again... not till i have bonnie back with me.
i'm not gonna be alone with her, not till i'm well.
what do you mean, you're not gonna be alone with her?
if you think i'm gonna have people laughing at me, you got another thing coming.
if you were really crazy, it'd be different, but not this multiplied thing.
the truth is, neither eve black... nor mrs. white is a satisfactory solution.
neither of them is really qualified to fill the role of wife, mother... or even a responsible human being.
well, there wasn't anybody else there but me... so when she went in the bathroom and she locked the door, look.
she made one slash, and then i got out, and i made her drop the blade... and i got it and threw it away.
but then when papa was driving me out of the yard...
i got the strangest feeling that i wasn't never gonna see her again... that this was the last time.
i could smell the odor of fresh earth... like a long time ago... and morning glories... though there are no morning glories growing around there now.
and you still can't remember anything at all about your childhood?
jane tells me that when she came out up there on sunday... when you were playing catch with bonnie... the ball rolled under the house, and she went under after it.
and when she got under there... she had a feeling of being very small... a child... a very curious and somehow frightening feeling, as if she'd been there before.
- yeah... but only when i wanted to do something she didn't want to do.
didn't she ever tell you about all those lickings she got for things she didn't do?
well, i want you to have it... 'cause you're the only one that knows what it's meant to me, the only one.
i know of nothing that's gonna happen to you... but i do appreciate the dress, believe me.
"and still no more eve white and no more eve black.
"that's why we decided it was safe at last to have bonnie with us...

well, it's like the other day i was playing out in the back yard with bonnie and all of a sudden i got this splitting headache and then the next thing i knew,
i mean, the next thing i was conscious of, it was the next morning.
she had no more blackout spells - at least, none that she was aware of.
but not quite a year later, several things happened that showed her to be in urgent need of help.
you've been frightened by this voice because you recognise it as a symptom of illness.
people who are actually losing their minds rarely find anything extraordinary about hearing voices.
i don't know whether she heard me or not, but i really hollered at her.
boy, i can tell you, though, i'm gonna fix his wagon.
every time i go in there, they ask me to stand up and sing.
of course, i have to be in the mood to do it, though.
and one of these days, i'm gonna come out and stay out, just you wait and see.
and can you retire, go back in when you want to?
"love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with might;
smote the chord of self, that, trembling, pass"d in music out of sight."
- i mean if you get into any trouble at all,
mrs white will be adjudged crazy, but it'll be both of you that'll be locked up.
i'm afraid that is a possibility, but that's a chance i think we're gonna have to take.
if we're ever gonna reunite these two personalities, to put it simply, i'd say the first logical step to take in that direction would be to introduce 'em to each other.

if i don't check out of that motel by ten, they'll charge me for another six hours.
i won't leave here until i'm well again, not till i have bonnie back with me.
besides, can't go to jacksonville with just one dress, even if it was new.
if i buy you a dress, will you go away with me?
she really was gonna kill herself if i hadn't stopped her.
when you said there was something wrong somewhere, did you mean something more than the effort to kill herself?
i got the strangest feeling that i wasn't ever gonna see her again, that this was the last time.
and i wanted to jump out of that truck and go hug her.
if she'll just understand how much our little girl needs love and understanding, then i won't mind dyin'.
you know, if she'll just take good care of her for me.
i could smell the odour of fresh earth, like a long time ago.
and morning glories, though there are no morning glories growing around there now.
jane tells me that when she came out up there on sunday, when you were playing catch with bonnie, the ball rolled under the house and she went under after it.

you was the first one i ever said who i was.

in the desert, near the shore of the sea, the government has established one of its most important naval research bases.
at the laboratory on the secluded south tip of the base, top-secret atomic experiments are carried out under rigid security control.
on may 17, in the early afternoon, an earthquake occurred in the desert area.
its force was strong enough to be felt at the research base, even though its epicenter was 10 miles away in the wild rock formations 350 feet below the surface of the salton sea.
however, less than 2 hours after the earthquake, the base was back to normal operating procedure.
lt. hollister, of the parachute test unit, was preparing to make the last-scheduled jump of the day.
in my opinion, the man you found on the boat was literally scared to death.
do you have enough deputies to post a quarantine on all the beaches until we find out what happened out there?
gentlemen, we believe that this creature is of the same family as the historically documented kraken.
a giant sea beast that was the direct ancestor of the modern water mollusk.
i've had some film of common mollusks flown in from san diego.
i'd like you to compare it with the creature that attacked us.
as i mentioned, most of these creatures live entirely in the water.
but it's not unusual to find them on land, searching for food.
i'd say there are at least 10 of these giant creatures, each one with the capacity to lay several thousand eggs in its life cycle.
there was a cave here which we sealed with explosives and probably trapped the rest of them inside.
if any did escape, it will have to surface sooner or later.
it won't find enough food in the salton sea, it'll get hungry.
a few miles from here is the all-american canal system, which irrigates the entire imperial valley and then in time empties into the gulf.
i don't want to alarm you unduly, but if just one of these creatures lived and got by the patrols, into the canal system and multiplied, the species could threaten the entire world.
first, devouring all life in the oceans and then, foraging on land.
can you imagine an army of these things descending on one of our cities?
a few miles from here, this lakebed existed in a dry state, void of life for many years.
then a flash flood filled it with about 2 feet of water.
suppose an earthquake caused a fissure to open at the bottom of the sea, allowing water to seep down to this pocket.
because this water was slightly radioactive, and because the eggs had a capacity to absorb this radioactivity, they found an environment that was perfect in which to hatch and grow.
we're on our way back to the base now, and we have to eat sometime.
what i mean is, why don't you let me take you to dinner tonight?
i had to come to town with some reports for the doctor.
i know it's past dinnertime, but if you hadn't already eaten, i...
[ narrator ] this is the salton sea in southern california.
a strange phenomenon, in which nature has placed 400 square miles of salt water in the middle of an arid desert.
in the desert, near the shore of the sea, the government has established one of its most important naval research bases.
at the laboratory on the secluded south tip of the base, top-secret atomic experiments are carried out under rigid security control.

lt. hollister, of the parachute test unit, was preparing to make the last-scheduled jump of the day.
it's just a simple marine secretion, although there is something that puzzles me.
i'd like to run another series of tests on it tomorrow.
to make sure it's dead, we're going to saturate the area with depth charges.
but our most important job is to find all its eggs.

i told you that squirt of a foreman was going to be trouble.
he talked to the wrong man when he talked to me like that.
the sooner you take off, the faster you get in there.
all right, now, don't forget... as you come in, you fall away from the bag.
but the third and fourth inning, i thought we were going to lose it, but...
mrs. piersall, your son made a play like a big leaguer today, and don't think they don't know it up there.
first we got to be great next season when the scouts come down.
you got to stay in shape, keep healthy then nothing can stop us.
you're going to have to work hard and think for yourself.
remember, no one's going to be there doing your thinking for you.
well, look, i've got a perfectly good steak here and asparagus and olives and muffins and ice cream and stuff like that... what do you say?
i mean, i'm very tired of eating out at all these restaurants around here all the time, aren't you?
i need a couple of saucepans and a double boiler and worcestershire sauce and muffin tins and... and, uh... well, to light the oven to 450.
oh, and the ice cream... maybe it should go in the icebox right away.
he knows what it takes to make the big leagues and so do these guys.
every week a fat report goes up to boston how i'm running up bases how i'm feeling, how i'm hitting...
with no ball game scheduled today in the majors the rival manager spent the time juggling their lineups for the crucial games ahead.
locally, the whole town is talking about jim piersall a flashy, young outfielder of our pennant-winning scranton club.
"the boston red sox have decided the outfield flash isn't ready for the big leagues yet."
"he'll be sent down to louisville next spring for further training."
as soon as we move in, i thought i'd put it
mary, mary... right in the room that's going to be hers.
i won't lift the suspension until jim's ready to settle down.
he'll settle down, mr. cronin if you put him in the outfield.
you put him in the outfield where he knows everything and i'll...
listen, i'll guarantee you he'll play a whale of a game.
you don't have to say a thing but if there's anything on your mind.
look, uh, i like you, doc but i don't think we're getting anywhere with this thing.
it's just going to be like last week and the week before.
well, since we have to spend this hour together anyway, uh... how about watching the ball game?
would you like her to grow up feeling she owed you something?
now, look, doc, let me tell you something... let me get you something straight.
he taught me, and he straightened me out and he kept me in line.
if it hadn't been for him standing behind me and pushing me and driving me, i wouldn't be where i am today.
he's making progress here and i won't have that progress interrupted.
why don't we go and ask jim how he feels about it?
i've had business in san antonio several times in the last two years.
any one of the three of us might have met her.
i wasn't supposed to come home last night, but i changed my mind.
there was a black horse back of the house when i rode in.
maria blew out the lamp when i stepped into the living room, but i caught just a flash of him.
a flash in the moonlight on his sleeve as he was getting out the window.
now that you've blown off steam, maybe you'd best get back to the business at hand.
i never fired a gun before, but i wish now i'd taken at least one shot at you.
well, now there's no sense of all three of us being hung.
and all one has to say to strome is, "i'm it."
those two could double back and try and save the one who had to stay.
yeah, but suppose he didn't let one of us go, or two of us go.
someone who could paint word pictures for her of places she'd never seen and never would see locked up in that big house of yours.
somebody had to tell her she was clever, she was pretty and wanted.
he promised to ruin the small kingdom protected by the fairy.
as said, the fairy had left her wand with her friend.
well, he needs to stop and say hello to the barber foxy.
and also have a refreshing glass of wine in the tavern.
they talked about the big party and the market and about the carnival people that would arrive soon.
that same morning, inventor franz decided to try his new... invention, so it was important to wake up in time.
a top secret song that held the key to the box with the fairys wand.
per was delighted, but as he couldn't stop thinking about barbara, he wanted to freshen up after his trip.
but before she could leave she had to finish a blouse for mrs anderson.
and mrs anderson tried on hat after hat... in front of lucidos, who was ready to kill her.
a couple of guys played pool, while they waited for the party.
julie's oldest son was very good, but today was not his day.
twa will let me know if we can have a pink plane.
i haven't seen a woman in two weeks in anything but pink.
"do unto others as you would have others do unto you."
we'll only do unto you for a moment, and it's no more than we would do unto ourselves.
now, tell marion about the books so that we can get out of here.
this deals with epiphenomenalism, which has to do with consciousness as a mere accessory of physiological processes whose presence or absence makes no difference...
you'd be amazed how small the demand is for pictures of trees.
my work is pleasant, the pay is excellent, and i get a trip to paris every year.
and that you not only look like, but you are, a mess of worms.
i'll bet you've been here all these years because if you left, you'd be picked up for vagrancy.
not everyone interested in empathicalism meets him, any more than every american meets the president.
an invitation to flostre's home is a great honour, and as hard to get as an invitation to...
here, hold these balloons high in the air, and when i say "run", run as fast as you can and don't let the balloons go.
run as fast as i can and don't let the balloons go.

i'm so excited about meeting you, i forgot to introduce myself.
if only you knew how anxious i am to talk to you.
twa will let me know if we can have a pink plane.
i haven't seen a woman in two weeks in anything but pink.
none of you seems to realise you're trespassing on private property.
you run around, ignorant of the fact that i can have you put in jail.
you'd be amazed how small the demand is for pictures of trees.
my work is pleasant, the pay is excellent, and i get a trip to paris every year.
gentlemen, may i tell you that you look like a mess of worms?
and that you not only look like, but you are, a mess of worms.
not everyone interested in empathicalism meets him, any more than every american meets the president.
an invitation to flostre's home is a great honour, and as hard to get as an invitation to...
friends, you saw enter here a waif, a gamin, a lowly caterpillar.
we open the cocoon but it is not a butterfly that emerges.

twa will let me know if we can have a pink plane.
i haven't seen a woman in two weeks in anything but pink.
none of you seems to realise you're trespassing on private property.
you run around, ignorant of the fact that i can have you put in jail.
you'd go to a party every night, drink champagne, swim in perfume, and a new love affair every hour on the hour.
if i went to paris, it would be to go to emile flostre's lectures.
gentlemen, may i tell you that you look like a mess of worms?
and that you not only look like, but you are, a mess of worms.

i had no idea they were coming, or what got into dick.

i guess they can't understand anyone coming to paris to work.
we should all go straight to our hotels and get some rest.
gentlemen, may i tell you that you look like a mess of worms?
and that you not only look like, but you are, a mess of worms.
i don't want to spend my entire life retouching your pictures.
when we're finished, you can spend all your time making small talk.

the correspondent from madrid finally will be able to make it after all.

i'm so excited about meeting you, i forgot to introduce myself.

duval can't show his collection without you, regardless what you feel about me!
you can't do this to him, or to all the other people involved!
i had no idea they were coming, or what got into dick.
my dear, you mustn't assume guilt for something that was unavoidable.
with you alive, who can have a copper pot on their heads?
i want you to have pots made of gold on your heads.
with you alive, who can have a copper pot on their heads?
i want you to have pots made of gold on your heads.
didn't you say that one part of the crop will be yours and 3 ours?
giving her due respect for her age, i was being lenient.
yet the wind is still cold, making my left elbow ache.
when i was young, i suffered a joint inflammation in my elbow.
but because i can't use this hand freely, you always bring up marriage proposals.
reiko, you've grown up in a household with out a mother.
i thought it was a bit rare to have a female robber.
but does't your father get upset when you come to places like this?
decide for yourself whether you want to come with me or not.
i can't go when you say something like that, so suddenly...
they come in november and go back home to siberia in april.
the sight is rough, but it has a wild beauty to it.
it says...that daddy can't come home yet because he hasn't finished his work.
so it says to listen to your mother well and to not get ill.
i somehow feel like i am not in the place where i grew up, but instead in a new place,
as a traveler, speaking to someone from far away, meaning, you... chatting in a fun manner.
my days consist of a staring contest between me and blue picture and tracing paper, but my life here is halfway through.
as soon as i return home, i'd like to see you.
when i see you two, sometimes i feel a bit of frustration.
mr. sada, you're a man, so couldn't you, say, pursue her stronger?
i thought of telling mr. katsuragi that i had been spending time with mom beforehand.
if he knew about that he shouldn't be able to ask me to marry him.
it seems that your husband has been taking care of reiko as well.
last time when he called reiko told me to say she wasn't home.
in no way was it possible for me to go there.
with no will and nothing to go by, no one knew the reason of mrs. katsuragi's death.
i have come home thinking that you will be here waiting for me, but you are not here.
i can understand your feeling that you don't want to see me, but you have to forget the things that have already happened.
even after i am finished with the work, i do not plan to live in this city.
i will be sending neri to sappori tomorrow to where kumiko is.
i want to turn around from here, and i want to see two chins well tucked back.
i want to see two powerful little chests lifted right u into the atmosphere.
mr. marquales, you're a filthy ri ch freshman with money dribbli ng out of your ears.
you have a cadillac car and an allowance of $200 a month.
well, perhaps this is a stupid, old-fashioned idea on my part, but i always thought that cheating at cards was not exactly the noble sort of thing to do.
well, i'll tell you what , mr. marquales, the money we win you can keep.
it's very thoughtful of your mother to pack this, mr. simmons.
well, come on now, two bottles of liquor in the barracks, jock?
i don't care whether you approve of it or not you just keep roger's glass filled, that's all.
sir, you wouldn't make me do anything against my basic convictions, would you, sir?
sir, did you know that alcohol is the opium of the western world?
sir, if you took a piece of beef steak and immersed it in a glass of liquor and let it stand overnight, do you know that, that liquor would literally eat that beef steak?
now, sir, can you imagine what that liquor will do to the delicate linings of the human stomach?
now you listen to me, you ridiculous idiot, you keep roger's glass filled or i'm going to take this broom here and cut you in half.
now this is the united states you're living in, and you can take all that europe stuff back where it came from.
yeah, you take that schizophrenic stuff back to sweden, mr. simmons
some senior smuggled a bottle into his barracks, sipped on it all night.
went out for a breath of air he fell down the stairs, stumbled out on the quadrangle and passed out.
a cadet was found this morning unconscious on the quadrangle of headfield barracks.
will any cadet having knowledge of the whereabouts or activities of cadet avery, g., between 2300 and 0600, report before noon drill to colonel ramey at headfield barracks.
well, sir, it's about cadet avery being found th morning on the quadrangle.
the cadet colonel said that any cadet with information about that should report to you before drill .
well, sir, last year i was a cadet officer, and cadet avery was in my platoon.
i was very tough on cadet avery and all the men in my platoon.
well, learning that authority and responsibility go together is one of the hardest things in life, cadet de paris.
however, i take it you have some special reason for telling me this.
could have a mild concussion, and not be drunk at all.
as for the liquor bottles, those could've just been put there.
oh, there's no doubt that whiskey was spilled or poured all over his clothes.
the question is, whether or not any of the whiskey went into his stomach.
i'm not as much of an idealist as you, cadet de paris.
i'm afraid that out of 2,000 men, one or two are apt to turn out to be slightly rotten.
and if we do get caught, they're going to think you're the ringleader, not me.
you said i used to thi nk you was a card, jock.
there's also such a thing as 50 million years of evolution, mr. simmons.
now tell the truth, mr. simmons, don't you ever have any wicked thoughts?
i haven't come here because of its fame as a military college.
no, i've come here simpl y to study engineering, like mr. marquales.
sir, i think when you understand why i've come here to this school you'll understand why i cannot possibl y meet this young lady that you would like me to meet
simmons, he is going to kill you if you don't shut up.
then a machi ne gun mowed him down and a bomb fell on him.
he got the congressional medal of honor and the croix de guerre.
i promised my mother on her death bed i wouldn't go out with any girls.
now that's a death bed promise, and i cannot break a death bed promise.
but are you trying to make him go and report us all?
if you make me go out with this girl, i'm going to throw myself off the roof.
ramey has already questioned those guys, joc they ain't said anything.
yeah, but major avery is going to put a lot more pressure on them than that.
boy, just don't stan d there sipping water, let's do something.
i'm telling you, jock, those freshman talk and we're gone goslings
officially this investigation is closed, but my son says he went into your room last night.
it's hard for me to believe he'd tell me a deliberate lie.
let's suppose that an upperclassman abused his authority to force a freshman to break regulations.
suppose this freshman knew he would be expelled if he told the truth.
i don't know what this school means to you, but i do know what it means to my son.
you look like a decent boy, and i'm going to make an appeal to you.
now, here i'm sent by my family to a military school for discipline.
while in europe, with my talent, why, i'd already be famous.
we'll have two antipastos, and then we'll have a bottle of red wine.
and i'll have veal scaloppini, and a nice, juicy lamb chop for the young lady.
as ridiculous as it is, he insists that you are responsible for his difficulties
i didn't bother to ask you about it before becaus well, it's so absurd.
he claims that he didn't have anything to drink that night.
and that you and some other cadet he couldn't recognize beat him up, dressed him and put him on the quadrangle.
by the same token, you could put something into the stomach as well as take it out.
if you had some sort of apparatus to do it with.
i didn't have any proof before, but i've got proof now.
sir, i swear to you, i don't know what on earth you're talking about.
i can't believe you'd make an unfounded, crazy charge as that, sir.
what would you say if i told you that after i found this,
it stands to reason that thing would be washed with loving care.
of course, sir, you could have put whiskey there for the police to find.
it would be best for him to be separated for awhile from you and mrs. avery.
you know, they say these mental breakdowns often come from a lack of harmony in the home.
well, in that case, we'll just have to meet without you.
but remember, sir, if any one of us talks, that's enough.
what are you trying to do, robert, clear your own conscience at our expense?
why should we take the blame for anothe r guy's meanness?
this is a good college, and you may not belong here but this is a good college.
you know yourself the major broke jock of his rank just last year.
who do you think you are , the ku klux klan?
if i'd done something wrong, corger, why haven't i been reported to a regular honor court?
you guys really do think you're the ku klux klan, don't you?
do you realize that what you are doing is completely illegal?
they rat on me like a bunch of stinking cowards and you're tryin g to get them off.
you don't care anything about major avery at all it's these guys you care about.
you'll find out the man you're dealing with is a man named jocko de paris.
you'll find out that my name is not charles l. chickenfeathers, my name is jocko de paris.
why, there ain't a man in town lay a finger on me if i was to--
excuse me for butting in, sheriff, but you forgot to sign my claim.
because at 3 feet, he knows he'll get hurt, maybe killed, even if he draws first.
pulling your gun, you just goaded him into trying to get you.
your gun comes out cocked as you jerk it for action.
there's a lot more to gunfighting than just shooting at a mark.
- and to have confidence, you gotta keep a cool head.
don't take any chances you don't have to, but wait, then end the fight with one shot.
if you step into a fight, make sure you're the better man.
me and the old lady put on a better fight than that one.
so he went to his friend at the bank, but it seems like money and friendship didn't mix.
he said he was sorry, but this was business, had to have collateral.
took him a long ways from home, but he tracked him down.
the fellow tried to shoot it out, so he killed him.
a man lives alone like me, he gets kind of selfish.
he gives you anything, be sure he's getting his money's worth.
i swear both of you are gonna get a fair trial.
now, you just put down your guns because i'm coming up there.
i figure ed mcgaffey's gonna get hung, but he's gonna get hung the way the law says.
if you don't stand up for law and order now, it don't mean nothing.
you gonna fetch them out, or do we go get them?
you're a brave man when you've got 100 better men to back you up.
as for ben here, young as he is, he's the only one we could find.
would you rather see it pinned on a man like bogardus?
why, there ain't a man in town would lay a finger on me if i was to...
excuse me for butting in, sheriff, but you forgot to sign my claim.
'cause at 3 feet, he knows he'll get hull, maybe killed, even if he draws first.
pulling your gun, you just goaded him into trying to get you.
as long as you're wearing that badge, you gotta walk up,
tell them to throw them up and then watch which way his hands move.
if you gotta step into a fight, make sure you're the better man.
man, the old lady pulled out a better fight than that one.
if he gives you anything, you can be sure he's getting his money's worth.
you wanna give me something, how about a cup of that coffee?
you gonna fetch 'em out, or do we go get 'em?
you're a brave man when you've got a hundred better men to back you up.
we'd hate to see it on any man who didn't keep it clean and bright like he did.
as for ben here, young as he is, he's the only one we could find.
you walk right up to a man, chances are he won't gunfight.
because at 3 feet, he knows he'll get hurt, maybe killed, even if he draws first.
see all the kids you ever delivered, including me and millie.
won't mean a thing if i don't get my birthday present.
i'd sure hate to see it on any man that didn't keep it clean and bright like he did.
as for ben here, young as he is, he's the only one we could find.
why, there ain't a man in town would lay a finger on me if i was to...
excuse me for butting in, sheriff, but you forgot to sign my claim.
'cause at 3 feet, he knows he'll get hurt, maybe killed, even if he draws first.
pulling your gun, you just goaded him into trying to get you.
hit the handle with the whole joint of your thumb, like this, and your gun comes out cocked as you jerk it for action.
remember, there's a lot more to gun fighting than just shooting at a mark.
took him a long ways from home, but he tracked him down.
fellow tried to shoot it out, so he killed him, brought him in, collected the $1,000.
if he gives you anything, you can be sure he's getting his money's worth.
you wanna give me something, how about a cup of that coffee?
i swear both of you are gonna get a fair trial.
now, just put down your guns 'cause i'm coming up there.
not this way, you might hit a cave rat or a bounty hunter.
you're a bad shot, mcgaffey, except when you sneak up on an unarmed old man.
you gonna fetch 'em out, or do we go get 'em?
you're a brave man when you've got a hundred better men to back you up.
and features a pair of these attractive and useful charm bracelets.
these, of course, are stage handcuffs especially made so that one can easily get out.
oh, i forgot to show you how the door lock works.
you see, you can lock it from inside, and then, say, for instance, you had to leave your prisoner alone for a while,
i didn't sleep for a week after each one and then i never forgot how they looked when i shot them.
but it was in line of duty and they'll stay buried for a long time.

but he'll keep paying on it and paying on it, month after month because that's the kind of man he is.

but, just so you begin to see the picture, it stays right where she left it.
when the cleaners come through the car at the station yard, they will find it.
what if i fix it so that there can be no possible suspicion?
your name is clear, your job is clear, you're $50,000 ahead.
look, you'll get a lot of sympathy, they'll slap a bandage on you.
then you go pick up the bag at lost and found.
i hope to have my hand free next time you see me.
if i do, we should be able to present another story.

i want to build a place where i can house thousands of these kids.
and i'll make men of them, so they can stand proud.
it's a bad evening for me every time i see you...
to listen to everyone saying, giovanni your son is crazy, he's out of his mind...
off the top of my head, it would be quite a sum.
the land i inherited from my uncle, does it hold much value?
i believe a little slice of the state also belongs to them.
either way, let's start the work, god will take care of the rest.
to not step on the weakest, and not be intimidated by the strongest...
because no one is strong forever, nor is anyone weak forever...
okay, then tell your kids to be on their best behaviour.
no, i don't want the kids to be exposed to the ill deeds of adults.
'i'll never reply to you, i won't talk to a man who won't tell me his name.'
then you sent me a scrap of paper with 'mario' written on it.
i often dream of chickens and trains, does that mean i love them?
the train, yes, it travels the world and sees so many things.
i can do nothing but being trapped like a caged bird

no sir, once suicide starts in a prison, it's exactly like an epidemic.
of course the epidemic is in my institution, 2 suicides in 6 months!
there was nobody here in the office when i got back.
i waited at the coffee shop for hours for him, but he didn't come.
i called joe and he told me he'd meet me at crane's at 5:00, but he didn't show up.
i've called here any number of times but there was no answer.
the boat gave a lurch as i started down the companionway and i had to stop a minute to get my balance.
i called to him again and i thought i heard him groan.
but if you wanna get technical, i put supplies in the boat, then headed back for town.
used my credit card to buy gas at benson beach and was miles away when joe bradford was murdered.
would you tell us, in your words, what you saw when you examined the cabin of the yacht, mary belle.
well, the body of joseph bradford was lying face down on the starboard side of the cabin with the head toward the companionway.
can i ask if you can identify it for us, please?
yes, that was affixed to the bulkhead of the cabin of the mary belle.
i now show you this object and ask if you can identify it.
yes, that's the candle that was used to light the cabin of the mary belle the night of the murder.
there was actually more to it than just the similarity of names, wasn't there?
well, it seemed that we were married to the same man.
and then she came down the stairs to the landing and i could see she was holding a revolver.
in other words, if it had been mr. bradford, she would've met him with a revolver.
and where were you on the morning of the 15th around 2:00, the morning after the murder?
well, where i always am, looking out that ocean, which just might sound silly to you.
but to me, that's the most beautiful sight in the whole world.
as i see it, you know, a man, he could always lose some sleep.
now, captain, you were testifying about the mary belle being grounded.
in other words, as the water receded, she tilted in this manner, 18 or 20 degrees.
from your experience with sailing craft, could you give us any reason for someone lighting and extinguishing a candle in this position?
well, i would say whoever lit that candle set it up crooked, and then put it out.
and he did it while the vessel was listing at low tide.
that's the only way they could get it to burn straight.
that information was never released to the press or anyone else.
mr. harper testified he brought those candles aboard the afternoon of the murder.
tell us about your quarrel with joe bradford over the defendant.
tell us how you grabbed the fire axe and hit him.
in 1944, when japan's island empire was still an impregnable fortress i approved plans, as commander in chief of the pacific fleet for one of the most daring and formidable operations in the history of naval warfare.
the problem was how to get past the heavily-mined entrances into the sea of japan.
how to sever the link of supply between japan and the asiatic mainland thereby breaking his will to fight and ensuring his destruction.
my faith in this daring operation was placed in men like vice adm. charles a. lockwood...
and his faith was placed in men like cmdr. casey abbott captain of the submarine starfish.
this is the story of the life-and-death struggle fought not only beneath the surface of the sea but within the minds and hearts of a valiant group of men the hellcats of the navy.
but according to your report, casey you did the only thing possible.
well, let's hope the mine you brought back will give us a real clue to getting through the tsushima straits.
we're covering a few dozen dummy mines with the same rubber and acetate coating on the japanese mine.
when we get the report from the lab we'll try to fix our sonar to pick them up.
these nickels, dimes and quarters, they're the mines in the bay.
but a clear channel has been left so a japanese harbor pilot, having a chart can guide friendly shipping through without running into the mines.
here's our chance to log every inch of that channel, right into the sea of japan.
didn't prentice tell you that there was no suction in the bilges and the pump's burnt-out?
leave a vo/unteer there to keep the /eak stoppers in p/ace.
put on any air pressure you need to keep the plugs in.
adm. lockwood, i understood when i first shipped out as cmdr. abbott's exec, that it was a temporary assignment that i was in line for a command of my own.
in fact, i thought when the sea ray returned from the china sea...
i think you're a man who is ruled by personal emotion and you attribute that behavior to everyone around you.
until you overcome that, you'll be unfit for the responsibility of command.
knowing that we planned to invade the sea of japan and appreciating the value of a chart through the minefield i decided that the weather, the time of day and the evident lack of japanese surveillance all justified the attempt.
i considered it a target of opportunity and within my discretion as a commanding officer.
did you take into consideration that your vessel was already damaged?
i concluded the damage was not so extensive as to interfere with the mission.
- i should point out that i lost my boat after maneuvering successfully out of the strait, into the open sea.
i had no radar as a result of damage on my original mission to saishu-to.
on the grounds that a transit of the strait seemed to exceed the permissible scope of our assignment.
but you are aware now that adm. lockwood never expressly prohibited such a mission and that capt. abbot was unable to radio for instructions?
mr. landon, i know this may be distasteful to you but as next ranking officer, i must ask you do you have any reason to believe that capt. abbott was guilty of any negligence or dereliction of duty?
sir, that's a conclusion that you're asking of me, not facts.
there's the report of the board of investigation in the loss of the starfish.
they concluded that your actions were justified and they've recommended no further proceedings.
but we cannot achieve victory until we isolate the home island from their main source of coal, iron and food on the continent of asia.
it is your mission, gentlemen, to demonstrate to the japanese people that even their warlord's private lake is fair fishing for the american navy.
i was just telling them how we lost the starfish on your last patrol.
if you're done with your coffee and done telling war stories would you mind making up a position report?
in our relations with other people, we mainly discuss and evaluate their character and behavior.
that is why i have withdrawn from nearly all so-called relations.
it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science.
i have a son, also a doctor, who lives in lund.
i'm going by car anyway, and you can do as you damn well please.
i happen to be grown-up and needn't take orders from you.
he should have paid it back when he became an associate professor.
it's a matter of honor for him to pay back 5,000 a year, and so on, and so on.
perhaps i got a little tired and felt a bit sad.
it's not impossible that i began to think of this and that, associated with places where i played as a child.
and he only wants to kiss in the dark, and he talks about sin.
he's on such a terribly high level, and i feel so worthless.
but sometimes it seems to me that i'm a lot older than isak, if you know what i mean.
and then i think he's a child, although we're the same age.
and sigfrid is so bold and exciting, and i want to go home.
i don't want to be here all summer and be an object of ridicule for the twins and all of you.
during lunch i was in good spirits and told the young people about my years as district medical officer.
my stories were quite a success, and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy.
i had wine with the lunch, and then port with the coffee.
ah, when creation shows so much beauty, how radiant must be its source!
he is going to be a minister, and viktor a doctor.
reciting poetry is against our agreement not to discuss god or science on this trip.
they started arguing about god, and then they lost their tempers.
and anders tried to twist viktor's arm, and viktor said that was a lousy argument for god's existence.
i dozed off, but was haunted by vivid and humiliating dreams.
there was something overpowering in these dream images that bored relentlessly into my mind.
but he doesn't mean a word he says because he's cold as ice.
and suddenly he gets very tender, and i scream at him that he's mad
my life has been full of hard work, and i am grateful.
it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science.
but i shall say plenty to myself about selfish, crabby old men who never think of those who have served them faithfully for 40 years.
incredible that i have put up... with your bossing for so long.
i had a stupid idea that you might help evald and me.
so i asked to stay with you for a week or two.
it's not impossible that i began to think of this and that, associated with places where i played as a child.
i don't know how it happened, but the day's clear reality dissolved into the even clearer images of memory that appeared before my eyes with the strength of a true stream of events.
he wants us to read poetry and talk about the next life and play four-handed piano.
and he only wants to kiss in the dark, and he talks about sin.
and then i think he's a child, although we're the same age.
and sigfrid is so bold and exciting, and i want to go home.
i was overwhelmed by feelings of emptiness and sadness, but was soon awakened from my reveries
by the voice of a young girl asking me repeatedly about something.
my stories were quite a success, and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy.
i had wine with the lunch, and then port with the coffee.
ah, when creation shows so much beauty, how radiant must be its source!
he is going to be a minister, and viktor a doctor.
well, you must go now, or you'll be late for the ceremony.
i am very glad you came, and i hope to see you again.
then they told me to shut up because i didn't understand the debate, so i left.
they went up the hill to fight it out because each insisted... the other had hurt his innermost feelings.
many forget a woman who has been dead for 30 years.
some cherish a sweet and fading picture, but you can recall this scene at any time.
then he says he'll get me a sedative and that he understands everything quite well.
and i tell him it's his fault that i am as i am.
with these simple flowers we want to say that we are very impressed that you've been a doctor for 50 years.

our relations with other people mainly consist of discussing and judging our neighbours' character and behaviour.
for me, this has led to a voluntary withdrawal from virtually all so-called social intercourse.
owing to this, i have become somewhat lonely in my old age.
the days of my life have been full of hard work, and for this i'm grateful.
what began as a struggle to make a living ended in a passion for a science.
i have a son, who also is a doctor and lives in lund.
he's been married for many years, but it's a childless marriage.
my mother is still alive, and full of energy despite her great age.
you can come in the car, or take the plane - whichever pleases you.
for a whole year i've been looking forward to this ceremony.
i'm taking the car, and you can do what the blazes you want!
i happen to be an adult so i don't need to put up with your commands, miss agda.
"i've no respect for mental suffering, so don't come to me for sympathy."
"if you're in need of mental masturbation, i can find you a shrink."
perhaps i was a bit tired and felt a trifle melancholy.
it's not inconceivable that i came to think of a thing or two associated with the places where we played as children.
you can put your luggage in the boot, if that's convenient.
i really should tell isak that anders and i are going steady.
i may have to seduce viktor to put him out of the running.
i'd better inform isak that i'm a virgin, hence my sauciness.
she was so convincing that we believed her rather than the doctors!
you may be overwrought, but why don't you leave your wife be.
"surely i'm the doctor here," i said to the old hag!
during lunch, which was a great success, i became elated and told the youngsters of my years as district doctor.
i had wine with my food and then port with my coffee.
when so much beauty in each vein of life and nature is contained, how beauteous will the source not be, forever clear!
the signs are there, wherever a force emerges a flower smells softly, the wind in a field surges
in the sigh i heave, the air i breathe, his charity is present
no, you must leave now, so you have time for everything you need to do.
i'm very grateful for your visit, and hope to see you again some time.
he'll say he'll fetch me something calming and that he fully understands the situation.
i'll tell him it's his fault that i am as i am.
i don't want any ties that force me to live a day longer than i choose.
you know i'm serious - it's not hysteria as you first thought.
it's impressive that you're old enough to have been a doctor for fifty years.
we do realise that you are a very wise old man who knows a lot about life, and has learnt the entire manual by heart.
if i have been feeling worried or sad during the day
i have a habit of recalling scenes from childhood to calm me.
my life has been full of hard work, and i am grateful.
it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science.

during lunch i was in good spirits and told the young people about my years as district medical officer.
my stories were quite a success, and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy.
i had wine with the lunch, and then port with the coffee.
ah, when creation shows so much beauty, how radiant must be its source!
he is going to be a minister, and viktor a doctor.
reciting poetry is against our agreement not to discuss god or science on this trip.
well, you must go now, or you'll be late for the ceremony.
i am very glad you came, and i hope to seeyou again.
then they told me to shut up because i didn't understand the debate, so i left.
they went up the hill to fight it out because each insisted... the other had hurt his innermost feelings.
many forget a woman who has been dead for 30 years.
some cherish a sweet and fading picture, but you can recall this scene at any time.
then he says he'll get me a sedative and that he understands everything quite well.
and i tell him it's his fault that i am as i am.
with these simple flowers we want to say that we are very impressed that you've been a doctor for 50 years.
we know you must be a very wise old man who knows everything about life and has learned all the instructions by heart.
my life has been full of hard work, and i am grateful.
it began as toil for bread and butter and ended in a love for science.
but i shall say plenty to myself about selfish, crabby old men who never think of those who have served them faithfully for 40 years.
incredible that i have put up... with your bossing for so long.
i had a stupid idea that you might help evald and me.
so i asked to stay with you for a week or two.
it's not impossible that i began to think of this and that, associated with places where i played as a child.
i don't know how it happened, but the day's clear reality dissolved into the even clearer images of memory that appeared before my eyes with the strength of a true stream of events.
he wants us to read poetry and talk about the next life and play four-handed piano.
and he only wants to kiss in the dark, and he talks about sin.
and then i think he's a child, although we're the same age.
and sigfrid is so bold and exciting, and i want to go home.
i was overwhelmed by feelings of emptiness and sadness, but was soon awakened from my reveries
by the voice of a young girl asking me repeatedly about something.
my stories were quite a success, and i don't think they laughed merely out of courtesy.
i had wine with the lunch, and then port with the coffee.
ah, when creation shows so much beauty, how radiant must be its source!

chan ho-nam, you can tell obviously that your fellows are making troubles
paul, simon, as being professional lawyers, can you tell me who is right and who is wrong?

i have reason to suspect him as being a triad member
i just want to go straight, and i don't want to do anything with the triads again
but you should get triad's cover to sell newspaper in street

i don't think i can't make a living without sticking to triads
we would like the chairman of our club to hand over the cheque
mr. chiang, i can't imagine a club can do charity deed like this
that's why i talked to lam and got a very good idea, that is to bid a new mini-bus route from central to jordan
you know, when the new airport is used, the terminal in jordan will be prosperous
at first, we said we would join together to run the route, but he isn't the one to figure this plan out
lam and i would like to bid a new route, from kwai chung to jordan and then to western district,

"i want the public to know that the district attorney, bernard butler, is a fool,

because the victim is always a woman, a married woman who is afraid to press charges.
either that or some other woman for an alibi, some sweet trusting thing who swears you weren't there and couldn't have done it.
maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea for you to see one.
well, if you hear of a pretty one, let me know.

just the horizon, on which the glances of the passers-by get stuck upon.
an enormous bed, where the sky embraces the earth without stopping his breath.
a wind of craziness which swept away all the trash from the earth.
and on these lonely plains like sheep with wool made of steel the thistles of poverty seemed to laugh at the people and animals.
for some of them their dream ends when the wind stops blowing.
they will not go on and wrestle the world, like the others which will continue their journey, stirred up by the hope of a brighter life.
the road is hard: it burns your soles and weakens your knees.
not even 7 oxen would move me from here, if it wasn't for you.
matache, now that we are rich let's treat ourselves to a little something.
give us some bread, a sausage and... some of this sugar-on-a-rope for the boy.
the holy spirit, protector of the poor, from the story, will help us.
she's known for helping other lunatics that ventured in the baragan.
they tried to force me to work, that's why i hurried out of there.
here, you don't have anything to steal, even if you're desperately hungry.
because tanase is a poor peasant, and because he has mouths to feed.
because he is hugely in debt to the boyar, and can only repay him by breaking his back.
you haven't seen me in 3 weeks and you already forgot about me.
didn't we agree that you first gather the corn and forage for my cattle, and you gather yours after?
i came to tell you... she came back because she was afraid you'd get killed.
when a person is dear to you you run and live with him.
my dad's eyes were ripped from his sockets by some boyar's dogs.
and before that my mom died because the doctor didn't come to see her.
you have always been good to us and you've pulled us through hard times, hunger and poverty.
and with this sickness that has settled in our home you are now highly in debt and the boyar goes out of his way to make you leave tudorita.
where have you seen bread and bacon in the last 2 years?
if you hang around those who eat bread, tell them to send us some wheat.
i am very saddened by the empty places at the table.
i would've liked to see more people eating and celebrating on this little occasion.
we have enough troubles, we don't need to go to trials.
since you want to talk to us, tell us, where is this justice you talk about?
and they don't need any prisoners, just like they didn't need them in moldavia.
whoever feels hotheaded and wants to start a ruckus in the country, is welcome to do so!

barton, will you show me on the model... the point from which you'll make your attack?
after the two groups have accomplished their missions... they will rendezvous 24 hours later at bir el sidi.
they will then proceed to crown city... where sgt. evans will be waiting with the camels to bring you back.
anybody can kill at a distance... with the same sort of courage that a man shoots rabbits.
when it comes to the dirty work, you have to call in the civilian.
you're not the sort of man, brand, who'd kill for his woman.
but you'd murder... to stop her from finding out that you're a coward, wouldn't you?
i think i can assure you that gen. rommel is shortly going to find himself... in a very delicate situation.
and i have the authority and pleasure... to award to the man who led you, maj. david brand... the distinguished service order.

and all the characters i've ever played pass in front of me.
and i'm every one of them, but that's all i am.
well, if you're not gonna hire me for this new play of yours,
i'm afraid you're going to have to take care of me in some other fashion.
well, just a small one, of course, just to keep body and soul together.
otherwise, i'm afraid i'm going to be forced to tell some of our more talkative columnists about that little incident in philadelphia.
i had it all neatly tucked away in the back of my mind, where it wouldn't bother me.
i made a fine new world where i could be proud instead of ashamed.
when you get there, wait and see, it'll just pour out.
maybe if i had a drink, just one, just to strengthen...
the cream of the jest is a play about the theatrical business.
and it has as its central character a fading actor named charles hanover gresham.
gee, mr. gresham, i'd like to, but i'm afraid i can't.
now, you're not gonna tell me the well has run dry?
that's what you said the last time, and the time before that.
that's why i hired you, because you needed the job so badly.
you know, jerry, that's what's the matter with these modern playwrights.
most of the time, they're full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
it's been a long time since i've had to remember back to the way i began.
i had it all neatly tucked away in the back of my mind, where it wouldn't bother me.
i made a fine new world where i could be proud instead of ashamed.
sometimes, i think it was nine-tenths willpower and about one-tenth talent.
you know, if you played that part, it would be the cream of the jest, wouldn't it?
it'd be the first time a blackmailer ever earned his money.
but i'm warning you, that 20 bucks isn't just another handout.
i'm going to see that it's deducted from your first week's salary, if you get the part, that is.
and all the characters i've ever played pass in front of me.

my money and his life and we're both going to keep what we've got.
come on, dooley, you've still got time to catch that stage.
maybe i don't want to see him show up at that canyon tomorrow.
you want to scrape him off the bottom of the canyon, is that it?
i've been trying to save enough money to get out of this town.
i can't afford to turn down marquette's deal and neither can anybody else.
dooley, i made that $3,000 last week and i worked hard for it.
but i'd rather lose it right here and now then see you lose your life trying to do something you can't possibly do.
now, as you know, ireland is a quiet little island of about 4 million population.

'let us take a look at the police barracks at balena loch.'
'for although we are a very peace-loving people' 'we still have, believe it or not, police barracks.'

the police warrant in his pocket laying heavy on his heart.
i haven't tasted a supper moonshine in a month of sundays.
you know, made the old way, with the smoke of the turf curling out of it.
there wasn't a man in the bar and he would've had a hundred songs in his heart.
but with the people going here, there and everywhere and off to canada, australia, america, south boston with the comin' of the automobiles a-a-and the films...

and then, right at the height of the festivities didn't his uncle from skibbereen drop dead on the floor.
the proof of that was seen when there were the doctors and the wise people together.
it wasn't to the doctors, people went there will be thinking.
out there on the hillside is the sure cure for every known disease.

in this box i have the sum of 10 pounds, 11 shillings and some odd pence.

for as many centuries as these stones have rested one upon the other.
even in country places the little old railroad is always the, uh, little old railroad.
the travel to market on it is still a great adventure.
and how i am to make a match for this boy, i don't know.
he never opens his mouth, but to put his foot in it.
if you are to put a pint of porter or a jar of malt in front of that boy there wouldn't be much of it left for the next man.
sure, it's only his youth and he'll grow out of it.
you can tell your tom dolan to come and fetch his own pocán.

who're you to be interferin' with the bishop's golden jubilee dinner?
how bad are some people that thinks themselves admirables be raisin' to the few brass buttons on their coats.

i suppose, i can, now, take it, mrs. folsey that we are in complete agreement as to the children's future happiness, what?
well, as man to man and friend to friend, we are.
i was wondering, like, uh but, how long have we been mocking' up together?
it was 11 years, 9 months and 3 days last tuesday.
i'm the wife of sergeant o'hara, i'll have you know trying to bring a bit of supper to me husband.
being stopped at every turn by people like you, with stripes.
on the coldest, dampest, loneliest place in the whole lot of those.
is that my supper, that should have been here two hours ago?
ah, but all i'm asking is a shilling or two for me ballad.
there are some sailors there who'll be coming ashore in a bit
kind, old friend of mine, a fine voice he had too.
what he used to sing best was "the rising of the moon."
do you mind if i explain something to you about nathaniel?
you see, when they took the boy, they killed his wife, too.
i am a long way from being a preacher, but i do know something about killing, and that's what you people are going to have to do tonight.
now, rightly or wrongly, the pawnees believe that boy belongs to them.
i don't know that answer, but if killing is wrong, especially tonight, then it's wrong for everybody, isn't it?
it's wrong for you, too, even to protect a few poor indians.
well, this is the night when some people pretend there's no evil in the world.
this is the one night of the year when the white man honors the children of his tribe.

all right, tie up your horses and get rid of your guns.

he had been dead about six months, i think, before she applied for the money.
she didn't know he had the policy until she came across it in his papers.
well, i'm sure you do, but i don't think that's such a good idea.
well, if i saw her alone i might be able to persuade her to sell it.
you know we decided we didn't want to be tied down.
this way we could make all the arrangements, before we go on our wedding trip.
mrs. gillespie was just telling me how she loved the house and i...
it's true, i expected to spend the rest of my life here, until i met howard.
well, i couldn't just stand by and see him murdered, could i?
joe, you have no more proof against this woman than you had before.
well, anyway, she's sure to want to sell the house before she goes.
by the time she can do that you'll have turned something up.
i can go out there and tell her who i am.
she may not be so anxious to go through with it if she knows we're onto her.
and they were all drowned in the bathtub on the honeymoon.
well, she's had two husbands who were both cremated before we could find out how she poisoned them.

i'd better fill in some of the details for those of you who were careless enough to miss the first episode.
before the detectives were quite settled down to work, they are faced with an embarrassingly oversupply of confessions.
for, both froy and lord sorrington confessed to a murder that only one of them could have committed.

for, both froy and lord sorrington confessed to a murder that only one of them could have committed.
she was frail to begin with and felt things more keenly than most of us do.
her distress over what helen had been through in italy made her seriously ill.
for a fortnight i listened to count mattoni's movements through those doors.
it soon became evident that he was incapably drunk every night by about 11:00.
so, last night, after i'd heard no sound for more than an hour,
i managed to slip the bolt on this side of the door and came in here.
i was afraid that someone might have heard the shot, so i didn't turn on the light in my flat and didn't see the shell case.
i left immediately afterwards and only remembered later that i had left the pistol behind.
he couldn't prove it, of course, but that wouldn't stop him.
it would get into all the papers and there'd be a big smell.
anyhow i snooped around here some at nights and had found that there were duplicate keys to the flats in the porters' lobby.
so last night, while the elevator was on a trip up,
confound it all, i've never had two people competing for a murder before.
well, that's what makes the work seem so interesting, isn't it, sir?
i felt too tired to dress so i ordered my dinner in my room.
then i read my book for a while and went to sleep.
but i promise you on my honor the truth will be out next time.
i've excused the actors until we return when they will present the final act of our play.

inspector davidson and his assistant raines, the investigating detectives, have uncovered a number of clues.

inspector davidson and his assistant raines, the investigating detectives, have uncovered a number of clues.
her distress over what helen had been through in italy made her seriously ill.
when mattoni came here, he insisted that helen go back to him, threatened the child if she didn't, threatened to sue for his custody.
oh, to begin with, i took the flat next door, as you know.
for a fortnight i listened to count mattoni's movements through those doors.
it soon became evident that he was incapably drunk every night by about 11:00.
one of the liftmen would come in later on and get him into bed.
so last night, while the elevator was on a trip up,
i got the key to this flat and slipped up the stairs.
then what was it doing empty on this floor at 2:00 this morning?
long enough for miss la lune to walk up four flights of stairs and go to her flat?
because it happens that in the count's wallet, found here on this floor, there were two banknotes with your fingerprints on them.
now you'd better tell me all you know about this murder and who you're shielding, and i want the truth.
if i were you, i'd avoid being unpleasant with this lad,
in a few hours, you will probably have to sleep with him.
but, dear, no man has ever thought of anything else when looking at you.
you inspire a very beautiful love, which you actually make very well,
inspector, i admire your composure but unfortunately, if you were in my place...
i wouldn't worry at all, you'll probably receive a letter from switzerland or italy, saying
i'm sorry, madam, but because of new developments in the investigation,
i'll have to go to your house and question everyone there.
he's the one that cut you loose like this, left you out here to dig your own graves?
it was either the baby and me or the whole wagon train.
well, there's something in latin hanging on her wall, but lady doctors ain't my idea...
now, look, there's a woman and a baby that need doctoring real bad.
now, what's this, my friend, about a woman and a baby?
some pebble-hearted wagon master left them on the edge of the desert out here to die.
he wanted me to jeopardize the lives of 50 people against two.
did you ask the 50 people about what they thought about it?
you know, i was the second woman to graduate from my medical school.
after me, there were others, but... well, it's difficult for us, but i think we'll finally be accepted as something better than freaks.
are you people going to let this man sentence a woman and a baby to death?
we'll bring you what you need, mr. paladin, but you ain't bringing them in.
you may be able to keep them out of your community, but you'll carry your sickness with you wherever you go.
as long as you live, you'll die every time you see a baby smile.
it'll burn away the seeds that clara benson has spread among us.
it will scourge the disease from our souls and bodies and purify our homes once again.
clara benson never had a trace of typhoid and the doctor says the baby's out of danger.
o, how thou art fallen from heaven, o, lucifer, to plague us with this villain's falsehoods.
i'm nice to people where it pays me to be nice.
i do it enough on the outside, so don't expect me to do it in my office.
and what business is it of yours what they do, this boy and girl...
if you knew hunsecker like i do, you might understand why it is my business.
you were crossing hollywood boulevard and you got hit by one.
and you had to go to the hospital to get it removed.
i want my relationship with her to remain at least at par.
i don't intend to do anything to antagonise her if i don't have to.
i'm the first to admit it didn't jell as fast as we'd like.
but why, all of a sudden, can't i get you on the phone?
he's like the gag-you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy.
that's what my beef with leo bartha was about. "leo," i says, "jj froze me out."
an amusing boy, but you haven't got a drop of respect in you for anything alive.
you're so immersed in a theology of making a fast buck.
i'm not here to sell anything and i'm not gonna peddle anything.
but when i tell a client i can get him space in hunsecker's column, it's not talk.
if i run over, i'll cut some items off the tail.
"from washington through jefferson, from lincoln and fdr, right up to today, the democratic way of life."
i'd take a baseball bat and break it over his head.
sidney lives so much in moral twilight, that when i said you were coming here, he predicted disaster.
are you telling me i think of this in terms of personal pique?
today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of 60 million people in the greatest country in the world.
don't you know how my brother's gonna see you after tonight?
you're gonna be the man who... drove his beloved little sister to suicide.
visit me when i'm not writing your brother's column and i'll revise that delicate outlook of life.
to give credit where credit is due, that body of yours deserves a better fate than tumbling off some terrace.
i took it for granted that you heard about it around town.
you're not gonna like this, but they picked him up on a marijuana rap.
sorry to bother you, but a bad mistake has been made.
jj, you've got such contempt for people, it makes you stupid.
but also in the sense that you are a personal liar too, because you don't do the work i pay you for.
when i spoke to jj last night... i wish i could help in some way, sidney.
i'm nice to people where it pays me to be nice.
i do it enough on the outside, so don't expect me to do it in my office.
i was so taken aback, i said anything that popped into my sleepy head.
if i'm not mistaken, i think i even ordered the man out of his own house.
he's got nothin' against me, he says, only he can't afford to antagonise columnists.
so i tell him how i still have sonny at the military academy...
i often wish i were deaf and wore a hearing aid.
with a flick of the switch, i could shut out the greedy murmur of little men.
the day i can't get along without a press agent's handouts,
i'll close up shop and move to alaska, lock, stock and barrel.
if i'm gonna go out on a limb for you, you gotta know what's involved.
my right hand hasn't seen my left hand in 30 years.
look, otis, if you're trying to blow this into an item for your column, forget it.
by the way, what's this i hear about jj giving you the flit-gun treatment?
but he happens to be keeping company with jj's screwball sister.
it's a real goody, if, like me, you wanna clobber jj.
you're so immersed in a theology of making a fast buck.
not that i don't sometimes feel that you yearn for something better.
oh, i don't mind you seeing the column in advance, so long as jj doesn't know.
but don't do it like a little boy stealing gum from a slot machine.
look, nobody believes in a press agent, temple, if he makes claims he can't produce.
i'm not here to sell anything and i'm not gonna peddle anything.
i said you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
i thought you might have a faint idea how that item originated.
i say to the judge "i didn't murder the man", but the judge says to me "why not you? "
there's only two men who could be responsible for that smear:
but neither do i agree with the column, that you smoke marijuana and belong with the reds.
also, since we're talking repulsive, jj won't like this for two cents.
i'm here as an average joe who happens to love your sister.
well, just be careful you don't knock her off her feet, hm?
tell me, sir, when he dies do you think he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
let's forget about dogs and cats and all that pseudo-literary junk.
as i see it, if susie had stood behind him today, he might have proved a threat.
but since primarily he's wedded to his work, he's not gonna be able to take it.
sidney, this syrup you're giving out, you pour over waffles, not jj hunsecker.
what do you mean, this lousy kid'll give up my sister?
am i supposed to forget how that kid talked to me today?
jj, is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you?
today that boy wiped his feet on the choice, on the predilections of 60 million people in the greatest country in the world.
if you had any morals, you'd understand the immorality of that boy's stand today.
not if you gave me a column would i do a thing...
who do you think writes the column while susie and i are away for three months?
don't you know how my brother's gonna see you after tonight?
you're gonna be the man who... drove his beloved little sister to suicide.
visit me when i'm not writing your brother's column and i'll revise that delicate outlook of life.
to give credit where credit is due, that body of yours deserves a better fate than tumbling off some terrace.
you're not gonna like this, but they picked him up on a marijuana rap.
and is that why you put your hands on my sister?
- but, sidney - - "but." but - but - but what?
that makes five days in a row mr. hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
i'm nice to people where it pays me to be nice.
look, i do it enough on the outside, so don't expect me to do it in my own office.
i thought you said that your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker.
yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge... and frankly, i'm glad - for steve's sake, not yours.
come to think of it, what business is it of yours what they do, this boy and girl?
if you knew hunsecker as well as i did... you might understand why it is my business.
this is such an interesting fusion of the traditional form with the new progressive style.
i just wanted to ask how you came to form the group.
what did you expect he was gonna do in his apartment?
but sidney, sweetheart, the man musta been out of his mind.
susie, j.j. happens to be one of my very best friends.
i know, but someday i'd like to look into your clever little mind... and see what you really think of him.
come on, i'm just gonna have to laugh at that - an attractive girl like you.
i hope j.j. likes steve, that he isn't just putting on an act.
harvey, i often wish i were deaf and wore a hearing aid.
with a simple flick of the switch, i could shut out the greedy murmur of little men.
but the one i like - the really cute one - is the quick, dependable chap.
nothing he won't do for you in a pinch... so he says.
i want my relationship with her to remain at least at par.
i don't intend to do anything to antagonize her if i don't have to.
now, don't begrudge it to me, j.j. i owe him a lot of favors.
i think you understand that the dallas skull is badly dented.
you're an amusing boy... but you haven't got a drop of respect in you for anything alive.
you're so immersed... in a theology of making a fast buck.
look, nobody believes in a press agent, temple... if, uh, if he makes claims he can't produce.
i'm not here to try to sell anything, and i'm not gonna peddle anything.
if i run over, i'll cut some items off the tail.
"from washington through jefferson... from lincoln and f.d.r. right up to today... the democratic way of life - that's what the man said.
as a matter of fact, i'll have plenty to say about smears on my show today.
and that's why i'd - well, i'd like your personal assurance too.
i'm here as an average joe who happens to love your sister.
well, just be careful you don't knock her off her feet, hmm?
when he dies, do you think he'll go to the dog-and-cat heaven?
look, let's forget about dogs and cats and all that pseudo-literary junk.
my whole interest, if it's not too late, is in susie... and how to undo what you've done to her.
and what have i done to her except not buy her a new fur coat lately?
am i supposed to forget how that kid talked to me today?
j.j., is he worthy of a second glance from a man like you?
are you telling me i think of this in terms of personal pique?
don't you see that today that boy wiped his feet on the choice... and the predilections of 60 million men and women... in the greatest country in the world?
j.j., i swear to you on my mother's life, i wouldn't do that.
not if you gave me a column would i do a thing -
don't you know how my brother's gonna see you after tonight?
you're gonna be the man who... drove his beloved little sister to suicide.
to give credit where credit is due, susie... that body of yours deserves a better fate than tumbling off some terrace.
susie... a bed is the best friend a girl ever had.
you're not gonna like this, but they, uh, they picked him up on a marijuana rap.
and is that why you put your hands... on my sister?
i'm nice to people where it pays me to be nice.
i do it enough on the outside, so don't expect me to do it in my office.
you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
i thought you said your boy was washed up with susie hunsecker?
i often wish i were deaf and wore a hearing aid.

in brief, from now on... the best of everything is good enough for me.

- [show music] - [man] i said, "figo, i'm not sellin' ya a dozen eggs.
i'm sellin' ya herbie temple, so don't give me any of your lip."
you mind if i ask an impertinent question, with no criticism intended?
of course, al, i know you earn your 10 percent... but how can you let a sock act like herbie temple... tiptoe through town without a publicity build?
if i run over, i'll cut some items off the tail.

and he was a democrat running in a traditionally republican district.
but he was also the fifth cousin of the most popular man in america, the ex-president of the united states, theodore roosevelt.
i asked him why, and he replied, 'because you don't show your teeth.'" but he did.
he was already a top-notch salesman because he wouldn't immediately enter into a topic of politics when he met a party.
he stopped by the white house for the first time since leaving it 11/2 years earlier.
president william howard taft and his wife were out of town.
roosevelt remembered every servant and gardener by name, asked about their families, and exclaimed over a piece of the corn bread he'd especially loved while living at the white house, brought to him hot from the kitchen.
when he was shown into the handsome new oval office that had been built over the old tennis court, he strode across the room and sat down in the president's chair.
and the greatest mistake that he ever made was to relinquish power when he had it.
and leaving at the height of his powers as the youngest former president was a ruinously ludicrous thing for him to do.
with his handsome face and his form of supple strength he could make a fortune on the stage and set the matinee girl's heart throbbing with subtle and happy emotion.
but no one would suspect behind that highly polished exterior the quiet force and determination that now are sending shivers down the spine of tammany's striped mascot.
theodore roosevelt had made his reputation by embarrassing the bosses of his own republican party.
franklin lost no time in taking on the new york city democratic machine, tammany hall.
fdr did everything he could think of to make himself seem like tr, in albany.
he, he really was a sort of caricature of a caricature of, of tr for quite a while.
and just like the boys at groton and harvard, the professional politicians in albany couldn't stand him.
when the political boss of the bowery saw franklin's name on the list of democratic newcomers, he said, "well, if we've caught a roosevelt",
meanwhile, a seat in the united stated senate for new york had opened up.
in those days, u.s. senators were still chosen by their state legislatures.
and the outnumbered republicans had agreed not to put up a fight.
but a band of 21 reform-minded democrats had resolved to block sheehan with a nominee of their own.
franklin joined their ranks, and because he alone was wealthy enough to rent a house in albany...
the rebels met in its library each morning, producing so much blue cigar smoke that eleanor had to move the children to the top floor.
the press found the idea of a new roosevelt repeating his celebrated cousin's albany battles irresistible.
"it's the most humanly interesting political fight for many years," wrote the albany stringer for the "new york herald," louis howe.
and might have gone on even longer if a fire hadn't gutted the state capitol building, requiring the weary and impatient democrats to caucus in cramped quarters across the street.
finally, the tammany boss named a new candidate, an irish-american judge every bit as pliant as sheehan.
i have just returned from a big fight, a fight that went 64 rounds, and there was fighting every second of those 64 rounds.
this fight was a free-for-all, and many on the other side got good and battered.
public service, whether my husband was in or out of office, was to be part of our daily life from now on.
eleanor was fascinated by the sheehan battle and pleased at her own ability to function apart from her mother-in-law in a wholly new world.
franklin roosevelt battled hard for a direct primary that would have allowed voters, not bosses, to choose their senators, but then backed away at the last minute from a reform charter for new york city.
after a fire at the triangle shirtwaist company killed 146 women, a special commission produced a flood of 32 reform bills.
roosevelt voted for all of them, but when the most hotly contested vote came...
on a bill setting a 50-hour-per-week work limit for women and children...
and throughout, he maintained an earnest, pious air, compounded by what one observer remembered as
"the unfortunate habit... so natural that he was unaware of it... of throwing his head up, which,
those state parties controlled their state legislatures, which were, in turn, controlled by the interests...
banks in new york, timber in michigan, copper in montana, and rail roads everywhere.
the man who wrongly holds that every human right is second to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare, who rightly maintains that every man holds his property subject to the general right of the community
to regulate its use to whatever degree the public welfare may require it.
state party machines still picked most delegates to the republican convention, but a dozen states would hold direct primaries that year.
if roosevelt could demonstrate in those that voters overwhelmingly wanted him, he reasoned, the bosses would be unable to resist.
one evening, a reporter came upon an exhausted taft aboard his train.
"roosevelt was my closest friend," the president said, and began to weep.
but just as edith had predicted, when the party met in the chicago coliseum in june, the old guard regulars in charge were immovable.
they awarded all but 19 of the 254 contested delegates to taft.
if they wished to form a third party and have him make the fight, he told them,
"i will make it, even if only one state should support me."
many of his closest friends thought he was making a terrible mistake.
i don't think you can say it was a mistake because he would have exploded from unspent energy if he hadn't done it.
and there's nothing wrong with every once in a while saying that two parties aren't responsive to a rising sentiment in the country.
the two-party system is an excellent thing but it is not graven on the heart of man by the finger of god.
i think it's fair to say that teddy roosevelt also had a public spirit that caused him to move.
tr as a student of lincoln's career knows that the republican party was just invented as this strange third party in 1854.
both parties were, were stalling and they are stuck with, you know, party bosses and the issues of a past generation.
a third party was needed to bring the crucial issues to the forefront.
limit the work day to 8 hours and the work week to 6 days;
and to provide federal insurance for the elderly, the jobless, and the sick.
when he decides what the people as a whole can and cannot do, the people should have the right to recall that decision if they think that it is wrong."
he truly had come to believe that the progressive agenda would save this country from a bloody social revolution of the kind that would occur in russia.
roosevelt was confident he could beat taft, but his hope of defeating the democrats rested on their picking what he called "a reactionary."
and two of the 3 leading candidates were just the kind of opponents he'd hoped for.
but after 46 exhausting ballots at their convention in baltimore, the democrats settled on woodrow wilson, the former president of princeton university and governor of new jersey.
he'd only been in politics two years, but he appealed to reformers because he'd beaten his own party machine to pass progressive legislation in his state.
nothing new is happening in politics except mr. roosevelt, who is always new, being bound by nothing in the heavens above or in the earth below.
he is now rampant and very diligently employed in splitting his party wide open...
but i wish franklin could be fighting now for uncle ted, for i feel he is in the party of the future.
franklin would be unable to fight for himself or anyone else that fall.
that fall, the same red maxwell that had introduced franklin roosevelt to his constituents two years earlier prowled dutchess county again in search of votes...
but this time it was carrying a very different kind of passenger.
he latched on to franklin roosevelt and he was able to tell roosevelt when he was wrong.
he was really the only person who ever could do that consistently.
when he met him in 1911, he actually put aside a bottle of sherry and said that he would open it after roosevelt became president.
and he decided when no one else in his right mind would have thought so, except possibly roosevelt, that he should be president of the united stated
he shook hundreds of hands, promised jobs on behalf of the candidate wherever he could, and introduced a shrewd innovation...
mimeographed "personalized" letters to farmers, fishermen, and apple growers, promising each group special legislation.
and tr sometimes delivered 30 whistle-stop speeches a day, shadow-boxing through the caboose to maintain his energy before stepping out onto the platform.
again and again, he denounced his democratic opponent as a secret advocate of state's rights, a false progressive masquerading as a friend of strong federal government.
called only for their regulation, while wilson's "new freedom" seemed to suggest that he would actually break them up.
in my dream, i saw president mckinley sit up in his coffin pointing at a man in monk's attire in whom i recognized theodore roosevelt.
theodore roosevelt was in milwaukee standing in his open automobile in front of the gilpatric hotel, waving his hat to the crowd.
a delusional german immigrant named john schrank, standing just 7 feet away, aimed a pistol at his chest.
he had been stalking roosevelt for a month, convinced the ghost of william mckinley was directing his hand.
the bullet passed through the ex-president's spectacles case and the folded 50-page speech behind it, smashed through his chest wall, and lodged in a splintered rib less than a quarter of an inch from his heart.
"i did not care a rap for being shot," he later told a friend.
"it is a trade risk which every prominent man should accept as a matter of course."
friends, i shall ask you to be as quiet as possible.
i don't know whether you fully understand that i have just been shot.
the bullet is in me now, so that i cannot make a very long speech, but i will try my best.
and now, friends, this effort to assassinate me emphasizes to a peculiar degree the need of the progressive movement.
"could have influenced as many americans as were stirred by the shot of a madman."
he was out of action and under his wife's strict care for almost two weeks.
woodrow wilson won the presidency with only 42% of the vote, and his party gained control of both the senate and the house for the first time in almost two decades.
there is no use disguising the fact that the defeat at the polls is overwhelming.
i had expected defeat, but i had expected that we would make a better showing.
i try not to think of the damage to myself personally.
he was so used to being popular and loved and then he's suddenly a pariah.
alice used to say that there is a melancholy that ran through the roosevelt family.
he was surprised by the defeat but also by the enormity of the defeat.
i mean, he had, he had lost by quite a bit and just hadn't expected it.
he was brave about it in public and quite sad about it in private.
mrs. roosevelt wrote one of the children who was away that "father spends more time on horseback"
franklin and eleanor went to washington for woodrow wilson's inauguration, where josephus daniels, the new secretary of the navy, sought franklin out.
roosevelt had been an early supporter of the new democratic president.
i was very much pleased that you were appointed as assistant secretary of the navy.
it is interesting to see that you are at another place which i myself once held.
franklin leave the state senate for washington as republican bosses had been to see theodore roosevelt run for vice president 14 years before.
franklin roosevelt was just 31, the youngest assistant secretary of the navy in history,
the new assistant secretary had attended groton and harvard, learned to sail aboard his father's yacht, and, like his cousin theodore, believed in a strong defense and a big navy.
josephus daniels was a newspaper editor from north carolina who called battleships "boats,"
seemed most concerned with banning wine from officers' messes throughout the fleet, and was a close ally of wilson's secretary of state
william jennings bryan, who believed strong defenses were a provocation and promised that the united stated would never go to war on his watch.
tr had spent the first few nights of his presidency there and afterwards had walked there so often to talk things over with his shrewd sister that the press called it the "little white house."
it would be franklin roosevelt's headquarters for the next several crowded, frenetic years.
my calls began in the autumn of 1914 under poor auspices, for i was feeling miserable again, as another baby was coming along.
somehow or other i made my rounds every afternoon, and from 10 to 30 calls were checked off on my list day after day.
louis howe guarded the home-like outer office, seeing to details, screening admirals and ordinary visitors with the same brusque air, and always making sure the press heard what his boss was doing.
when franklin is assistant secretary of the navy, as theodore was, he first is associating with his prep school chums and various people from his social class who he, he meets with.
and as time goes on he, he ends up spending more time with labor leaders, ship-builders, ordinary people who made something of themselves.
he started to realize the folks who actually got things done, made things happen.
he affected a navy cape and designed an official assistant secretary's flag for himself.
and whenever he could get away to his summer home on campobello island, he liked to come and go by destroyer, guiding the big warship through the narrows with his own sure hand at the wheel.
the lofty and matted forest rose like a green wall on either hand.
the trees were stately and beautiful, the looped and twisted vines hung from them like great ropes.
after theodore roosevelt's defeat as the progressive party's candidate for president in 1912, he undertook another great adventure...
an expedition into the amazon rainforest to chart the course of a newly discovered jungle waterway.
it was a series of 6 falls, the final of which was 30 feet.
and colonel rondon, who had spent half of his life in the rainforest, said,
i saw that if i did end my life, that would only make it more sure that kermit would not get out.
for i knew he would not abandon me, but would insist on bringing my body out, too.
kermit's weeks of working alongside the expedition's porters and paddlers paid off.
he used his engineering skill to lower the dugouts down the steep canyon walls, and kept his men moving forward.
a deep gorge and an apparently impassable series of new rapids stretched on ahead.
theodore was helpless now, forced to be paddled along beneath a makeshift tent.
finally, on april 26, after a month and a half in the wilderness, they came upon a 6-man relief party that had been sent to help them out of the rainforest.
here's roosevelt so ill, and he looks up and he sees on this bank the brazilian flag and the flag of the united stated of america.
and he knows that they're gonna be ok, that they're saved.
the river of doubt, which turned out to be almost half as long as the rhine, was renamed "rio roosevelt."
new yorkers gave roosevelt another big welcome when he returned home, but friends were shocked by his appearance.
he had lost 55 pounds... roughly a quarter of his weight...
could barely make himself heard when speaking, and leaned on a cane he bravely called "my big stick."
as he limped down the companionway, the impression was strong that the colonel had endured the greatest hardships of his life.
it is not a good thing for a country to have a professional yodeler, a human trombone like mr. bryan as secretary of state, nor a college president like mr. wilson as head of the nation, with a hypocritical ability to deceive plain people
and no real knowledge or wisdom concerning internal and international affairs.
in early august of 1914, 5 weeks after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo,
germany declared war on russia and france and sent troops across the belgian border.
he is bewildered by it all, very sweet but very sad.
i am not surprised at what you say about mr. daniels for one could expect little else.
all of the roosevelts sided with england and her allies from the moment the first gun was fired.
"even i long to go over into the thick of it and right the wrong," franklin told an old british friend.
in a recent speech, he'd said that when it came down to a struggle between "popular rights and corrupt and machine-ruled government"
the interests of the republican and democratic bosses of new york were "fundamentally identical."
during the 1911 senate battle over billy sheehan, he'd seen collusion between the bosses of both parties firsthand and was more than willing to say so in court on behalf of the man who continued to be his hero.
when a lawyer asked franklin what relation he was to the former president, he grinned.
"fifth cousin by blood," he said proudly, "and nephew by law!"
"i shall never forget the capital way in which you gave your testimony,"
a german submarine had sunk the british passenger ship "lusitania" off the coast of ireland.
more than 1,100 men, women, and children had drowned, including 128 american citizens.
this represents not merely piracy, but piracy on a vaster scale of murder than the old-time pirates ever practiced.
it seems inconceivable that we can refrain from taking action in this matter, for we owe it not only to humanity but to our own national self-respect.
it took the jurors two days, but in the end, all 12 of them exonerated roosevelt, who went right back on the attack.
there is a chance of our going to war, but i don't think it is very much of a chance.
wilson and bryan are cordially supported by all the hyphenated americans, by the solid flub-dub and pacifist vote.
every soft creature, every coward and weakling, every man who can't look more than 6 inches ahead, every man whose god is money, or pleasure, or ease is enthusiastically in favor of wilson;
but it also was visceral in the sense that he didn't like the presbyterian moralist, just struck teddy roosevelt as, i think, part of the effeminacy that he associated with a commercial republic.
wilson declared, "there is such a thing as being too proud to fight"
he complained again and again about secretary daniels being that further infuriated theodore roosevelt.
but the president also agreed to double the defense budget in the interest of what wilson now called "preparedness."
and surreptitiously slipped damaging information about his boss and the administration's defense efforts to the ranking republican on the house military affairs committee.
if the public ever turned on the administration for having been too slow in preparing for war, he was determined he would not be blamed.
and he shared his cousin theodore's conviction that the united stated not only would... but should...
hyde park was very definitely my most favorite place in life.
it was their grandmother's home at hyde park that represented a sanctuary from their parents' increasingly turbulent world.
in 1915, sara delano roosevelt greatly expanded springwood to accommodate them and the nurses and maids that traveled with them.
the house now included so many bedrooms she sometimes called it "our hotel."
the renovated first floor, modeled after the country houses of the roosevelts' aristocratic friends in england, was meant to be a showcase for her son and his collections...
but it remained her mother-in-law's home, she remembered many years later, and, "i was only a visitor."
sara delano roosevelt was a very great mother and a very tough mother-in-law.
the kind of love eleanor had never known when she was a girl and now found hard to provide to her own children.
up to a point it is good for us to know that there are people in the world who will give us love and unquestioned loyalty.
"i was always just getting over a baby or about to have another" was over.
she was ready to resume a life of her own, to find a new kind of fulfillment, on her own terms.
on june 14, 1916, with the nominating conventions just weeks away, president wilson led a preparedness parade up pennsylvania avenue from the capitol to the white house...
and made sure that theodore roosevelt's young democratic cousin was marching with him.
the navy department made an excellent showing in the parade, and when i passed the reviewing stand
i was sent for to join the president in the stand and spend the next 4 hours there!
it would be a mistake to re-nominate me in 1916 unless the country has in its mood something of the heroic...
unless it feels not only devotion to ideals but the purpose to realize those ideals in action.
theodore roosevelt hoped somehow to obtain both the progressive and the republican presidential nominations that year.
but the old guard of his old party had not forgiven him for 1912.
and while most americans sympathized with britain and france and now supported preparedness, they still remained reluctant to get involved in a far-away war.
the republicans chose instead the austere, mildly progressive supreme court justice charles evans hughes.
roosevelt and the progressives had championed had already become law thanks to woodrow wilson's shrewd political skills...
a new antitrust statute, workmen's compensation, a ban on most child labor, a federal reserve board and federal trade commission.
the battle lines had been frozen for nearly 3 years now, along a line that stretched 450 miles from belgium to switzerland.
in early 1917, in an attempt to strangle british supply lines and break the deadlock,
it was about midnight, and thundered down 4 flights of stairs with these terrified children under his arms and then, plunked them on the floor and then spent an hour or so orating about hi..., the role
that he hoped to play in the war while they stood and watched him and tried to figure out who this man was.
it would take time to build and train an american army.
he was sure he could raise a division of volunteers virtually overnight, lead it into battle, and inspire the allies to hold on.
you look at the photographs of him or the old film clips, he's old, old man as if he's a high intensity light bulb that burned out quickly.
but if he could not fight, his 4 sons could, and one by one, he secured places for them that would nudge them as close as possible to danger.
"i should be ashamed of my sons if they shirked war," he wrote,
"just as i should be ashamed of my daughters if they shirked motherhood."
i have always explained to my 4 sons that if there is a war during their lifetime,
i wish them to be in a position to explain to their children why they did go to it, and not why they did not go to it.
in order to undertake the war work which consumed her, she had to organize her busy household to function without her.
she rose often at 5 in the morning, and spent 12 hours without a break at the union station red cross canteen making coffee and jam sandwiches for the dough boys passing through.
sometimes, i wondered if i could live that way another day.
strength came, however, with the thought of europe and a little sleep, you could always begin a new day.
she never forgot the sound of the door locking behind her or the sight of the dark ward filled with shattered men, some chained to their beds, muttering, staring.
they continued to frighten her but she came back to see them, week after week, and lobbied the government and raised private funds to improve the conditions under which they lived.
in fact, it was a signal to boss murphy and the big-city democrats that once the fighting ended, he would no longer be their enemy.
to succeed in post-war politics, he would need the bosses he had once fought so hard.
meanwhile, he did all he could to strengthen and speed up the navy.
daniels over-ruled his plan to build hundreds of small craft to patrol american harbors that were not under any real threat...
privately, franklin continued to be scornful of his slow-moving boss and never abandoned hope of supplanting him as secretary, but he also learned lessons from daniels that would prove essential to him later...
how to work his will with congress and how to keep control out of the hands of ambitious military men who assumed they knew better than civilians.
fdr took from the first world war a great sense of the bureaucratic con.
he always understood where people were hiding money in budgets or why certain things wouldn't happen because he had once hidden money in budgets and not done things, ah, that, that his superiors wanted.
roosevelt finally persuaded his chief to let him sail for europe on an inspection tour.
if franklin roosevelt could not fight, at least he could see the fighting for himself.
a torpedo may be waiting to start on its quick run;
that we can never get our good, old ocean back again until that god and the people who have set him up are utterly cut down and purged.
and over the years, in roosevelt's retelling, the american destroyer and the german submarine grew closer and closer until he was claiming it had come up first on one side of his ship and then the other.
dearest ted, you and your brothers are playing your parts in the greatest of the world's great days, and what man of gallant spirit does not envy you?
first, archie's knee and elbow had been shattered by german shells, and he had been awarded the french croix de guerre.
ted had been gassed leading his men on the front lines in one battle and been awarded the silver star for his gallantry in another.
"but i would not have them elsewhere for anything in the world."
quentin, the youngest and perhaps the best-loved of the roosevelt children, had joined the army's fledgling air service.
he was engaged to miss flora payne whitney, but forbidden by her parents to marry until the war was over.
when a visitor told quentin how proud the country was to see all the roosevelt sons in uniform, he just grinned.
"well," he said, "you know it's rather up to us to practice what father preaches."
his fellow flyers in the 95th "kicking mule" aero squadron called quentin the "go and get 'em man"
and roosevelt looked at it and he walked in towards the house and he said, "how am i going to tell edith?"
"how will i, how will i break this news to edith?"
and so he did and they issued a statement about how proud they were that their son had gotten to the front and had seen action and had done his national service.
when the roosevelts lived in the white house, those children were in the news all the time, and quentin was, i think, about 4 when his father became president.
and he was really in a large sense the country's little boy.
so when he died, this was front-page news across the country.
there was a town in pennsylvania, which had been named bismarck, that changed its name to quentin.
to feel that one has inspired a boy to conduct that has resulted in his death has a pretty serious side for a father...
and at the same time i would not have cared for my boys and they would not have cared for me if our relations had not been just along that line.
roosevelt remained stoical in public, but his coachman came upon him in the stable, his face buried in the mane of his son's pony, murmuring,
copies of the picture made their way to all the roosevelts.
"two bullet holes in the head," eleanor roosevelt told a friend,
"so he did not suffer and it is a glorious way to die."
a few weeks later, she saw her uncle at a family gathering.
only franklin could make such a decision and president wilson himself had told him to stay at his post.
meanwhile, overseas on his inspection tour, her husband had been having the time of his life.
in london, roosevelt bought himself 3 pairs of silk pajamas, praised the heroism of the men he called "my" marines at the battle of belleau wood, chatted with king george v, who told him he'd "never seen a german gentleman"...
and had a brief encounter with the man with whom he would one day direct a far bigger war.
he stood in the open snapping photographs long enough for the germane to call in artillery.
he and his party had to drive off so fast he left his suitcase behind.
he now hoped to get himself a navy commission and join a naval battery on the western front.
but first he traveled to scotland to inspect the north sea mines and spent a couple of days salmon-fishing in a cold rain before sailing home.
bamie roosevelt had recommended her not long after the young roosevelts arrived in washington
5 years before, and eleanor had been pleased with the way she had helped steer her through the shoals of society in the nation's capital.
she had let her secretary go in june of 1917, but within two weeks lucy had enlisted in the navy, and was conveniently assigned to franklin's office at the navy department.
at campobello that summer, eleanor worried about where her husband was and what he was up to.
in october, franklin's boss josephus daniels dismissed miss mercer from the service.
the threat to the roosevelt marriage seemed to have been lifted.
but i think franklin roosevelt didn't dwell very much on the impact he had on people.
ah, he, he was in many ways a very selfish, a very self-centered person.
at 11:00 in the morning on november 11, 1918, the great war ended in an allied victory.
"the feeling of relief and thankfulness was beyond description," eleanor wrote.
and this brevity of life is painful for him to face.
dear ted, father was in your old nursery and loved the view, and as it got dusk he watched the dancing of waves and spoke of the happiness of being home, and made little plans for me.
it was not only that he was a great man, but, oh, there was such fun in being led by him."
my sorrow is so keen for the young who die that the edge of my grief is blunted when death comes to the old, of my own generation;
for in the nature of things we must soon die anyhow...
and we have warmed both hands before the fire of life.
the panama canal is one of the great achievements of the human race.
and after a secret courtship, the celebrated marriage of eleanor and franklin.
and he was a democrat running in a traditionally republican district.
but he was also the fifth cousin of the most popular man in america, the ex-president of the united states, theodore roosevelt.
i asked him why, and he replied, because you don't show your teeth. '" but he did.
he was already a top-notch salesman because he wouldn't immediately enter into a topic of politics when he met a party.
he stopped by the white house for the first time since leaving it 11/2 years earlier.
president william howard taft and his wife were out of town.
roosevelt remembered every servant and gardener by name, asked about their families, and exclaimed over a piece of the corn bread he'd especially loved while living at the white house, brought to him hot from the kitchen.
when he was shown into the handsome new oval office that had been built over the old tennis court, he strode across the room and sat down in the president's chair.
and the greatest mistake that he ever made was to relinquish power when he had it.
and leaving at the height of his powers as the youngest former president was a ruinously ludicrous thing for him to do.
with his handsome face and his form of supple strength he could make a fortune on the stage and set the matinee girl's heart throbbing with subtle and happy emotion.
but no one would suspect behind that highly polished exterior the quiet force and determination that now are sending shivers down the spine of tammany's striped mascot.
theodore roosevelt had made his reputation by embarrassing the bosses of his own republican party.
franklin lost no time in taking on the new york city democratic machine, tammany hall.
fdr did everything he could think of to make himself seem like tr, in albany.
he, he really was a sort of caricature of a caricature of, of tr for quite a while.
and just like the boys at groton and harvard, the professional politicians in albany couldn't stand him.
when the political boss of the bowery saw franklin's name on the list of democratic newcomers, he said, "well, if we've caught a roosevelt",
meanwhile, a seat in the united states senate for new york had opened up.
in those days, u.s. senators were still chosen by their state legislatures.
and the outnumbered republicans had agreed not to put up a fight.
but a band of 21 reform-minded democrats had resolved to block sheehan with a nominee of their own.
franklin joined their ranks, and because he alone was wealthy enough to rent a house in albany...
the rebels met in its library each morning, producing so much blue cigar smoke that eleanor had to move the children to the top floor.
the press found the idea of a new roosevelt repeating his celebrated cousin's albany battles irresistible.
"it's the most humanly interesting political fight for many years, " wrote the albany stringer for the "new york herald, " louis howe.
and might have gone on even longer if a fire hadn't gutted the state capitol building, requiring the weary and impatient democrats to caucus in cramped quarters across the street.
finally, the tammany boss named a new candidate, an irish-american judge every bit as pliant as sheehan.
i have just returned from a big fight, a fight that went 64 rounds, and there was fighting every second of those 64 rounds.
this fight was a free-for-all, and many on the other side got good and battered.
public service, whether my husband was in or out of office, was to be part of our daily life from now on.
eleanor was fascinated by the sheehan battle and pleased at her own ability to function apart from her mother-in-law in a wholly new world.
franklin roosevelt battled hard for a direct primary that would have allowed voters, not bosses, to choose their senators, but then backed away at the last minute from a reform charter for new york city.
after a fire at the triangle shirtwaist company killed 146 women, a special commission produced a flood of 32 reform bills.
roosevelt voted for all of them, but when the most hotly contested vote came...
on a bill setting a 50-hour-per-week work limit for women and children...
those state parties controlled their state legislatures, which were, in turn, controlled by the interests...
banks in new york, timber in michigan, copper in montana, and rail roads everywhere.
the man who wrongly holds that every human right is second to his profit must now give way to the advocate of human welfare, who rightly maintains that every man holds his property subject to the general right of the community
to regulate its use to whatever degree the public welfare may require it.
state party machines still picked most delegates to the republican convention, but a dozen states would hold direct primaries that year.
if roosevelt could demonstrate in those that voters overwhelmingly wanted him, he reasoned, the bosses would be unable to resist.
one evening, a reporter came upon an exhausted taft aboard his train.
"roosevelt was my closest friend, " the president said, and began to weep.
but just as edith had predicted, when the party met in the chicago coliseum in june, the old guard regulars in charge were immovable.
they awarded all but 19 of the 254 contested delegates to taft.
if they wished to form a third party and have him make the fight, he told them,
"i will make it, even if only one state should support me."
many of his closest friends thought he was making a terrible mistake.
i don't think you can say it was a mistake because he would have exploded from unspent energy if he hadn't done it.
and there's nothing wrong with every once in a while saying that two parties aren't responsive to a rising sentiment in the country.
the two-party system is an excellent thing but it is not graven on the heart of man by the finger of god.
i think it's fair to say that teddy roosevelt also had a public spirit that caused him to move.
tr as a student of lincoln's career knows that the republican party was just invented as this strange third party in 1854.
both parties were, were stalling and they are stuck with, you know, party bosses and the issues of a past generation.
a third party was needed to bring the crucial issues to the forefront.
limit the work day to 8 hours and the work week to 6 days;
and to provide federal insurance for the elderly, the jobless, and the sick.
when he decides what the people as a whole can and cannot do, the people should have the right to recall that decision... if they think that it is wrong."
he truly had come to believe that the progressive agenda would save this country from a bloody social revolution of the kind that would occur in russia.
roosevelt was confident he could beat taft, but his hope of defeating the democrats rested on their picking what he called "a reactionary."
and two of the 3 leading candidates were just the kind of opponents he'd hoped for.
but after 46 exhausting ballots at their convention in baltimore, the democrats settled on woodrow wilson, the former president of princeton university and governor of new jersey.
he'd only been in politics two years, but he appealed to reformers because he'd beaten his own party machine to pass progressive legislation in his state.
nothing new is happening in politics except mr. roosevelt, who is always new, being bound by nothing in the heavens above or in the earth below.
he is now rampant and very diligently employed in splitting his party wide open...
but i wish franklin could be fighting now for uncle ted, for i feel he is in the party of the future.
franklin would be unable to fight for himself or anyone else that fall.
that fall, the same red maxwell that had introduced franklin roosevelt to his constituents two years earlier prowled dutchess county again in search of votes...
but this time it was carrying a very different kind of passenger.
he latched on to franklin roosevelt and he was able to tell roosevelt when he was wrong.
he was really the only person who ever could do that consistently.
when he met him in 1911, he actually put aside a bottle of sherry and said that he would open it after roosevelt became president.
and he decided when no one else in his right mind would have thought so, except possibly roosevelt, that he should be president of the united states
he shook hundreds of hands, promised jobs on behalf of the candidate wherever he could, and introduced a shrewd innovation...
mimeographed "personalized" letters to farmers, fishermen, and apple growers, promising each group special legislation.
and tr sometimes delivered 30 whistle-stop speeches a day, shadow-boxing through the caboose to maintain his energy before stepping out onto the platform.
again and again, he denounced his democratic opponent as a secret advocate of state's rights, a false progressive masquerading as a friend of strong federal government.
called only for their regulation, while wilson's "new freedom" seemed to suggest that he would actually break them up.
in my dream, i saw president mckinley sit up in his coffin pointing at a man in monk's attire in whom i recognized theodore roosevelt.
theodore roosevelt was in milwaukee standing in his open automobile in front of the gilpatric hotel, waving his hat to the crowd.
a delusional german immigrant named john schrank, standing just 7 feet away, aimed a pistol at his chest.
he had been stalking roosevelt for a month, convinced the ghost of william mckinley was directing his hand.
the bullet passed through the ex-president's spectacles case and the folded 50-page speech behind it, smashed through his chest wall, and lodged in a splintered rib less than a quarter of an inch from his heart.
"i did not care a rap for being shot, " he later told a friend.
"it is a trade risk which every prominent man should accept as a matter of course."
friends, i shall ask you to be as quiet as possible.
i don't know whether you fully understand that i have just been shot.
the bullet is in me now, so that i cannot make a very long speech, but i will try my best.
and now, friends, this effort to assassinate me emphasizes to a peculiar degree the need of the progressive movement.
"could have influenced as many americans as were stirred by the shot of a madman."
he was out of action and under his wife's strict care for almost two weeks.
woodrow wilson won the presidency with only 42% of the vote, and his party gained control of both the senate and the house for the first time in almost two decades.
there is no use disguising the fact that the defeat at the polls is overwhelming.
i had expected defeat, but i had expected that we would make a better showing.
i try not to think of the damage to myself personally.
he was so used to being popular and loved and then he's suddenly a pariah.
alice used to say that there is a melancholy that ran through the roosevelt family.
he was surprised by the defeat but also by the enormity of the defeat.
i mean, he had, he had lost by quite a bit and just hadn't expected it.
he was brave about it in public and quite sad about it in private.
mrs. roosevelt wrote one of the children who was away that "father spends more time on horseback"
franklin and eleanor went to washington for woodrow wilson's inauguration, where josephus daniels, the new secretary of the navy, sought franklin out.
roosevelt had been an early supporter of the new democratic president.
it is interesting to see that you are at another place which i myself once held.
i am sure you will enjoy yourself to the full as assistant secretary and that you will do capital work.
franklin roosevelt was just 31, the youngest assistant secretary of the navy in history,
7 years younger than theodore roosevelt had been when he first sat at the same desk, so young and so young-looking that a dinner companion who didn't catch his name thought him a "naughty little boy, just out of college."
josephus daniels was a newspaper editor from north carolina who called battleships "boats, "
seemed most concerned with banning wine from officers' messes throughout the fleet, and was a close ally of wilson's secretary of state
william jennings bryan, who believed strong defenses were a provocation and promised that the united states would never go to war on his watch.
not long after franklin took up his new duties, his boss went off on an inspection tour, leaving him in charge.
eleanor, sensitive to any feeling among her oyster bay relatives that she and franklin might unfairly be exploiting their link with theodore roosevelt, was appalled.
it was a "horrid little remark, " she told her husband.
he and eleanor rented theodore roosevelt's sister bamie's home at 1733 n street.
tr had spent the first few nights of his presidency there and afterwards had walked there so often to talk things over with his shrewd sister that the press called it the "little white house."
it would be franklin roosevelt's headquarters for the next several crowded, frenetic years.
eleanor brought to it all the organizational skills she'd learned in albany, seeing to the needs of her growing household, entertaining her uncle's old friends, getting to know new people from all over the country,
when franklin is assistant secretary of the navy, as theodore was, he first is associating with his prep school chums and various people from his social class who he, he meets with.
and as time goes on he, he ends up spending more time with labor leaders, ship-builders, ordinary people who made something of themselves.
and whenever he could get away to his summer home on campobello island, he liked to come and go by destroyer, guiding the big warship through the narrows with his own sure hand at the wheel.
when it came time for the 10th reunion of his harvard class, he arranged to have it held on the deck of the uss "palmer."
on february 27, 1914, shortly after midday, we started down the river of doubt into the unknown.
the lofty and matted forest rose like a green wall on either hand.
the trees were stately and beautiful, the looped and twisted vines hung from them like great ropes.
after theodore roosevelt's defeat as the progressive party's candidate for president in 1912, he undertook another great adventure...
an expedition into the amazon rainforest to chart the course of a newly discovered jungle waterway.
the expedition's leader was candido rodon, the brazilian explorer who had discovered its headwaters and given it its name... "rio de duvida"... the "river of doubt."
it was a series of 6 falls, the final of which was 30 feet.
and colonel rondon, who had spent half of his life in the rainforest, said,
i saw that if i did end my life, that would only make it more sure that kermit would not get out.
for i knew he would not abandon me, but would insist on bringing my body out, too.
kermit's weeks of working alongside the expedition's porters and paddlers paid off.
he used his engineering skill to lower the dugouts down the steep canyon walls, and kept his men moving forward.
a deep gorge and an apparently impassable series of new rapids stretched on ahead.
theodore was helpless now, forced to be paddled along beneath a makeshift tent.
finally, on april 26, after a month and a half in the wilderness, they came upon a 6-man relief party that had been sent to help them out of the rainforest.
here's roosevelt so ill, and he looks up and he sees on this bank the brazilian flag and the flag of the united states of america.
and he knows that they're gonna be ok, that they're saved.
the river of doubt, which turned out to be almost half as long as the rhine, was renamed "rio roosevelt."
as i am writing, a great black tornado trembles on the edge of europe and the whole question of peace and war trembles in the balance.
it is not a good thing for a country to have a professional yodeler, a human trombone like mr. bryan as secretary of state, nor a college president like mr. wilson as head of the nation, with a hypocritical ability to deceive plain people
and no real knowledge or wisdom concerning internal and international affairs.
in early august of 1914, 5 weeks after the assassination of archduke franz ferdinand in sarajevo,
he is bewildered by it all, very sweet but very sad.
i am not surprised at what you say about mr. daniels for one could expect little else.
all of the roosevelts sided with england and her allies from the moment the first gun was fired.
"even i long to go over into the thick of it and right the wrong, " franklin told an old british friend.
in a recent speech, he'd said that when it came down to a struggle between "popular rights and corrupt and machine-ruled government"
the interests of the republican and democratic bosses of new york were "fundamentally identical."
during the 1911 senate battle over billy sheehan, he'd seen collusion between the bosses of both parties firsthand and was more than willing to say so in court on behalf of the man who continued to be his hero.
when a lawyer asked franklin what relation he was to the former president, he grinned.
"fifth cousin by blood, " he said proudly, "and nephew by law!"
"i shall never forget the capital way in which you gave your testimony, "
a german submarine had sunk the british passenger ship "lusitania" off the coast of ireland.
more than 1,100 men, women, and children had drowned, including 128 american citizens.
this represents not merely piracy, but piracy on a vaster scale of murder than the old-time pirates ever practiced.
it seems inconceivable that we can refrain from taking action in this matter, for we owe it not only to humanity but to our own national self-respect.
it took the jurors two days, but in the end, all 12 of them exonerated roosevelt, who went right back on the attack.
there is a chance of our going to war, but i don't think it is very much of a chance.
wilson and bryan are cordially supported by all the hyphenated americans, by the solid flub-dub and pacifist vote.
every soft creature, every coward and weakling, every man who can't look more than 6 inches ahead, every man whose god is money, or pleasure, or ease is enthusiastically in favor of wilson;
but it also was visceral in the sense that he didn't like the presbyterian moralist, just struck teddy roosevelt as, i think, part of the effeminacy that he associated with a commercial republic.
wilson declared, "there is such a thing as being too proud to fight"
he complained again and again about secretary daniels being that further infuriated theodore roosevelt.
but the president also agreed to double the defense budget in the interest of what wilson now called "preparedness."
and surreptitiously slipped damaging information about his boss and the administration's defense efforts to the ranking republican on the house military affairs committee.
if the public ever turned on the administration for having been too slow in preparing for war, he was determined he would not be blamed.
and he shared his cousin theodore's conviction that the united states not only would... but should...
hyde park was very definitely my most favorite place in life.
it was their grandmother's home at hyde park that represented a sanctuary from their parents' increasingly turbulent world.
in 1915, sara delano roosevelt greatly expanded springwood to accommodate them and the nurses and maids that traveled with them.
the house now included so many bedrooms she sometimes called it "our hotel."
the renovated first floor, modeled after the country houses of the roosevelts' aristocratic friends in england, was meant to be a showcase for her son and his collections...
i do so wish the holiday had been longer and less interrupted while it lasted.
i felt tuesday as if i was really getting back to earth again...
but it remained her mother-in-law's home, she remembered many years later, and, "i was only a visitor."
sara delano roosevelt was a very great mother and a very tough mother-in-law.
the kind of love eleanor had never known when she was a girl and now found hard to provide to her own children.
up to a point it is good for us to know that there are people in the world who will give us love and unquestioned loyalty.
"i was always just getting over a baby or about to have another" was over.
she was ready to resume a life of her own, to find a new kind of fulfillment, on her own terms.
on june 14, 1916, with the nominating conventions just weeks away, president wilson led a preparedness parade up pennsylvania avenue from the capitol to the white house...
and made sure that theodore roosevelt's young democratic cousin was marching with him.
the navy department made an excellent showing in the parade, and when i passed the reviewing stand
i was sent for to join the president in the stand and spend the next 4 hours there!
it would be a mistake to re-nominate me in 1916 unless the country has in its mood something of the heroic...
unless it feels not only devotion to ideals but the purpose to realize those ideals in action.
theodore roosevelt hoped somehow to obtain both the progressive and the republican presidential nominations that year.
but the old guard of his old party had not forgiven him for 1912.
and while most americans sympathized with britain and france and now supported preparedness, they still remained reluctant to get involved in a far-away war.
the republicans chose instead the austere, mildly progressive supreme court justice charles evans hughes.
roosevelt and the progressives had championed had already become law thanks to woodrow wilson's shrewd political skills...
a new antitrust statute, workmen's compensation, a ban on most child labor, a federal reserve board and federal trade commission.
the battle lines had been frozen for nearly 3 years now, along a line that stretched 450 miles from belgium to switzerland.
in early 1917, in an attempt to strangle british supply lines and break the deadlock,
it was about midnight, and thundered down 4 flights of stairs with these terrified children under his arms and then, plunked them on the floor and then spent an hour or so orating about hi..., the role
that he hoped to play in the war while they stood and watched him and tried to figure out who this man was.
it would take time to build and train an american army.
he was sure he could raise a division of volunteers virtually overnight, lead it into battle, and inspire the allies to hold on.
but if he could not fight, his 4 sons could, and one by one, he secured places for them that would nudge them as close as possible to danger.
"i should be ashamed of my sons if they shirked war, " he wrote,
"just as i should be ashamed of my daughters if they shirked motherhood."
i have always explained to my 4 sons that if there is a war during their lifetime,
instead of making social calls, i found myself spending 3 days a week in a canteen down at the rail road yards, one afternoon a week distributing free work for the navy league, two days a week visiting the naval hospital,
and contributing whatever time i had left to the navy red cross and the navy relief society.
the war liberated all of what eleanor called her "executive ability."
in order to undertake the war work which consumed her, she had to organize her busy household to function without her.
she rose often at 5 in the morning, and spent 12 hours without a break at the union station red cross canteen making coffee and jam sandwiches for the dough boys passing through.
sometimes, i wondered if i could live that way another day.
strength came, however, with the thought of europe and a little sleep, you could always begin a new day.
one day, the red cross asked eleanor to inspect st. elizabeth's hospital, a mental facility filled with sailors and marines suffering in the aftermath of battle.
they continued to frighten her but she came back to see them, week after week, and lobbied the government and raised private funds to improve the conditions under which they lived.
"you must do what you think you cannot do, " she wrote.
in fact, it was a signal to boss murphy and the big-city democrats that once the fighting ended, he would no longer be their enemy.
to succeed in post-war politics, he would need the bosses he had once fought so hard.
meanwhile, he did all he could to strengthen and speed up the navy.
daniels over-ruled his plan to build hundreds of small craft to patrol american harbors that were not under any real threat...
privately, franklin continued to be scornful of his slow-moving boss and never abandoned hope of supplanting him as secretary, but he also learned lessons from daniels that would prove essential to him later...
how to work his will with congress and how to keep control out of the hands of ambitious military men who assumed they knew better than civilians.
fdr took from the first world war a great sense of the bureaucratic con.
he always understood where people were hiding money in budgets or why certain things wouldn't happen because he had once hidden money in budgets and not done things, that, that his superiors wanted.
roosevelt finally persuaded his chief to let him sail for europe on an inspection tour.
if franklin roosevelt could not fight, at least he could see the fighting for himself.
but now, though the ocean looks unchanged, the doubled number on lookout shows that even here the hand of the hun false god is reaching out to defy nature,
that 10 miles ahead of this floating city of souls a torpedo may be waiting to start on its quick run;
you have seized the great chance, as it was seized by those who fought at gettysburg and waterloo, and agincourt and arbela and marathon.
he was at sagamore hill doing routine correspondence when phil thompson of the associated press came to see him on july 16, 1918.
ted had been gassed leading his men on the front lines in one battle and been awarded the silver star for his gallantry in another.
kermit was unhurt, but he had survived several close calls fighting with the british army in mesopotamia.
quentin, the youngest and perhaps the best-loved of the roosevelt children, had joined the army's fledgling air service.
he was engaged to miss flora payne whitney, but forbidden by her parents to marry until the war was over.
when a visitor told quentin how proud the country was to see all the roosevelt sons in uniform, he just grinned.
"well, " he said, "you know it's rather up to us to practice what father preaches."
and roosevelt looked at it and he walked in towards the house and he said, "how am i going to tell edith?"
"how will i, how will i break this news to edith?"
and so he did and they issued a statement about how proud they were that their son had gotten to the front and had seen action and had done his national service.
when the roosevelts lived in the white house, those children were in the news all the time, and quentin was, i think, about 4 when his father became president.
and he was really in a large sense the country's little boy.
so when he died, this was front-page news across the country.
there was a town in pennsylvania, which had been named bismarck, that changed its name to quentin.
to feel that one has inspired a boy to conduct that has resulted in his death has a pretty serious side for a father...
and at the same time i would not have cared for my boys and they would not have cared for me if our relations had not been just along that line.
roosevelt remained stoical in public, but his coachman came upon him in the stable, his face buried in the mane of his son's pony, murmuring,
copies of the picture made their way to all the roosevelts.
"two bullet holes in the head, " eleanor roosevelt told a friend,
"so he did not suffer and it is a glorious way to die."
a few weeks later, she saw her uncle at a family gathering.
only franklin could make such a decision and president wilson himself had told him to stay at his post.
meanwhile, overseas on his inspection tour, her husband had been having the time of his life.
in london, roosevelt bought himself 3 pairs of silk pajamas, praised the heroism of the men he called "my" marines at the battle of belleau wood, chatted with king george v, who told him he'd "never seen a german gentleman"...
and had a brief encounter with the man with whom he would one day direct a far bigger war.
he stood in the open snapping photographs long enough for the germane to call in artillery.
he and his party had to drive off so fast he left his suitcase behind.
he now hoped to get himself a navy commission and join a naval battery on the western front.
but first he traveled to scotland to inspect the north sea mines and spent a couple of days salmon-fishing in a cold rain before sailing home.
bamie roosevelt had recommended her not long after the young roosevelts arrived in washington
5 years before, and eleanor had been pleased with the way she had helped steer her through the shoals of society in the nation's capital.
she had let her secretary go in june of 1917, but within two weeks lucy had enlisted in the navy, and was conveniently assigned to franklin's office at the navy department.
at campobello that summer, eleanor worried about where her husband was and what he was up to.
in october, franklin's boss josephus daniels dismissed miss mercer from the service.
the threat to the roosevelt marriage seemed to have been lifted.
but i think franklin roosevelt didn't dwell very much on the impact he had on people.
he, he was in many ways a very selfish, a very self-centered person.
at 11:00 in the morning on november 11, 1918, the great war ended in an allied victory.
"the feeling of relief and thankfulness was beyond description, " eleanor wrote.
and this brevity of life is painful for him to face.
dear ted, father was in your old nursery and loved the view, and as it got dusk he watched the dancing of waves and spoke of the happiness of being home, and made little plans for me.
"for if roosevelt had been awake, there would have been a fight."
two days later, as pallbearers prepared to carry his coffin to a hilltop grave at oyster bay, a new york police captain said to roosevelt's sister corinne,
my sorrow is so keen for the young who die that the edge of my grief is blunted when death comes to the old, of my own generation;
for in the nature of things we must soon die anyhow...
and we have warmed both hands before the fire of life.
franklin and eleanor roosevelt had been unable to attend the funeral.
do you remember that time, when giancarlo had me tied up about to kill me?

only the dame's beginning to get on my nerves, that's all.
listen, i'm getting fed up on these rubber checks bouncing in.
we're laying down good beer and getting nothing but a lot of bum paper.
i got one this morning for $1,200 from that pete over on kedzie avenue.
you fellows don't know what it means to a girl, getting married.
you knew all the time i was going to marry you, didn't you?
you know, all my friends... think that things are different between us than they are.
they figure they know me pretty well... and don't think i'd go for a merry-go-round.
and you won't be no good to me when you're in the cemetery.
i got to have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again.
i've been watching and hearing about you, and i've been worried.
i was worried when you got mixed up with that two-timer putty nose.
maybe it was selfish of me, tom... but somebody's got to stay here and take care of ma.
you earn more money than i do, and they'd have called me first anyway.
you'll get too much in your nose someday and wonder how you got it.
for crying out loud, i heard some guys talking about you... saying you were in on some crooked work.
he and matt have been running around... with a couple of girls at the washington arms hotel.
now, the worst part of it all is that he's been lying to his mother.
i know what you've been doing... how you got those clothes and those new cars.
you've been telling ma you're in politics, that you're on the city payroll.

that is, different from the kind of girls i was used to.
i don't go in for these long-winded things, but with me, it was always yes or no.
i got to have a couple of days to get the boys lined up again.
while i'm doing that... you'll be where nobody knows where to find you except me.

believe me, mr. leehman, when nails and his mob start on a job... it's already done.

the port of shimoda is the hometown to koina no ginpei.
an orphan, he joined shimataro onabe 's gang which ruled the area.
gohei's place is prospering thanks to oichi, his only daughter, known for her beauty.
oichi, isn't it ti me we spoke to your father about...
i left the gang 13 years ago, and led an honest life since.
but owe so much to boss onabe for watching after us still.
if you don't make enough today, no dinner for you tonight!
koina no ginpei who is sitting nearby has been watching them closely.
it's said that four years ago, he killed my best swordsman, lwakado no tajiro.
i'd say a life for a life, but instead i'm telling you to leave shimoda.
he had fought back his anger and worked hard to lead an honest life in his hometown shimoda.
but even unokichi had to give in to this nightmare of continuing harassment from ushimatsu.
the movies in this dvd product feature tsumasaburo bando, one of the biggest stars of our cinema.
after graduating from elementary school he joined the school of a famous kabuki actor and began training.
however, in the "feudal" kabuki world, the good roles were reserved for actors who belonged to the prominent kabuki families.
actors who joined the kabuki world driven just by love for the art, were given only minor roles, regardless of their talent.
bantsuma left the school at around twenty and with fellow actors established a traveling troupe that toured towns and villages.
in those years, there were many such troupes, that performed outside the big cities of tokyo and osaka.
back then, bantsuma was trying very hard to keep his face hidden from the cameras.
why would he shy from the camera despite his ambitions for stardom?
he was confident that one day he would become a superstar,
he was confident that one day he would become a superstar, and he didn't want to be remembered for such minor roles.
he was an extremely well-respected figure, and one of the reasons for this was his generous treatment of screenwriters.
he paid very good salaries to screenwriters if he was convinced of their talent.
i don't know about the actors, but by putting the plot first, makino demonstrates amazing insight.
one of the most famous screenwriters fostered by shozo makino was rokuhei susukita.
susukita studied carefully the hollywood action movies of that time, and introduced various novel devices into japanese cinema.
for instance, the mask is an element that appears often injidaigeki films,
one of the actors who attracted his attention, was tsumasaburo bando.
unlike the regal and calm actors from the old school, the young bantsuma stood out with his glaring eyes, rebellious attitude and intensive play.
take for instance the story of a man who gets in a fight with a yakuza and kills him.
then, to repent for his crime, he takes care of the family of his victim, or saves his child and continues his travel.
the wanderers and criminals that hasegawa vividly depicted in his stories believed that they must repay their obligations with similar kindness.
the beautiful world of hasegawa's heroes offered bantsuma fresh ground for expanding his repertoire.
his swashbuckling skills, coupled with his heroic stature won him great popularity among children.
for quite some time, he was known as a kid-friendly action star.
in this story, bantsuma plays neither a hero, nor a criminal, but a rickshaw man.
although his hero is just a poor rickshaw man, he has a big heart,
and the beauty of the story moves the audience to tears.
before starting work on the movie, bantsuma told the director that he didn't want to work on it, because he was "afraid."
who played mostly heroes in popular films didn't let fame get to their heads, but rather became modest and compassionate, sympathetic to other's hardships and pain.
tsumasaburo bando gives a wonderful example for the life and growth of japanese actors.
ever since bantsuma was a young and unknown actor, his peers saw in him the talented actor and huge superstar he would become one day.
the screenwriter rokuhei susukita wrote roles especially for bantsuma, and requested producers to cast bantsuma for the lead in their films.
however, the established and popular stars of that time demanded that they be given the lead roles.
thus bantsuma saw many good parts go to other actors, and had to put up with minor roles.
kosuzume pass is one of the films created during his early years.
bantsuma plays a minor role, but is eager to play it well and be noticed.
the flower of love is starting to bloom in ginpei's heart.
outside the bustling town of shimoda in izu, not too far from the post town.
but owe so much to boss onabe for watching after us still.
doubt that i'ii be of much help, but better than a scarecrow.
i just honored the rules of a fight and killed my enemy.
ginpei killed tajiro of ushimatsu's gang to save unokichi who he wishes so much to kill himself.
it's said that four years ago, he killed my best swordsman, iwakado no tajiro.
i'd say a life for a life, but instead i'm telling you to leave shimoda.
he had fought back his anger and worked hard to lead an honest life in his hometown shimoda.
but even unokichi had to give in to this nightmare of continuing harassment from ushimatsu.
i left the gang 13 years ago, anf led an honest life since.
but i owe so much to boss onabe for watching after us still.
they drank farewell cups with their families, while ginpei was all alone without anyone.
not to leave any regrets, he confessed his love but was not met.
"my home is the kosuzume pass, famous for its delicacies, sweet inari, ohagi rice cakes, and the candy of omitsu's teahouse"
in her heart, fresh and tender like a wild flower, bloomed a secret love.
the babbling stream and the gentle wind told the story of their love.
it blossomed like a fragrant summer flower, unaware of the approaching fall.
in this town lived a famous master of the sword, a middle-aged samurai known by the name mochizuki sanzaemon.
sanzaemon was a brave and gentle man, but a long-hidden secret of his past cast a shadow over his life.
thus tokutaro had to perform his song under the cold stares and arrogant smirks of the samurai.
it was a painful moment for mochizuki, seeing his son humiliated in front of everybody.
we shall humbly accept your sacrifice and leave this town to live in exile.
a sad quiet fell over, as they bid a tearful farewell.
your task, ladies and gentlemen, will be to determine whether she is guilty or not.
needless to say, in the eyes of the law, men and women are equal.
but, ladies and gentlemen, only a truly innocent person can be indifferent towards such an accusation.
if you are convinced that the defence represents the facts, it is your duty to release the accused.
however, i must point out that the accused is a talented actress.
though if you are convinced that she has committed the deed in full consciousness, then i can only remind you of the words of the prosecutor:
the defence argues that there is a possibility that she could have acted under a fit or something like that.
surely it is clear that in the evidence for the defence the medical expert put forward the following theory:
we know that under the influence of a very strong emotion, an individual can act without being aware of their actions.
actions the individual do not remember at all when she regains her normal mental state.
either we can let her go free, but if she's a murderer, that's wrong to society.
or else we get her hung, and that i find barbaric.
everyone would like to have a girl like her for a daughter.
do not let your verdict be influenced by this young lady's qualities and their appeal to you.
it confirms that the two women had been enemies for some time.
he said the accused wanted to attack mrs. moore on stage.
it's an inquiry into the current whereabouts of the troupe with which miss baring was at work.
and locate that small man stage manager, or theatre director or what he was.
to begin with, we must return to the scene of the crime.
do you think you can spare me a few days of your time?
we went to the window to see who made the fuss.
i saw a man on the corner that looked like a policeman.
the most important factor is the policeman you did not see.
at the night of the murder, your wife saw a policeman on the corner.
you mean that someone used one of our theatre uniforms to disguise as a policeman?
we must find out the name of the man mary is protecting.
you can't imagine how i suffer for having contributed to your misery.
and if you want to, mary, you'll become a great actress.
the name of the man who was the subject of the discussion.
he had nothing to do with it and we weren't arguing about him.
listen to this, mr. brown, here is the end of my play:
by these words, he jumps in with the fire poker in his hand, pushes mary, whose head hit the table, and collapses, unconscious.
good morning, ladies and gentlemen morning, morning, colleague we'll tell you the exact time first:

he'll be ashamed but i only mean well with you look at me you see he used to be in love with me for a long time he even told me he'd love me for an eternity of course, eternity is "rubbish with gravy"
but do you imagine a man would give up his habits, the things he used to like?
you see a woman like you ought to look like ... like a princess!
she should have a blouse made of silk no, artificial silk, you know, that throws such pretty lights and then a tailored skirt of berlin's best department store and a pair of silk stockings and shoes of snakeskin

incinerating the remainings of the victims of cholera from 1860 in oaxaca.
miahuatlan temple, that fell and buried the preacher and 50 churchgoers.
they haven't heard the events so we'll tell the story to you.
you may think it all nonsense though every word is true.
in the name of all the tenants here, so proud to know a millionaire, accept this bouquet of flowers and may your happiness be ours.
didn't the man who took the jacket leave a name or address?
i sell it to a singer, and another man comes to get it back, upon which we get a police raid.
so tonight we go to the opera lyrique and we get that jacket.
you'll have one hour to yourself each afternoon and your evenings after 7.
but you're to be in bed and lights out at 10.
there's only one guy that can do a nurse any good, a patient with dough.
catch one with a fever and a low pulse, make him think you saved his life and you'll be getting somewhere.
i will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drug.
i will do all in my power to elevate the standard of my profession and will hold in confidence all personal matters committed to my keeping and all family affairs coming to my knowledge in the practice of my calling.
because he's shady, and you know it, as well as every other doctor in this city.
i know a lot of things inside the profession that i can't advertise.
i'll calm down, if you'll only tell me what to do.
- my advice is for you to go back on that job.
one time, i had a pain and the doctor put a big cone over my face and told me to take a deep breath.
and i did and i floated right up through the cone and when i came out the other end, there she was.
how long did you think you could get away with this?
you think because you strong-arm women, you have the brains to put this over?
a grocer? i'm afraid he knows more about groceries than about hospitals.
what does he mean "the time you were at high school"?
life is going on for you in the same old way.
say, i was afraid the hospital would burn down before i could get into it.
there's only one guy that can do a nurse any good, a patient with dough.

why hasn't he got a job on some decent hospital staff?
because he's shady, and you know it, as well as every other doctor in this city.
but if he wants to murder those youngsters, we'll make him use a gun.
i came to apologize for the way i acted this morning.
you know, we discovered, for some strange reason that nick seems to irritate me less than any of the other servants.
so as far as feasible, dr. ranger wanted him to be my personal attendant.
i thought you was out delivering gin with that crush of yours.
i haven't seen him but once since that night in the drugstore.
that's why you keep the mother full of booze all the time.
you'll take her out and marry her and grab the trust fund.
you want to marry me off to someone i don't know.
but the general director told me that he's a wonderful man.
you don't know a bigger slicker, my dear girls, when he gets going, he never stops.
no matter if you're fat or skinny, short or tall if he gets you in his head, he won't let go.
and i must tell you that the house that mr. zlatnik bought will be sold.
as mr. zlatnik was reduced to poverty because of your kindness.
why are you buying vegetation like this to a silly hopper!
you should've bought something warm to wear or eat for yourself instead!
today there's just a few paths that could lead us straight to paradise.
an office girl is happy to see the sun shine in the sky.
why should she dream of happiness to come, when life is giving her a bad time.
sing a song of your youth, and the sun that seems so dim will hear you whispering.
don't give up hope, a day will come when i stop dreaming.
the whole world will know at once that someone loves me.
that's because when spring comes we all tend to forget ourselves and even an old dog is sure to go astray in the dark.
you don't know a bigger slicker, my dear girls, when he gets going, he never stops.
no matter if you're fat or skinny, short or tall if he gets you in his head, he won't let go.
he knows that slowly but surely he'll get what he wants.
allow me to say that i don't belong among these comedians, among this company of actors!
my name is finicker, i am a senior auditor from renesov!
i know a man who likes to come but never holds out long.
as soon as a girl sits in his lap he goes running wild.
when he came back in two days, the girl was gone and she left her child there.
you don't say, it's like a story from an amorous novel.
if you only knew how i was shoved and pushed all my life.
why should i care whether you are a forwarder's daughter or not.
one lady noticed my voice and helped me get on stage.
i have to show my body every night now and who is to blame for that?
if we don't get a million crowns by tomorrow, we're bankrupt.
if at least consul vieland came so that you could marry his daughter.
just between you and me, sir, there are more cocks on this roost.
because one was just crowing when i came and quite nicely, i daresay.
people, i've suffered so much since the day i was born, my mother left prague and my father was sick in bed.
good fairies gave me the river as my dowry so forlorn.
when i get a little angry, i shake like jellied meat.
as a baby they bathed me in a water that was so hot and i feel the consequences to this very day.
and all you hear are lovers whispering their sweet words in the park.
that's because when spring comes we all tend to forget ourselves and even an old dog is sure to go astray in the dark.
there's such chaos in my head that i'll have to make an audit.
and it's all because of that nightgown, in which i ran away.
then, saint peter wrapped me in paper, open the heaven's gates and put me on a cloud.
i didn't learn to fly well yet, as i was a tiny angel.
so, i wanted to ask you, whether you would accept my congratulations now.
and at the same time, i wanted to ask you, if we could shake hands, sir.
we are most honored and pleased to be able to announce the good news.
you have always been a law abiding and an honest citizen of this town and in consequence, all the citizens have unilaterally chosen you as the mayor of the town of renesov.
the king summons the estates-general - the nobility, the clergy and the bourgeoisie.
the revolutionary bourgeoisie succeeds in seizing power in the national assembly.
with the storming of the bastille the revolution wins its first victory.
the king and the national assembly are forced to move from versailles to paris.
yes but ... excuse me the king has squandered away your money
3.000 horses stand in the royal stables 300 ceremonial carriages and the courtiers are numberless the palace at versailles cost 3/4 billion singers, composers, dancers, interpreters heralds, printers and the priests a whole bunch of clerics
i say, m. robespierre now you've given up eating and drinking too you'll be losing all your forces
this shirt is badly ironed now really, m. robespierre but i can't keep a clear head these days my god!
i have come to paris to give away my inheritance to the republic
i only hope your inheritance isn't too deeply in debt, m. le marquis if you please
believe me there isn't a man in france whom i admire more than you
a lot of aristocrats come to see me but i place myself entirely at your disposition
but i'm telling you don't start the newly acquired freedom with a murder!
very true one must pluck out the evil by the roots what kind of an office is it anyway?
bestowed upon one by the chance of birth and can be administered by any idiot but danton, here in the jacobin club there are only republicans
i hope so we're not debating france's form of government we're dealing with the personal fate of the king whether banishment or execution
- i wanted to ... you've put on weight that comes from ...
i am entitled to 100 francs from the king tell me, what exactly do you want to do with those 100 francs?
the monarchs of all europe will unite to take revenge on france.
you're right about this, robespierre the despots will unite even closer whereas we are quarrelling for nights let's avoid all partition what if our motion isn't accepted in the convention don't worry
you'll remember my words but ... for the sake of our good cause
i'll speak in favour of your case at the convention bravo, robespierre
- leave us in peace, will you what swinish business must we sit and watch those beasts destroying everything that's sacred to us?
they may take away all our rights they may lock all the churches they may even abolish religion but they cannot send god to the guillotine
ah, the gentlemen of the guard how weird it looks in here
like a museum well now we'll have a look at the good king
in view of this trial's exhaustive length, the jacobin club, in order to come finally to a decision, after extensive examination of facts of the case, has voted unanimously to demand the death penalty for louis capet.
the people must now give an answer to this motion and proclaim their will through their representatives.
documents found in a secret cabinet of his majesty, despite his hypocritical affirmations.
and therefore i declare that the man who has the effrontery to speak for the counter-revolution, for the aristocracy, for the king must fall.
and thus i accuse louis capet, formerly king of the frenchmen, of treason of the fatherland, counter-revolution, and high treason.
and thus i demand in the name of all patriots, in the name of the blood of french citizens, which he criminally shed, the death penalty.
i'm afraid, my friend, that i've fallen in love with that man.
and still, i'm telling you kids, out there it doesn't look good hundreds of thousands of allies and only 30.000 on our side only a fool would let himself be sent out there
i've been ordered to the homeland and i'm to report to you, citizen danton why?
the minister of war claims that i'm not fit for field duty
first they abolish indecent behaviour and in the end all our freedom.
the prostitutes are prohibited to appear in all public places what will our good danton do now, i wonder?
when a revolutionary behaves in a way like danton then i'm in favour to accuse him publicly
he'll be here any minute he couldn't possibly miss out this important session he'll know how to justify himself
danton has turned a gentleman he doesn't belong to the people anymore
paris is starving, and danton is celebrating his wedding but the bride is beautiful
# who who who # who won the trial for humankind?
# who who who # who created the flag for liberty?
he's celebrating his wedding and honeymoon wasn't it danton who gave dumouriez the high command?
yes we shall hold him responsible for this this won't help us send him out to the front he's the only one who can restore order out there
- von strackwitz when will our soldiers put up camp in paris?
in six weeks at the latest, your ducal highness and you're asking us to go home?
i'll speak in the convention there will be patriots who won't understand me
i must spare the republic such a trial for high treason
the more of us dying for the idea ... the stronger and more secure it will live.
that's only theory, robespierre the idea can only live with us no bridge remains standing between us a pity a pity for france yes yes a pity for france
i struck them down the king and the aristocrats was that murder?
no that was war against the interior am i to curse my own hand upon which fell the curse of necessity?
i'd be so glad if... if one doesn't live like you do dry, sober without love then one is already an aristocrat
i'd be so glad if you two ... the way you, under the sign of death ... we're saving the fatherland with the power of terror and the world must fear the guillotine of france yes yes i understand
to throw down the republican government and to reinstate the monarchy.
besides, it was the citizen danton who in concert with the enemy abroad wanted to prevent the execution of the death penalty against marie antoinette.
if he appears here i shall undertake it to carry my head personally to the guillotine or to prove, that your own heads must roll at the people's feet.
silence in the name of the republic respect before the convention
we can't hold back the people they want to free danton what shall we do?
tell the people food has arrived from overseas it's lying in the harbour but has food really arrived?
no but tell them anyway telling them anything doesn't help anymore.
we must act then the convention shall the cleared and the judgment shall be read out before an empty house
marat is dead the king is dead and danton soon will be ... and they told me ...
i am to address myself to you it's about the 100 francs
greeting from the chief of fanuma lord of all the islands to the chief of bora bora
upon you and your people i confer the highest honor known to our islands
the maiden sacred to our gods has passed away and i decree that from your island shall come her successor
one i have chosen for her beauty, for her virtue, for her royal blood, she who is named reri
no law of the gods is more to be feared than that which guards the chosen one man must not touch her...
or cast upon her the eye of desire for in her honor rests the honor of all her people
she will be hunted down and sacrificed, matahari will be killed old hitu himself will die.
i shall not leave until i learn what the island is going to do.
no law of the gods is more to be feared than that which guards the chosen maid man must not touch her...
or cast upon her the eye of desire to break this tabu means death
over leagues of open sea seeking some island of the pearl trade...
where the white man rules and the old gods are forgotten
as the government desires above all things to avoid conflict between the islands under its rule,... it demands the arrest of this man and woman wherever found.
for their arrest, the government ofers a reward of five hundred frans.
i trust i have the government's approval in putting up a sign forbidding further diving in this place.
tabu three days i give you you return with me or matahi dies three days hitu
i have been so happy with you far more than i deserved the love you have given me i will keep to the last beat of my heart
across the great watters i will come to you in your dreams when the moon spreads its path on the sea farewell
it was he whom i overpowered in the hallway last night.
and from this moment on, mr ah kee and petrie will be inseparable.
rich or poor- when it comes to women, they've only got one idea in their head.
take those fellas out there today- when they didn't try to date you up... you could tell what they were thinking by the way they looked at ya.
but almost every fella we meet makes a pass at us.
when my girlfriend here said you wouldn't flirt, i just couldn't believe it.
and you'll be content to do it for the rest of your life... because you're just a good-time girl.
this is where you wanna be, with a lot of saps like that... yellin' their heads off and thinkin' they're enjoying themselves.
why, you can have your own little place in six months.
- but not if you let a woman get a hold on ya.
come here, and i'll show you what i had to do with it.
what do i care what you had to do with it?
jim come over to my house about an hour ago to see if you were there.
he was worried about you, so i came back here with him.
let him meet your family, like any decent fella would want to do.
and after a while, if i think he's all right... you can marry him.
you tell me that you'll wait, or i'll know that you gotta marry this guy.
and if that's the case, i don't want you in the house.
just because she stayed out until 4:00 in the morning and you suspect where she was.
well, i stayed out until 4:00 in the morning, and you knew where i was.
the first thing you have to learn is to get accustomed to your wife's tears.
i was over to your house, and they said you wasn't there.
the boss is gonna lend me a hundred bucks... and with the 650 i got saved up, i can swing the deal.
he'll let me have all the radios i want on time.
i been thinkin' about having my own store for over two years now.
and while i ain't much on tossing' this baloney... and all that mush stuff... a guy could have a worse wife than you.
he's always yelling about living in a tenement... and what a sin it is to have children if you can't afford to give 'em everything.
i don't think i read anything in the papers about him being born in the white house.
it's got sheets and pillowcases and beds and everything in it.
and the kitchen- we got a lot of pots and pans.
i asked a lot of the gang, and they're in on it too.
it's gonna be like, you know, one of those surprise parties.
they didn't have enough money to support themselves... so they go and have nine kids.
my old lady used to scrub floors in an office building.
4:00 every morning she went to work- sick or well, summer or winter.
i can see her goin'out when it was 20 below zero... with a cough that'd tear the heart out of ya.
nobody knows what a husband suffers when his wife has a baby... and a big juicy raspberry.
it must be great for a woman when everything is right- you know, when she can afford a doctor like that man burgess... and when she knows her husband wants the baby.
a guy wanted his radio fixed, so i did it on the side.
i should think you'd try gettin' home... with your wife goin' to the hospital and everything.
but a friend of mine's gettin' me on... in the preliminaries over at the empire club.
i get 10 bucks a round, and i don't mind takin' a beating for 40 bucks.
you and me is gonna have a good time, the same as always.
why, in six months we'll have forgotten we got a kid.
all i could get was that she had a good record,
was very quiet, and, of course, was known as "miss townsend."
you said you had a proposition to make to her, didn't you?
yes, but i think it would be most unwise to see her now.
i'm through with your dirty rag, and i'm through with you!
oh, i'm not ducking any of the blame for this thing.
that girl has wee bit of scotch in her, i bet you.
i think she's a wee bit of the devil in her.
otherwise you don't need to ask him in the first place.
still, i don't have to tell you what my business is.
come closer, please ladies and gentlemen so i can go easy on my voice.

but it's stomach in, chest out, and back on your feet, or you end up in a pauper's grave!
many among us have stared down grenades and shrapnel, stared right in their eyes.
but... this little gizmo here ― this gave me the idea.
they can knock it down and turn it on its head ― it always gets back on its feet.
you get knocked over, but you'll always get back on your feet ― as long as a man's got two legs to stand on.
but it's not a man's legs that matter, or his arms, but what he's got in here!

...'specially since you've got yourself a dame who's certainly no spring chicken.
don't let her snow you with her diamonds and her chauffeur.
i throw him a right hook, and he goes down for the count.
but he gets up and says 'okay, okay, how about a drink?
and when she gets some clothes, i can take her out in style.
how'd i look with a dame wearing cotton stockings and a crummy hat?
i'm sorry but mrs. wood has signed... an exclusive 10 year contract with mr. wallstein.
it was my idea... and my brother fernand took them to the dealer.
actually i was a pw in germany under the name of a dead pal.
i switched our papers... to get away from my wife, not the army.
madame, i could understand your inventing this story... of thieves in the night.
but the minions of the law have a right to the truth.
you've confessed that lulu asked you about money that evening... and i am informed that you quarreled violently.
she even told you she was leaving you for a cashier... with whom she was having an affair.
oh, i pulled a few fast ones like most kids... even the best kids.
sure i got money from women... but they were glad to give it to me.
i just gave advice to some girls who wanted to travel... get an education...
and it was better than scrubbing floors or working in a factory.
you've been with us a long time... and we've been highly satisfied with you.
your regrettable affair... with a notorious young lady... who just met with an untimely end... would be quite inexplicable... had you not incurred, on behalf of that young lady... expenses out of all proportion to your avowed income.
we do not believe in prying into our employees' private lives... provided, of course, they behave properly in their functions.
however, these expenses of yours did concern us... in so far as the money might have come out of our till.
my husband and i were listening to the street singers... when i saw him go up to madame pelletier's flat.
a few minutes later i went up and found the body.
he's a good sort, shy, getting on in years, and incredibly naive.
in sensitivity and intellect he's so superior to those around him that they take him for a complete idiot.
i really have to rough her up just to get her to bring me 50 francs!
but now... with legrand on the hook, i'll be on easy street.
i've always been off in my own world, ignorant about life.
i never knew what wretched lives women have to live, how one slipup is fatal for them, how there's always a man to take advantage of it.
this would all be quite inexplicable had you not incurred on that young lady's behalf expenses that far exceeded your known sources of income.
we do not pry into our employees' private lives, on the condition that in their professional capacity they behave correctly.
a few minutes later i took her mail up and found the body.
i remember wondering why he didn't say hello, because he could have taken her mail up with him.
he finished his military service in africa, where, if his superiors hadn't been too lenient in allowing him to return to civilian life, he'd still be sewing time in a penal battalion, and this tragedy would not have happened.
gentlemen of the jury, i can't believe that by now some doubt has not arisen in your minds.
all that matters here is the accused, and that seems to be me!
listen, i want to behave correctly and not shout, but i swear i'm not guilty!
let's fight together, only then can we work with any tranquillity.
then you speak with the head, if you are so sure.
after the university, i worked as a professor in the radio.
and 1 or 2 months ago, i opened a western restaurant.
thus is the shared fate of a pair well known in the ministry of education.
if you offered me this out of pity for my poverty, i would be offended.
you wouldn't be so weak, if while a student you had done more gymnastics.
his wife did not want him to work in something so humble, considered a shame.
may you all continue to prosper through hard work and self-reliance.
please relax and enjoy each other's company like in your student days.
we wanted very much to take a walking trip through the pyrenees.
but i was so busy we only got as far as niagara falls.
doesn't it mean anything at all to you that mother's been snubbed right and left ever since she came to new york?
now that she's come to her senses and given up trying you're starting it.
she hasn't any interests here and all her friends are in kansas city...
why don't you stay at home once in a while and keep her company instead of running around at charity bazaars?
if i can't have their entire output, i'll buy the factory.
i brought that up at the meeting, but they don't want to sell.
they've been around me so long they feel like my children.
then think of all the fun you can have spending it.
i'll look you up, and if that offer still holds we can do business.
are you sure i couldn't persuade you to cancel that contract?
just because you bought your way into a weekend doesn't mean that you belong.
berry may step outside of his own class to play around, but that's all it means.
i believed i was the one man for the tower building.
but i didn't believe you wanted to marry me just to crash the gate.
i thought you'd like the business better after you'd stuck to it awhile.
you have no idea, son, what it means to me to...
why, my family's happier than they've ever been in their lives.
you settled down, your mother and sister both found new absorbing interests
has it ever occurred to you that the buffalo... is practically extinct on manhattan island?
and the common mouse, if allowed to multiply, could in no time obliterate the entire earth.
i know, i'll roll up in some of that iron sheeting over there.
besides, i'm not supposed to sleep in a case like this.
i wanted to ask you if we couldn't get away for a while.
if we could perhaps take a little trip together, to europe or someplace.

i found the very lawyer to get your divorce for you.
and from all i hear it won't cost you any more than a smile or two.
mr. george spellbin was the name, elizabethtown, new york, dear sir.
i'm in receipt of your proposition offering me $1,000 to assist you in defense of your client accused of uh... of uh...
well, of course i don't believe i could be very much assistance, you see, until after the crime is committed.
i only thought, on account of your feeling for lonely wives....
but i came to you for a divorce, not a party.
well, of course, miss o'dare, if you cannot consider yourself a party of the first party...
well, you see, you must produce evidence that your husband has been uh... has been uh...
that is to say, you must explain that you have discovered him... and not only him, but uh...
see if you can pry it out of mrs. mantel, will you?
wouldn't it be better if i went to the bank, sir?
and, on your way to the bank, well, something got spilled on my coat last night.
drop in and leave it at the tailor's for me, will you?
i'm not going to leave this house until i get my big laugh.
it'll cost me 50 dollars and i want to be here to enjoy it, ha, ha, ha.
i'll mix you a bracer as only your madeline knows how.
and then we'll go for a nice, long drive in the country.
in fact, that's the only thing to do here you are your mail, ministerial director here you are
ministerial councilor dr. grimmeisen has been promoted to ministerial director say ... where's some entertainment around here?
# little uncle, you're so sympathetic to me # little uncle, i love you fanatically # and if there are thousands of men to chose from ... # then, little uncle, i chose only you!
# try one's luck, that's understandable # the longing stays eternally in the heart, so # everybody wants to feel love a bit for once # and often one says to a nice gentleman:
# little uncle, you're so sympathetic to me # little uncle, i love you fanatically # in your eyes lies a sunbeam of happiness # that's why one yearns for you, for your sweet baby glance
# little uncle, you're so sympathetic to me # little uncle, i love you fanatically # and if there are thousands of men to chose from ... # little uncle, then i only chose you!

# the most beautiful thing of the week is the weekend the lehmann!
good day, gentlemen good day, minister gentlemen, you know that in my ministry, patronage doesn't exist
i only acknowledge industriousness and efficiency the new ministerial director dr. grimmeisen asked today, for reasons of health, for his ... one ticket, 2nd class
during the night of 15 oct., in the village of uslada, the kulaks set fire to the stables of the activist yegor ilytch petrov which had been prepared for the storage of the grain.
in uslada the kulaks terrorized the poor and the activists who had formed a general head-quarter for food requisition.
anka, the daughter of the buoy's keeper nazar has slept with your son.
philip parfenich, don't get agitated or the cold kvas will make you ill.
jacob has come here to become a komsomolets and serve at the buoy, so that his father, that moneybag, can feel at ease.
it isn't right that the thief jakob silayev is sitting next to decent men.
for how much longer will you follow the policy of the silayevs?
it's not the village council's fault, the district has been too demanding.
but if they catch me i'm sure i won't survive it.
then you'll have another reason against the kulaks, and the evidence with the names.
my brother charlie and she don't like it, nor does my father, i can tell you.
mr. hornblower never to have found that land without those works.
i like you, but i don't like him, and i don't like his works.
you might realize that we've been here since elizabeth and rather naturally love the place.
i certainly would never have sold if i had known he was going to do this.
they talk about his having bought the centry, sir, to put up more chimneys there.
i've been thinking you want the village run your old-fashioned way, and i want it run mine.
i'll fancy there's not room for the two of us here.
g. and anyone in my path doesn't stay there lon or if he does, he stays there on my terms, and my terms are chimneys in the centry, where i need them.
it'll do you a power of good to know that you're not almighty.
well... you should hear both sides before you say that, missy.
there isn't anothe r side to turning out the jackmans after you promised... oh, dear me, yes.
chimneys and smoke, all the trees cut down, piles of pots all over the place.
you know, i was born here and my father and his and his.
i suppose such men pay no attention to what women are.
i'm fond of my husband i don't quite know why you spoke to me.
i only thought you might like to treat me as a human being.
really, i... i'd rather you left me alone just now, if you don't mind.
no, if that's the one, it's a relief oh, the bitter snobs.
i'll remember it in the account i've got with them don't say anything to charlie.
it conveys that centry added long meadow to the squire for 4,500.
now, mum, if hornblower puts his hand to that, he'll have been done in the eye and 6,000 out of pocket.
i'm sure i don't want to do that girl a hurt.
i only mention it because of course, you can't guarantee that it won't get out.
i've come to ask you point blank what you mean by writing me these letters.
i will discuss it in the presence of nobody, if you please.
mr. hornblower, you'd better decide that after hearing what it is.
we shall be quite ready to repeat it in her presence, but... we want to do as little harm as possible... oh.
the man who is to be divorced often visits an hotel with a strange woman.
i'm extremely sorry to have to say that your daughter-in-law, before her marriage, was in the habit of being employed as such a woman.
i've done him such a wrong i didn't realize it till after.
i thought meeting him was such a wonderful piece of good luck
he thought i was respectable, and that was such a relief, you can't think.
so i let him... well, after i married him, you see, i fell in love.
he came to me, and i told him i knew nothing.
he wouldn't take it and went for me, said he knew everything.
he shouldn't have threatened me and goaded me on like that.
besides, it's got out as a scandal, common talk in the village.
you better behave yourself, or i shall ask that you be shown out.
give me that deed... you little ruffian, i see it in your pocket.
you've ruined my son's married life, and you've killed... my grandchild.
i'm not staying in this cursed spot, but if ever i can do you or yours a hurt i will.
my brother charlie and she don't like it, nor does my father, i can tell you.
mr. hornblower never to have found that land without those works.
i like you, but i don't like him, and i don't like his works.

hillcrist told us when he sold the land to you that it was on condition that we and the others shouldn't be turned out.
yes, well, i didn't think i'd need the cottages then, but now, i must have them for my workmen.
but miss mullins would never sell the centry, would she, dawker?
i heard she wants to, and hornblower won't stick at the price, sir.
of all the blatant things i ever heard said... well, as we are speaking plainly...
i've been thinking you want the village run your old-fashioned way, and i want it run mine.
well, bad words break no bones, and they're wonderful for hardening the heart.
if it wasn't for a lady's presence, i could give you a specimen or two.
well, i don't like you, and i don't want to put up with your attitude.
you've had things your own way too long, and now you're not gonna have them any longer.
you seem to me a poor sort of creature that's bound to get left with your gout and your dignity.
but of course, you can make yourself pretty disagreeable before you're done.
there isn't anothe r side to turning out the jackmans after you promised... oh, dear me, yes.
why, they don't matter a row of gingerbread compared to the schemes i've got for bettering this neighborhood.
you'll just have to learn that a man who's worked as i have, risen as i have, and who knows the world is the proper judge of what's right and wrong.
i'll answer to god for my actions, not to you, young lady.
it's going to be half interesting for you, not for us.
look here, jill, is there anything between you and this young what's-his-name rolf?
i don't mean any tosh about love's young dream, but i do like being friends.
i want to enjoy things, and you can't do that when everybody's on the hate.
i'm fond of my husband i don't quite know why you spoke to me.
i only thought you might like to treat me as a human being.
from the ground... from the ground, you see that chap i told you about come down from town.
he's a fellow who can tell us all about young mrs.
he says if you want to go about 6,000, blow your nose once.
when you blow it the second time, he'll take it as a signal to stop bidding altogether.
you make me pay $9,500 for a bit of land not worth 4, and you think i'm not going to get back on me?
why, i'm going on with as little consideration as if you were a family of black beetles.
but we shall still have the power to disclose that secret at any time?
yeah, but things may happen you can't bring home to him.
i will discuss it in the presence of nobody, if you please.
mr. dawker knows just as much as i do, and more.
, and what you've got to say if it's not just a trick to see me again, you will say to her face.
mr. hornblower, you'd better decide that after hearing what it is.
you daren't tell the secret so long as i've got it.
well, then, you go your own way, and we'll go ours.
can't you tell him something to put him back to thinking it's all right?
i've done him such a wrong i didn't realize it till after.
i thought meeting him was such a wonderful piece of good luck
after all i'd been through i'm not such a bad lot.
so i let him... well, after i married him, you see, i fell in love.
oh, if i had of before, perhaps i wouldn't have dared.
but he's bound to go on, because he knows there's something.
a man isn't going to be satisfied when there's something he suspects about his wife.
the only thing is to tell him something positive, something he'll believe that's not too bad.
like my having been a lady clerk for those people who came here this morning and having been dismissed on suspicion of taking money.
dawker... that my agent happens to know the firm who in the old days employed your wife.
i should greatly prefer not to say anymore, especially as we don't believe the stories.
he wouldn't take it and went for me, said he knew everything.
then he started to threaten me, and i lost my temper, and i told him.
besides, it's got out as a scandal, common talk in the village.
oh, not the facts, of course, but quite enough to cook their goose here.
you should get a job at the opera as a chorist.
you're surely ignorant of the fact that you have before you the president, the vice-president, and the artistic director of the piggy bank
# le ciel n'est plus noir, mesdames messieurs il semble être tout bleu # ma chambre est petite, je le sais, mais elle me parait un palais # je me sens très heureuse tout d'un coup, je reprends goût à tout
# et tout ça parce qu'un chef de bureau m'a prise pour dactylo # je vois la vie en rose, en rose, en rose # tout se métamorphose, tout me parait charmant # il est des jours moroses, moroses, moroses
# neither rockefeller or carnegie, # but we don't care, we live happily # we're richer, why?
because # we have a piggy-bank like the little children # we have a piggy-bank with pennies inside # into our piggy-bank, like the little children # each day, naturally, we put money inside # sometimes for a whim we break our piggy-banks
# j'écoute ces deux voix i'une me fait rougir d'émoi # l'autre me fait pleurer, pourquoi?
# et pourtant toujours # la nuit et le jour obéir à deux voix, tour à tour
yes, director, i'd like to talk to you, but ... in private.
you know, i don't have any secrets from my office manager.
a very pretty town, a very nice climate for a secretary ...
there's a train leaving at 7 o'clock in the morning ...
no, wait a second -- you know, you've been looking a bit tired lately.
how about taking advantage of this trip to rest a few days?
you must have made a bargain deal with the barracks next door.
next time i'll paint them black, then you'll take them for caviar.
is it so ridiculous to want the most out of life?
you'll make it -- if the little piggies don't eat you first.
# my room is tiny as you see but it's a paradise to me
# all at once i feel light-hearted happy days for me have started
# an office manager's to thank – i'm typist at a savings bank
# my path is full of roses, of roses, of roses
# my path is full of roses, of roses, of roses

only two things for a soldier to do when he's a stranger like you.
that's get drunk and get mixed up with the wrong kind of women.
and he's willing to step up and do his duty, by king and country.
and what's more, i'm prepared to be your bridesmaid and help you blush.
all you have to do is go through with the ceremony collect his separation allowance, and live in luxury.
then there's your insurance, if he gets knocked off in action.
but that shouldn't bother you with only one on your hands.
look here, i put you in the way of a good thing.
i had an argument with old plumsteed once on the very subject.
he took the point of view that carriages are more comfortable but cars were bigger.
talking about acting reminds me, i had a niece who wanted to go on the stage.
i don't think anything came of it, i think she got married or something or other.
well, you can't do everything, as old plumsteed used to say.
i suppose this business of acting isn't so easy as it looks.
of course, it's none of my business, sir, what you do and what you don't do but i know her and i know her kind to make cost.
and if you take my advice, when you do see her, you'll take that receipt and you'll throw it in her painted face and then you'll have no more to do with her.
once i get to the front, i'll arrange my pay and everything and then, if anything happens to me, well, you'll be all right.
roy do you know why i've been trying not to marry you?
you ain't got a chance with a classy dame like that or anyone like her!
well, i'm not going to be a bellhop all my life.
we've never been able to give him the happiness... the simple joys and pleasures that should come to every young boy.
all his life long... his young eyes have seen only misery and evil.
even the very strongest among us... will stray from thy path without happiness or contentment.
bestow some of thy manifold blessings upon him, so that the light may fold into his troubled spirit... that he may be led aright.
sorry i couldn't see you before... but i've been away most of the time since your arrival.
so they out you in charge of the stamping dept., eh?
i've been trying to get a word with you ever since you came to the factory.
there's a rule there that says the head of a department... can't have anything to do with a girl that works for him.
there isn't one of them as nice as you are, roberta.
you're different now from the way you are in the factory.
as if you had no use for any of the girls.
sometimes when the pressman comes up to you and you're not expecting it... you jump and look kind of scared.
what is it about me that's made you act like this?
up until a few months ago you were as nice as any human being could be!
you should have seen mama's face when she found out you were up here!
we'll have to be more careful than ever until october when we're back in town!
i'm doing the very best i can now and please be patient!
i'll either come for you or arrange for you to meet me, and... don't be using my name like you did now!
you know, it seems so odd to be registering as mr. and mrs. carl graham... and mr. and mrs. clifford golden in those places.
it made me feel as though you didn't want to marry me at all.
i want every proper step taken to find out whether he is or not!
if he isn't, to defend him to the limit of the law, but no more than that!
and for that reason, we've invented this other story about a change of heart.
it's not quite as true as yours... but it is true that you experienced a change of heart in that boat!
they charge that he willfully and with malice, cruelty and deception... murdered and then sought to conceal forever from the knowledge... and justice of the world, the body of roberta alden.
the daughter of a farmer who has for years resided in mimico county.
they charge that this same clyde griffiths... before this crime was committed, had for weeks... plotted the plan and then in cold blood, executed it!
gentlemen... it will not take me long to picture the type of girl this was... whose life was so cruelly blotted out!
over a year ago, she went to the city of lycurgus.
in order that by working with her own hands... she might help her family!
she loved him with that love which is the crowning mystery of the human brain... and the human heart!
it transcends in all its strength and its weakness... all fear of shame... or punishment even from the immortal throne above!
and so loving him... in the end she gave him all any woman can give the man she loves.
friends, this has happened millions of times in this world of ours.
but, in january last... this girl, who is now dead in her grave... was compelled to come to this defendant... and tell him she was about to become a mother.
we shall prove to you that then and later... she begged him to go away with her and make her his wife.
gentlemen of the jury... the individual who is on trial here for his life... is a mental as well as a moral coward.
not a criminal... of a crime so product of the darkest vomiting of hell... that the district attorney would have you believe.
do you slay a man because he's a victim of fear?
it was mental and moral cowardice... that prevented him once the waters of the lake... accidently closed over her... from making public her death.
another bellboy asked me out on a ride in a car that a friend of his borrowed.
we were hurrying back to work, and he ran over and killed... a little girl and... then he got frightened and kept on going and... the car got smashed and.... after that i was afraid to stay in kansas city, so i ran away.
don't try to make yourself any better or any worse... she is dead and you may be eventually.... if these 12 gentlemen so decide.
the truth for the peace of your own soul is the best!
you know, clyde... some here have the opinion that it was a bluff on your part... which originated in your mind about this time... to conceal your identity and hers... and to lure her up to one of those lonely lakes in the adirondacks... and drown her in cold blood!
in order that you might be free to marry this miss x!
and had you made up your mind by then just what you wanted to do?
i was going to tell her the real reason for changing as i had.
that i was in love with another girl and couldn't help it!
and that if she still wanted me after that, i'd quit my job and marry her.
then she began crying and said maybe it was best for her not to live any longer.
then i told her i was sorry and willing to do the right thing!
but how will a demonstration on a man of mr. newcomb's build... going to show what happened in the case of a girl the size of miss alden?
well, then we'll have a girl the size and weight of miss alden.
that's the way it looked to me when i came up!
well now, after the boat turned over and you came up... just where were you in relation to the boat?
as i say, i didn't notice when i first came up!
about as far as from here to the railing, i guess.
i was dazed when i came up and... besides she was striking about and screaming so...
do you mean to say that when you could swim 500 feet to shore afterward... that you couldn't have swum to this boat and pushed it to her... in time for her to save herself?
but you don't know that because you were so anxious to get out on the water!
and you didn't expect to come back and pay for it anyway!
and if i bring 2 witnesses to swear that on july 3... 3 days before you left lycurgus... you were seen by them to go into the lycurgus house... and take 4 or 5 circulars from the rack there?
will you still say it must have been the renfrew house in utica?
- may i ask your honor to defer sentence for a week to 10 days?
if council desires, i will listen to arguments on the matter tomorrow.
it is ordered that within 10 days after this day's session of court... the sheriff of this county deliver you, together with the warrant of this court... to the warden of the state prison at auburn.... where you shall be kept in solitary confinement... until the week beginning monday, the 28th day of january.
and upon some day in the week so appointed... said agent and warden of the state prison of the state of new york... is commended to do execution upon you, clyde griffiths.... in the mode and manner prescribed by the laws of the state of new york.
i'm going to tell you something i couldn't tell the court.
i didn't kill roberta but when she fell in the water, i could have saved her.
and while we were trying to save the souls of others... we were letting you go astray.
we never taught you to be brave and fight sin like a man.
and you can fool some of the people some of the time.
but you can fool some of the people some of the time.
and you can lose some of your things all the time.
but you can't lose some of the things some of the time.
when i married you, it was because it was the only way i could get you.
why, i even said to the other fellows that when i'm tired of you, i'll get a divorce and kick you out.
in a year or so the girl returned and mighty proud was she.
she told how she'd done her duty in the great war or the sea.
she told how she picked up the wounded and held each one to her breast.
so the wood workers got together and made her a cedar chest.
i shall provide you with a magnificent home, servants, all the money you may need.
what appeals to me is the chance to serve my country.
had i caught you in my country, i'd have had you shot without hesitation.
but we're both alive yet, and you can make my last few hours in vienna very pleasant.
if you kept me here another minute, i'd not only be in danger of losing my life, but of falling in love with you, you devil!
a few thousand feet higher up we might find better weather, but i doubt it.
i'd like to share my last few hours on earth with you.
do you think you can fool me as easily as you did the adjutant?
i don't know whether i can get away, but there seem to be plenty of planes outside.
if it weren't going to be more exciting out there, i'd be tempted to stay with you.
you had a chance to redeem your unfortunate life in the service of your country.
can you give one reason you failed to take advantage of that privilege?
what appeals to me is the chance to serve my country.
it is now my duty to point out to you that the profession of a spy is the most ignoble calling on earth.
if you kept me here another minute, i'd not only be in danger of losing my life, but of falling in love with you, you devil!
a few thousand feet higher up we might find better weather, but i doubt it.
do you think you can fool me as easily as you did the adjutant?
i give you my word of honour that i no longer want anything but to be with you.

of all of our best workers, and all the workers in general.
all the people available around the mines shall participate in the common effort to face the lack of supplies.
i, one of the best workers at snizjanka, from mine n°9
i promise to exceed by the end of the year, last year's incentive of 28000 tons!
it must be ensured that the working masses in the mines are included in making leeway.
i, a shock worker from pit #1, promise to overfulfill the plan till the year's end... 28 000 tons!
i, a shock worker from pit #9, promise to exceed the quota this year and to deliver 28 000 tons!
in the five-year plan's third year of struggle, the donbass' miners must bear in mind that their socialist country's primary industries depend on their efforts.
we miss so much in life by not doing what we're really feeling.
didn't you ever want to trip a waiter when he's carrying a tray full of dishes?
i could never tell you how wonderful she's been to me.
she works so hard to pay for my schooling over here and...
from near or far wherever you are come to me, come to me in answer to my call.
somewhere on a hill there's a whippoorwill calling with me as the shadows fall.
we miss so much in life by not doing the things we want to do.
if you feel like doing something, why shouldn't you do it?
and the coachman, who is a good man... wishes to know whether you wouldn't mind... continuing the journey after sunrise.
i am very sorry, but at midnight... a carriage will be waiting for me at the borgo pass.
anyway, what i mean to say is that i am not afraid.
i have already told him that it is a business matter.
"for those who are already dead let us empty our glasses...
"and let us cheer for the one who must die first."
i am going to england with dr. seward to study renfield's case.
and perhaps i will prove to you... that the superstition of times gone by... may become a scientific truth in our times.
the wings of flies, sir... represent the aerial power of the psychic faculties.
there is more to this fellow than meets the eye, doctor.
and it looked as if the whole room filled up with mist.
it was so thick... that i could hardly see the light by my bedside.
and the physicians of this country as well as the police... will believe that very thing.
what gives vampires their power... is that people refuse to believe in them.
but professor, according to your own theory... the vampire must return to his grave before dawn.
he must return to his native land... which is where he was buried.
that flycatcher has escaped again... and he's capable of any foolishness.
dr. seward and his famous scholar are in the abbey... chasing vampires.
look, mr. harker... if there is a brave man after my job, he can have it.
i am going to look for work at another asylum... where the crazy people are nice and reasonable.
both confirm that it is a beautiful lady... dressed in white... whose modus operandi is to offer... candy to her victim.
she then lures the victim to a deserted corner... where she delicately bites the victim's neck."
we have already put wolfbane in this room and in your bedroom... to free you from dracula, in case he comes back.
she's going to be free of him... because either she returns with me to london or i call the police.
seward, my friend, i must be in charge here... or whatever i do will be useless.
miss eva must keep this branch of wolfbane with her in her bed.
the legend tells of an ancient family... that disappeared over five centuries ago... and was said to be made up of vampires.
since i discovered, by chance... that dracula cast no reflection in the mirror, and that in addition... three large boxes had been sent to carfax abbey... and since i also knew that a vampire must sleep during the day... in his native earth...
i understood at once that dracula had to be the person... whom renfield calls "master."
one of the undead who has been able... to prolong his life beyond its natural limits... by feeding on the blood of other living creatures.
renfield, you will force me to put you in a straitjacket.
i am afraid that it will be useless at this point.
from now on... any mental suggestion that you receive from me... must be carried out.
whenever i want you to do something... it has to be done.
and now that you've learned what you've learned... it would be wise to return to your country.
i intend to stay and protect those... you would like to destroy.
would you like me to offer you a handful of them?
do not forget, van helsing, that over the years... those who crossed my path... paid for it with their lives... and some of them in very unpleasant ways.
you shall not move your hand unless i want you to.
take out whatever you have in there and put it in this box.
i must warn you that today is st. walpurga's day, which is considered a bad omen around here.
and the coachman, who is a good man, wishes to know whether you wouldn't mind continuing the journey after sunrise.
with all that, i thought i had come to the wrong place.

dracula's name is associated with a legend still told among his fellow countrymen.

a red mist spread over the lawn and came towards me like a raging fire.
then the master parted the mist and revealed before my eyes thousands of rats, their eyes inflamed like his own, but smaller.
and they seem to be so close, as if you could reach out and touch them.
would you like me to offer you a handful of them?
you shall not move your hand unless i tell you to.
take out whatever you have in there and put it in this box.
he wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
well, i'm sorry, but there's a carriage... meeting me at borgo pass at midnight.
it reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle in transylvania.
the abbey always reminds me of that old toast about lofty timbers.
i may be able to bring you proof... that the superstition of yesterday... can become the scientific reality of today.
but, professor, renfield's cravings... have always been for small living things.
a most distinguished scientist whose name we know, even in the wilds of transylvania.
i had a frightful dream a few nights ago, and i don't seem to be able to get it out of my mind.
yes, and that is what your english doctors would say, your police.
the strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.
during the hours of the day, it must rest in the earth in which it was buried.
but then, if dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night... to transylvania, and that's impossible.
i promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
if you can save lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
and knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
i am convinced that this dracula is no legend but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
i have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things, little-known facts, which the world is perhaps better off not knowing.
i know, but, professor, all i want is to get mina away from all of this.
dracula boasts that he has fused his blood with that of miss mina.
in life, she will now become the foul thing of the night that he is.
i must warn you that today is st. walpurga's day... which is considered a bad omen around here.

once you have given him this message... you will remember nothing.

take anne out somewhere and be sure that you're seen by a lot of people whom you know, in case you do need an alibi.
in the morning, they'll find the place robbed and the safe open.
they'll pick $40,000 worth of non-negotiable bonds lying in the alley.
they'll figure that the thieves threw them there, keeping only the stuff they could dispose of.
i went into this thing with my eyes open because i loved you, bert.
i always have, but it's taken this to make me realize it.
i haven't any use for, and jail is both of them.
you play ball with me, and your worrying days will be over.
you've got to get used to him and get to like him
you're going to see a lot of him in the next few months.
you'd be in for an awful lot of grief if ever you married me.
i'd be holding out or pulling a fast one on you
tell joe he can expect a visit from me in the morning.
have him take me to his own private office when i get there.
by a lot of people in case you do need an alibi.
in the morning, they'll find the place robbed and the safe open.
i tried to call you up myself, but i didn't know where to get hold of you.
i guess i was a little tight that day i met you at the ritz.
well, all i know is that some four years ago i quit being a newspaperman in america.
now i'm over here to see if i can really write.
unfortunately, there are a few americans living in this town who are not exactly all they might be.
frankly, there's only a handful, but they're what i've come to see you about.
'"tis a pity that some of our compatriots are so naive and lacking in worldly knowledge.
"surely mr. harold taylor, the soft coal baron of stratford, pennsylvania,
if i'm going to get back here and take you to dinner by 7:00 and then catch that train for london,
i've got to get home and pack and send a couple of wires.
i know you have to go, frank, but it's that kind of thing that keeps me from making up my mind.
i don't want to-- to get engaged to a man who thinks of nothing but business all the time.
i think i can guarantee you this is the last you'll hear of the matter.
from what they say of this fellow, he seems to be living from hand to mouth, so i'm sure your donation will be more than enough to shut him up.
just because frank and i grew up together and are fond of each other--
well, in my time, you didn't need much more than to grow up together and be fond of each other.
of course, a fellow would have to watch his step, but...
i'll bet it'd be a lot of fun once you got to know the place.
do you know what time the elevator man told me you got in last night?
there's a fortune waiting for any elevator man who can't tell time.
she's just a babe in the woods-- especially for spade henderson.
the waiter reports that mrs.jowitt... picked up spade at henry's bar an hour ago.
i get seasick so easy, and the thought of having to sit up for three hours... while i'm being tossed around on that channel doesn't make me any too happy.
sometimes i think i'd have been better off if i'd spent my summer in pittsburgh.
he was going to fly this afternoon, but they called off the service on account of fog.
now he has a ticket on the boat, but no stateroom.
you know, these folks want to see all the sights marked on the picture postcards.
i'm beginning to think they've been getting the wrong kind of postcards.
if i can, uh, relieve him of any part of it--
if you could take mary around a bit, that would be great.
say, if he came across that easy to keep his own name out of the papers, what do you suppose he'd be willing to part with for his dear little niece?
you know, when i was getting the dope on them, i had a feeling we were blowing into the wrong end of the horn.
this is the first time i've ever asked you to break that funny little rule of yours.
oh, it's been all over between us for a long time, i know, but what do you say?
you've been doing everything but wearing a plume in your hat.
the first thing i know, you'll be helping old ladies across the street.
if i had my wish about this party, we'd never have left the bar in the first place.
the idea of spending a lovely afternoon like this looking at horses.
but it keeps you out in the open air, uncle harry.
well, i had all the open air i wanted back home.
you've been doing pretty well dodging monuments and paintings, uncle harry, without a guide.
well, as i remember the old u.s.a., there's plenty of monuments right there.
if miss harper knows of a new place in montmartre that's opening up,
i'm sure it's the kind of place that you would like.
i don't want to go to the opera if you don't want to.
well, i wouldn't like to have it generally known, but the opera i want to go to doesn't exist.
i should think you'd never want to finish writing your novel if it meant you had to leave paris.
i've had a guilty feeling these last few days that i've made you neglect your work.
in everything we do, whether we know it or not, there's always a collaborator.
in this case, my hero has... fallen in love with a girl he's just met.
suppose he's not the man she thinks he is, that he seems to be in the opening chapters.
i may have to end it as i first planned it.
it, uh, might be a good idea if you were to take these walks on some other nights... than when we have to get out this beautiful little weekly of yours.
there may not be many more nights when we have to get out this beautiful little weekly of mine.
to spare you the trouble of asking a lot of questions,
i'll try to tell it to you as compactly as i can.
there's not a chance in the world for a girl like that to be in love with you.
i suppose you neglected to tell her who you really are and what you really do.
i don't think i could've stood it if you hadn't had some kind of flaw, michael.
it's funny, you're trying to tell me you're not worthy of me, when all the time-- oh, mary.
i'll bring a couple of cops along for protection... and to pull you in as soon as the ceremony is performed.
there are a lot of things the cops in this town would like to know, and i'm just the little lady that can tell them.
you are what you are and you're never going to be able to change, because there are a lot of people you've done things to who won't let you.
no matter if you stayed honest from now on until you died.
she can spend five years, 1 0 years of her life as mrs. convict trevor, or whatever one of your aliases they get you under.
if i don't squeal, it doesn't have to be me, something will pop up one of these days and get you... and you know it.
it's down there in black and white just like that other item.
you can suit yourself about believing it, but that's the way it gets printed unless--
and in the second place, the item gets printed whether you do or not.
i've heard about your kind of scoundrel, but i really didn't believe he existed.
if the paper is wrong, i'm sure it will publish a retraction.
unfortunately, however, a retraction is seldom read... by all the people who read the original statement.
i don't see what we can do, mary, except pay him.
and the sooner you take care of it, the sooner i can be on my way.
the sooner you get out ofhere, the better it suits me.
why did you tell me about yourself if you didn't mean what you said?
suppose someone had seen you with me before i had everything ready.
they might have found out who i was and have told you.
as a result of information supplied by a friend, we have today established the identity of the editor of the american scandal sheet, which has annoyed so many of your compatriots.
however, the french government has no desire... to fill its jails with such undesirable foreigners.
you would be conferring a favor upon this man... by letting him know that the police will call upon him tomorrow at this time.
they would be pleased if they were unable to arrest him... because by that hour, he had left the frontiers of france behind him for all time.
i wasn't going to let you go through with holding them up, after i found out how much you cared for her.
i sold those platinum bracelets of mine yesterday and wired the money to my brother.
and now all i can think of is that it's four days before we get back to pittsburgh.
the head man on the ship says we reach cape town in about 10 days.
if you run out of those, there's more where they come from.
brother, before the night's over, you'll be buying them from me.
well, nick the barber can shave them a little closer than you can.
just take a look at those decks i sent out for.
louisville bound with a bank roll big enough to choke a cow.
i guess after tonight, i'll send the boys back home a few thou.
every time we raid nick, he proves he doesn't own the place.
he's got a phony front for every one of his joints.
you know, he reminds me of a little sawmill we had in our old hometown in irontown.
it had a big whistle, every time the whistle blew the sawmill stopped running.
i just kicked your stool pigeon right out of my office.
if you don't quit messing around my affairs, i'm gonna kick you right out of town.
the sentence for blackmail, miss graham is two to 10 years in the penitentiary.
but you can avoid that if you'll just do what i ask you.
well, nick the barber can shave them a little closer than you can.
just take a look at those decks i sent out for.
you know, he reminds me of a little sawmill we had in our old hometown in irontown.
it had a big whistle, every time the whistle blew the sawmill stopped running.
we watched every step both of you made for a week.
the sentence for blackmail, miss graham is two to 10 years in the penitentiary.
while if you went to the penitentiary for a long sentence...
but he's the only the person that's ever been kind to me.

i'd rather see him on the gallows than in the arms of another.
oh, smith, you're such a darling, such a fine, upstanding man.
they might just chop them up to make their steak tartare
the poorest man in london and the wealthy mack the knife... - shouldn't they join forces?

gee, it follows me home and pounds into my head like a hammer.
do you know what i'd do if i had a lot of money?
i friend of mine runs a big business and i was talking to him today about you.
he thinks there might be an opening in his office for you.
gee, this place was just a city of millions of strangers until you came along.
isn't it funny how you go along and you meet all kinds of people... and then all of a sudden you...
i've been married eighteen years and there's tricks to all trades.
it's a good thing to call up the office when your husband's working overtime.
the room was kind of dark and i thought i'd brighten it up a little.
what's the use of trying to change brown monstrosities into pink monstrosities?
how many times have i told you never to telephone me at the office?
you never can tell when those switchboard girls are listening in.
i hope you'll forgive my dropping in like this without any warning or notice.
you can always drop in on me without any warning or notice.
to tell you the truth i was so tired i could have slept standing up.
oh, i dreamt of clocks chiming and i smoked lots of your cigarettes.
i would rather have gone to prison than have this happen to me.
do you wonder now why i kept our marriage a secret?
will you laugh in front of his face before i'm through with him?
you lied to me from the start and you've been lying ever since.
when the wind blows over the sea it carries my song to my homeland.
carries it to you, asks you for me, how you are in our homeland.
step right up, revered messrs officers und sailors russians, italians, french.
step right up, whoever's got soldier's blood in his veins and wants to see something, will find under the colors of her majesty the queen of pontenero all that his heart desires.
her majesty's cruiser persemon... is to be cleared for immediate departure...
directive und instructions for the mission will be issued later today directly by the queen...?
you find on all coasts flowering roses and for every one of them a thousand others for replacement.
it's so sweet to sleep in the harbour, but soon we have to say goodbye!
well if you already know, smart aleck, i don't have to tell you.
and now i should all of a sudden become a water chauffeur for a dame?
in the long run my dear love my heart can be no anchoring place.
you find on all coasts flowering roses and for every one of them a thousand others for replacement.
it's so sweet to sleep in the harbour, but soon we have to say goodbye!
this is the love of the sailors, from the lowest and the meanest man up to the captain.
it's so sweet to sleep in the harbour, but soon we have to say goodbye!
this is the love of the sailors, from the lowest and the meanest man up to the captain.
but this is no book for a respectable woman - give it to me.
you're right - a respectable woman throws a book like that out of the window!
soon it'll be five, now we soon have to look out for something convenient!
of course - at five o'clock the ladies are all gathered at the café de paris.
now what'll we do with the dough, what'll we do with the dough?
i'll buy me the one hundred prettiest girls in the world.
and the queen, the ole quee-ny, in the meantime found another fascinating occupation:
she sits at the station of livorno and she's waiting till the cows come home!
the qui-qua-queen of pontenero has an empty head and an empty portemonnairo.
for her - fights no torero and salutes no caballero, in the land of pontenero everyone is a scroungero!
well, with your stupid bucket you won't get that war fleet off our back either!
what war fleet... what the hell are you jabbering, you idiot!
you couldn't be brought to your senses, you... you silly boy.
craddie, give me ten slaps in the face, but don't be mad at me anymore.
you find on all coasts flowering roses and for every one of them a thousand others for replacement.

it has reached my ears that certain rules are being disobeyed
letters are being sent without prior approval with unfounded complaints about the school
i want to get up and come to you but i know that i can't
and i think of when i get older and have to leave the school and every night you will kiss other girls

famous american jewelry collector tobias jefferson (who just acquired the famous halifax emerald in antwerp) has arrived with wife and daughter, and will be staying at hotel splendid
i told you, the boss won't take no for an answer!
i should have worn the blue dress, it makes me look younger.
- well, if the opportunity arises, i will grab umm, i mean, i will acquire a gemstone or two.
so, as a connoisseur you will be interested in my latest purchase, the halifax emerald.
yes, i've heard about it - supposed to be a nice little rock.
but it's not just a little rock, it's a rare gem!
- no, my gripe is that they are far too lenient.
if i had my way, those criminals would hang - to say the least.
i have reviewed your file, and you are currently not indicted with anything.
does that mean i can walk out of here, right now?
- ahem, they... umm and then one more bucket, and another one...
you go where you want to, but i will go to bed now.
that's the stone that has been stolen from the american gentleman next door!
you must return it immediately without anyone noticing, or they'll arrest you!
think of it, louis, not an acre left out of that two million.
the only spot i wanted was the ground we stood on, and...
- with flowers and trees... and morning glories growing all over.
it'll be our first real home, alone... and i want you to be happy all the way, sugar.
all this in six weeks right up from the raw prairie.
next time you come here, chief, you go through the roof.
i've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it.
i've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers.
and while i know my bible from cover to cover... and many of its passages are graven on my heart... this, fellow citizens, is the very first time... that i have ever been required to speak the word of god in his temple.
for any shelter, however humble or however sordid... no offense, grat... becomes, when his word is spoken in it...
but this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized.
i intended to announce from this pulpit... this platform... that i would publish this knowledge... in the first issue of the oklahoma wigwam... coming off the press next thursday, thereby starting my paper off with a bang.
well, i tried to be a farmer, but i had to give up the land.
the neighbors' wives formed a vigilance committee, and i left by request.
and you stood there actually talking to her, holding her hand... after she'd stolen your land in the run, too.
she wanted that land because she was trying to give up her way of living...
i know a lot of people scattered over oklahoma... that shouldn't cast a stone at her.
don't you quote your bibles and magdalenes at me, yancey cravat!
cravat could use that dollar to buy the new baby a rattle.
and a pair of rubber boots till the streets get paved.
yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much.
the garden looks fine, miss sabra, and them morning glories sure is climbing.
i reckon louis hefner's gonna have a run on wallpaper soon.
i want to get a nice little dainty rosebud pattern... for donna's new bedroom.
- old ben harrison'll be tickled pink... for getting rid of the last real bandit of the country.
i wouldn't be surprised if they appoint you governor of the territory.
well, i must be getting back to the store... before a customer brings in a coyote and bites the clerk.
- did you fix the salad like i told you, ruby?
we thank thee for thy blessings, o god... and pray that thou wilt watch over us all while we are separated.
spare our dear one... and bring us all together again... in safety and happiness.
this woman, a viper lurking in our midst... a sinister menace to public decency.
gentlemen... if i were in the jury box... if i were judge on the bench... yea, even though i sat... in the governor's chair...
turn your eye to that figure that has so deservedly held your attention.
this gifted person, mr. patrick leary... is the only man in the glorious and brilliant southwest... nay, in this magnificent nation... of whom it may actually be said that he is able to strut sitting down.
gentlemen of the jury... you have heard the prosecution's cruel attack on this defenseless woman.
bred in the gentle surroundings of a pure home... such as you would choose for your own daughters... this innocent girl, bereft by death of her loved ones... was left alone in the world.
in that hour of dark terror came a wolf in sheep's clothing, gentlemen.
a wretch, posing as a friend... false promises, lies, deceit so palpable... that it would have fooled no one but a young girl... such as you, yourself, mrs. wyatt, in your maidenly days.
well, i managed to get a position as schoolteacher and then... someone found out about me, and i...
and they blamed you instead of the man, and you were forced to get out.
well, i got work in another town as a nurse girl.
but the same thing again and again, wherever i went, always the same.
he is afraid of your knowing all the pitiful facts of her life.
gentlemen, an immortal soul has been tortured on the rack... and i ask you as men with blood in your veins... who have helpless women in your own homes... to think of one of your innocent, dear ones... wronged and oppressed, like this poor defenseless woman.
they've talked about you, said everything about you... and i wouldn't believe them.
but now, what do you expect me to think of you and that woman?
maybe, if things had been different, she might be like i am... married, safe.
i'm thankful i've got you, that we've got each other... and our home.
stand still, donna... or i'll never have this dress finished for you to take back to school.
sabra, darling, if you think i'm going back to new york finishing school... wearing a homemade fizzle like this, you're seriously mistaken.
i must say, mr. levy, your stock is quite up- to-date.
you'll have my orders in at once for my new house?
we can fix things so we'd all make plenty of money.
now, you see, the indians... they aren't competent to take care of their own... oil leases, and claims, and income.
a prophet is never without honor, save in his own country.
you could be one of the greatest figures in this nation.
well, then i say you won't print it, not in these columns.
when you take my name off and put yours in its place... you'll be editor of this paper.
a relative of mine, a fellow named moses, wrote the ten commandments.
ladies and gentlemen... as chairman of the oklahoma progressive state committee, i greet you.
we are here to congratulate our new member of congress... and to welcome our noted visitors... the senators and congressmen from washington... who will accompany us on a tour of inspection to the bowlegs oil field... and also to announce the arrival and the unveiling of a statue... to commemorate the oklahoma pioneer.
and now it is my privilege to ask you... to drink to the health of our guest of honor.
my poor words could add nothing... to the sterling achievements of our fellow townswoman... who has risen to eminence in oklahoma... and finally in the councils of the nation.
i therefore call upon the one you are waiting to hear... our new congresswoman, sabra cravat.
my friends... today i stand before you in a new responsibility.
time has passed for many of us... since we first met in the early days of osage.
time that mellows our hearts and tells us all the truth.
to many others among you... including our distinguished guests from washington...
i'm sorry, this afternoon, that i cannot present to you... my husband... but he's out of the city.
i know he would be glad to be here to greet you.
the women of oklahoma... have helped build a prairie wilderness into the state of today.
the holding of public office by a woman is a natural step.
yeah, i've got a wife and son, four years old now.
aye, this is like a fourth of july celebration on judgment day.
a new empire... and i want to help build it for you.
and we'll have just the prettiest little house we can find, too.
they have plenty of combination stores out here until the town gets larger.
if you've a mind, you can fly out of there, elmer.
yancey, our womenfolk think it's about time... that some contact be established between the town and providence.
there ain't a minister here, and we've come to ask you... to conduct divine service next sunday.
it was so nice of your husband to conduct this service this morning.
about time the intellectual life of this community was stirred up a bit.
i've been required to speak on various occasions on many subjects.
i've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it.
i've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers.
and while i know my bible from cover to cover... and many of its passages are graven on my heart... this, fellow citizens, is the very first time... that i have ever been required to speak the word of god in his temple.
all right, jesse, will you please favor us with a pitch?
will the ladies please join in with their sweet soprano voices?
i might say this jackal or dirty skunk... if it wouldn't be sacrilegious.
but this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized.
i repent of my greed... and my desire for self-advancement at the expense of this community.
i no longer intend to withhold the name of that yellow, skunking murderer... who shot down jack paigler when his back was turned.
thought you'd settle down on that quarter section that i didn't get.
well, i tried to be a farmer, but i had to give up the land.
and i'm gonna have a hired girl as soon as the newspaper...
yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much.
all right, we'll pick them up and put them in the front window.
yancey, that's the highest price shooting ever done in this community... with all the rewards out for the kid.
i'm gonna sell out everything i got... and head for that cherokee land.
well, i would, too, but i don't think the foot will hold.
fella told me he was over at cherokee strip living with a squaw.
someone said he's over at the kickapoo land opening, sold out for big money.
suppose it's true about yancey and dixie lee... that he sent her the money to build that brick house?
folks that use up air for that kind of talk have one-chambered minds... and mighty small caliber.
the rest of them, like me, well, we just come along and live in it.
well, i must be getting back to the store... before a customer brings in a coyote and bites the clerk.
- and that, your honor... the integrity of our fair city... is threatened... sullied by this shameless evil... flaunting in our faces.
this woman, a viper lurking in our midst... a sinister menace to public decency.
gentlemen... if i were in the jury box... if i were judge on the bench... yea, even though i sat... in the governor's chair...
i could say no less... and duty compels that the presence among us... of this disgraceful criminal, this scavenger... this unspeakable human... strikes at the very foundation of the southwest.
may i then, before i begin my poor plea... respectfully call your attention to that which i believe... has never been duplicated before in the history of oklahoma.
turn your eye to that figure that has so deservedly held your attention.
bred in the gentle surroundings of a pure home... such as you would choose for your own daughters... this innocent girl, bereft by death of her loved ones... was left alone in the world.
in that hour of dark terror came a wolf in sheep's clothing, gentlemen.
gentlemen... my only object in being here is to try and get at the truth.
for that purpose, your honor, i call as witness the defendant...
but the same thing again and again, wherever i went, always the same.
in other words, refused even the poorest kind of work... to try and keep body and soul together.
you stay away five years, come back and do a thing like this.
they've talked about you, said everything about you... and i wouldn't believe them.
honey, if i know anything about dixie lee... she'll leave town after today... but driving her out won't help matters.
dixie lees have been stoned in the market place for 2,000 years.
you haven't sent to prison a woman instead of a real criminal... social order, which you can't change, yet.
my only interest in dixie lee was to see that she got one less kick.
well, that's a nice social problem, an indian in the family.
well, i'm going to pick out the richest white man in town and marry him.
we'd like to inform you that the oklahoma wigwam... still prints all the news, all the time.
knowing no law but the law of god... and the government of these united states.
now, with you in the chair, we've got the chance of a lifetime.
we can fix things so we'd all make plenty of money.
a relative of mine, a fellow named moses, wrote the ten commandments.
ladies and gentlemen... as chairman of the oklahoma progressive state committee, i greet you.
we are here to congratulate our new member of congress... and to welcome our noted visitors... the senators and congressmen from washington... who will accompany us on a tour of inspection to the bowlegs oil field... and also to announce the arrival and the unveiling of a statue... to commemorate the oklahoma pioneer.
and now it is my privilege to ask you... to drink to the health of our guest of honor.
my poor words could add nothing... to the sterling achievements of our fellow townswoman... who has risen to eminence in oklahoma... and finally in the councils of the nation.
i therefore call upon the one you are waiting to hear... our new congresswoman, sabra cravat.
my friends... today i stand before you in a new responsibility.
time has passed for many of us... since we first met in the early days of osage.
time that mellows our hearts and tells us all the truth.
to many others among you... including our distinguished guests from washington...
i'm sorry, this afternoon, that i cannot present to you... my husband... but he's out of the city.
i know he would be glad to be here to greet you.
the women of oklahoma... have helped build a prairie wilderness into the state of today.

we can fix things so we'd all make plenty of money.
i'll never forget the flood of clippings... that came in from all over the country... and they called him the nation's leading editor.
yes, and since then, congress has granted all he asked for.
ladies and gentlemen... as chairman of the oklahoma progressive state committee, i greet you.
we are here to congratulate our new member of congress... and to welcome our noted visitors... the senators and congressmen from washington... who will accompany us on a tour of inspection to the bowlegs oil field... and also to announce the arrival and the unveiling of a statue... to commemorate the oklahoma pioneer.
and now it is my privilege to ask you... to drink to the health of our guest of honor.
my poor words could add nothing... to the sterling achievements of our fellow townswoman... who has risen to eminence in oklahoma... and finally in the councils of the nation.
i therefore call upon the one you are waiting to hear... our new congresswoman, sabra cravat.
my friends... today i stand before you in a new responsibility.
time has passed for many of us... since we first met in the early days of osage.
time that mellows our hearts and tells us all the truth.
i can only thank you for the office you have conferred upon me.
the women of oklahoma... have helped build a prairie wilderness into the state of today.
think of it, louis, not an acre left out of that two million.
the only spot i wanted was the ground we stood on, and...
- with flowers and trees... and morning glories growing all over.
it'll be our first real home, alone... and i want you to be happy all the way, sugar.
all this in six weeks right up from the raw prairie.
next time you come here, chief, you go through the roof.
i've spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it.
i've been called upon to defend and convict... horse thieves, harlots, and murderers.
and while i know my bible from cover to cover... and many of its passages are graven on my heart... this, fellow citizens, is the very first time... that i have ever been required to speak the word of god in his temple.
for any shelter, however humble or however sordid... no offense, grat... becomes, when his word is spoken in it...
but this jackal in a lion's skin... who by threatening sudden death... has held this little town abjectly terrorized.
i intended to announce from this pulpit... this platform... that i would publish this knowledge... in the first issue of the oklahoma wigwam... coming off the press next thursday, thereby starting my paper off with a bang.
well, i tried to be a farmer, but i had to give up the land.
the neighbors' wives formed a vigilance committee, and i left by request.
and you stood there actually talking to her, holding her hand... after she'd stolen your land in the run, too.
she wanted that land because she was trying to give up her way of living...
i know a lot of people scattered over oklahoma... that shouldn't cast a stone at her.
don't you quote your bibles and magdalenes at me, yancey cravat!
cravat could use that dollar to buy the new baby a rattle.
and a pair of rubber boots till the streets get paved.
yeah, all those things, sugar, but you mustn't try too much.
the garden looks fine, miss sabra, and them morning glories sure is climbing.
i reckon louis hefner's gonna have a run on wallpaper soon.
i want to get a nice little dainty rosebud pattern... for donna's new bedroom.
- old ben harrison'll be tickled pink... for getting rid of the last real bandit of the country.
i wouldn't be surprised if they appoint you governor of the territory.
well, i must be getting back to the store... before a customer brings in a coyote and bites the clerk.
- did you fix the salad like i told you, ruby?
we thank thee for thy blessings, o god... and pray that thou wilt watch over us all while we are separated.
spare our dear one... and bring us all together again... in safety and happiness.
this woman, a viper lurking in our midst... a sinister menace to public decency.
gentlemen... if i were in the jury box... if i were judge on the bench... yea, even though i sat... in the governor's chair...
turn your eye to that figure that has so deservedly held your attention.
this gifted person, mr. patrick leary... is the only man in the glorious and brilliant southwest... nay, in this magnificent nation... of whom it may actually be said that he is able to strut sitting down.
gentlemen of the jury... you have heard the prosecution's cruel attack on this defenseless woman.
bred in the gentle surroundings of a pure home... such as you would choose for your own daughters... this innocent girl, bereft by death of her loved ones... was left alone in the world.
in that hour of dark terror came a wolf in sheep's clothing, gentlemen.
a wretch, posing as a friend... false promises, lies, deceit so palpable... that it would have fooled no one but a young girl... such as you, yourself, mrs. wyatt, in your maidenly days.
well, i managed to get a position as schoolteacher and then... someone found out about me, and i...
and they blamed you instead of the man, and you were forced to get out.
well, i got work in another town as a nurse girl.
but the same thing again and again, wherever i went, always the same.
he is afraid of your knowing all the pitiful facts of her life.
gentlemen, an immortal soul has been tortured on the rack... and i ask you as men with blood in your veins... who have helpless women in your own homes... to think of one of your innocent, dear ones... wronged and oppressed, like this poor defenseless woman.
they've talked about you, said everything about you... and i wouldn't believe them.
but now, what do you expect me to think of you and that woman?
maybe, if things had been different, she might be like i am... married, safe.
i'm thankful i've got you, that we've got each other... and our home.
stand still, donna... or i'll never have this dress finished for you to take back to school.
sabra, darling, if you think i'm going back to new york finishing school... wearing a homemade fizzle like this, you're seriously mistaken.
we can fix things so we'd all make plenty of money.
now, you see, the indians... they aren't competent to take care of their own... oil leases, and claims, and income.
a prophet is never without honor, save in his own country.
you could be one of the greatest figures in this nation.
well, then i say you won't print it, not in these columns.
when you take my name off and put yours in its place... you'll be editor of this paper.
i'll never forget the flood of clippings... that came in from all over the country... and they called him the nation's leading editor.
yes, and since then, congress has granted all he asked for.
ladies and gentlemen... as chairman of the oklahoma progressive state committee, i greet you.
we are here to congratulate our new member of congress... and to welcome our noted visitors... the senators and congressmen from washington... who will accompany us on a tour of inspection to the bowlegs oil field... and also to announce the arrival and the unveiling of a statue... to commemorate the oklahoma pioneer.

time that mellows our hearts and tells us all the truth.
i can only thank you for the office you have conferred upon me.
the women of oklahoma... have helped build a prairie wilderness into the state of today.
and i was wondering whether you'd like to stay in and listen to the wireless or go out to the pictures.
mr. baker will give his 12th talk on accountancy in 3 minutes.
i really only carry them for the benefit of the less fortunate.
don't you think the world would be a better place, commander, if we all did that sort of thing a little more often?
and tomorrow your husband will be up and looking after you again.
but poor commander gordon will be left right into the background.
and having developed a taste for champagne what's the use of trying to stick to water?
oh, well, maybe she will find someone who is nearer her own level.
he was just a great baby masquerading as a big, strong man.
i've held my tongue because i hadn't the heart to open your dear eyes.
well, not a loan exactly because we were pooling everything we had.
and then there were our passages to australia... of course, i was going to see the jeweler all right.
think of that tart heading for burma with 1,000 of the best in her pocket and shoving her fingers to her nose.
how in god's name are we going to get home, fred?
well, you see, you're just a man and not my husband.
and if you get bored with me, all you've got to do is to get up and go away and it doesn't matter.
it used to make my heart ache to hear you worship that overgrown sham, the way you kowtowed to him.
he was just a great baby masquerading as a big, strong man.
but you've no right... when i said i would, he started to show me you as the outside world sees you.
not as i've seen you, blinded by love and all this long time together.
and then there were our passages to australia... of course, i was going to see the jeweler all right.
i mean... well, you were gonna run away with your precious gordon.
well, you see, you're just a man and not my husband.

okajima was leaving school to enter into society, just like his beard
sorry to keep you waiting, please enter in the order you arrived
we do not wish to accept the proposal, and we've put up notice to the effect
mother, this is mr okajima, the gentleman who saved me the other day

i got to go over to the track and see little champ.
you know, i ain't seen that guy... since day before yesterday.
you wouldn't like to live in a great big home, would you?
one of those great big barns... nothing cozy like... well, like our joint, for instance?
say, there ain't no reason why i can't come back, is there?
if i do, why, i'll get us a girl that will follow us around... and do nothing but look after our fingernails, huh?
well, when i was gambling i lost all of our dough and i lost the horse... and i think we're better off now that i've quit.
we used to have a lot of fun... and now you're training most of the time... and we don't get to see much of each other.
all of a sudden i turn sissy... and faint dead away.
the ground came up... and socked me right square in the face.
give us a little butter, and leave it off the check.
i bet you say that to every dame you meet, don't you?
oh, because your wife will throw me out sure as blazes.
you know they always do when you bring a guy home with a bun on.
you've got to tell a good guy the truth no matter how much it burns him up.
but do you think the three of us could go on living under the same roof?
every time you speak to me or touch me, it's the same thing over and over again and i can't stand it any longer.
that's why i want you to go, if you must know.
say, you ought to hold this meeting up in the auditorium.
news got around among the boys, they'll be coming by the dozens.
i said, "i think you better turn in for a nap".
he said, "i got something to do, something i been thinking about".
we've had scraps, plenty of them, ever since we was kids.
i didn't give you a fair deal on the last one.
i could never get the straight of it, between you and lily, i mean.
i guess it was because i was seeing too much red.
say, listen, you didn't tell me who you was out with, smarty.
she wouldn't have been no nice girl, drinking and all that.
give us a little butter, and leave it off the check.
i bet you say that to every dame you meet, don't you?
i'll end up in the front office as gm as sure as you're born.
you're also gonna break your arm if you don't quit patting yourself on the back.
the first time it happened, we didn't mean to start anything.
only a minute ago, all three of us were playing together.
why don't you lay the cards on the table and say what you're thinking?
i've known you for 20 years, bill and it's taken me all this time to find out you're yellow.
say, you ought to hold this meeting up in the auditorium.
news got around among the boys, they'll be coming by the dozens.
into taking an engine and a string of flats out onto the bridge.
he figured that the weight of a trainload of cement would hold the bridge steady.
i said, "i think you better turn in for a nap."
he said,"l got something to do, something i been thinking about."
we've had scraps, plenty of them, ever since we was kids.
i didn't give you a fair deal on the last one.
i could never get the straight of it, between you and lily, i mean.
i guess it was because i was seeing too much red.
how can i give you tips for the race if you keep me waiting for three hours at the astoria?
i've been waiting there since five o'clock, and now it's seven.
since then she is traveling through the world on her own.
in winter i met her in egypt, in spring i encountered her in london, and now, she's here again.
but i'm very grateful to you for... for allowing me to express what's on my mind.
madame... it's me who has to be grateful, for your trust in me.
jirokichi robbed 99 mansions of the shogun 's vassals, and stole a total of 7, 93 1 ryo.
however, the series of bold crimes had made him easy prey for the police.
lord wakisaka was the shogun's architect, and was in charge of the budget for the building of eitai bridge.
okino's father lived in the lord's mansion and guarded the money.
his target was the residence of nikichi's patron, the powerful lord shigematsu.
nikichi was plotting to make okino, this tender and innocent flower, that captured jirokichi's heart, a mistress of shigematsu, and get the police jitte in exchange.
later that night, the altar was opened again, and the money inside it disappeared.
maybe it was just a fling in the beginning, but then i...
she placed the money on the altar and went to bed.
that night, the row house behind tenno-ji temple was raided by a thief.
i'll be hanged for my deeds anyway, so i want to have at least one beautiful memory in my wasted life.
your feelings make me happy, but i can't go with you.
the early spring dusk was filled with the shouts of the policemen.
a way from the light of the lanterns floated the body of a brave woman who took with her the heart of her beloved.
that's all i've been allowed to think about since the day i was born.
well, i'm going to think about myself, my own happiness for a change.
doesn't he realize that we're to leave here in another hour?
doesn't he know that he's put on his [inaudible] uniform for the procession to the harbor?
do you think for one moment that i'm going to america for pleasure?
i'm going to work for the good of my dear country.
we're leaving in a short time, and we cannot wait for the king.
i've had another conference with the people's leader, ma'am, dr. fellman.
i took them down to the lord chancellor's office for verification.
well, then, you go right down to the lord chancellor's office and get them right back again.
i think you'll be glad to hear what i have to say, sir.
i am happy, i am proud to say that i have completed a little arrangement on which we've all set our hearts.
it was advisable to keep this matter a profound secret for diplomatic reasons.
thus, we deemed it unwise to divulge the terms, even to your highness.
what i meant was is that you get a chance to practice.
now, i'll wager that when you're off duty, you practice with the finest checkers players in this city.
the family can end here and now for all i care.
if they must have two male children, they can adopt them.
and besides, he's much too sweet to be mean to anyone.
well, are you aware of the character of your fiance's family?
i love freddie, and nothing in heaven or earth is going to stop me from marrying him.
i'm afraid your mother will not be very enthusiastic about this.
the time has come when we must forcefully show our resentment to northrup's iron heel.
tonight, he made a violent speech, and there was nothing for us to do but to declare a revolution.
well, northrup then replied that if the people were in for war, so was he.
he pounded the table with his fist when he said it.
i regret to say, sir, that i must be allowed to handle this crisis as i see fit.
i merely told you of my plans just as a matter of courtesy.
go down to the cellar right away and get about a dozen bottles of champagne.
it seems to me the time has come to all get gloriously drunk.
if you wish to save your country, you must abdicate, and you must do it at once.
there's nothing to be done now except that your people must surrender.
i want you to understand that i am in charge here.
and i won't have any interference from you or anyone else.
and if you find me being otherwise, you must remind me.
well, what is it that mother has told you to tell me now?
and if we don't pacify laker before the wedding there will be bomb, bullet, and so forth.
well then, sir, we better notify general northrup and the police.
and see that the prisoner isn't put aboard until the last moment before sailing.
and i suggest, major, that you remain with him until the ship is well out of the harbor.
that the chief cause of all trouble, the unemployment situation, be relieved.
you, general northrup, have refused even to consider a council for arbitration.
we wasted our time coming here to talk to these tyrants.
your majesty, i have tried to bring this business to a sensible conclusion.
they'll have to take their chances along with the rest of you.
and if any of you reach the cathedral alive it will be due to an oversight [inaudible].
you're to form a cabinet and have a general election for a new parliament at once.
if the fate of our country is entrusted to these men it'll mean death and dishonor for us all, for everything we've cherished.
i made friends with dr. fellman and his friend, mr. laker.
if you'd left it to me, i'd have got rid of northrup and with no assistance from dr. fellman either.
of course, i blame you, but i'm going through with it, every bit of it.
and i never want to see you again, or mother, or anyone else in this hateful, cruel place.
i thought it best for you to be married respectfully before you left.
i don't think your mother would like it if you went under less conventional circumstances.

dracula is one of the most durable fictional creations in modern times.
the universal film, directed by tod browning, secured the master vampire's image for the age of mass media.
but stoker himself would barely have recognised most of the dracuias we've known and loved in the 20th century, and therein lies a tale.
i'ii discuss the simultaneously produced spanish-ianguage version, also included on this special edition, and will draw extensively from stoker's original novel, from the stage adaptations, from universal's final shooting script, and earlier scripts and treatments,
all to better illuminate the creative processes and creative conflicts that forged the most indelible image of a vampire the world has ever known.
the coach rumbling our way is real, even if the mountains aren't.
here we meet carla laemmie, the niece of universal's founder carl laemmie, delivering the first lines of dialogue ever spoken in a supernatural horror talkie.
i should mention that carla is also the host and narrator of our special documentary supplement, the road to dracula, which you can access through the main menu.
when bram stoker wrote dracula, the region around the borgo pass was part of transyivanian hungary.
today it's in romania, where dracuia tourism is a big part of the economy.
just like renfieid, actor dwight frye is very much a stranger in a strange land, having only recently arrived in hollywood after a varied career as a broadway actor.
and, iike renfieid, little does he know what he's in for.
the innkeeper is michael visaroff, a russian-born character actor who fled his homeland after the bolshevik revolt.
he acted on the new york stage for some years, coming to hollywood in 1924, at first working for paramount.
tod browning used him in a parallel role in 1935's mark of the vampire for mgm.
he appeared in the opening sequence of tod browning's freaks in 1932, and in dozens of colourful cameos in major productions such as morocco, anna karenina, and camille.
visaroff appealed to the columnist loueiia parsons, who publicly confirmed that reports of the actor's death, iike mark twain's, were greatly exaggerated.
but just a few weeks later, as parsons was still contradicting reports of the actor's demise, she received the news that michael visaroff actually had died, carried away by a sudden bout of pneumonia.
the movies tell us that the crucifix is an effective vampire repellent, a representation to believers of the true death and resurrection of christ, as opposed to the blasphemous inversion of the resurrection shown by a vampire.
in more recent films and novels, vampires are less likely to cower before the cross.
in universal's 1979 remake, for instance, the dynamic is completely reversed.
not only is dracuia unaffected by the symbol, but the cross itself bursts into flames in dracula's presence.
in dracula he seems constrained, perhaps by director browning, who was traditionally partial to a more static camera, and tracking shots like this appear only sporadically.
coming up is the first supernatural vampire ever depicted in hollywood, actress geraidine dvorak, formerly greta garbo's stand-in at mgm.
and here, in an unforgettable shot, the 1931 public first met count dracuia, in the person of beia lugosi.
he seems to pull us toward him, each audience member a potential victim.
this next scene is highly atmospheric, but it does present a puzzle.
in the novel, the spanish film version, and the antecedent film nosferatu,
the borgo pass is a real location, but not a place stoker or his adaptors had actually visited.
in reality it's a lushly forested region, but both the novelist and the filmmakers wanted something more atmospheric.
"the whole area through which the coach is passing has a grim, macabre quality, as if taken bodily from a dore steel engraving."
as discussed in our documentary supplement, upcoming is a "glass shot".
the upper portion of the image is painted on glass mounted in front of the camera, and photographed simultaneously with the live action.
the coach and rocky roadbed are live, and the rest of the image is an optical illusion.
the geological formations in the lower part of the picture can still be visited at vasquez rocks park, in the antelope valley north of los angeles.
the horses being led by a bat was the invention of screenwriter fritz stephani, who imagined the scene in universal's first treatment for dracula in june, 1930.
renfieid's cautious approach to the door of castle dracula is emblematic of hollywood's attitude toward dracuia himself.
although the stage play had earned more than $2 million in america alone, the studios were as much repelled as attracted by the grotesque, frankly fantastic character and subject matter.
but once renfieid had crossed dracuia's cobwebby threshold, fantastic and uncanny themes would no ionger be taboo in the american cinema.
a virtual land rush would follow at universal and other studios, with frankenstein, dr jekyll and mr hyde, the mummy, and so many others.
this extraordinary set, magnified to soaring heights by another glass painting, was constructed on universal's stage 12, a facility still in use today.
the 18ft-wide spider web was constructed on a wire framework, built up with filaments of rubber cement shot from a rotary gun, iike cotton candy.
i heard a heavy step approaching from beyond the great door, and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light."
"then there was the sound of chains and the clanking of bolts drawn back."
"a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back."
"within stood a tall old man, ciean-shaven save for a iong white moustache, and clad in black from head to foot, without a single speck of colour."
"what sad music they make" or "what sweet music they make", but lugosi intones it with just the note of malevolent ambiguity that stoker originally intended.
today, dracula would probably have walked through the spider web with the aid of some digital effect, but consider how much more chilling it is not to see the action.
according to studio publicity, this scene was delayed for hours, at some expense, until the loud crackling of the fire logs died down.
beia lugosi, whose real name was beia biaskó, was born in lugos, hungary, in 1882.
he became fascinated with the theatre at an early age, much to his parents' disappointment, and worked in provincial productions, and finally secured a company position with the national theatre in budapest.
contrary to some accounts, he played mainly minor roles at the national theatre, a source of endless frustration for him.
postwar political upheaval and his activities as a union organiser forced him to flee his homeland in 1919.
he worked in german films before coming to the united states in 1920 to look for more rewarding work as a stage actor.
he learned many of his engiish-ianguage roles phoneticaiiy, resulting in the deliberate, oddiy-infiected diction we now forever associate with count dracuia.
curiously, this is another characteristic at odds with stoker's vampire, who took great pains to speak english without any trace of an accent.
you may notice a continuity jump, as renfieid's valise suddenly leapt from dracuia's hands flat onto the table.
dracula's enquiry as to whether renfieid has destroyed all his correspondence has been cut, resulting in an abrupt edit.
with lofty, domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the face and temples, but profusely elsewhere."
"his eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, with bushy hair that curled in its own profusion."
renfieid's bed is suddenly turned down, although dracuia has not had the time to perform the courtesy.
one of the most famous lines in dracula is not taken from the novel or the play, but is original to the universal film.
incidentally, this is not the first time dwight frye had acted with beia lugosi.
they had appeared together, along with fredric march, in the broadway comedy the devil in the cheese in 1926.
but after dracula, both lugosi and frye would find comedy roles few and far between.
the novel dracula is full of shakespearean allusions, and dracula's three wives, as imagined by stoker, are likely inspired by the weird sisters in macbeth.
renfieid is attacked by dracula's wives and not by dracula himself.
in a later script, though not the shooting script, a wonderful effect is proposed:
that the camera be placed on the floor in renfieid's helpless position as the ghostly faces of the women descend upon him.
the vision of dracula repeiiing the women and claiming the male visitor for himself is one of the earliest images that fired bram stoker's imagination.
it brings to completion the uneasy atmosphere of homoerotic seduction that has coloured the entire sequence.
in bram stoker's own theatrical adaptation, which he presented as a staged reading in 1897,
dracula goes so far as to sweep the unconscious visitor up into his arms and carry him into the shadows, much like rhett butler's rape of scarlett o'hara.
in the modernised stage play upon which the film is largely based,
due to budget constraints, the sequence was constructed from footage taken from a universal silent called the storm breaker.
the jerky, speeded-up appearance of the film is the result of silents being shot and projected at a slower speed than taikies.
also in 1931 , james whale cast him in another demented role, that of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant fritz, in frankenstein.
thereafter, frye found himself in a very narrow career groove, but, luckily for film fans, he gave some of the most enjoyable performances in the entire universal canon.
browning got a start in show business via travelling carnivals and freak shows, for which he had a morbid fascination
long after he became one of the highest-paid directors in hollywood.
browning's films are filled with outsiders and misfits, and disturbing images of physical deformity.
he forged a winning partnership in the 1920s with lon chaney, the famous "man of a thousand faces", who was similarly drawn to themes of mutilation and disability.
universal hoped to have chaney work with browning on dracula, where the actor's skill as a make-up artist would likely have created a dracula very much unlike the one we've come to know, but chaney was stricken with terminal cancer before a contract was finalised.
this legendary shot was not scripted, and resulted from an inspired improvisation between frye, browning and freund.
frye's son, also named dwight, told me that he is still startled from time to time by waiters and sales people who, recognising his name on a credit card, spontaneously regaie him with imitations of his father's otherwise inimitable laugh.
the inclusion of this newspaper is the film's closest echo of stoker's use of accumulated documents to tell his story:
quote: "he nods slowly, indicating that he'ii take a flower, and makes a sign that she is to place it in his buttonhole."
"she selects a flower, and with a haif-timid, haif-coquettish air starts to obey."
"camera moves forward to a iarge ciose-up of her face, as her eyes start to move in a dizzy, circular movement under the spell of dracula's hypnotic stare."
the shooting script also described dracuia parting his lips to reveal fangiike teeth.
i'm virtually certain the flower girl was played by a young actress, anita dardour, who did not much longer pursue a hollywood career, but later, under her married name, anita harder, was active in santa barbara community theatre,
where she enjoyed recounting being beia lugosi's first victim outside transyivania.
the script has a description here of a moving camera shot worthy of kari freund that was never quite realised.
through dense fog, which starts slowly to clear, brilliant lights appear, and the crowd becomes denser.
limited to title sequences and scenes where music was actually performed.
we just heard a snippet of schubert's unfinished symphony, followed rather abruptly by the prelude to wagner's die meistersinger.
the film's opening-titie music is from act two of tchaikovsky's swan lake, which became a trademark for universal's early horror films.
it also opens murders in the rue morgue and the mummy.
and here we meet the rest of the principal supporting cast.
from left to right, helen chandler as mina seward, david manners as john harker,
by 1931 the depression had drawn sharp lines between the haves and have-nots, and perhaps this accounts for some of the film's fascination for audiences then.
it is very puzzling how kari freund could have set up such a badly composed shot, with dracula standing outside and below the box.
- helen chandler, david manners and frances dade - had only brief careers in hollywood, and all for very different reasons.
in stoker's novel and the stage adaptations, carfax is only a house, but in the universal film it becomes, for the first time, an abbey.
it is a stand-in, obviously, for whitby abbey, a ruin on the north yorkshire coast that stoker knew well, and features prominently in the first portion of his novel.
frances dade came from a prominent philadelphia family, acted in stock, and toured with the stage production of gentlemen prefer blondes in the late '20s, before her short fling with hollywood.
dade returned to philadelphia in the mid-'30s, married, and at the time of her death in the 1960s, was reported to have been working as a nurse.
a curious landmark moment, as helen chandler gives the first vocal imitation of lugosi as dracula on record.
no one dreamed then that lugosi's voice would become one of the most imitated and instantly recognisable in hollywood history.
in real life, chandler and dade were the closest of friends.
chandler had acted professionally from age eight, and had an impressive list of stage credits in new york.
she had played one of the young princes in john barrymore's richard lll, and appeared as opheiia in horace liverwright's modern-dress hamlet.
just prior to dracula, she appeared in the screen adaptation of sutton vane's drama
outward bound, about a ship whose passengers don't yet realise they're dead and sailing toward judgment.
chandler seemed to have a promising career ahead, but she also had her own private vampire - alcohol -
which would very soon begin to destroy her, personally and professionally.
the association of vampires with werewolf transformations, however, had long been established in folklore and literature.
here is the scene's description before being toned down for the shooting script.
"his lips part and his head bends nearer to her throat."
"the teeth seem to have an almost canine appearance, as his mouth is about to touch her neck." unquote.
the ward attendant is charles gerrard, an actor who had appeared the previous year, along with david manners, in the film of rc sheriff's acclaimed world war i drama journey's end.
the director, james whale, would soon be recruited by universal, where he would eclipse tod browning, with an incomparable flair for films like
here we are introduced to the unorthodox scientist professor van helsing, played by the character actor edward van sioan.
like lugosi, van sioan created this part in the original broadway production.
the producers had seen him portray a psychiatrist in a drama by franz werfei, and thought he would be perfect.
he told a reporter that he had never been in a play that ran more than a few weeks, but the new york and road-show versions of dracula kept him occupied for 22 months.
gerard mentioned that "nosferatu" was the romanian term for vampire, and stoker took her word for it.
he used the word authoritativeiy in his novel, and it was further popularised as the title of fw murnau's unauthorised film adaptation of 1922.
its real meaning and derivation, therefore, are matters of conjecture and mystery.
dr seward is played by herbert bunston, who reprises his broadway role.
born in england, bunston made his london stage debut in 1897, coincidentally the year of dracula's first publication.
he's the only person connected with the 1931 film who also had a connection with bram stoker, who was acting as general manager of sir henry irving's royal lyceum theatre when bunston performed there at the turn of the century.
so, as dr seward and professor van helsing discuss vampire superstition,
i'ii give a fuller outline of the genesis of stoker's novel in folklore and literature, and its transformations via the theatre that resulted in the classic film we are now watching.
legends of spirits who return from the dead to drain the blood of the living are as old as recorded history.
it is eastern european folklore that most informs dracula, but the image of the vampire as a decadent, predatory aristocrat is not part of the folklore tradition at all.
rather, it derives from romantic literature, in particular a short story called the vampyre by john poiidori, published in 1819.
poiidori was the physician and travelling companion of lord byron, whose scandalous personal life was the inspiration for poiidori's supernatural iady-kiiier, lord ruthven.
poiidori's story inspired seven stage plays and two operas in the 19th century, and their influence on dracula is considerable.
novelist bram stoker was born just outside of dublin in 1847.
he was a sickly child, and one can't read about his early life without being reminded of all the anxious sickbed scenes in dracula.
stoker overcame childhood illness, attended trinity college, and afterward became a civil servant.
stoker was overwhelmed with irving's charisma, and devoted his professional life for the next three decades to managing irving's company and its base of operations, the lyceum theatre.
almost all commentators on stoker have noted his slavish devotion to irving, a relationship that virtually eclipsed his own marriage.
given the fact that stoker was publishing vast amounts of fiction on the side, it is difficult to imagine what time for a domestic or personal life he had at all.
one is tempted to find an echo of his professional bondage in dracula:
in fact, stoker sorely wanted irving to play dracuia on the lyceum stage.
like poiidori, stoker also seems to have intended his vampire as a backhanded tribute to a difficult, controlling benefactor.
he spent nearly six years researching, writing and revising dracula, apparently in the hope of achieving a creative collaboration with irving, not just a business partnership.
in our documentary supplement you can see stoker's working notes for dracula, as well as some photos of henry irving.
irving, however, spurned stoker's efforts to recruit him as a vampire.
a chicago drama critic recalled stoker's complaints during one of irving's tours.
quote: "when the late bram stoker told me he had put endless hours in trying to persuade henry irving to have a play made from dracula and act in it, he added that he had nothing in mind save the box office."
"'if', he explained, 'i am able to have my name on the book, the governor can afford, with business bad, to have his name on the play."'
"'but he laughs whenever i talk about it, and we have to go out and raise money to put on something in which the public has no interest."' end quote.
stoker went on to describe irving as dracula as a composite of the actor's celebrated villains:
in his earliest outlines, stoker structured his story like a shakespearean play, in five acts, or "books" as he called them.
the vampire's name was originally count vampyre, until stoker came across a reference to the ferocious 15th-century warlord named viad tepes, popularly known as dracula, meaning "son of the devil".
there is controversy about the degree of tod browning's control over the film.
david manners told me personally that browning directed none of his scenes, that the production was disorganised, and that his only direction came from cameraman kari freund.
freund must have been very distracted with extra responsibilities for this scene.
notice the very ragged piece of cardboard some grip has obviously used to shield the practical lamp for a ciose-up.
notice how it never goes away, even for the iong shots.
one gets the feeling no one is in the director's chair or behind the viewfinder.
in fairness to browning, even a more polished director like whale was capable of things just as sloppy.
in our special edition of frankenstein, see the operating-tabie shot, where a sheet has fallen off the monster's draped form, revealing someone's neatly polished dress shoe.
the novel dracula was a departure from previous vampire stories, plays, operas, in that stoker did not romanticise dracuia, and our 20th-century image of the count is a hybrid of stoker's character and vampires from other literary sources.
stoker's dracula engenders disgust rather than attraction, and is an amalgam of qualities that iate-victorian england found repulsive.
there was a strong current of cultural xenophobia in the 1890s, and many britons felt threatened by waves of immigration.
foreigners were frequently viewed as a threat to cultural and racial purity, and demonised as biologically degenerate, according to a distorted understanding of the theories of charles darwin.
dracula himself is a perfectly darwinian monster, changing shape up and down the evolutionary scale.
he is an invading foreigner, with a strong anti-semitic coloration, much like shyiock, fagin or svengaii.
examination of the skin for telltale marks was a common anxiety ritual for sexually active victorians.
stoker may have been less familiar with "the blood is the life" as a biblical quote, than as an advertising tag line for a quack remedy for "bad blood", a euphemism for syphilis.
some scholars argue that stoker may have suffered from tertiary syphilis, then untreatabie, which could have hastened his death in 1912.
the novel offers many strange reflections of other victorian sexual anxieties as well.
many victorian men were disturbed by the growing assertiveness of women.
the concept of the "new woman" was routinely mocked and vilified in the mainstream press as monstrous and degenerate.
the lusty vampire women in dracula are caricatures of victorian prostitutes, who were popularly scapegoated as vectors of venereal disease and the destruction of the middie-ciass family.
dracula's first two screen appearances were not authorised by stoker's widow.
he makes the mistake of inviting someone to fire a bullet at him, hoping to prove his immortality.
dracula's death only used the name, but, the following year in germany, fw murnau directly adapted stoker's novel as
bram stoker's widow convinced the german courts to declare the film a plagiarism and order all prints destroyed.
fortunately for film history, several copies did survive, and nosferatu is now considered an expressionist classic.
in the spanish version, dracula intensifies the mirror smashing by using his cane.
although we now regard dracuia as a quintessential screen icon, modern dracuia image is, in fact, largely a creation of the legitimate theatre.
when deane wrote and produced the first authorised stage version in 1924, he introduced a radically reconstituted dracuia, a suave man about town, who actively ingratiates himself into the lives of the other characters.
deane added the accent that stoker's dracula had worked so hard to overcome, as well as the now trademark evening clothes and satin-iined cape, trappings borrowed from the familiar, faintly mephistopheiian persona of the standard stage magician.
deane completely eliminated stoker's transyivania scenes and restructured the story as a modern drawing-room mystery melodrama, that could utilise stock scenery, and not require the expense of period costumes.
deane's play toured britain for three years before taking residence at the little theatre, a weii-known haunt for horror and mystery plays in london's west end.
as a publicity stunt, audiences were greeted by a nurse in the lobby, on hand to administer smelling salts to the faint of heart.
the public loved it, but the snootier london critics were not kind, and reserved special brickbats for the play's more mechanical contrivances.
"in that sense, at ieast, this piece displays a sure sense of the theatre."
"there is very little of bram stoker in it, but most of us jumped in our seats at ieast once in every act." end quote.
french windows, secret panels, and, perhaps most memorably, easiiy-hypnotisabie maids, who can be relied upon to remove a variety of annoyances, ranging from crucifixes to garlic flowers to noxious necklaces of vampire-repeiiing woifbane.
the american stage rights were secured by the pubiisher-producer h liverwright, a flamboyant showman, ever on the prowl for sensational properties.
when the west end dracuia, raymond huntiey, turned down the broadway part in a salary dispute,
liverwright, unable to afford a name performer, offered the role to the relatively unknown hungarian expatriate actor beia lugosi, despite lugosi's shaky command of english.
in the film, any suggestion of vampire foreplay is completely eliminated.
as in london, nurses and fainting patrons were both provided by the management.
a conflict of interest, perhaps, but one which drew no serious complaint.
hollywood studios had long toyed with the idea of filming dracula, but were put off by the horrifying subject, and many studio readers considered it unfiimabie for reasons of censorship.
dwight frye may well have regretted ever having heard the name dracuia, given the effect it had on his career.
though the roles he was offered after dracula and frankenstein may have been beneath his real talents, he gave wonderfully loony performances in such films as the vampire bat,
the maid, played by moon carroll, is misidentified on the film's main titles as joan standing.
standing actually plays the nurse briggs, who will soon attend the ailing mina.
"so far as the picture value of the story goes, nothing has changed."
"dracuia is and always has been material for a great picture."
"while it is picture material from the angle of the pictorial and dramatic, it is not picture material from the standpoint of the box office, nor of ethics of the industry."
"it would be a thing which no child and, for that matter, no adult of delicate or nervous temperament should see, a thing beside which the cabinet of dr caligari would seem like a pleasant fireside reverie." end quote.
dracula ran for 33 weeks on broadway, followed by two simultaneous american tours, one with beia lugosi, and the other with raymond huntiey, the original london dracuia.
lugosi luckily played the part in los angeles, home of the film industry.
studio executives, afraid of the novel, realised that the tamer thrills of the stage play might be screenworthy after all.
following two years of often tempestuous negotiations between bram stoker's widow, hamilton deane,
universal purchased the film rights to the novel and stage adaptations for $40,000 in the summer of 1930.
this scene shows another puzzling iapse of directorial judgment, or perhaps just pressure from the front office to keep the production moving.
i had the pleasure of making david's acquaintance during his last years, and i remember him saying how much he disliked film acting as against the stage.
he complained that the studios treated actors like mechanical props, not artists.
he was annoyed at being given chalk marks on the floor for positioning, and hated filming scripts out of sequence.
as a broadway actor, he felt the performer controlled the drama.
but in hollywood actors sometimes weren't even told what was going on.
although it's not apparent on screen, in the days of slow film stocks sets like this were lit with huge arc lights, which could be painful for the actors, especially when shooting was going slowly, as it did on dracula.
a year before dracula he appeared in seven pictures, including journey's end, directed by james whale.
he is also remembered for appearing in other universal horror and mystery films, including the mummy, the black cat, and the mystery of edwin drood.
his six unhappy years in hollywood came to an end, he told me, when joan crawford hysterically screamed obscenities at him for having the temerity to turn down a script.
he told me he simply knelt down, placed the script silently at the screaming crawford's feet, and left, never looking back.
but universal's president, carl laemmie, insisted that the part be played by silent superstar lon chaney, whose fame for grotesque characterisations would provide box-office insurance for the risky property.
chaney had proven difficult and temperamental for universal in the past, but his films did make money.
negotiations got as far as universal's offer of a three-picture deal, including a talking sequel to the phantom of the opera, but chaney had already developed terminal cancer.
his death in august 1930, at the age of 47, shocked the film world.
beia lugosi had lobbied feverishiy for the screen part, even corresponded with stoker's widow to try to bring down the purchase price, but the studio showed little interest until all other possibilities had fallen through.
because he was not an established star, the studio felt confident that lugosi could be signed cheaply.
director tod browning received credit on the shooting script, though his writing credit was taken from the titles, with bromfieid's and murphy's.
we can safely assume that it was fort to whom we owe most thanks for dracula.
he was also the main screenwriting force behind universal's frankenstein, as well as dracula's daughter in 1936.
because dracula was a transitional film, reflecting the late silent era as much as the early talkies, it presented special problems to the studio.
many theatres in early 1931 were still not wired for sound.
the foreign market, especially spanish- speaking countries, wanted taikies, but they wanted actors to speak in their native language.
the browning-lugosi talkie, of course, but also an intertitied silent version for theatres still without sound capability.
in our documentary supplement, we've re-created a scene from the silent version following universal's original cutting continuity.
satan takes christ and tempts him with glorious visions of the material world.
quote: "aii these things i will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me." unquote.
in the novel he serves as a kind of psychic informer for the vampire on doings within the sanitarium.
in traditional folklore, a vampire requires an invitation to enter a house, and the weak-minded renfieid is happy to make the overture.
the most intriguing variant version of dracula is the spanish-ianguage film, shot simultaneously at night on the same sets, but with a completely different director, cinematographer, cast and crew.
van helsing's confrontation with dracula is a good demonstration of the divergent approaches taken by the english and spanish versions.
the spanish film follows the shooting script, building suspense while intercutting scenes of mina's seduction of harker, while van helsing attempts to resist dracuia's hypnotic commands.
as you can see, browning's version lets the sequences play independently.
both are valid cinematic techniques, but they demonstrate very different cinematic sensibilities.
many foreign-ianguage versions were produced in hollywood in the '30s, but the spanish version of dracula is unique in that it amounts to a fuii-fiedged rival production, owing to the personalities and politics of universal at the time.
despite carl laemmie jr's name on the main title of the spanish film, the de facto producer of this version was paul kohner,
carl laemmie sr's ambitious young protege and heir apparent, until laemmie sr turned over the studio to his far less experienced son as a 21st birthday present.
kohner was taken off the slate as producer of the english dracula, for which he already had great plans.
he had hoped that paul leni, director of waxworks and the cat and the canary, would direct dracula, with conrad veidt as the star.
instead, kohner was relegated to foreign versions of universal's domestic films.
meanwhile, he had fallen in love with the beautiful mexican ingenue, lupita tovar, star of universal's spanish version of the cat creeps, which he had also produced, and so effectively that laemmie ordered sections of the american version
the spanish dracula, included in this edition, along with a special introduction by lupita tovar kohner, provides a rare opportunity to compare and contrast simultaneous studio interpretations of a single script.
under paul kohner, the spanish crew was headed by director george meiford.
meiford had previously directed rudoiph vaientino as the sheik, effective preparation for the spanish dracula, a latin lover if there ever was.
kohner, meiford, and cinematographer george robinson reviewed tod browning's dailies and obsessively made their improvements.
the actors, however, could not view the rushes, except for carlos viiiarias as dracula, whom the studio wanted to appear as lugosi-iike as possible.
viiiarias' name was shortened to carlos viiiar on the main titles, and his contract for the film was further americanised to charles viiiar.
you can also spot him, once again in formal attire, in the opening scenes of bordertown, with bette davis and paul muni, in 1935.
tod browning was reportedly furious at being upstaged by kohner's production, but the spanish film displays more technical sophistication than browning's.
it lacks the poetry of lugosi's majestic presence and unforgettable line readings, but visually often seems years ahead of its time.
the overall effect is aided immeasurably by the quality of the master element, based on universal's nearly pristine nitrate negative, save for the third reel, which had deteriorated beyond recovery, and was replaced by a multigenerational showprint found in havana.
nitrate was a very unstable film stock, but its high silver content produced an extraordinary image, difficult to reproduce on safety film.
notice in the spanish dracula the deep velvety blacks and crystalline highlights evident everywhere throughout the film.
notice the special care given to lighting, especially the back lighting of spider webs and mist.
notice shots cut from the browning film, including an extraordinary glass shot of carfax abbey perched on a cliff above a pounding sea.
notice george robinson's use of the moving camera, inspired, no doubt, by karl freund but often eclipsing their inspiration.
notice how many times lugosi appears in long shots and medium long shots:
universal didn't have to worry about the censor for its non-domestic product.
the spanish film was produced at the amazing cost of $66,000, as compared to the $341 ,000 iavished on the engiish-ianguage film.
the engiish-ianguage dracula was premiered at new york's roxy theater on february 12, 1931 .
an oft-repeated story suggesting a valentine's day tie-in is without basis.
the initial advertising campaign traded instead on the bogus moving back of the premiere from friday 13.
the film was a surprise hit across the country, and contributed to universal having its one profitable year during the depression.
according to david manners, neither he or his co-star helen chandler took the filming of dracula very seriously, and had to stifle laughter throughout the production.
and there once more is the kari freund memorial piece of cardboard, which nobody in the film ever seems to notice.
david insisted that he had never even bothered to see dracula, but i'm not sure i really believed him.
he was, in any case, flabbergasted at the fan mail he continued to receive more than 60 years after the film's release.
i hope i'm not making him out to be a curmudgeon.
he was an elegant, accomplished and very charming man, but he never understood why, with all the things he had done in his long life, people only seemed to want to talk to him about dracula.
one of the more lurid passages in stoker's novel involved dracuia feeding blood from a wound in his chest to mina harker as a mystical, quasi-sexuai sacrament.
not surprisingly, helen chandler only describes the action, rather as renfieid described the rats.
"and as i iooked, it was dripping with fresh blood." unquote.
the most gruesome scene in stoker's novel, the destruction of lucy, is not shown in the english version, and only briefly indicated in the spanish version.
quote: "as the door of the vault closes slowly with a faint creaking sound, behind lucy and from somewhere near at hand an owl hoots."
"camera swings around to medium close shot of harker and van helsing behind a tombstone, and we get over harker's reaction to lucy's appearance, which has left him speechless and shaken."
"he stares at the closed door of the vault with an expression of stupefaction, can't credit his senses."
"there is a faintly pitiful look in his eyes, as if he almost suspected his own sanity."
the script cuts back to dracuia's abduction of mina, returning to a shot of the churchyard, lucy's vault in the foreground.
quote: "through the open door there comes the sound of a heavy blow, followed by a piercing unearthiy scream."
"he emerges and leans against the door of the vault, head bowed, body sagging."
"van helsing follows, backing out, eyes looking back to the darkness of the vault."
for both tod browning and beia lugosi, dracula was a problematic milestone.
it would be the most commercially successful film either would make, and yet for both of them it was a high point that would never be repeated.
miracles for sale, in 1939, and then retired to malibu and lived a comfortable, if reciusive, existence until his death in 1962.
due in part to the indelible impression he made with the role,
beia lugosi never escaped the shadow of dracula, although he played the role on screen only one more time, in the 1948 comedy abbott and costello meet frankenstein.
his heavy accent hampered him, and his star in hollywood was soon eclipsed by boris karloff's, who, by the time of frankenstein's release at the end of 1931 , was the new new lon chaney.
a iong-standing medical addiction to painkillers became tabloid news in 1955, when lugosi publicly sought treatment.
a few years later, when dracula was released to television and discovered by a new generation of fans, he might have had a twilight revival of his career.
but he died on august 16, 1956, taking one of his beloved dracuia capes to the grave with him.
in the novel, the destruction of dracula took place after an exciting sea and land chase back to transyivania.
"i saw the count lying with the box upon the earth, some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him."
"he was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i knew too well."
"as i iooked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph."
"but, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of jonathan's great knife."
"i shrieked as i saw it tear through the throat, whilst at the same moment mr morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart."
"it was like a miracle, but before our eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight."
"i shall be glad as long as i iive that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace, such as i never could have imagined might have rested there." end quote.
in the film nosferatu, dracula was destroyed by the first rays of sunlight, which would have surprised stoker, since his dracuia walked around london in broad daylight.
in the first stage version, dracula was stabbed through the heart and evaporated into dust with the aid of a trick coffin, built on the principles of a magician's disappearing cabinet.
for the broadway version, a wooden stake was substituted for the knife.
unfortunately, hollywood censors did not agree with atkinson, and most of dracula's death groans went unheard for nearly 60 years until universal finally restored them on laser disc.
as the actors took their bows during the curtain call of the stage version, it was customary for professor van helsing to step forward, raising his hand to stop the applause, and deliver a special message.
original cast member ivan butler told me that provincial audiences, familiar with the speech from repeated touring, eventually recited it aloud, as in a 1920s version of the rocky horror picture show.
it was included in the original release of the film, but the censors demanded its removal, fearful it might offend religious groups by encouraging belief in the supernatural.
so, to get a better idea of exactly what professor van helsing had to say,
i suggest you visit our documentary supplement, the road to dracula, where we've done our best to re-create this lost cinematic moment.
the abbey always reminds me of that old toast... about lofty timbers.
the walls around are bare, echoing to our laughter as though the dead were there."
i may be able to bring you proof... that the superstition of yesterday can become... the scientific reality of today.
but, professor, renfield's cravings... have always been for small living things.
i could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
and then i saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white livid face came down out of the mist.
a most distinguished scientist whose name we know... even in the wilds of transylvania.
i had a frightful dream a few nights ago, and i don't seem to be able to get it out of my mind.
i don't mean to be rude, but that's the sort of thing i'd expect one of the patients here to say.
yes, and that is what your english doctors would say, your police.
but then, if dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night to transylvania, and that's impossible.
then he must have brought his native soil with him, boxes of it.
- well, how could she know... anything about the woman in white?
it's bad enough for her to read it in the newspaper...
knowing a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
i am convinced that this dracula is no legend... but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
i have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things, little-known facts which the world is perhaps better off not knowing.
i know, but, professor, all i want is to get mina away from all of this.
he wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
well, i'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at borgo pass at midnight.
dr seward, your patient renfieid, whose blood i have just analysed, is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life.
but, professor van helsing, modern medical science does not admit of such a creature!
and just as i was commencing to get drowsy, i heard dogs howling.
and when the dream came... it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
it was so thick i couid just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
and then i saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white, iivid face came down out of the mist.
it seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me.
darling, we're going to forget all about these dreams and think about something cheerful, aren't we?
"further attacks on small children, committed after dark by the mysterious woman in white, took place last night."
"narratives of two small girls, each child describing a 'bootifui lady in white' who promised her chocolates, enticed her to a secluded spot, and there bit her slightly in the throat."
and, knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
i am convinced that this dracuia is no legend, but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
mr harker, i have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things -
iittie-known facts which the world is perhaps better off for not knowing.
this is david skal, and i bid you welcome to universal's dracula.
i'm going to spend the next hour and 15 minutes as your tour guide to one of the most influential yet underappreciated films in hollywood history.
the universal film, directed by tod browning, secured the master vampire's image for the age of mass media.
but stoker himself would barely have recognised most of the draculas we've known and loved in the 20th century, and therein lies a tale.
i'll discuss the simultaneously produced spanish-language versión, also included on this special edition, and will draw extensively from stoker's original novel, from the stage adaptations, from universal's final shooting script, and earlier scripts and treatments,
all to better illuminate the creative processes and creative conflicts that forged the most indelible image of a vampire the world has ever known.
the coach rumbling our way is real, even if the mountains aren't.
the entire image was captured live in the camera in a single take, through an interesting process.
the signage you will glimpse on the inn's exterior wall is also in hungarian.
when bram stoker wrote dracula, the region around the borgo pass was part of transylvanian hungary.
today it's in romania, where dracula tourism is a big part of the economy.
just like renfield, actor dwight frye is very much a stranger in a strange land, having only recently arrived in hollywood after a varied career as a broadway actor.
in the film versión, renfield has replaced the novel's hero jonathan harker as the real-estate agent who has come to transylvania to sell dracula a home.
the innkeeper is michael visaroff, a russian-born character actor who fled his homeland after the bolshevik revolt.
he acted on the new york stage for some years, coming to hollywood in 1924, at first working for paramount.
tod browning used him in a parallel role in 1935's mark of the vampire for mgm.
he appeared in the opening sequence of tod browning's freaks in 1932, and in dozens of colourful cameos in major productions such as morocco, anna karenina, and camille.
he was a mainstay of the russian colony in hollywood for nearly three decades.
but just a few weeks later, as parsons was still contradicting reports of the actor's demise, she received the news that michael visaroff actually had died, carried away by a sudden bout of pneumonia.
today, transylvanian innkeepers will do almost anything to encourage travellers to visit the real dracula's castle.
in more recent films and novels, vampires are less likely to cower before the cross.
in universal's 1979 remake, for instance, the dynamic is completely reversed.
in germany he had filmed metropolis for fritz lang, and the last laugh for fw murnau.
in dracula he seems constrained, perhaps by director browning, who was traditionally partial to a more static camera, and tracking shots like this appear only sporadically.
coming up is the first supernatural vampire ever depicted in hollywood, actress geraldine dvorak, formerly greta garbo's stand-in at mgm.
and here, in an unforgettable shot, the 1931 public first met count dracula, in the person of bela lugosi.
this results from the original full-aperture image being masked on one side, to make room for the optical soundtrack.
this next scene is highly atmospheric, but it does present a puzzle.
"almost completely hidden in the folds of his great cloak, and has a hat pulled down over his face, so that nothing of him is visible, save a pair of bright, almost feverish, eyes." unquote.
the borgo pass is a real location, but not a place stoker or his adaptors had actually visited.
"there are queer, grotesque-looking trees, with twisted black branches, huge misshapen rocks that in moonlight seem to take on fantastic shapes."
"the whole area through which the coach is passing has a grim, macabre quality, as if taken bodily from a doré steel engraving."
as discussed in our documentary supplement, upcoming is a "glass shot".
the upper portion of the image is painted on glass mounted in front of the camera, and photographed simultaneously with the live action.
the coach and rocky roadbed are live, and the rest of the image is an optical illusión.
the geological formations in the lower part of the picture can still be visited at vasquez rocks park, in the antelope valley north of los ángeles.
the horses being led by a bat was the invention of screenwriter fritz stephani, who imagined the scene in universal's first treatment for dracula in june, 1930.
renfield's cautious approach to the door of castle dracula is emblematic of hollywood's attitude toward dracula himself.
although the stage play had earned more than $2 million in america alone, the studios were as much repelled as attracted by the grotesque, frankly fantastic character and subject matter.
but once renfield had crossed dracula's cobwebby threshold, fantastic and uncanny themes would no longer be taboo in the american cinema.
a virtual land rush would follow at universal and other studios, with frankenstein, dr jekyll and mr hyde, the mummy, and so many others.
this extraordinary set, magnified to soaring heights by another glass painting, was constructed on universal's stage 12, a facility still in use today.
the 18ft-wide spider web was constructed on a wire framework, built up with filaments of rubber cement shot from a rotary gun, like cotton candy.
dracula's first appearance is much more theatrical in the spanish versión, but the simplicity of stoker's introduction of the count is also worth consideration.
"then there was the sound of chains and the clanking of bolts drawn back."
"a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse, and the great door swung back."
"the instant, however, that i had stepped over the threshold, he moved impulsively forward, and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength that made me wince, an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as ice -
more like the hand of a dead than a living man."
it is fashionable in recent adaptations of dracula to modify this famous line to:
"what sad music they make" or "what sweet music they make", but lugosi intones it with just the note of malevolent ambiguity that stoker originally intended.
today, dracula would probably have walked through the spider web with the aid of some digital effect, but consider how much more chilling it is not to see the action.
prompted by what is unseen, we complete the uncanny event in our minds.
dracula is quoting from deuteronomy 12.23, an injunction against consuming blood, one of many explicit and implicit biblical references in stoker.
i'm sure you will find this part of my castle more inviting.
bela lugosi, whose real name was béla blaskó, was born in lugos, hungary, in 1882.
he became fascinated with the theatre at an early age, much to his parents' disappointment, and worked in provincial productions, and finally secured a company position with the national theatre in budapest.
contrary to some accounts, he played mainly minor roles at the national theatre, a source of endless frustration for him.
postwar political upheaval and his activities as a unión organiser forced him to flee his homeland in 1919.
he worked in german films before coming to the united states in 1920 to look for more rewarding work as a stage actor.
he learned many of his english-language roles phonetically, resulting in the deliberate, oddly-inflected diction we now forever associate with count dracula.
curiously, this is another characteristic at odds with stoker's vampire, who took great pains to speak english without any trace of an accent.
you may notice a continuity jump, as renfield's valise suddenly leapt from dracula's hands flat onto the table.
dracula's enquiry as to whether renfield has destroyed all his correspondence has been cut, resulting in an abrupt edit.
another line, cut from an earlier script, would have revealed renfield as the sole proprietor of his real-estate practice, and therefore unlikely to be missed in the event of his disappearance.
"his face was a strong - a very strong - aquiline, with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils;
with lofty, domed forehead, and hair growing scantily round the face and temples, but profusely elsewhere."
"his eyebrows were very massive, almost meeting over the nose, with bushy hair that curled in its own profusión."
"the mouth, so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache, was fixed and rather cruel-looking, with peculiarly sharp white teeth."
one of the most famous lines in dracula is not taken from the novel or the play, but is original to the universal film.
when the play was revived on broadway in 1977, the line was added to the script, presumably because audiences have come to expect it.
they had appeared together, along with fredric march, in the broadway comedy the devil in the cheese in 1926.
but after dracula, both lugosi and frye would find comedy roles few and far between.
the novel dracula is full of shakespearean allusions, and dracula's three wives, as imagined by stoker, are likely inspired by the weird sisters in macbeth.
in addition to geraldine dvorak, the other actresses are dorothy tree and cornelia thaw, whose real name was mildred pierce.
in a later script, though not the shooting script, a wonderful effect is proposed:
that the camera be placed on the floor in renfield's helpless position as the ghostly faces of the women descend upon him.
the visión of dracula repelling the women and claiming the male visitor for himself is one of the earliest images that fired bram stoker's imagination.
it brings to completion the uneasy atmosphere of homoerotic seduction that has coloured the entire sequence.
in bram stoker's own theatrical adaptation, which he presented as a staged reading in 1897,
dracula goes so far as to sweep the unconscious visitor up into his arms and carry him into the shadows, much like rhett butler's rape of scarlett o'hara.
in the modernised stage play upon which the film is largely based,
dracula makes his risky journey to england in an aeroplane, leaving transylvania at dusk and arriving at wimbledon aerodrome before dawn.
due to budget constraints, the sequence was constructed from footage taken from a universal silent called the storm breaker.
the jerky, speeded-up appearance of the film is the result of silents being shot and projected at a slower speed than talkies.
also in 1931, james whale cast him in another demented role, that of the hunchbacked laboratory assistant fritz, in frankenstein.
thereafter, frye found himself in a very narrow career groove, but, luckily for film fans, he gave some of the most enjoyable performances in the entire universal canon.
browning got a start in show business via travelling carnivals and freak shows, for which he had a morbid fascination long after he became one of the highest-paid directors in hollywood.
browning's films are filled with outsiders and misfits, and disturbing images of physical deformity.
he forged a winning partnership in the 1920s with lon chaney, the famous "man of a thousand faces", who was similarly drawn to themes of mutilation and disability.
universal hoped to have chaney work with browning on dracula, where the actor's skill as a make-up artist would likely have created a dracula very much unlike the one we've come to know, but chaney was stricken with terminal cancer before a contract was finalised.
this legendary shot was not scripted, and resulted from an inspired improvisation between frye, browning and freund.
frye's son, also named dwight, told me that he is still startled from time to time by waiters and sales people who, recognising his name on a credit card, spontaneously regale him with imitations of his father's otherwise inimitable laugh.
the sound of traffic is the first inkling we are seeing a film set in the 20th century.
an interesting bit of scripted action was cut here, though possibly shot.
"she selects a flower, and with a half-timid, half-coquettish air starts to obey."
"camera moves forward to a large close-up of her face, as her eyes start to move in a dizzy, circular movement under the spell of dracula's hypnotic stare."
the shooting script also described dracula parting his lips to reveal fanglike teeth.
i'm virtually certain the flower girl was played by a young actress, anita dardour, who did not much longer pursue a hollywood career, but later, under her married name, anita harder, was active in santa barbara community theatre,
where she enjoyed recounting being bela lugosi's first victim outside transylvania.
the script has a description here of a moving camera shot worthy of karl freund that was never quite realised.
through dense fog, which starts slowly to clear, brilliant lights appear, and the crowd becomes denser.
we see men in top hats and the gleam of white shoulders, the richness of furs.
music was used sparingly in early talkies, limited to title sequences and scenes where music was actually performed.
we just heard a snippet of schubert's unfinished symphony, followed rather abruptly by the prelude to wagner's die meistersinger.
the film's opening-title music is from act two of tchaikovsky's swan lake, which became a trademark for universal's early horror films.
it also opens murders in the rue morgue and the mummy.
and here we meet the rest of the principal supporting cast.
from left to right, helen chandler as mina seward, david manners as john harker,
by 1931 the depressión had drawn sharp lines between the haves and have-nots, and perhaps this accounts for some of the film's fascination for audiences then.
it is very puzzling how karl freund could have set up such a badly composed shot, with dracula standing outside and below the box.
- helen chandler, david manners and francés dade - had only brief careers in hollywood, and all for very different reasons.
in stoker's novel and the stage adaptations, carfax is only a house, but in the universal film it becomes, for the first time, an abbey.
it is a stand-in, obviously, for whitby abbey, a ruin on the north yorkshire coast that stoker knew well, and features prominently in the first portion of his novel.
francés dade came from a prominent philadelphia family, acted in stock, and toured with the stage production of gentlemen prefer blondes in the late '20s, before her short fling with hollywood.
dade returned to philadelphia in the mid-'30s, married, and at the time of her death in the 1960s, was reported to have been working as a nurse.
a curious landmark moment, as helen chandler gives the first vocal imitation of lugosi as dracula on record.
no one dreamed then that lugosi's voice would become one of the most imitated and instantly recognisable in hollywood history.
in real life, chandler and dade were the closest of friends.
chandler had acted professionally from age eight, and had an impressive list of stage credits in new york.
she had played one of the young princes in john barrymore's richard iii, and appeared as ophelia in horace liverwright's modern-dress hamlet.
just prior to dracula, she appeared in the screen adaptation of sutton vane's drama
outward bound, about a ship whose passengers don't yet realise they're dead and sailing toward judgment.
chandler seemed to have a promising career ahead, but she also had her own private vampire - alcohol -
which would very soon begin to destroy her, personally and professionally.
bram stoker was the first writer to suggest a human vampire's literal transformation into a vampire bat.
the association of vampires with werewolf transformations, however, had long been established in folklore and literature.
here is the scene's description before being toned down for the shooting script.
quote: "she has given up reading and is lying back, eyes closed as if dreaming."
"the teeth seem to have an almost canine appearance, as his mouth is about to touch her neck." unquote.
the spanish film also avoids fangs, but more effectively ends the scene with dracula pulling his cape over his sleeping victim like a shroud.
more moving camera work from freund, this shot made with an hydraulic crane, also used by cinematographer george robinson for the dramatic staircase appearance of dracula in the spanish versión.
the ward attendant is charles gerrard, an actor who had appeared the previous year, along with david manners, in the film of rc sheriff's acclaimed worid war i drama journey's end.
browning never seemed comfortable with talkies or with directing dialogue, whereas whale had the advantage of being a stage director at a time when hollywood was actively recruiting new talent from theatre.
here we are introduced to the unorthodox scientist professor van helsing, played by the character actor edward van sloan.
like lugosi, van sloan created this part in the original broadway production.
the producers had seen him portray a psychiatrist in a drama by franz werfel, and thought he would be perfect.
"nosferatu" is a word stoker found in a book by the scottish folklorist emily gerard, called the land beyond the forest, the literal meaning, by the way, of the word "transylvania".
gerard mentioned that "nosferatu" was the romanian term for vampire, and stoker took her word for it.
he used the word authoritatively in his novel, and it was further popularised as the title of fw murnau's unauthorised film adaptation of 1922.
the problem is, "nosferatu" cannot be found in any dictionary or lexicon,
dr seward is played by herbert bunston, who reprises his broadway role.
born in england, bunston made his london stage debut in 1897, coincidentally the year of dracula's first publication.
i'll give a fuller outline of the genesis of stoker's novel in folklore and literature, and its transformations via the theatre that resulted in the classic film we are now watching.
legends of spirits who return from the dead to drain the blood of the living are as old as recorded history.
it is eastern european folklore that most informs dracula, but the image of the vampire as a decadent, predatory aristocrat is not part of the folklore tradition at all.
rather, it derives from romantic literature, in particular a short story called the vampyre by john polidori, published in 1819.
polidori was the physician and travelling companion of lord byron, whose scandalous personal life was the inspiration for polidori's supernatural lady-killer, lord ruthven.
polidori's story inspired seven stage plays and two operas in the 19th century, and their influence on dracula is considerable.
novelist bram stoker was born just outside of dublin in 1847.
he was a sickly child, and one can't read about his early life without being reminded of all the anxious sickbed scenes in dracula.
while working as an unpaid drama critic for a dublin paper, he met a rising english actor-manager named henry irving.
stoker was overwhelmed with irving's charisma, and devoted his professional life for the next three decades to managing irving's company and its base of operations, the lyceum theatre.
almost all commentators on stoker have noted his slavish devotion to irving, a relationship that virtually eclipsed his own marriage.
given the fact that stoker was publishing vast amounts of fiction on the side, it is difficult to imagine what time for a domestic or personal life he had at all.
one is tempted to find an echo of his professional bondage in dracula:
the lyceum as the castle and henry irving as the count,
like polidori, stoker also seems to have intended his vampire as a backhanded tribute to a difficult, controlling benefactor.
he spent nearly six years researching, writing and revising dracula, apparently in the hope of achieving a creative collaboration with irving, not just a business partnership.
in our documentary supplement you can see stoker's working notes for dracula, as well as some photos of henry irving.
irving, however, spurned stoker's efforts to recruit him as a vampire.
a chicago drama critic recalled stoker's complaints during one of irving's tours.
quote: "when the late bram stoker told me he had put endless hours in trying to persuade henry irving to have a play made from dracula and act in it, he added that he had nothing in mind save the box office."
"'lf', he explained, 'i am able to have my name on the book, the governor can afford, with business bad, to have his name on the play."'
"'but he laughs whenever i talk about it, and we have to go out and raise money to put on something in which the public has no interest."' end quote.
the vampire's name was originally count vampyre, until stoker came across a reference to the ferocious 15th-century warlord named vlad tepes, popularly known as dracula, meaning "son of the devil".
although stoker did little research into the historical dracula, appropriating the name was one of his greatest inspirations.
david manners told me personally that browning directed none of his scenes, that the production was disorganised, and that his only direction came from cameraman karl freund.
freund must have been very distracted with extra responsibilities for this scene.
notice the very ragged piece of cardboard some grip has obviously used to shield the practical lamp for a close-up.
notice how it never goes away, even for the long shots.
one gets the feeling no one is in the director's chair or behind the viewfinder.
in fairness to browning, even a more polished director like whale was capable of things just as sloppy.
chandler next married the actor bramwell fletcher, best remembered by universal horror fans as the young archaeologist who goes out of his mind after reviving boris karloff in the mummy.
this marriage crumbled, as she began a self-destructive spiral of drink, drugs and periodic commitment to sanitariums.
stoker's dracula engenders disgust rather than attraction, and is an amalgam of qualities that late-victorian england found repulsive.
there was a strong current of cultural xenophobia in the 1890s, and many britons felt threatened by waves of immigration.
foreigners were frequently viewed as a threat to cultural and racial purity, and demonised as biologically degenerate, according to a distorted understanding of the theories of charles darwin.
dracula himself is a perfectly darwinian monster, changing shape up and down the evolutionary scale.
stoker may have been less familiar with "the blood is the life" as a biblical quote, than as an advertising tag line for a quack remedy for "bad blood", a euphemism for syphilis.
some scholars argue that stoker may have suffered from tertiary syphilis, then untreatable, which could have hastened his death in 1912.
the novel offers many strange reflections of other victorian sexual anxieties as well.
many victorian men were disturbed by the growing assertiveness of women.
the concept of the "new woman" was routinely mocked and vilified in the mainstream press as monstrous and degenerate.
in dracula, women's sexuality is shown as a kind of evolutionary throwback linked to blood contamination by a foreigner.
the lusty vampire women in dracula are caricatures of victorian prostitutes, who were popularly scapegoated as vectors of venereal disease and the destruction of the middle-class family.
dracula's first two screen appearances were not authorised by stoker's widow.
he makes the mistake of inviting someone to fire a bullet at him, hoping to prove his immortality.
dracula's death only used the name, but, the following year in germany, fw murnau directly adapted stoker's novel as
bram stoker's widow convinced the german courts to declare the film a plagiarism and order all prints destroyed.
fortunately for film history, several copies did survive, and nosferatu is now considered an expressionist classic.
in the spanish versión, dracula intensifies the mirror smashing by using his cane.
although we now regard dracula as a quintessential screen icon, modern dracula image is, in fact, largely a creation of the legitimate theatre.
when deane wrote and produced the first authorised stage versión in 1924, he introduced a radically reconstituted dracula, a suave man about town, who actively ingratiates himself into the lives of the other characters.
deane added the accent that stoker's dracula had worked so hard to overcome, as well as the now trademark evening clothes and satin-lined cape, trappings borrowed from the familiar, faintly mephistophelian persona of the standard stage magician.
deane completely eliminated stoker's transylvania scenes and restructured the story as a modern drawing-room mystery melodrama, that could utilise stock scenery, and not require the expense of period costumes.
deane's play toured britain for three years before taking residence at the little theatre, a well-known haunt for horror and mystery plays in london's west end.
as a publicity stunt, audiences were greeted by a nurse in the lobby, on hand to administer smelling salts to the faint of heart.
the public loved it, but the snootier london critics were not kind, and reserved special brickbats for the play's more mechanical contrivances.
"in that sense, at least, this piece displays a sure sense of the theatre."
"there is very little of bram stoker in it, but most of us jumped in our seats at least once in every act." end quote.
french windows, secret panels, and, perhaps most memorably, easily-hypnotisable maids, who can be relied upon to remove a variety of annoyances, ranging from crucifixes to garlic flowers to noxious necklaces of vampire-repelling wolfbane.
the american stage rights were secured by the publisher-producer h liverwright, a flamboyant showman, ever on the prowl for sensational properties.
when the west end dracula, raymond huntley, turned down the broadway part in a salary dispute,
liverwright, unable to afford a name performer, offered the role to the relatively unknown hungarian expatriate actor bela lugosi, despite lugosi's shaky command of english.
in the film, any suggestion of vampire foreplay is completely eliminated.
as in london, nurses and fainting patrons were both provided by the management.
a conflict of interest, perhaps, but one which drew no serious complaint.
hollywood studios had long toyed with the idea of filming dracula, but were put off by the horrifying subject, and many studio readers considered it unfilmable for reasons of censorship.
dwight frye may well have regretted ever having heard the name dracula, given the effect it had on his career.
though the roles he was offered after dracula and frankenstein may have been beneath his real talents, he gave wonderfully loony performances in such films as the vampire bat,
the maid, played by moon carroll, is misidentified on the film's main titles as joan standing.
standing actually plays the nurse briggs, who will soon attend the ailing mina.
"so far as the picture value of the story goes, nothing has changed."
"dracula is and always has been material for a great picture."
"while it is picture material from the angle of the pictorial and dramatic, it is not picture material from the standpoint of the box office, nor of ethics of the industry."
"it would be a thing which no child and, for that matter, no adult of delicate or nervous temperament should see, a thing beside which the cabinet of dr caligari would seem like a pleasant fireside reverie." end quote.
dracula ran for 33 weeks on broadway, followed by two simultaneous american tours, one with bela lugosi, and the other with raymond huntley, the original london dracula.
lugosi luckily played the part in los ángeles, home of the film industry.
studio executives, afraid of the novel, realised that the tamer thrills of the stage play might be screenworthy after all.
following two years of often tempestuous negotiations between bram stoker's widow, hamilton deane,
universal purchased the film rights to the novel and stage adaptations for $40,000 in the summer of 1930.
this scene shows another puzzling lapse of directorial judgment, or perhaps just pressure from the front office to keep the production moving.
i had the pleasure of making david's acquaintance during his last years, and i remember him saying how much he disliked film acting as against the stage.
he complained that the studios treated actors like mechanical props, not artists.
he was annoyed at being given chalk marks on the floor for positioning, and hated filming scripts out of sequence.
as a broadway actor, he felt the performer controlled the drama.
but in hollywood actors sometimes weren't even told what was going on.
although it's not apparent on screen, in the days of slow film stocks sets like this were lit with huge arc lights, which could be painful for the actors, especially when shooting was going slowly, as it did on dracula.
a year before dracula he appeared in seven pictures, including journey's end, directed by james whale.
he is also remembered for appearing in other universal horror and mystery films, including the mummy, the black cat, and the mystery of edwin drood.
his six unhappy years in hollywood came to an end, he told me, when joan crawford hysterically screamed obscenities at him for having the temerity to turn down a script.
he told me he simply knelt down, placed the script silently at the screaming crawford's feet, and left, never looking back.
but universal's president, carl laemmle, insisted that the part be played by silent superstar lon chaney, whose fame for grotesque characterisations would provide box-office insurance for the risky property.
chaney had proven difficult and temperamental for universal in the past, but his films did make money.
negotiations got as far as universal's offer of a three-picture deal, including a talking sequel to the phantom of the opera, but chaney had already developed terminal cancer.
his death in august 1930, at the age of 47, shocked the film world.
bela lugosi had lobbied feverishly for the screen part, even corresponded with stoker's widow to try to bring down the purchase price, but the studio showed little interest until all other possibilities had fallen through.
because he was not an established star, the studio felt confident that lugosi could be signed cheaply.
director tod browning received credit on the shooting script, though his writing credit was taken from the titles, with bromfield's and murphy's.
we can safely assume that it was fort to whom we owe most thanks for dracula.
he was also the main screenwriting force behind universal's frankenstein, as well as dracula's daughter in 1936.
because dracula was a transitional film, reflecting the late silent era as much as the early talkies, it presented special problems to the studio.
many theatres in early 1931 were still not wired for sound.
the foreign market, especially spanish- speaking countries, wanted talkies, but they wanted actors to speak in their native language.
the browning-lugosi talkie, of course, but also an intertitled silent versión for theatres still without sound capability.
in our documentary supplement, we've re-created a scene from the silent versión following universal's original cutting continuity.
satan takes christ and tempts him with glorious visions of the material world.
quote: "all these things i will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me." unquote.
in the novel he serves as a kind of psychic informer for the vampire on doings within the sanitarium.
in traditional folklore, a vampire requires an invitation to enter a house, and the weak-minded renfield is happy to make the overture.
the most intriguing variant versión of dracula is the spanish-language film, shot simultaneously at night on the same sets, but with a completely different director, cinematographer, cast and crew.
van helsing's confrontation with dracula is a good demonstration of the divergent approaches taken by the english and spanish versions.
the spanish film follows the shooting script, building suspense while intercutting scenes of mina's seduction of harker, while van helsing attempts to resist dracula's hypnotic commands.
as you can see, browning's versión lets the sequences play independently.
both are valid cinematic techniques, but they demonstrate very different cinematic sensibilities.
many foreign-language versions were produced in hollywood in the '30s, but the spanish versión of dracula is unique in that it amounts to a full-fledged rival production, owing to the personalities and politics of universal at the time.
despite carl laemmle jr's name on the main title of the spanish film, the de facto producer of this versión was paul kohner,
carl laemmle sr's ambitious young protégé and heir apparent, until laemmle sr turned over the studio to his far less experienced son as a 21st birthday present.
kohner was taken off the slate as producer of the english dracula, for which he already had great plans.
he had hoped that paul leni, director of waxworks and the cat and the canary, would direct dracula, with conrad veidt as the star.
instead, kohner was relegated to foreign versions of universal's domestic films.
meanwhile, he had fallen in love with the beautiful mexican ingénue, lupita tovar, star of universal's spanish versión of the cat creeps, which he had also produced, and so effectively that laemmle ordered sections of the american versión
the spanish dracula, included in this edition, along with a special introduction by lupita tovar kohner, provides a rare opportunity to compare and contrast simultaneous studio interpretations of a single script.
under paul kohner, the spanish crew was headed by director george melford.
melford had previously directed rudolph valentino as the sheik, effective preparation for the spanish dracula, a latin lover if there ever was.
kohner, melford, and cinematographer george robinson reviewed tod browning's dailies and obsessively made their improvements.
the actors, however, could not view the rushes, except for carlos villarías as dracula, whom the studio wanted to appear as lugosi-like as possible.
villarías' name was shortened to carlos villar on the main titles, and his contract for the film was further americanised to charles villar.
you can also spot him, once again in formal attire, in the opening scenes of bordertown, with bette davis and paul muni, in 1935.
tod browning was reportedly furious at being upstaged by kohner's production, but the spanish film displays more technical sophistication than browning's.
it lacks the poetry of lugosi's majestic presence and unforgettable line readings, but visually often seems years ahead of its time.
the overall effect is aided immeasurably by the quality of the master element, based on universal's nearly pristine nitrate negative, save for the third reel, which had deteriorated beyond recovery, and was replaced by a multigenerational showprint found in havana.
nitrate was a very unstable film stock, but its high silver content produced an extraordinary image, difficult to reproduce on safety film.
notice in the spanish dracula the deep velvety blacks and crystalline highlights evident everywhere throughout the film.
notice the special care given to lighting, especially the back lighting of spider webs and mist.
notice shots cut from the browning film, including an extraordinary glass shot of carfax abbey perched on a cliff above a pounding sea.
notice george robinson's use of the moving camera, inspired, no doubt, by karl freund but often eclipsing their inspiration.
notice how many times lugosi appears in long shots and medium long shots:
universal didn't have to worry about the censor for its non-domestic product.
the spanish film was produced at the amazing cost of $66,000, as compared to the $341,000 lavished on the english-language film.
the english-language dracula was premiered at new york's roxy theater on february 12, 1931.
an oft-repeated story suggesting a valentine's day tie-in is without basis.
the initial advertising campaign traded instead on the bogus moving back of the premiere from friday 13.
the film was a surprise hit across the country, and contributed to universal having its one profitable year during the depressión.
according to david manners, neither he or his co-star helen chandler took the filming of dracula very seriously, and had to stifle laughter throughout the production.
and there once more is the karl freund memorial piece of cardboard, which nobody in the film ever seems to notice.
david insisted that he had never even bothered to see dracula, but i'm not sure i really believed him.
he was, in any case, flabbergasted at the fan mail he continued to receive more than 60 years after the film's release.
i hope i'm not making him out to be a curmudgeon.
he was an elegant, accomplished and very charming man, but he never understood why, with all the things he had done in his long life, people only seemed to want to talk to him about dracula.
one of the more lurid passages in stoker's novel involved dracula feeding blood from a wound in his chest to mina harker as a mystical, quasi-sexual sacrament.
not surprisingly, helen chandler only describes the action, rather as renfield described the rats.
"and as i looked, it was dripping with fresh blood." unquote.
the most gruesome scene in stoker's novel, the destruction of lucy, is not shown in the english versión, and only briefly indicated in the spanish versión.
quote: "as the door of the vault closes slowly with a faint creaking sound, behind lucy and from somewhere near at hand an owl hoots."
"camera swings around to medium close shot of harker and van helsing behind a tombstone, and we get over harker's reaction to lucy's appearance, which has left him speechless and shaken."
"he stares at the closed door of the vault with an expressión of stupefaction, can't credit his senses."
"there is a faintly pitiful look in his eyes, as if he almost suspected his own sanity."
the script cuts back to dracula's abduction of mina, returning to a shot of the churchyard, lucy's vault in the foreground.
quote: "through the open door there comes the sound of a heavy blow, followed by a piercing unearthly scream."
"he emerges and leans against the door of the vault, head bowed, body sagging."
"van helsing follows, backing out, eyes looking back to the darkness of the vault."
for both tod browning and bela lugosi, dracula was a problematic milestone.
it would be the most commercially successful film either would make, and yet for both of them it was a high point that would never be repeated.
miracles for sale, in 1939, and then retired to malibu and lived a comfortable, if reclusive, existence until his death in 1962.
due in part to the indelible impressión he made with the role,
bela lugosi never escaped the shadow of dracula, although he played the role on screen only one more time, in the 1948 comedy abbott and costello meet frankenstein.
his heavy accent hampered him, and his star in hollywood was soon eclipsed by boris karloff's, who, by the time of frankenstein's release at the end of 1931, was the new new lon chaney.
a long-standing medical addiction to painkillers became tabloid news in 1955, when lugosi publicly sought treatment.
a few years later, when dracula was released to televisión and discovered by a new generation of fans,
in the novel, the destruction of dracula took place after an exciting sea and land chase back to transylvania.
just before sunset and just before reaching his castle, his earth box is thrown from a wagon and pried open by jonathan harker and his fatally wounded american compatriot quincey morris.
"he was deathly pale, just like a waxen image, and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i knew too well."
"as i looked, the eyes saw the sinking sun, and the look of hate in them turned to triumph."
"but, on the instant, came the sweep and flash of jonathan's great knife."
"i shrieked as i saw it tear through the throat, whilst at the same moment mr morris's bowie knife plunged into the heart."
"it was like a miracle, but before our eyes and almost in the drawing of a breath, the whole body crumbled into dust and passed from our sight."
"i shall be glad as long as i live that even in that moment of final dissolution there was in the face a look of peace, such as i never could have imagined might have rested there." end quote.
in the film nosferatu, dracula was destroyed by the first rays of sunlight, which would have surprised stoker, since his dracula walked around london in broad daylight.
in the first stage versión, dracula was stabbed through the heart and evaporated into dust with the aid of a trick coffin, built on the principles of a magician's disappearing cabinet.
"they kill him with one blow on a stake driven through his heart."
"several additional blows, given with a hearty grunt or two, would seem to be a good deal more conclusive."
as the actors took their bows during the curtain call of the stage versión, it was customary for professor van helsing to step forward, raising his hand to stop the applause, and deliver a special message.
original cast member ivan butler told me that provincial audiences, familiar with the speech from repeated touring, eventually recited it aloud, as in a 1920s versión of the rocky horror picture show.
it was included in the original release of the film, but the censors demanded its removal, fearful it might offend religious groups by encouraging belief in the supernatural.
so, to get a better idea of exactly what professor van helsing had to say,
he wants me to ask if you can wait and go on after sunrise.
well, i'm sorry, but there's a carriage meeting me at borgo pass at midnight.
i don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and...
well, and with all this, i thought i was in the wrong place.
dr seward, your patient renfield, whose blood i have just analysed, is obsessed with the idea that he must devour living things in order to sustain his own life.
but, professor van helsing, modern medical science does not admit of such a creature!
and just as i was commencing to get drowsy, i heard dogs howling.
and when the dream came... it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
it was so thick i could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
and then i saw two red eyes staring at me, and a white, livid face came down out of the mist.
it seemed as if all the life had been drained out of me.
darling, we're going to forget all about these dreams and think about something cheerful, aren't we?
pardon me, dr seward... but i think miss mina should go to her room at once.
professor van helsing, i don't believe it's as important as you seem to think.
and that is what your english doctors would say, your police.
the strength of the vampire is that people will not believe in him.
during the hours of the day it must rest in the earth in which it was buried.
but then, if dracula were a vampire, he'd have to return every night to transylvania.
as these attacks continue, she comes more and more under his power.
"further attacks on small children, committed after dark by the mysterious woman in white, took place last night."
miss mina, i promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
if you can save lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
and, knowing that a vampire must rest by day in his native soil,
i am convinced that this dracula is no legend, but an undead creature whose life has been unnaturally prolonged.
and i could see that there were thousands of rats, with their eyes blazing red - like his, only smaller.
and then he held up his hand and they all stopped.
now that you have learned what you have learned, it would be well for you to return to your own country.
i prefer to remain, and protect those whom you would destroy.
she will live through the centuries to come... as i have lived.
should you escape us, dracula, we know how to save miss mina's soul, if not her life.
and i will have carfax abbey torn down stone by stone, excavated a mile around.
i will find your earth box and drive that stake through your heart.
dracula and his wives, they take the form of wolves and bats.
they leave their coffins at night and they feed on the blood of the living.
i don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and...
well, and with all this, i thought i was in the wrong place.
i may be able to bring you proof that the superstition of yesterday can become the scientific reality of today.
but, professor, renfield's cravings have always been for small living things.
and when the dream came... it seemed the whole room was filled with mist.
it was so thick i could just see the lamp by the bed, a tiny spark in the fog.
and you, miss mina, you're looking exceptionally... (van helsing) pardon me, dr seward... but i think miss mina should go to her room at once.
professor van helsing, i don't believe it's as important as you seem to think.

incredible, perhaps, but we must face it, we must cope with it.
as these attacks continue, she comes more and more under his power.
miss mina, i promise you that after tonight she will remain at rest, her soul released from this horror.
if you can save lucy's soul after death, promise me you'll save mine.
miss mina is to wear this wreath of wolfbane when she goes to bed.
watch her closely and see that she does not remove it in her sleep.
but don't forget she's my daughter, and i must do what i think is best.
mr harker, i have devoted my lifetime to the study of many strange things - little-known facts which the world is perhaps better off for not knowing.

one upon a time there was a big big city with many many millions of inhabitants.
and in this big, big city stood a proud stony palace, 800 years old, who has lived through wars and revolutions without losing a single stone.
a painting of immense, immeasurable value, a painting visited yearly by thousands of admirers, from all sorts of foreign countries
and this painting ... this little painting ... one beautiful sunny day before its guards' very eyes, was stolen from this stony palace
the louvre's management declined my offer, so it suits me very well that the painting has changed its owner in the meantime.
i hope i come to a quicker agreement with you than with the louvre's management.
now i'll confess that i'm the thief of the mona lisa.
and i'll tell them too that i did it for you.

here you see the mona lisa, ladies and gentlemen it is leonardo da vinci's masterpiece the world's most famous painting the portrait of the beautiful mona lisa del gioconda she is exactly 406 years old the painting, not the woman
for centuries artists and scholars have tried to solve the mystery of her smile but nobody has yet managed to get behind the secret of this strange, saintly woman
therefore the louvre's administration has decided... to put the paintings, catalogue no.
1717 ... 1717 ... 453 ... 453 ... 1601 ... 1601 ... under glass.
it's no use to offer 15, 20 million or even higher sums the mona lisa will definitely remain in the louvre

he seems to be as interested in connie these days as he is in helen.
heaven knows there's nothing about connie's golf that would appeal to him.
and if i were you and had a wife like connie, believe me, i'd appreciate her.
i'm hanged if i'd be playing around with a follies girl the way you are.
well, one night he asked me out to dinner... this friend of mine and this follies girl.
he was called away on business before we were through and... well, naturally i finished dinner with her.
i was just wondering if i dare ask helen down for the weekend.
you know, i've already invited tony and i have a hunch that...
i think it's rotten the way a thing like that gets around.
don't you think there aren't any decent people left in the world?
i didn't know you could do anything as good as that.
why, they say i was the best boxer in the history of the club.
as a matter of fact, i'd have given anything if... if i could have lied successfully again.
well, i did try very hard not to fall for it.
why don't you take a couple of weeks off and go up in the mountains?

why, you'll pay for every one of them out of your salary.
and the next time you are caught shooting... you are fired.
yeah, you'll probably get stranded again the way you did with the rodeo.
only next time maybe you won't even land with a top-gun joint.
she says you're out of it, so i'm letting you go.
but i'm holding her unless she'll spill who gave her that gun.
nobody in the beer racket ever welshed out on a pal, yet.

ah, that's just about of lucky as that little rubbish that yarn of hers.
why, you'll pay for every one of them out of your salary!
and the next time you are caught shooting, you are fired.
no, he's just like an old bull we had back on the ranch.
he stamps around a lot, but he hasn't got any horns.
i used to ride some pretty tough broncs back on the ranch.
you'll probably get stranded again, the way you did with the rodeo.
meet me round the corner from there in 15 minutes if you have to break your arm to get there.
i said... if you have to break your arm to get there.
what are you doin' travelling' around with that west side mob, anyhow?
pop, he might get troubled being' in a spot like this.
there's a shyster with a writ for you downstairs, so i've got to do it.
the law don't look so good when it works both ways, eh inspector?
you gonna let him get away with a thing like this?
if he's runnin' this mob what are you gonna do about the big fella?
before the face of the moon will be round you all will die !
you first you second you third you fourth and you at last.
one of my trousers, what use is it to them ?
if you let them do, they will steal our underwear !
the amphibian spits some kind of saliva which is collected on a piece of paper.
then he makes it drink to the person you want to harm.
when we first travelled to the moon on board the apollo our perspective of the world was forever changed
for the first time we were able to see mother earth from a distance
the picture gave us an understanding, that our fragile planet is a unique part of the universe
while telescopes prolong our view beyond the solar system, we begin to understand that our world, as well, is connected to a galaxy in tremendous and creative change
for more than a decade the danish physicist henrik svensmark has been working on a new theory about the climate.
already now it is obvious, that his results will change our understanding of climate change.
throughout the years svensmark and his colleagues have struggled to be heard, in a world, that seems to have decided that global warming is man's work.
but, perhaps, the answer to the mystery of climate change, is to be found in ordinary clouds in the sky.
i figure the cost on every bit of work done by the company.
without me, they couldn't tell whether they were making money or losing it.
if he told all he knew, we could break the gangs in this city forever.
we could send to prison, if not to the electric chair ..
it would tell every gangster in this city that there is law.
and every one of them will be answerable to the law.
we saw the man in the yellow raincoat, didn't we, ma.
well doggone it, he stood right there on the running board,
i was just ready to grab him, when he tripped me.
and when i was trying to right myself, he popped me on the head with something.
"by which he expects to convict campo of the murder of preston and clark."
orville, if them two girls in the common room don't punch out soon.
so we broke the door in with the woman screaming bloody murder all the time.
and there she was in the bathtub without a stitch on.
then i planned on putting them all in a house of detention until after the trial.
but i didn't think that campo or his men would work so fast.
up there it was "mr leeds" this and "mr leeds" that.
"have a cigar, mr leeds" and "won't you take this chair, mrs leeds".
they rallied to save him, to save their own hides for the future.
i'll protect you if i have to camp the whole police department on the doorstep.
why should we be penned up in here like a lot of crooks in jail?
you've a chance to do the city a service worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
why you kicking if there's nothing to do but read magazines?
next time bring me some knitting needles or a mouth organ.
if they make a move to stop me, i'll ask the governor to call out the militia.
i'll throw a guard around the criminal court building and panel a special jury.
donny sent me up here to find an old wrist strap.
he said it was in here so i got to ..
i'll call the commissioner and tell him to meet you at stanton street station.
i'll throw every policeman i can in the area, and go through it house by house.
i might hesitate to arrest your mother, but you tell the truth or in you go.
well, you can pick me out a cell with a nice southern exposure right now.
i heard that and i don't like it a danged bit.
i may be a little bit old, but let me tell you right here.
i ain't never going to get too old to tell the truth.
i see that fellah shoot them two men in the street.
and we kept the country together for a lot of young scamps like you.
standing around sucking cigarettes saying "what do we get out of it?".
and you can keep her up there or you can haul her down.
because you be scared of a lot of back- stabbing, yellow-bellied foreigners.
he's not exactly what i'd call a star witness, but he's the best we've got.
we can't afford to let him out of our sight, even for a second.
call summerill to the stand first, then jackie, and then the girl.
that should be enough to hold campo for the grand jury.
you think for a minute, no matter what we do, those rats will turn the boy loose?
you think they'll let him go so he can go to the rogues gallery and pick them out?
but it won't be by any bargain with a bunch like that.
why, they'd cut his throat the minute we turned campo loose.
is that the man who killed who men in front of your eyes?
and then ran past you as close as he is now?
the horses will cut you down if you try that often.
if they want to cut me down they'll have to go some.
remember, i was still in the hallway wheñ i saw him.
i came up out of the cellar with a glass of jam in my hand.
those mugs couldn't find their own nose if it was running.
now you bring it over the end of your finger like this.
twist the bottle and put the drip back with the cork.
but master marius doesn't care, so it trickles onto the label.
i'm glad the french flag flies over those faraway lands, though i can't say it does much for me.
but to go there - especially by boat - no thanks.
no, he's changed to a dutch woman at least twice the size.
when he goes to see her, he makes excuses to hide it.
say what you will, the good lord is not very kind.
such a devoted wife, and so good at putting the employees to work.
some may say i've not waited long enough, but my conscience is clear.
i've wept more in four months than others do in years.
i'd say i did, but you'd only see it on the pots of face cream in the window of the corner shop.
but the right poem at the right time lends tone to a conversation.
but, if they get married right away, and if they have kids, they'll need money.
in that case, i'd give them an allowance as long as i had my fish stall.
i forgot the key to my stall, so i couldn't lock up till i'd gotten it.
then i saw a light through the crack, so i knocked.
i learned to sew, so i could wear a new dress when you came on leave.
every time you spoke to a girl, i wished she'd drop dead.
i'll say, "going out?" and he'll say, "yes, to the movies."
he goes out, climbs back through the window, and locks his door on the inside.
she can never love again, and she takes to the streets.
and, once she gets started there, she has nothing to lose.
i'm sure she's a virgin, and i've seen and know nothing.
but if you've been exchanging glances and caresses, you must get married as soon as possible.
since before you left for algeria, when you were knee-high to a grasshopper.
one night, in this very bar, marius's mother lifted you up and asked,
but master marius doesn't care so it trickles onto the label.
that's why the bottles are easier to pick up than put down.
last thing at night when you see all the lights on the water.
haven't you ever wanted... to turn round and put out to sea?
say what you will, the good lord is not very kind.
such a devoted wife and so good at putting the employees to work.
some may say i've not waited long enough but my conscience is clear.
i've wept more in four months than others do in years.
i'd say i had but you'd only see it on the pots of face cream in the window of the corner shop.
but the right poem at the right time lends tone to a conversation.
but master marius doesn't care, so it trickles onto the label.
that's why the bottles are easier to pick up than put down.
lay a hand on marius and i'll kick you so hard your teeth will chatter.
lay a finger on marius and you'll wake up in the hospital.
i know i've got a quick temper, but i'd never start a quarrel that could end in a massacre.
i wasn't even looking at him when he pounced on me.
i'll say, "going out?" and he'll say, "yes, to the movies."
he goes out, climbs back through the window, and locks his door on the inside.
if it's an apology you want, i'll say i'm sorry right now.
no, i demand an apology that reflects the gravity of your remarks.
she can never love again, and she takes to the streets.
and, once she gets started there, she has nothing to lose.
i'm sure she's a virgin, and i've seen and know nothing.
but if you've been exchanging glances and caresses,t you must get married as soon as possible.
since before you left for algeria, when you were knee-high to a grasshopper.
one night, in this very bar, marius's mother lifted you up and asked,
thinking that water makes him even more beautiful she goes to wet her hair in order to become beautiful as well, just like daphnis
but she is not satisfied with the reflection of her naked body on the water
so choose me, because i'm white as milk and blonde like the hay ready for scything.
he is young, hairless as a woman and dark-skinned like a wolf.
he herds goats and stinks terribly and if he, as they say, was breastfed by a goat, he is no different than a goat
just like zeus, i was raised by a goat and i don't stink just like pan doesn't stink.
this is all i wanted to tell you and now you can choose whoever you want.
but that kiss was not just a kiss but a spark that lit the flame of love inside daphnis's heart
on this spring night, the nymphes were singing love's song under the moonlight
he is in pain but he doesn't know the reason because just like chloe
lykainia, the sensuous woman from the city seeks satisfaction for her lust for beautiful daphnis
it's a summer evening and the hot wind caresses the young lovers.
when we are apart we cry and when we are together we want something but don't know what.
in a few words filitas we are sick but don't know with what
one day in the woods, my husband found by accident a little baby that was nursed by a sheep.
he gladly took it with him because he considered it to be a gift from the gods.
they swear to the god of the waves that they will love each other for ever, that they'll never forget each other and that no matter what, one day they'll be back together.
he, a lord's son, leaves for the city, while she, a shepherds daughter, stays back alone
like a dove that lost it's mate, weeps for what's is lost, maybe forever.
but he also withers in the city, just like chloe, and even more for his lost love.
on a dark night at the old place where their love first started, the boy in love calls for his mate to meet him, as she did before.
the restoration of the film "daphnis and chloe" was done by the greek film archive's restoration department with the help of orestis laskos
conrad, your own butler, who has been with you for years ..
who pays your bills, watches your diet, won't even go to hear you sing.
now where would i be today, if it weren't for albert?
he's been very kind and generous, quite aside from putting me in grand opera.
"you are not singing with your voice, you are singing with your uh ..
well, never mind what he thought it was i was singing with ..
it means that we're going to a villa .. we two all alone.
the moon is out .. the stars are shining, and the whole night smells of flowers.
if you think .. that alfred von gronac is any consolation, you're mistaken.
do you really believe he's taught me the depths of passion and the heights of love?
i can assure you i respect you quite as much as though you were my wife.
you respect me so much, that you're dining with maida linden tonight.
she .. she asked me to tell her when the marchesa went to bed, sir.
she told me not to mention the matter to you sir ..
of course, i could say that you've gone to bed too sir, if you like.
oh no, don't do that .. no, merely tell her that i'm alone.
it seems an impertinence for a stranger to keep dropping in here in such a fashion.
well, you've said that so often madame, it might be rude to contradict you.
madame, i will never miss another opera .. in which you sing.
may i be permitted to kiss the hand of a great artist?
i've been having a little trouble with my ears, lately though.
i took some pills for it but they didn't work very well.
that premier dancer of yours hardly shares your opinion, i'm afraid.
every time i come here to the theatre lately, he watches me like a cat.
suppose he falls in love with one of those beautiful women?
for a man like you, there is nothing wrong with it.
until i feel as though, every nerve in my body had a voice that was screaming.
how can i stand it unless you give me all i need?
that would only make your image the size of a mountain.
to do him any good at all, you've got to tear yourself out of his heart.
yet the blooms wait for the caress of your breath and the touch of your hand.
once nestled in your bosom, they will again lift up their fairy heads.
when the sun pours his golden light on the white marbles of acropolis they shine through the streets of athens
you should make me, petran, director here since i know every one of those
i'll provide money for all of you if i'm in charge
until today we tried reign, military power, the dictatorship of pagkalos,
he is marrying her because she saved his life and he even broke up with his mistress gina
today paolo is getting married and his sister is coming by plane from calcutta
october 1815 was abducted to st. helena by the british on board the bellerophon... the whole world breathed with relief.
the emperors and kings which he had removed from their thrones or put on their thrones like chess figures... watched pitilessly and with timorous gratification... the deep fall of this titan.
i don't think it wise... to let ariane go on her own to berlin.
you seem to attach a great deal of importance to ariane's staying in zürich.
ariane is close to me, because she is close to you.
after all, she'd been educated in your house... she could almost be your own daughter.
heine once arrived in a pretty little town... he saw a girl at a window watering her flowers, and he said:
yesterday i wasn't here yet... tomorrow i shan't be here any more... but today i am yours.
well... travelling is a weakness of mine, i couldn't possibly resist the temptation.
i'll marry an engine driver any day , it wouldn't be the first time either.
i'm so glad... that i've escaped from the dangers of love, as you used to call them so luckily.
otherwise how would i stand before you now if i had fallen in love with you at the time despite all precautions?
i thank god that i have never had to face those terrible dangers.
and i thank you, grand-duke, that you've let me go so unbroken from of your hands.
i don't love you, and you don't love me... so what's there to destroy?
you were just been looking for an adventure while passing through town.
the emperors and kings which he had deposed or enthroned like chess figures... watched pitilessly and with timorous gratification... the downfall of this titan.
st. helena's climate was to kill him within a few years.
i don't think it wise... to let ariane go on her own to berlin.
you seem to attach a great deal of importance to ariane's staying in zürich.
ariane is close to me, because she is close to you.
after all, she's been educated in your house... she could almost be your own daughter.
dear mr. konstantin michael, you said today that you would rather avoid a young girl
dear mr. konstantin michael, you are fanatical supporter of frankness, therefore i must tell you that i am that i have never had tea with a man before.
what fools the men must have been you knew before me.
# tell me, you women, you who know about it: [figaro]
# tell me, is it love which is burning here so brightly?
# tell me, is it love which is burning here so brightly?
i've been so relieved ... that i've escaped from the dangers of love, as you used to call them so luckily.
otherwise, how would i stand before you now, if i had fallen in love with you at the time, despite all precautions?
i thank god that i have never had to face those terrible dangers.
and i thank you, grand-duke, that you let me go so unblemished from of your hands.
i don't love you, and you don't love me... so what's there to destroy?
you were just looking for an adventure while passing through town.
that stirs up the police and makes things more expensive and harder to handle.
you don't think i had anything to do with those murders?
why, all i have to do is stand still and they'll be swarming all over me like a bunch of bees.
i'm gonna tell them all i know, and you take your own chances.
now, don't let's try to figure out how much you've trusted me.
i promised to help you, sure, but you didn't say anything about any black birds.
haven't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else?
well, if i'm peddling it, i'm selling to the highest bidder.
why, as a matter of fact, i have a large sum of money on me, and, naturally, i was alarmed at being trailed.
i'm not usually timid, but in a strange city one never knows.
and miss wonderly, is she also afraid to go home in the dark?
miss wonderly is taking some notes that i haven't finished as yet.
if you won't listen to me, i know someone who will.
lieutenant dundy might be interested in what i've got to say.
for years, they had taken the cream of the east as spoils of victory.
we all know that to them the holy wars were merely a matter of loot.
you might as well say it belongs to the king of spain.
but i don't see how you can say it belongs to anyone, except by right of possession.
hey, what are you doing here this hour of the night?
well, you told me to stick around till you came back.
i don't know why it's so valuable, but it's worth a fortune.
sam, whoever shot that captain will do the same to you.
my guesses might be excellent, but i'm not silly enough to make them in front of a district attorney.
i don't think i'm convinced yet that the police have the right theory.
spade, you're concealing information that will enable us to solve this.
and by withholding that information, you make yourself an accomplice to a murder.
you can always get me at my office or my home, mr. bryant.
i aim to give service at all times, night and day.
you can't expect us to believe that you're afraid of the police and not able to handle them.
i'm not afraid of the police, and i can handle them.
and i'm in this mess up to my neck, and they know it.
you're not a man that worries about a little trouble, sir.
you've received your money, why can't we have the falcon now?
i said i want 20,000 bucks, and besides, i couldn't get the bird before daylight.
there's a baggage checker for that suitcase we got last night.
i want you to bring it over to my apartment early this morning.
so wilmer followed him to his hotel and did what he did.
if wilmer killed both of them with the same gun then the bullets will match.
well, if you thought that you were right, thursby never killed archer.
oh, i know archer was dumb, but not dumb enough to let thursby catch him up a blind alley with his gun stuck away in his hip pocket and his overcoat buttoned.
and if you had asked him to go up that alley with you, and he knew no one else were there, he would've gone.
and then you could have stood with your body close up against his, and he would have grinned from ear to ear, and you could've shot a hole right through him.
you figured that thursby would be nailed for the killing, and then you could get the black bird for yourself.
but when you found out thursby was shot, you needed a protector, and so you came back to me, right?
miss wonderly's gonna meet him tonight at her hotel at 8:00.
and i think it would be safe for you if you met him in the lobby.
i would have run away yesterday instead of coming to you.
i know i haven't any right to ask you to help me blindly.
but remember, you're not hiring me to go out and murder or steal.
you simply want me to get the black bird for you in a lawful and honest way.
i'm not usually timid, but in a strange city one never knows.
if i may go with you when you leave, i'll feel much safer.
pirates captured the boat on which it was shipped to spain and took the bird.
i've traced the history of that bird all over europe, sir.
it took me that time to locate it, but i did it.
i traced it to the home of a russian in constantinople.
archer was killed by a woman who wanted him out of the way.
number two, the wife's paramour committed the crime with the object of removing archer as an obstacle to their illicit relations.
and when i do, spade, you'll know that we have information about you and miles archer's wife that will require a lot of explanation.
well, the only chance i see of saving myself would be to bring in the murderers all tied up in a nice little bouquet.
i'm not afraid of the police, and i can handle them.
but you've gotta toss them somebody to hang the works on.
why, i feel toward wilmer exactly as if he were my own son.
well, you can easily pick another son, but there's only one black bird.
you seem to forget that you are not in a position to insist on anything.
i am in a swell position, and don't you forget it.
we tried to persuade him to join us, but we couldn't.
so wilmer followed him to his hotel and did what he did.
i'm not thursby or jacobi, and i won't play the sap for you.
you know down in your heart that in spite of everything i've done
london is so full of fog... that it has penetrated our minds... set boundaries for our vision.
as men of science, we should be curious... and bold enough to peer beyond it... into the many wonders it conceals.
i shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body... in sickness and in health.
today, i want to talk to you of a greater marvel:
i believe the day is not far off... when this separation will be possible.
in my experiments, i have found... that certain chemicals have the power...
i was drawn to the mysteries of science, to the unknown.
but now, the unknown wears your face... looks back at me with your eyes.
one day, london will glow with incandescence... and will be so beautiful that even you will be moved by it.
i find london quite satisfactory as it is... and i'm not interested in your shortcuts and your byways.
we'll be so gloriously happy... that even the french will be jealous of us.
i'm so thrilled and tempted, but i don't want to hurt my father.
yes, but a gentleman like me daren't take advantage of them.
gentlemen like me must be very careful of what they do and say.
i tell you no man ever needed another or loved another... as i need and love you.
i don't know what to say... but if you'd been ill that would have been different.
- i expect a man in your position... to observe certain traditions.
i want to see you more settled down before i entrust my daughter to your care.
here's hoping that hyde rots wherever he is... and burns where he ought to be.
and here's hoping that dr. jekyll... will think of ivy once in a while.
now, lanyon... will you let me take this glass and leave without further question?
i've gone too far not to see this through to the end.
from her heart has come an ever-increasing flow of virtue and moral blessing.
she came upon a world sadly mired in the ways of the flesh.
jekyll, i wouldn't talk these experiments around very openly if i were you.
you're dealing with things it would be better not to mention.
miss beatrix would be after me properly if we did that, sir.
and besides, mrs. marley's butler tells me that their new cook is really first-class, sir.
since then, he had undergone a complete change until this afternoon i found him completely reverted to the animal.
we can clearly understand a shock to the nervous system but how does that affect the soul?
i think he was shocked from normal good into complete evil.
when i say he was a good man, i don't mean he hadn't had a bad thought.
now, suppose we could break that chain, separate those two selves free the good in man, and let it go to its higher destiny and segregate the bad.
but aren't you a bit presumptuous in assuming that there's evil in all men?
after all, we've all had thoughts that we didn't want published or shouted out loud.
and we certainly have had desires that are not confined to a drawing room.
dr. courtland, advanced theories are always a sore point with the medical council.
or even with the queen's physician, if there's a comfortable profit...
seems i must discontinue my research, spend my life diagnosing measles mumps, and whooping cough or encounter his serious disapproval.
even i was surprised when you took a marley dinner party into your confidence.
i don't think it was a triumph, but it was an attack.
but one which would have been repulsed even without your help, john.
wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
that's where you'll find me from tonight on until i get what i'm looking for.
and don't you believe about this here comet and the "world coming to an end" business.
if you ask me, it don't amount to a row of beans.
i don't want you to go, bea and i can't agree with your father's decision, but i know he's thinking of your happiness.
i can't argue against that and i can't ask you to.
i suppose i'm just not very interested in housing conditions at the moment.
you mean because a man doesn't cover the pages with sentiment?
what a lucky man i am to be loved this way.
but supposing i did have to leave you for a while?
this is a great day for us, if you'll forgive me saying so.
soon be back to our regular meals, regular hours, regular ways, sir.
what's the sense of being victorious if you haven't a head?
what's the sense of my taking a trip, acquiring art and culture if you're not going to pay attention?
but february is still a long way away, and your father will simply have to listen....
if you don't stop looking at me like that, i won't be responsible for what happens.
i may be getting old and crotchety, but i won't put up with it anymore.
i'm afraid you must take her off my hands as soon as possible.
"a nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir, wouldn't be knowing such a person. " no.
" i ain't such a bad looker, sir, when i'm more myself. " yes.
he's the kind of man you can get down on your knees to, isn't he?
a sweet, dear, pure man that you can trust and believe.
he leadeth me in the path of righteousness, for his name's sake.
yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death....
as men of science, we should be curious... and bold enough to peer beyond it... into the many wonders it conceals.
i shall not dwell today on the secrets of the human body... in sickness and in health.
i believe the day is not far off... when this separation will be possible.
in my experiments, i have found... that certain chemicals have the power....
i beg your pardon, sir, but you would make us very happy... if you'd set an earlier date for our wedding.
i've already announced to you... that you would be married on the anniversary of my own wedding.
i find london quite satisfactory as it is... and i'm not interested in your shortcuts and your byways.
but it's in the byways that the secrets and wonders lie:
miss muriel is scolding me for having missed her dinner last night.
go and tell her that i shall come to dinner tomorrow night.
anyway, i'm relieved to know he's not confined to his bed.
begging your pardon, sir, it's my opinion that my master isn't well.
if that blighter was my man, he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on me... not if he knowed what was good for him.
he's a brute, that's what he is, and my advice, dearie....
i don't know whether i shall be able to tear myself away from you.
perhaps i shall go only as far as the door... and the sight of your tears will bring me back.
the sufferings of the spirit are so difficult to communicate... even to those who love you.
do you think there's anything that has to do with you that i wouldn't understand?
i assure you, sir, you will have no cause to regret it.
to be frank, jekyll, i'm not at all satisfied with your conduct.
i am the angel whom you wanted to slave for and love!
and i'm going to take you in my arms now and hold you close!
what you are about to see is a secret you are sworn not to reveal.
you who have sneered at the miracles of science... you who have denied the power of man to look into his own soul... you who have derided your superiors.
with purity in our hearts with right thinking in our minds we arm ourselves with intolerance of all evil.
so it is, on this glorious sabbath morning in this momentous year of 1 887 we naturally turn our thoughts towards that way of life as exemplified by victoria, our beloved queen.
she came upon a world sadly mired in the ways of the flesh.
but during her reign, the forces of good have achieved notable....
before that, he was a fine, solid citizen kind with his children, deeply in love with his wife.
since then, he had undergone a complete change until this afternoon i found him completely reverted to the animal.
we can clearly understand a shock to the nervous system but how does that affect the soul?
i think he was shocked from normal good into complete evil.
good and evil are so close as to be chained together in the soul.
now, suppose we could break that chain, separate those two selves free the good in man, and let it go to its higher destiny and segregate the bad.
develop your practice, cultivate the circle in which you and beatrix shall move.
harry, my boy, i've always wanted a son, and now you're going to be that.
even i was surprised when you took a marley dinner party into your confidence.
you need not agree with me, i just have a decision to make.
then let's just say that we were foolish and next time we'll drink to one another's health.
i suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.
but one which would have been repulsed even without your help, john.
wouldn't you run less risk if you confined your experiments to the lab?
sir charles, i know it's strange to find beatrix here but i want you to believe that--
all i can believe is that your ideas are not normal, jekyll, not fit--
father, i know my being here is difficult to understand, but i'm not ashamed.
then, my dear, i shall be for you, because i do understand.
hobson told me last night that they were expected home today, sir.
this is a great day for us, if you'll forgive me saying so.
but if i ever go away again and you don't write just because you're ill....

- the counsel for the defense evidently has as poor a memory as his client.
didn't general shubin say that mata hari was in his rooms at the time he was telephoning?
we cannot blame monsieur dubois, of course for accepting too readily whatever information was given to him.
but has he any proof that it was shubin who spoke over the telephone?
i demand that the prosecution produce some one witness who will swear to one definite thing or i demand that mata hari be acquitted with the apologies of the court.

observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe, as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
all of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the case history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
the very day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
he said he was on the verge of a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
he was doing so well, and he seemed so happy with his work.
well, you know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electro-biology were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
he wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
i told him that his demands were unreasonable, and so he left the university to work unhampered.
i'm going to turn that ray on that body and endow it with life.

yes, yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?

today you'll make me very happy by doing the same for elizabeth.
and i hope in 30 years time, a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.
this was an added scene, photographed long after the film completed production, in anticipation of objections from religious groups over the theme of divine presumption.
staff universal screenwriter at the time, john huston, wrote earlier drafts that included lines such as "frightful, supremely frightful, would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator."
scenario editor richard schayer wrote another version, which includes material used in the speech now being given:
"here we unfold the portentous record of frankenstein, man of science, who sought to create a man in his own image, not reckoning upon god."
the music is an original composition written for the picture by film composer bernhard kaun.
other than the end-titie music, it is the only scoring used in the picture.
this was reminiscent of the very first stage production of frankenstein in 1823.
the character of the monster was billed only with a question mark at that time.
originally, this opening sequence began with a distant shot in profile of the funeral procession going up the hill.
this was dropped during editing, but appeared briefly during the flashback sequence in the bride of frankenstein.
the panning shot of mourners ends by a statue... and the statue is of the grim reaper.
here we are introduced to henry frankenstein, played by colin ciive, and his assistant, played by dwight frye.
this sequence does not derive from the novel, nor does it derive from any of the play adaptations that followed.
but the novel that spawned the frankenstein phenomenon was radically different in many ways from the countless dramatisations that followed on stage and screen.
mary woiistonecraft godwin was staying there with her lover, later her husband, the poet sheiiey.
together with their neighbour lord byron, his physician, doctor poiidori, and mary's stepsister claire, they would often gather on chilly, wet evenings and read ghost stories aloud.
one evening byron suggested they each try their hand at writing a story, a story of the supernatural.
on another night, mary heard an intense conversation between sheiiey and byron concerning the nature of the principle of iife, and whether it might ever be discovered and communicated.
"i did not sleep, nor could i be said to think."
"i saw - with shut eyes, but acute mental vision -
i saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together."
and here's frankenstein literally throwing dirt on the face of death.
in 1831 , mary sheiiey revised her novel for a new edition.
she also added an introduction, which tells the story of its origin and ends with mary bidding her "hideous progeny go forth and prosper."
the adaptability of the story to the theatre was recognised immediately.
in 1823, there were at ieast five stage versions, both serious and comic.
one, presumption; or, the fate of frankenstein by richard peake, was to serve as a basic transcription of the novel for the stage and a source for further elaboration.
action and melodrama were the keynotes of peake's play, and frankenstein the creator and his creature were presented as instant antagonists.
there is a major creation sequence - not in the novel - an assistant to frankenstein named fritz - not in the novel - and a non-taiking monster.
in the book, frankenstein's creature eventually becomes absolutely verbose, with an impressive vocabulary and masterful syntax.
his monologues run on for pages and, on occasion, entire chapters.
here at the medical college we are going to meet again actor edward van sioan, this time in character as doctor waidman - a variation on his van helsing role in universal's dracula with beia lugosi that was released earlier in 1931 .
van sioan also played van helsing in the new york stage production of dracula, with lugosi, in 1927.
later he played van helsing again in universal's 1936 sequel dracula's daughter, and a similar role, professor muiier, in the mummy in 1932.
van sioan began his professional acting career on the stage in 1910.
he worked with stock companies in montreal, canada, and in boston, newark and cleveland, finally reaching the new york stage in 1923.
the death kiss, death takes a holiday, the black room, the phantom creeps,
before i hang, the monster and the girl, and so on and so on.
the character of fritz, played by dwight frye, was not in the novel, but was introduced in the 1823 richard peake stage dramatisation.
in early drafts of the film scripts the character was mute, but it made sense to give him speech so that frankenstein could have dialogue rather than talking to himself or resorting to pantomime during the rather nefarious preparatory work for the experiments.
the about-to-be-dropped-and-shattered "normal brain", followed by fritz taking the "criminal brain", was a later addition to the script by francis edwards faragoh.
this element had never been used before in novel or plays, and indeed took away from the basic innocence of the monster.
a rather unusual way to introduce a new sequence and new characters.
the room in elizabeth's home is a set left over from universal's the cat and the canary from 1927.
leading man john boies was given the thankless part of henry's friend and elizabeth's friend - although he would iike to be much more than friend to elizabeth.
boies acted and sang on broadway, then came to hollywood and starred in several musicals, such as the desert song, rio rita and king of jazz, revealing a rich baritone voice.
later he became a leading man in screen soap operas, such as the 1932 back street, only yesterday, and the 1937 stella dallas.
and he was a father or father figure to shirley temple in the littlest rebel and curly top.
here it is planted that victor has strong romantic feelings toward elizabeth, but, being a gentleman, he doesn't overplay his hand, and for the most part stays in control with regard to his feelings.
henry henigson, a universal executive, early in the preparation of frankenstein complained to screenwriter garrett fort that the implied frustrated love affair between elizabeth and victor was "insufficient" as relief from the horror plot.
fort responded "the girl is not deeply in love with henry and does love victor."
"her wedding to henry is the result of a childhood arrangement between families, quite in keeping with the continental conception of such matters."
"the girl, in her scenes with henry, will receive all the sympathy because we realise she is making the best of a bad bargain, but doing it like a thoroughbred."
mae ciarke, director james whale's leading lady in the recently completed waterloo bridge, whom he liked, was a natural choice for frankenstein's fiancee.
she had been in film since 1929, and before that was a dancer, actress, singer, appearing primarily in nightclubs, broadway musicals, vaudeville.
in 197 4, author anita loos revealed that ciarke was the inspiration for her loreiei lee in gentlemen prefer blondes in 1926.
mae had a stand-out and showy role as molly the prostitute in the 1931 version of the front page.
but her starring role in waterloo bridge, in which she played a woman forced to turn to prostitution by her circumstances, was ciarke's favourite part - and she is excellent in it, delivering a performance of extraordinary delicacy.
"i asked for mae ciarke for elizabeth because of her intelligence, fervour and sincere belief that frankenstein would claim the public interest."
the only other actress of record considered for the part was bette davis, under contract to universal for six months.
but apparently producer carl laemmie jr did not think too highly of her sex appeal.
after frankenstein, james whale immediately cast mae in the ieading role in the impatient maiden.
back in 1927, english theatrical producer and actor hamilton deane decided to try out another subject for his company, to alternate with his version of bram stoker's novel dracula, on his tour of the english provinces.
this was to be a new adaptation of frankenstein by peggy webiing.
the initial presentation of this frankenstein took place late in 1927 in preston, england.
it continued to alternate in the provinces with dracula, and it finally opened in london, considerably revised, in february 1930.
peggy webiing retained some basic ideas from the novel and the previous plays, but she made substantial changes in time, locale, incidents and characters.
mary sheiiey's narrative took place over a considerable period of time.
in the novel, frankenstein vows to destroy his creation and pursues him to the arctic, where the scientist dies and his foe goes off into the ice and mist, presumably to his death.
shortly after the play opened in london, the london times announced that it wouid be produced on broadway.
as with deane's dracula, playwright and newspaper correspondent john l baiderston - who had recently written the hit play berkeley square - was engaged to revise and brush up the material for american consumption.
he kept, for the most part, peggy webiing's modifications and structure, but he added several touches of his own.
for exampie, fritz, the hunchback who assists frankenstein in his experiments, was added - although he is mute in baiderston's version.
with the release of dracula in early 1931 , universal pictures had a major success.
the film dracula was based more on the hamilton deane play than on the novel.
this stage version had been exceptionally well received in england and in america.
in may 1931 , the screen rights for the play were purchased for $20,000, with an additional 1% of the gross earnings to go to webiing and baiderston.
at universal's stipulation, the play wasn't produced in america - never has been - contrary to the original plan.
rex ingram's 1926 film the magician has various aspects that were later used in frankenstein.
the dwarf assistant in the magician hobbied down a staircase similar to the one in this film when he was going to open the tower door.
also, there is a comic porter scene from shakespeare's macbeth, and that's often been cited as an influence.
in a letter, fiorey said that he and schayer "worked with garrett fort" - who wrote universal's dracula -
according to fiorey, the edited test ran for 20 minutes, which seems extremely long.
it was photographed by paul ivano, and it started with a short conversation between victor moritz and waidman,
according to fiorey, the test lasted up to and including the initial awakening of the monster.
the actors involved were edward van sioan, dwight frye, lugosi - all of whom from the film dracula - and two stock players.
from all indications, lugosi's test make-up and garb were reminiscent of paul wegener in the golem, the 1920 german film about a legendary figure of clay brought to life by rabbi loew in the 15th century.
according to forrest j ackerman's interview with edward van sioan - who later played the major role of doctor waidman in frankenstein -
lugosi claimed he did not want to play a speechless brute laden with make-up.
mary sheiiey's and webiing and baiderston's talking monster had been relieved of speech, but he did speak in universal's first sequel, the bride of frankenstein, for which baiderston received co-adaptation credit.
in an interview carl laemmie jr gave within six months of his death, he states that the sight of lugosi in the test make-up made the studio head "laugh like a hyena".
fiorey claimed the test make-up was virtually identical to the final make-up worn by karioff, but obviously laemmie didn't regard the karioff version as funny in any way.
make-up artist jack pierce told an interviewer that lugosi himself influenced the test make-up negatively, thinking "his ideas were better than anyone's."
though not followed to the letter, the general structure of the first half of the webiing/baiderston play was at ieast in evidence in the evolving film script for frankenstein.
but the iast part of the play was not used until universal made bride of frankenstein four years later.
the final act of the play was concerned with frankenstein's preparations for the making of a mate for the creature.
then the monster stumbles into the electrical apparatus and dies as a result of a flash of lightning and the machine that brought him to life.
between the time the play premiered in preston, england, in 1927 and its london opening in 1930, there were considerable changes in the script.
in the early version, the monster ieaps from a cliff and destroys himself.
frankenstein and his fiancee, whom the monster had wanted to possess, are then happily reunited.
there is no material regarding the plan to create a mate for the monster.
by the end of june, a director was confirmed for frankenstein:
he'd just finished directing an extremely weii-received screen adaptation of robert sherwood's play waterloo bridge for that studio.
his previous fiim-directing credits were the dialogue scenes in howard hughes' aviation epic, hell's angels, and all of journey's end - the screen version of the exceptionally popular rc sherriff world war i play that whale had directed on the stage in london and then in new york.
aii of the elaborate electrical apparatus, full of sound and fury, but signifying and actually doing nothing, was built by kenneth strickfaden, who began his film career as an electrician in 1921 .
the first film to use some of his electrical pyrotechnics was the 1929 return of sherlock holmes.
the devices that, as a hobby, he had collected over the years and stored, came from discarded industrial parts, old aeroplanes, sections of automobiles, radio-broadcast transmitters and odds and ends of electrical equipment.
in 1981 , he said "i'd put something together, then sit back and marvel at it."
the apparatus was leased by the studio and ray lindsay operated it.
in 1981 , the academy of motion picture arts and sciences sponsored a gala affair in strickfaden's honour.
above the ceiiing-opening of the lab set electricians operated large iightning-arc machines, which gave off bright flashes of intermittent light and showers of sparks.
boris karloff recalled years later "the scene made me as uneasy as anyone, for while i lay haif-naked and strapped to doctor frankenstein's table,
director james whale later commented on the importance of the creation scene:
"i consider the creation of the monster to be the high spot of the film, because if the audience did not believe the thing had been really made, they would not be bothered with what it was supposed to do afterward."
"by this time, the audience must at ieast believe something is going to happen."
"it might be disaster, but at ieast they will settle down to see the show."
the lines "in the name of god" and "now i know what it feels like to be god"
were deleted by some local and regional censor groups at the time.
and in 1937, the production code office required that the lines, among other aspects, definitely be eliminated for reissue approval.
throughout this film, scenes of incredible intensity and dramatic impact are relieved by relatively mild scenes.
here we are introduced to henry's father, baron frankenstein, portrayed by british stage actor frederick kerr, who had recently worked with director whale on waterloo bridge.
incidentally, the baron here refers to "an old ruined windmill" where his son is.
in early drafts of the script, frankenstein's laboratory was in an old ruined windmill.
this was changed to a watchtower, but somehow this reference in the script wasn't changed.
frederick kerr was on the stage almost continuously for 50 years in both england and america.
in 1930, he commenced his film career and appeared in raffles with ronald colman, among other films.
for a iong time he was with the old vitagraph studio in new york city.
beimore appeared in a great range of parts over the years, in such films as the 1922 oliver twist, the 1924 sea hawk,
the king of kings, the count of monte cristo, cleopatra, mutiny on the bounty,
little lord fauntleroy and the adventures of robin hood in 1938.
but young laemmie, who had been made head of production in 1929 as a 21st-birthday present from his father, had been right about the very successful all quiet on the western front in 1930, and, of course, he was right about the recent dracula.
whale, after giving the subject some thought, decided to do frankenstein - partly, perhaps, because it wasn't yet another world war i subject.
remember, in 1931 no one had seen what the character had looked like, other than advertisements, posters.
his visage was hardly that of the icon we have known through the decades.
also, we weren't sure what he would do, how he would react, what would happen.
this speech of henry frankenstein, not in the final shooting script, gives us an added dimension to henry's character and psyche.
here is the intelligent, enquiring and sensitive human side of the obsessed and passionate man of science.
although universal wanted leslie howard for the role of henry frankenstein,
the first son of frankenstein wanted to provide the monster with a healthy brain.
the second son did replace the brain, but with one not exactly normal - that of igor, played by bela lugosi.
whale chose to direct this in an unusual, but very effective manner.
first, we heard the sound of the monster in the hall: suspense.
then, when the door opens, he walks in backwards: more suspense.
and the dramatic turn, followed by a series of progressively closer shots, which allow us to be startled, and yet able to observe in detail that face.
whale certainly was involved in the concept of the monster's look.
he made several sketches and consulted with make-up artist jack pierce, but pierce was the man who executed the work.
he and karioff worked for several hours each evening over a three-week period to evolve the make-up prior to the start of production.
over a bald cap, the head was built up with layers of cotton and collodion.
karioff's lean, gaunt face and features were necessary for the perfect realisation.
a top layer of biue-green greasepaint gave the skin a grey look on biack-and-white film.
the metal studs that protruded from the sides of the monster's neck were inlets for electricity.
significantly, the creative make-up always allowed karioff's expressions full play, accounting to a considerable degree for the effectiveness of his characterisation.
these were weighted in such a way as to enable him to lean considerably forward.
the iii-fitting black suit was made up with shortened sleeves to make his arms appear longer.
karioff's test convinced whale and universal executives that he was perfect for the part.
in the august 12th script this scene is handled quite differently.
"the moment the monster sees the fire, it lets out an unearthly shriek."
"its mouth widens to a hideous grin, its awful hands beat the air, it starts to rise from the chair, moves toward the dwarf."
obviously, changing the matches to a torch made much more dramatic sense and was a precursor for things to come.
fritz is played by kansas-born dwight frye - neither a dwarf nor a hunchback, but another victim of typecasting after his role in the 1931 dracula as the crazed renfieid.
after frankenstein, he was the village iunatic in the vampire bat, and so on.
but, before coming to hollywood in 1930, he had an impressive career on the stage.
after touring in stock, vaudeville and musical comedy, he then had leading roles in a variety of broadway plays, and in 1929 the critics voted him one of the ten best actors of the legitimate stage.
he died in 1943, aged 44, from a heart attack, which could have been brought on by the strain of working nights at lockheed aircraft company in world war ii in order to support his family, while playing some bit roles by day and acting in local theatrical productions.
frankenstein's relationship to the monster is decreed, in frankenstein's words, as "only command, blind obedience, no discussion."
he treats the creature cruelly, and in baiderston's adaptations makes considerable use of a whip and a hot iron.
he also finds satisfaction in having the monster perform tricks like a puppy,
literally commanding him to "iie down, roll over", and he refers to him as a slave.
this cruelty is transferred in the final screen version to the character of fritz, who continually provokes frankenstein's creation with whip and torch, thereby making frankenstein more sympathetic.
incidentally, many people refer to the monster by the name of frankenstein.
in fact, in peggy webiing's 1927 play, the revised 1930 presentation, and baiderston's version of the play, the monster is called frankenstein after its creator, on many occasions by some of the characters.
whale was quoted, when asked why he decided to do frankenstein:
"of 30 available stories, it was the strongest meat, and gave me a chance to dabble in the macabre."
"i thought it wouid be amusing to try and make a physical impossibility seem believable."
"also it offered fine pictorial chances, had two grand characterisations, and had a subject matter that might go anywhere - and that's part of the fun of making pictures."
among the changes made in the script by the new writer, francis edwards faragoh, was giving dialogue to fritz, frankenstein's assistant, who in the previous universal scripts had been a mute.
most importantly, both frankenstein and the monster were modified into basically more sympathetic characters, given more dimension.
certainly now we feel sorry for the monster, as in the novel and the webiing play.
in the novel frankenstein is a student of science, not a doctor, not the son of a baron.
the scene in which the monster is given life takes place in the upstairs room of frankenstein's house, not, as in this film, an old watchtower.
frankenstein's study, in an old house at goidstadt in switzerland, has been fashioned into a laboratory, and there's a storm during the creation scene.
in the early versions of the screenplay an abandoned windmill is used for the lab and a storm is raging.
a description of the setting in a preliminary script draft in the studio files mentions "something suggestive of the laboratory in metropolis."
the 1926 german silent film had a mad scientist involved in a laboratory creation scene amidst considerable electrical paraphernalia.
in mary sheiiey's book, the description of the procedures by which frankenstein gave his creation life is vague.
indeed, this major sequence of the creation, a high point in this film, is presented in one not-very-detaiied paragraph in the book:
"i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation, but now, now that i had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart."
the monster has been described as a projection of mary sheiiey's feeling of isolation and hatred, which stem from the death of her mother when she was only ten days old.
mary was barely tolerated by her cruel father and was driven inward, spending her childhood in solitary pastimes: reading, writing, daydreaming.
in a letter sent to colin ciive before production, director james whale described how he perceived the character of frankenstein:
whale's companion, david lewis, had been impressed with boris karloff's performance as the rather ungainly and odd convict in the stage and screen versions of the criminal code.
he recommended that whale meet the actor to see for himself the potential.
whale and karioff arranged a meeting and whale decided to test him for the role.
whale said later on that he was fascinated by karioff's face:
"his physique was weaker than i couid wish, but that queer, penetrating personality, i felt, was more important than his shape, which could easily be altered."
although karioff had been in american films since 1919, he was hardly a weii-known performer.
born in a london suburb, he emigrated to canada in 1909 and eventually joined various theatrical touring companies, playing supporting roles in plays all over canada and the united states.
by 1919, he was in hollywood playing extra and bit parts in films.
he also alternated as a truck driver until the mid-'20s to support himself.
frankenstein, of course, made him a star in a myriad of horror films, but he also played character parts in a variety of other films.
he was forced to resign from sandhurst royal military college and went into the theatre, training at the royal academy of dramatic art.
he made his london bow in 1919 and toured in many plays, including repertory companies.
james whale hired him to play the doomed captain stanhope in the extremely successful world war i drama journey's end.
he starred in the play and film version, which was also directed by whale.
other film roles following frankenstein include one more river, from the iast of the forsyte saga novels, also directed by whale,
clive of india, about his ancestor, mad love, based on the hands of orlac,
the man who broke the bank at monte carlo, and, of course, the bride of frankenstein in 1935, in which he reprised his role for director whale.
mae ciarke said in 1971 "oh, how i remember that voice."
"jim whale would say about colin 'his voice is like a pipe organ."'
"'you just arrange him, pull out the stops and his voice comes out like music."'
in 1937, at the age of 37, colin ciive died as a result of alcoholism.
prior to the 1931 frankenstein there were three siient-fiim productions of the story, the first going back to 1910.
the edison company's approximately 15-minute-iong version, according to the script, was a liberal adaptation of mrs sheiiey's famous story.
it featured a hunchbacked and shaggy-chested monster suggestive of quasimodo, with a stark, kabuki-iike white face and a mass of matted hair.
the climax of the film introduced some aspects of the jekyii-hyde theme - the monster was defeated by the power of love.
this, presumably the world's first horror film, was filmed at the edison manufacturing company studio at bedford park, the bronx, under the direction of j searie dawiey, and was coiour-tinted and/or toned for daylight and night scenes.
when frankenstein died after killing the monster, the book was closed and each of the characters revealed to be alive and well.
the third filming was done in italy in 1920 and called the monster of frankenstein.
frankenstein was filmed on the universal lot and the immediate surrounding terrain.
but now the production moved to what was almost certainly lake sherwood in the santa monica mountains near westiake village and close to the dividing line between los angeles county and ventura county.
lake sherwood and its immediate neighbour, sherwood forest, had been used for many years as a choice location for all kinds of outdoor pictures.
the name, according to various sources, derived from its use in douglas fairbanks's 1922 production of robin hood, and it was ideal for jungle epics, westerns, you name it.
seven-year-oid marilyn harris was chosen to befriend the monster in this delicate portrayal.
the monster, for the first and only time, finds a human who is unafraid of him - an innocent peasant child.
"this was a pathetic creature who, iike us all, had neither wish nor say in his creation, and certainly did not wish upon itself the hideous image which automatically terrified humans whom it tried to befriend."
"what astonished us was the fantastic number of ordinary people that got this general air of sympathy."
then he takes frankenstein's crippled sister, a character not in the novel or film, out in a boat and tries to make her float like the dove - but she drowns.
his remorse at this act is one of the motivations that leads to his fiinging himself off the cliff in the 1927 play version.
the monster, as portrayed by hamilton deane in this play, was sympathetic.
in a variant version from the same play, at the side of a river the creature, unaware that death can be caused by drowning, placed the girl's head beneath the water to see her lovely face through the glassy surface.
touched and excited with his first encounter with beauty, the monster tries to float the little girl and feels intense pain and confusion when she sinks.
later the scene was considerably cut and modified from what you see now, but more about that anon.
this european village was built on the back lot at universal for all quiet on the western front in 1930.
it was used through the years for a great many films, including subsequent frankenstein productions.
the wardrobe varies from 1931 fashions to doctor waidman's frock coat of an earlier vintage.
there is never any indication of an automobile, a telephone, a radio, to say nothing of the practice of hanging bodies on gibbets for public viewing.
in another exchange between universal executive henry henigson and screenwriter garrett fort during the script-deveiopment stage,
henigson wrote "i think everyone in the production should speak perfect english and we should take away the jas, the herrs, the frauleins and twists in the language's construction which give it a teutonic distinction."
"we're not trying to place the picture geographically in any particular spot, and i think that we can attend to this by taking the teutonic element out of it."
garrett fort replied "in a story laid in and around goidstadt, with names like frankenstein, waidman, moritz, fritz, etc, it seems that a teutonic element is inescapable."
"if we lay it elsewhere it will be necessary to change every name in the cast, probably even that of frankenstein, which certainly has teutonic connotations."
"this might lead to titles such as 'the monster', 'garibaidi', or 'love and murder in norway', etc."
"i have an idea that there is nothing offensive about the teutonic slant."
"and it is a particularly pertinent angle when we consider that the teutonic type of mind is certainly foremost in the scientific world, etc."
in the novel, frankenstein reluctantly agrees to create a female for the monster, but he changes his mind and the outraged monster tells frankenstein that "i will be with you on your wedding night."
after frankenstein and elizabeth marry, the monster keeps his word and kills the bride.
in edison's 1910 film version, the monster returns on frankenstein's wedding night and, hearing his bride scream, frankenstein interrupts the attack and the monster flees.
in peggy webiing's 1927 british play, the monster falls in love with frankenstein's fiancee.
this production, as we know, was never presented on the stage.
the staging of this scene resembles a similar scene in the 1919 film the cabinet of dr caligari, whereby the character portrayed by conrad veidt has been sent to kill a lovely girl in her bedroom.
the suspense here is well orchestrated and both players do not go over the top in the realisation of the scene.
although mae ciarke remembers tea breaks each mid-afternoon during filming, she never had an opportunity to get to know karioff very well.
"he would arrive at 4am and spend four hours in make-up."
"he didn't have lunch with us because it was easier for him, due to the make-up, to eat alone in his dressing-room bungalow, where he could remove some of his body padding."
"then a couple of hours would be spent removing his make-up at the day's end, and he would require a rubdown after stomping around all day with those weights on his shoes."
the woodcutter is carrying his drowned daughter to the burgomaster's office.
the scripts had maria being carried by her mother, who was also established earlier at their cottage.
this particularly long tracking shot - actually two tracking shots - apparently was difficult for both players.
michael mark, playing the father, appeared later in son of frankenstein,
the ghost of frankenstein and the house of frankenstein, with different roles in each.
going back to the drowning at the lake, this scene was cut entirely or in part by many local state and city censors and in foreign countries before the film's initial release.
but when the studio applied to the production code administration for a reissue seal of approval in 1937, various cuts were demanded.
this scene was modified in a manner that paradoxically compounded the problem.
the action played as photographed up to the point where the monster had thrown his last daisy into the water.
he watched it, then looked at his empty hands and held them out toward the child.
the rest of the scene was deleted, and it stayed deleted for decades until universal's restoration.
incidentally, has anyone noticed the disappearance of the old baron, henry's father?
he wasn't around before, during and after the monster was loose in the household, and he's not around now.
obviously, it is clearly understood that neither victor nor elizabeth are joining the hunting party.
there seems to be no question about the durability of the frankenstein theme, with its innumerable interpretations.
the cosmic theme of the limits of man and the power of god, which extends to man emulating god.
the disturbing idea that science could create life, possibly even eternal life.
the fascination with dolls, mechanical puppets and robots that effectively simulate life.
the faustian concept of the overreacher, who momentarily commands divine power, only to be destroyed because of it.
the theme of the divided self, in this instance creator and creature, that is part of the human psyche and derives from ancient legend.
the dumb innocent, craving love and understanding, but forced to become violent and exercise hatred because of the lack of compassion and the fear of others.
frustration and overwhelming rejection were the cause of the monster's brutality.
frankenstein, then, is a mixture of fascination and horror, dream and nightmare.
mary sheiiey succeeded in creating a tale that would, she said,
"speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror."
the enraged, driven villagers, frequently carrying torches, became a staple in universal's cavalcade of frankenstein films.
in bride of frankenstein, villagers seek the monster with lanterns and weapons.
in frankenstein meets the wolf man, the townspeople are in pursuit with guns and howling dogs.
in house of frankenstein, there is a band of torch-bearing villagers.
in house of dracula, the mob chases the murderer through the town, up the hills and through the cemetery.
the exterior chase scenes were shot on portions of the universal back lot, including poiiard lake, and around the nearby hills.
lifted footage of the search party from frankenstein was later inserted in the bride of frankenstein, the mummy's tomb and house of dracula.
if frankenstein had been made just a year or two later, at this point we would be listening to rousing music underscoring.
we're no ionger on the back lot, but on one of universal's sound stages with plaster rocks and a cyclorama in the background representing an ominous sky.
a cyciorama, incidentally, that had some problems, as you will soon notice.
incidentally, director james whale described this chase as "the pagan sport of a mountain manhunt".
note that the wounded man is character actor francis ford, who earlier had been a universal writer, director and leading player.
whale was in a prisoner-of-war camp in germany, where he directed and acted in plays for his fellow prisoners.
later he abandoned his job as a cartoonist for a london newspaper to become a fuii-time theatre person - actor, director, set and costume designer and stage manager.
according to whale biographer james curtis, the genesis of the look and interpretation of karioff in frankenstein goes back to whale's highly praised performance as the demented son of charles laughton in the london stage production of a man with red hair in 1928.
following frankenstein, karioff worked with whale again in the old dark house and the bride of frankenstein.
karioff continued to make films, work in television and appear in popular plays, such as arsenic and old lace in 1941 , and peter pan, as captain hook, in 1950.
near the end of his life, boris karloff continued to work with half a lung, crippling arthritis and a bad heart.
karioff was always grateful for the monster characters that built his career.
he once said of frankenstein's monster "god bless the old boy."
a few years later he retired from films and started painting in his pacific palisades home.
in 1957, his maid discovered whale's fully dressed body in the pool out in the back.
there was an ugly gash on whale's forehead, and many suspected foul play, but ultimately it was revealed that whale committed suicide.
it wasn't easy for karioff in take after take to carry ciive to the windmill and then up to the second level with all that heavy paraphernalia that he had on.
and certainly his physical conflicts were difficult for the same reason.
the exteriors of the windmill, built on the back lot at universal, were a combination of a fuii-scaie lower structure of 12ft and an upper miniature.
the williams travelling matte process was used to effect overlapping elements.
the original plan was to have the monster seek the mill, the only refuge it knew from the time its life began.
frankenstein had been laid out to film in continuity for the most part, starting on august 24th.
the schedule ran over by five days and shooting was completed on october 3rd.
it made the new york times ten-best list for the year.
exploitation gimmicks that go back to grand guignol presentations in the 1920s and perhaps earlier were resurrected - ambuiances stationed at the front of theatres, nurses on duty in the lobby, free nerve tonic, and so on.
"if the psychologists can be believed, at the familiar psychological moment".
"people like the tragic best at those times when their own spirits are depressed, and the economists tell us that even more than their spirits are at a iow ebb."
the reference to the economists was referring to 1931-32 being the worst years of the great depression.
in 1937, when universal submitted frankenstein to the considerably tougher production code administration for reissue approval, a number of deletions were ordered.
"eliminate scene in which the creature throws the child into the water."
the ending of the film was changed at the iast moment before its opening dates.
up to this time it was intended that both frankenstein and his creation would die at the conclusion of the film, as in the webiing/baiderston play.
reaction at the previews caused universal executives to decide on a new ending, which necessitated the filming of a short epilogue depicting henry frankenstein recovering from his injuries and reunited with elizabeth, while his father, the baron, and the maids drink a toast
colin ciive was on his way to europe, so another actor was used instead.
and mae ciarke could have been substituted, based upon the staging of the single shot.
frederick kerr, as the baron, reappeared from his prolonged absence from the footage.
the prologue with edward van sioan was also a late addition.
observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
all of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.
"i am living in an abandoned watchtower close to the town of goldstadt."
"only my assistant is here to help me with my experiments."
he wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
i told him that his demands were unreasonable, and so he left the university to work unhampered.
at first i experimented only with dead animals, and then a human heart, which i kept beating for three weeks.
but now i'm going to turn that ray on that body, and endow it with life.
what i really want to know is when will the wedding be, if you please.
unless henry comes to his senses, there'll be no wedding at all.
where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars?
30 years ago, i placed this on your mother's head, henry.
today, you'll make me very happy by doing the same for elizabeth.
there can be no wedding while this horrible creation of mine is still alive.
i made him with these hands, and with these hands i will destroy him.

the day we announced our engagement, he told me of his experiments.
he said he was close to a discovery so terrific that he doubted his own sanity.
he was doing so well and he seemed so happy with his work.
you know, his researches in the field of chemical galvanism and electrobiology were far in advance of our theories here at the university.
the bodies we use now, dissecting them for lecture purposes, were not perfect enough for his experiments, he said.
he wished us to supply him with other bodies, and we were not to be too particular as to where and how we got them.
but now i'm going to turn that ray on that body, and endow it with life.
and you really believe that you can bring life to the dead?
yes, yes, yes, we know all about that, but what do you want?
what i really want to know is when will the wedding be, if you please.
the whole village is kept waiting, the bride is kept waiting, and i am kept waiting.
henry must come home, if i have to fetch him myself.
where should we be if nobody tried to find out what lies beyond?
have you never wanted to look beyond the clouds and the stars?
here is one to make the best man look still better.
30 years ago, i placed this on your mother's head, henry.

and i hope, in 30 years' time, a youngster of yours will be carrying on the tradition.

a little tomain poisoning will get your mind off your other troubles.
when you get that feeling, a cross between delirium tremens and the seven-year itch, you know that something will come up any minute.
a good nightmare always begins in a dark cellar with a coffin.
a caretaker comes down to see that all the ghosts are locked up for the night.
he acts like congress and always ends up where he started.
this exercise is good for water on the knee, water on the brain and other naval diseases.
it is also a good way of enjoying the jitters without drinking alcohol.
the poor fellow is afraid to go to bed, so he sleeps in a hammock.
the only way to stop is to do it faster and tire yourself out.
if you saw this sight in your bedroom, maybe you'd have a jitter or two.
then he'll get down to the rugs and they'll need new furniture.
so dracula comes up close and shows us what the well-dressed ghost is wearing.
when dracula was born, his mother took one took at that face and had herself arrested.
so he decides to go back to his coffin and sleep for 100 years until congress decides to do something about the depression.
he's asleep, but maybe if we talk in his own language we can wake him.
you see, it's very simple, if you know how to handle your monsters.
helen is beside herself, and now something else is beside her.
there's nothing for helen to do but faint and wait for the nightmare to be over.
dracula's income tax was due and he had to get some money.
when night came, helen had decided to call it a day.
finally, the deed is did, and helen awakes in her sleep.
when helen tells the young man she saw a ghost, he says he'd like to see one too.
dracula has finished his entrée and is coming back for the dessert.
the monster is still around and he's getting a lot of bad ideas.
in the background is the monster, ready to try out dracula's technique.
if mae had eyes in the back of her head, she'd faint.
he has to sit down all day, because when he stands up his feet touch the floor.
but finally he sees what he wants and decides to go after it.
sometimes i think we film historians are a bit like mad scientists, poking around in dusty vaults, stitching together our research, trying to give a jolt of new life to hollywood's forgotten heritage.
fortunately one film that's never been forgotten is james whale's frankenstein, one of the most influential and imitated motion pictures of all time.
boris karloff's star-making performance created one of the most instantly recognisable cultural images of the 20th century.
so, if my friend here doesn't make you nervous, perhaps you'll join us both as we enter the vaults of universal studios, and open the frankenstein files.
my father always referred to the monster as his very best friend.
it's simply the most powerful character make-up ever created for the movies.
they were all hole n there, the weather was bad, and somebody came up with the idea -
percy or lord byron - that they should have a writing contest.
of course, mary shelley, when she wrote the book back in the early 19th century, described it somewhat differently, and, if i may read just a paragraph, it leaves a great deal up to the imagination.
"it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils."
there are so many aspects, which i think is the keynote as to why this particular idea has transcended time.
the novel was perfect for stage dramatisation, and playwrights realised this right off the bat.
richard peake presented presumption, which was the fate of frankenstein, which actually was quite a melodramatic offering.
it starred as the monster an actor named thomas potter cooke, who became in the 1800s pretty much what boris karloff became in the 1900s.
he became typecast, playing the frankenstein monster in all kinds of revivals of that play, in other plays.
the stage production that most influenced universal's film was the version written in 1927 by peggy webling and produced by the british actor/manager hamilton deane.
hamilton deane in the stage production actually was dressed very much like - he was the monster, the creature - very much like henry frankenstein, the creator.
they dressed very closely, and once again it was the mirror-image bit.
he didn't ask to be brought forth into the world, and there he was.
and because of his appearance, which was not his doing, no matter where he went or what he did, people were frightened of him.
there was a tremendous roll of thunder, flashes of lightning, and that was the final curtain.
techniques of the theatre, especially expressionist theatre, had a major influence on prototype horror movies produced in europe in the 1920s.
in terms of art direction, german expressionist cinema was characterised by intense light and dark, lots of shadows.
the hollywood style for a very long time was generally flat lighting, lighting to make sure people saw everything.
when hollywood filmmakers were first confronted with the german films, they were very surprised by the kind of atmosphere you could create, and that flows into the horror films, especially that universal made.
studio founder carl laemmle was born in germany and imported much european talent to universal city.
it was his son, carl junior, who was most attracted to horror themes, much to his father's initial disapproval.
but the success of dracula was all that was needed for junior laemmle to have his way with horror films.
he'd grown up partially in france and had started out in the '20s making interesting little experimental films that were very strongly influenced by german expressionism.
the cabinet of dr caligari starred werner krauss and conrad veidt in a tale of mind control, madness and murder.
it was one of florey's favourite expressionist films and a model for his proposed frankenstein.
there are similarities in that you have in the cabinet of dr caligari the werner krauss character who, in some ways, creates this being, but he is without his own will.
he is a somnambulist who caligari keeps bringing back almost from the dead.
another antecedent to frankenstein, of course, is the golem, which is also a film about a human-made monster that comes to life and then wreaks havoc.
although bela lugosi was announced as the star of frankenstein, he had objections to the assignment from the beginning.
with the success of dracula, he didn't want to play the monster, this mute, heavily made-up character.
the make-up people who were there all describe lugosi's make-up as basically resembling the golem.
and the story is that lugosi had a very claylike skin, a claylike look and also this big head of hair.
the first writer assigned to the project was garrett fort, who combined florey's ideas with an unproduced stage adaption of the peggy webling play by john balderston.
despite florey's passion for the project, another director was already waiting in the wings, and florey was soon out of the picture.
he had directed a very successful play in england called journey's end, with colin clive, who eventually played henry frankenstein.
whale was a rapidly rising hollywood director, noted for his direction of world war i dramas.
it was the moment when theatre directors were being imported by hollywood to deal with the fact that actors suddenly had to speak.
whale was more than anything responsible for the choice of karloff.
my father had been in hollywood about ten years when he made frankenstein in 1931.
and what most people don't know is that it was his 81st film, i believe.
he was in many silent films and also in a lot of talkies before frankenstein.
he was having lunch in the commissary, dressed in one of his good suits and looking very spiffy, and james whale spotted him.
whale saw his face and was fascinated by the bone structure of it, and called him over to have some coffee.
whale, as he put it, engaged in general conversation about england and about the problems of english actors and english directors in hollywood, and then suggested that he had a role for which he would like boris karloff to do a screen test
my father used to say his feelings were a bit hurt, since he was looking his very best that day, and to be considered for the role of the monster, he thought "hm".
but he was wise enough to take the part and, with the help of jack pierce and his genius make-up, went on to make cinema history.
jack pierce was the creator of all the classic universal horror make-ups, the head of the make-up department at universal during the golden age.
he was the man that did frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the wolf man, and all the classic make-ups.
i just hope someday i can do something that comes close to that.
of course, there's a great deal of debate about that make-up.
a lot of people think that it was inspired by james whale rather than jack pierce.
jack pierce, naturally, would say that he was the man, although he did say at one time that it was a compromise.
head flat on top so you could take out the old brain and put in the new like tinned beef.
the monster's trademark square forehead may have been partly inspired by thomas edison's 1910 version of frankenstein, in which charles ogle played the monster.
films really are a collaborative effort, and so many people are in the mix, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
this was a case where it all worked so well, when you had james whale, boris karloff, jack pierce, all the people involved in this film, it just clicked.
he still had the flat head and the brow, but there were these two ridges on his forehead with a little semicircular clamp on each one.
in fact, it's a photo that still crops up when they need a picture of the monster.
i guess the photo editors weren't too careful about whether it was really in the film or not.
the frontal bone, the brow here, was fabricated out of cotton and spirit gum and collodion, which is this really strong-smelling, very solventy-smelling plastic.
i'm sure it helped that it was early on in his career.
the story goes that karloff felt that in some of the original tests he looked too alive, his eyes looked too alive.
so he suggested that jack do something to it, so they ended up building up these heavy eyelids with mortician's wax over karloff's own lids, only allowing him to open them partway like this, but he was still able to give an amazing performance with these lids.
another thing that helped that corpselike appearance was karloff had a bridge, on his right side, which he removed so he could suck in his cheek, on that one side, and pierce shaded it to accentuate it.
again, when you think of this make-up, you think of the flat head and of the electrodes, which most people think are bolts through his neck.
but they are actually supposed to be how the electricity entered into his body.
if you would have built up much more on him, he would have become very stiff.
collodion isn't really very flexible, especially when you mix it with cotton.
not only was the make-up arduous, on and off every single day, it took three, three and a half hours to put on and almost as long to get it off...
the wardrobe itself was heavy and black, and they shot in the middle of august.
and it was not a fun job, i'm sure, for boris.
the most difficult part of the shoot was my father carrying colin clive up a hill time and time again until they got it right.
designer herman rosse conceived a futuristic look for frankenstein, but, in collaboration with art director charles hall and director whale, the film took on a distinctly gothic look, with angles and shadows in keeping with robert florey's initial expressionist vision.
the concept of the burning windmill also originated with florey, who felt the laboratory should also be situated in the mill.
preproduction concepts for the monster itself by hall and rosse were obviously discarded by director whale, an experienced production designer in his own right.
he was very meticulous about every shadow and every camera setup, and the way that the frame was filled so completely to the top.
and you wonder if the whole verticality of the movie wasn't designed by whale just to get you to that moment.
the sizzling laboratory equipment was the handiwork of kenneth strickfaden, a santa monica inventor who put his mark on mad-scientist laboratories for all time.
the original machines would continue to put in movie appearances until the 1970s.
karloff was fourth billed in a cast headed by colin clive, an actor whose anguished roles sadly reflected his own inner turmoil.
mae clarke played frankenstein's fiancée, elizabeth, and shared her memories with film historian gregory mank.
mae clarke was still very much the actress and insisted on acting out scenes from frankenstein in her bungalow at the motion-picture home.
he'd be up on the boom-crane tower, he'd be in the sound room, he had his finger on every single pulse of the picture.
she talked about colin clive, whom she had great sympathy and empathy for.
and so boris said "i'll tell you what we'll do, mae."
"you just keep your eye on my upstage, away-from-camera little finger, and i'll wiggle it."
"you'll see the monster wiggling his finger and know it's boris in make-up."
he did wiggle his little finger, which was a little finger compared to the rest of him, and she got through the scene all right.
edward van sloan, who had played the role of professor van helsing in dracula on stage and screen, brought a similar note of moral authority to the role of dr waldman.
next to boris karloff, seven-year-old marilyn harris gave the film's most poignant performance.
she said that on the morning that the company assembled at universal to go on location to malibu lake for the scene, there was this little parade of limousines and out came the monster, and she, at the age of seven, ran right up to him and took his hand and said
"may i drive with you?" and boris karloff said "would you, darling?"
and so james whale went up to her and he said
"i'll give you anything you want if you'll do this scene over again."
i don't know whether he saw dracula and thought he would be a good idea for fritz or whether he had seen some other of my dad's work, i don't know.
but james whale became, ultimately, during and after the making of frankenstein, a champion of my father's.
he was in five different james whale films throughout his career.
but the versatile actor was soon typecast in over-the-top horror roles.
they're all weird and they're all crazy, to one extent or another, but they are different from each other.
i think the first time i saw them, he was watching my reaction quite carefully.
and, like many adolescents, he's a clumsy, very awkward thing, so of course children across the world just grafted on to the frankenstein monster, particularly boris karloff, because they could see the inherent innocence, could see the pathos,
could see that the frankenstein monster was very much a child like themselves.
film audiences often confuse frankenstein's name with that of his creation, and possibly with good reason.
james whale seems to have been fascinated with the dramatic interdependency of the characters, according to film historian paul jensen.
the film works, at least partially, because its maker empathised with those two characters.
and i can't help but think that these are two people, each of which is a version of james whale.
the whole idea of it being a stage setting and he's the orchestrator of it,
whale brought out of or found in the situation something i don't think other directors would have bothered or recognised, and that is something that taps into his own sense of demonstration, of presentation, of theatricality.
one of the most effective and personal speeches was added during production, and was possibly written by whale himself.
where should we be if nobody had tried to find out what lies beyond?
but it's one of the most important scenes in the film.
so, whale must have wanted it there, and that's where this side of henry is expressed.
sometimes i find that the scenes that don't contain the most dramatic action might reveal the director's style of work and his talent in ways that are unexpected, if we look at them carefully, those scenes.
one such scene in frankenstein, for me, is the first conversation scene, the one between victor and elizabeth where they're talking about henry.
take a look at that scene because, aside from the fact that it begins with four close-ups - which itself is unusual - instead of an establishing long shot, we've got a close-up of a framed photograph of henry,
close-up of the maid, close-up of victor arriving, close-up of elizabeth rising, and only then an establishing long shot.
we've had to figure out what we're seeing and how those shots go together.
we're involved because our mind has had to relate those shots together.
we have a scene that could be thrown away by a lesser director that is actually turned into a highly visual and cinematic scene.
the last third of frankenstein is the part where at least the story line has its weakest moments, i think.
the gibbet with this body hanging there and being cut down, and the cadavers, and reanimating.
it's hard to believe now, because of the excess that we've all been subjected to over the decades, but in 1931 this was a big deal.
what they objected to in frankenstein were the little girl getting drowned, there were some fairly graphic close-ups of the monster being stuck with hypodermic needles.
and where fritz, the hunchback assistant, is tormenting the monster with a torch, there are some horrific close-ups of the monster with the torch in front of his face.
these are things that today you would see in g-rated movies on television.
the scene with the monster throwing the girl in the lake was cut in certain areas.
during the early talkies, sound was not on what we have today, an optical track, which is a visual strip along the edge of the film.
in the old days, the sound was recorded on big records about this size, and they were played in the theatre, synchronised with the projector.
in 1966, a friend of mine who was working at a local los angeles radio station called me and he said "you'll never believe what's in our studio - the sound disc from the original frankenstein."
and i was always disappointed when all the restored versions of frankenstein always left this line out.
with or without the censored footage, frankenstein was a sensation, and the monster became a major new hollywood icon.
boris karloff's stardom was assured, although in real life he had little in common with monsters.
robert florey's initial uncredited enthusiasm for frankenstein was finally rewarded with an acknowledgement on the french poster and the chance to direct a highly stylised horror film in the expressionist manner.
murders in the rue morgue starred bela lugosi as a mad scientist destroyed by his own experiment, and was partly filmed on the original frankenstein sets.
since bela lugosi's brain had been sewn into the monster's head in the last film, it made some sense for lugosi to finally play the monster himself, speaking in ygor's voice.
but the effect was considered ridiculous by studio heads, and the monster was rendered voiceless again for the release print.
boris karloff, wisely avoiding career quicksand, made his final appearance in a universal frankenstein film.
in house of dracula, frankenstein's creation made the briefest of appearances, a thankless lurch around the lab.
but the frankenstein mystique didn't end with the films of the '30s and '40s.
the universal tradition has inspired generations of filmmakers, even to the present day.
the laboratory equipment in gods and monsters was no longer the work of kenneth strickfaden, but the universal look was unmistakable.
in 1997, boris karloff and frankenstein had the unique honour of appearing on a us postal service stamp, along with four other classic universal monsters.
it was a very, very rewarding experience, because people were so enthusiastic.
i think my father would be the one that would be most surprised and pleased.
he always stressed how grateful he was for having been given the opportunity by james whale to play the monster, how it changed his whole life.
he certainly had seen the opposite side of success for many, many years before fame came his way.
and i don't think he ever had any difficulty with being typecast.
he felt, and i heard him say on more than one occasion, that a typecast actor was a very lucky actor, because if you had been able to make a niche for yourself, do something that nobody else had done or was likely to do,
he truly felt being typecast was the luckiest thing that ever happened to him.
in her introduction to the revised edition of frankenstein in 1831,
mary shelley instructed her hideous progeny to go forth into the world and prosper.
exactly 100 years later universal took her directive to heart and created the most successful movie monster of them all.
this was an added scene, photographed long after the film completed production, in anticipation of objections from religious groups over the theme of divine presumption.
staff universal screenwriter at the time, john huston, wrote earlier drafts that included lines such as "frightful, supremely frightful, would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator."
scenario editor richard schayer wrote another version, which includes material used in the speech now being given:
"here we unfold the portentous record of frankenstein, man of science, who sought to create a man in his own image, not reckoning upon god."
the music is an original composition written for the picture by film composer bernhard kaun.
other than the end-title music, it is the only scoring used in the picture.
this was reminiscent of the very first stage production of frankenstein in 1823.
the character of the monster was billed only with a question mark at that time.
originally, this opening sequence began with a distant shot in profile of the funeral procession going up the hill.
this was dropped during editing, but appeared briefly during the flashback sequence in the bride of frankenstein.
the panning shot of mourners ends by a statue... and the statue is of the grim reaper.
here we are introduced to henry frankenstein, played by colin clive, and his assistant, played by dwight frye.
this sequence does not derive from the novel, nor does it derive from any of the play adaptations that followed.
but the novel that spawned the frankenstein phenomenon was radically different in many ways from the countless dramatisations that followed on stage and screen.
mary wollstonecraft godwin was staying there with her lover, later her husband, the poet shelley.
together with their neighbour lord byron, his physician, doctor polidori, and mary's stepsister claire, they would often gather on chilly, wet evenings and read ghost stories aloud.
one evening byron suggested they each try their hand at writing a story, a story of the supernatural.
on another night, mary heard an intense conversation between shelley and byron concerning the nature of the principle of life, and whether it might ever be discovered and communicated.
"i did not sleep, nor could i be said to think."
"i saw - with shut eyes, but acute mental vision -
i saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together."
and here's frankenstein literally throwing dirt on the face of death.
in 1831, mary shelley revised her novel for a new edition.
she also added an introduction, which tells the story of its origin and ends with mary bidding her "hideous progeny go forth and prosper."
the adaptability of the story to the theatre was recognised immediately.
in 1823, there were at least five stage versions, both serious and comic.
one, presumption; or, the fate of frankenstein by richard peake, was to serve as a basic transcription of the novel for the stage and a source for further elaboration.
action and melodrama were the keynotes of peake's play, and frankenstein the creator and his creature were presented as instant antagonists.
there is a major creation sequence - not in the novel - an assistant to frankenstein named fritz - not in the novel - and a non-talking monster.
in the book, frankenstein's creature eventually becomes absolutely verbose, with an impressive vocabulary and masterful syntax.
his monologues run on for pages and, on occasion, entire chapters.
here at the medical college we are going to meet again actor edward van sloan, this time in character as doctor waldman - a variation on his van helsing role in universal's dracula with bela lugosi that was released earlier in 1931.
van sloan also played van helsing in the new york stage production of dracula, with lugosi, in 1927.
later he played van helsing again in universal's 1936 sequel dracula's daughter, and a similar role, professor müller, in the mummy in 1932.
van sloan began his professional acting career on the stage in 1910.
he worked with stock companies in montreal, canada, and in boston, newark and cleveland, finally reaching the new york stage in 1923.
the death kiss, death takes a holiday, the black room, the phantom creeps,
before i hang, the monster and the girl, and so on and so on.
the character of fritz, played by dwight frye, was not in the novel, but was introduced in the 1823 richard peake stage dramatisation.
in early drafts of the film scripts the character was mute, but it made sense to give him speech so that frankenstein could have dialogue rather than talking to himself or resorting to pantomime during the rather nefarious preparatory work for the experiments.
the about-to-be-dropped-and-shattered "normal brain", followed by fritz taking the "criminal brain", was a later addition to the script by francis edwards faragoh.
this element had never been used before in novel or plays, and indeed took away from the basic innocence of the monster.
a rather unusual way to introduce a new sequence and new characters.
the room in elizabeth's home is a set left over from universal's the cat and the canary from 1927.
leading man john boles was given the thankless part of henry's friend and elizabeth's friend - although he would like to be much more than friend to elizabeth.
boles acted and sang on broadway, then came to hollywood and starred in several musicals, such as the desert song, rio rita and king of jazz, revealing a rich baritone voice.
later he became a leading man in screen soap operas, such as the 1932 back street, only yesterday, and the 1937 stella dallas.
and he was a father or father figure to shirley temple in the littlest rebel and curly top.
here it is planted that victor has strong romantic feelings toward elizabeth, but, being a gentleman, he doesn't overplay his hand, and for the most part stays in control with regard to his feelings.
henry henigson, a universal executive, early in the preparation of frankenstein complained to screenwriter garrett fort that the implied frustrated love affair between elizabeth and victor was "insufficient" as relief from the horror plot.
fort responded "the girl is not deeply in love with henry and does love victor."
"her wedding to henry is the result of a childhood arrangement between families, quite in keeping with the continental conception of such matters."
"the girl, in her scenes with henry, will receive all the sympathy because we realise she is making the best of a bad bargain, but doing it like a thoroughbred."
mae clarke, director james whale's leading lady in the recently completed waterloo bridge, whom he liked, was a natural choice for frankenstein's fiancée.
she had been in film since 1929, and before that was a dancer, actress, singer, appearing primarily in nightclubs, broadway musicals, vaudeville.
in 1974, author anita loos revealed that clarke was the inspiration for her lorelei lee in gentlemen prefer blondes in 1926.
mae had a stand-out and showy role as molly the prostitute in the 1931 version of the front page.
but her starring role in waterloo bridge, in which she played a woman forced to turn to prostitution by her circumstances, was clarke's favourite part - and she is excellent in it, delivering a performance of extraordinary delicacy.
"i asked for mae clarke for elizabeth because of her intelligence, fervour and sincere belief that frankenstein would claim the public interest."
the only other actress of record considered for the part was bette davis, under contract to universal for six months.
but apparently producer carl laemmle jr did not think too highly of her sex appeal.
after frankenstein, james whale immediately cast mae in the leading role in the impatient maiden.
back in 1927, english theatrical producer and actor hamilton deane decided to try out another subject for his company, to alternate with his version of bram stoker's novel dracula, on his tour of the english provinces.
this was to be a new adaptation of frankenstein by peggy webling.
the initial presentation of this frankenstein took place late in 1927 in preston, england.
it continued to alternate in the provinces with dracula, and it finally opened in london, considerably revised, in february 1930.
peggy webling retained some basic ideas from the novel and the previous plays, but she made substantial changes in time, locale, incidents and characters.
mary shelley's narrative took place over a considerable period of time.
in the novel, frankenstein vows to destroy his creation and pursues him to the arctic, where the scientist dies and his foe goes off into the ice and mist, presumably to his death.
shortly after the play opened in london, the london times announced that it would be produced on broadway.
as with deane's dracula, playwright and newspaper correspondent john l balderston - who had recently written the hit play berkeley square - was engaged to revise and brush up the material for american consumption.
he kept, for the most part, peggy webling's modifications and structure, but he added several touches of his own.
for example, fritz, the hunchback who assists frankenstein in his experiments, was added - although he is mute in balderston's version.
with the release of dracula in early 1931, universal pictures had a major success.
the film dracula was based more on the hamilton deane play than on the novel.
this stage version had been exceptionally well received in england and in america.
in may 1931, the screen rights for the play were purchased for $20,000, with an additional 1% of the gross earnings to go to webling and balderston.
at universal's stipulation, the play wasn't produced in america - never has been - contrary to the original plan.
rex ingram's 1926 film the magician has various aspects that were later used in frankenstein.
the dwarf assistant in the magician hobbled down a staircase similar to the one in this film when he was going to open the tower door.
also, there is a comic porter scene from shakespeare's macbeth, and that's often been cited as an influence.
in a letter, florey said that he and schayer "worked with garrett fort" - who wrote universal's dracula -
according to florey, the edited test ran for 20 minutes, which seems extremely long.
it was photographed by paul ivano, and it started with a short conversation between victor moritz and waldman, leading to both going into the frankenstein laboratory.
following a scene with frankenstein and fritz in the lab, there was the arrival of waldman and victor.
according to florey, the test lasted up to and including the initial awakening of the monster.
the actors involved were edward van sloan, dwight frye, lugosi - all of whom from the film dracula - and two stock players.
from all indications, lugosi's test make-up and garb were reminiscent of paul wegener in the golem, the 1920 german film about a legendary figure of clay brought to life by rabbi loew in the 15th century.
according to forrest j ackerman's interview with edward van sloan - who later played the major role of doctor waldman in frankenstein -
lugosi arrived for the test with a head "about four times normal size, with a broad wig on it."
mary shelley's and webling and balderston's talking monster had been relieved of speech, but he did speak in universal's first sequel, the bride of frankenstein, for which balderston received co-adaptation credit.
the evolving script at the time presented the monster as totally unsympathetic, devoid of any pathos.
florey claimed the test make-up was virtually identical to the final make-up worn by karloff, but obviously laemmle didn't regard the karloff version as funny in any way.
karloff himself recalled that he had been told the lugosi make-up was "a horrid, hairy thing.
though not followed to the letter, the general structure of the first half of the webling/balderston play was at least in evidence in the evolving film script for frankenstein.
but the last part of the play was not used until universal made bride of frankenstein four years later.
but the monster kills frankenstein in the play after his creator decides at the last moment not to provide him with a mate.
then the monster stumbles into the electrical apparatus and dies as a result of a flash of lightning and the machine that brought him to life.
between the time the play premiered in preston, england, in 1927 and its london opening in 1930, there were considerable changes in the script.
in the early version, the monster leaps from a cliff and destroys himself.
frankenstein and his fiancée, whom the monster had wanted to possess, are then happily reunited.
there is no material regarding the plan to create a mate for the monster.
his previous film-directing credits were the dialogue scenes in howard hughes' aviation epic, hell's angels, and all of journey's end - the screen version of the exceptionally popular rc sherriff world war i play that whale had directed on the stage in london and then in new york.
all of the elaborate electrical apparatus, full of sound and fury, but signifying and actually doing nothing, was built by kenneth strickfaden, who began his film career as an electrician in 1921.
the first film to use some of his electrical pyrotechnics was the 1929 return of sherlock holmes.
the devices that, as a hobby, he had collected over the years and stored, came from discarded industrial parts, old aeroplanes, sections of automobiles, radio-broadcast transmitters and odds and ends of electrical equipment.
"the styling all depended upon what kind of junk i had at hand."
the apparatus was leased by the studio and ray lindsay operated it.
in 1981, the academy of motion picture arts and sciences sponsored a gala affair in strickfaden's honour.
above the ceiling-opening of the lab set electricians operated large lightning-arc machines, which gave off bright flashes of intermittent light and showers of sparks.
boris karloff recalled years later "the scene made me as uneasy as anyone, for while i lay half-naked and strapped to doctor frankenstein's table,
i could see directly above me the special-effects men brandishing the white-hot, scissors-like carbons that made the lightning."
"i consider the creation of the monster to be the high spot of the film, because if the audience did not believe the thing had been really made, they would not be bothered with what it was supposed to do afterward."
"by this time, the audience must at least believe something is going to happen."
"it might be disaster, but at least they will settle down to see the show."
the lines "in the name of god" and "now i know what it feels like to be god"
were deleted by some local and regional censor groups at the time.
and in 1937, the production code office required that the lines, among other aspects, definitely be eliminated for reissue approval.
throughout this film, scenes of incredible intensity and dramatic impact are relieved by relatively mild scenes.
here we are introduced to henry's father, baron frankenstein, portrayed by british stage actor frederick kerr, who had recently worked with director whale on waterloo bridge.
incidentally, the baron here refers to "an old ruined windmill" where his son is.
in early drafts of the script, frankenstein's laboratory was in an old ruined windmill.
this was changed to a watchtower, but somehow this reference in the script wasn't changed.
frederick kerr was on the stage almost continuously for 50 years in both england and america.
in 1930, he commenced his film career and appeared in raffles with ronald colman, among other films.
whale requested kerr for both waterloo bridge and frankenstein and said that "he is an asset to any picture."
the british actor arrived in america in 1907 after being on the london stage.
for a long time he was with the old vitagraph studio in new york city.
belmore appeared in a great range of parts over the years, in such films as the 1922 oliver twist, the 1924 sea hawk,
the king of kings, the count of monte cristo, cleopatra, mutiny on the bounty,
little lord fauntleroy and the adventures of robin hood in 1938.
his so-called horror pictures are the vampire bat, son of frankenstein,
dracula and frankenstein were both pushed through to production by junior laemmle's efforts.
he was enthusiastic about this tale of the macabre, but his father, carl senior, founder and president of universal, was apprehensive.
but we are gradually building up to the revealment of the creature, better known as "the monster", although so far he has done nothing to deserve that title.
remember, in 1931 no one had seen what the character had looked like, other than advertisements, posters.
his visage was hardly that of the icon we have known through the decades.
also, we weren't sure what he would do, how he would react, what would happen.
it is a telling counterpoint to his utterly believable theatrics in the creation scene.
here is the intelligent, enquiring and sensitive human side of the obsessed and passionate man of science.
although universal wanted leslie howard for the role of henry frankenstein,
whale insisted on colin clive, the british leading player of the stage and screen versions of journey's end, both directed by whale.
the monster's criminal brain became a thread in many universal follow-ups.
the first son of frankenstein wanted to provide the monster with a healthy brain.
and now, after much anticipation, surely one of the great theatrical entrances.
whale chose to direct this in an unusual, but very effective manner.
and the dramatic turn, followed by a series of progressively closer shots, which allow us to be startled, and yet able to observe in detail that face.
whale certainly was involved in the concept of the monster's look.
he made several sketches and consulted with make-up artist jack pierce, but pierce was the man who executed the work.
he and karloff worked for several hours each evening over a three-week period to evolve the make-up prior to the start of production.
a top layer of blue-green greasepaint gave the skin a grey look on black-and-white film.
karloff, according to some accounts, suggested his eyelids be heavily caked, giving the creature a look of only partial awareness.
to add to the bulk, he wore a built-up and padded double-quilted suit and raised heavy boots.
these were weighted in such a way as to enable him to lean considerably forward.
the overall look of the monster in all of the subsequent universal sequels was never as effective as it was in the original production - at least, in my opinion.
karloff's test convinced whale and universal executives that he was perfect for the part.
"the dwarf drops on the floor on all fours, fumbles in his pocket, takes out a dirty package of cigarettes, strikes a match and lights a cigarette."
"the moment the monster sees the fire, it lets out an unearthly shriek."
"just at this moment, frankenstein's last match flares up, then dies out."
obviously, changing the matches to a torch made much more dramatic sense and was a precursor for things to come.
fritz is played by kansas-born dwight frye - neither a dwarf nor a hunchback, but another victim of typecasting after his role in the 1931 dracula as the crazed renfield.
after frankenstein, he was the village lunatic in the vampire bat, and so on.
but, before coming to hollywood in 1930, he had an impressive career on the stage.
after touring in stock, vaudeville and musical comedy, he then had leading roles in a variety of broadway plays, and in 1929 the critics voted him one of the ten best actors of the legitimate stage.
he treats the creature cruelly, and in balderston's adaptations makes considerable use of a whip and a hot iron.
he also finds satisfaction in having the monster perform tricks like a puppy, literally commanding him to "lie down, roll over", and he refers to him as a slave.
this cruelty is transferred in the final screen version to the character of fritz, who continually provokes frankenstein's creation with whip and torch, thereby making frankenstein more sympathetic.
incidentally, many people refer to the monster by the name of frankenstein.
in fact, in peggy webling's 1927 play, the revised 1930 presentation, and balderston's version of the play, the monster is called frankenstein after its creator, on many occasions by some of the characters.
whale was quoted, when asked why he decided to do frankenstein:
"of 30 available stories, it was the strongest meat, and gave me a chance to dabble in the macabre."
"i thought it would be amusing to try and make a physical impossibility seem believable."
"also it offered fine pictorial chances, had two grand characterisations, and had a subject matter that might go anywhere - and that's part of the fun of making pictures."
among the changes made in the script by the new writer, francis edwards faragoh, was giving dialogue to fritz, frankenstein's assistant, who in the previous universal scripts had been a mute.
most importantly, both frankenstein and the monster were modified into basically more sympathetic characters, given more dimension.
certainly now we feel sorry for the monster, as in the novel and the webling play.
in the novel frankenstein is a student of science, not a doctor, not the son of a baron.
the scene in which the monster is given life takes place in the upstairs room of frankenstein's house, not, as in this film, an old watchtower.
frankenstein's study, in an old house at goldstadt in switzerland, has been fashioned into a laboratory, and there's a storm during the creation scene.
in the early versions of the screenplay an abandoned windmill is used for the lab and a storm is raging.
a description of the setting in a preliminary script draft in the studio files mentions "something suggestive of the laboratory in metropolis."
the 1926 german silent film had a mad scientist involved in a laboratory creation scene amidst considerable electrical paraphernalia.
in mary shelley's book, the description of the procedures by which frankenstein gave his creation life is vague.
indeed, this major sequence of the creation, a high point in this film, is presented in one not-very-detailed paragraph in the book:
"i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation, but now, now that i had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart."
the monster has been described as a projection of mary shelley's feeling of isolation and hatred, which stem from the death of her mother when she was only ten days old.
in a letter sent to colin clive before production, director james whale described how he perceived the character of frankenstein:
"an intensely sane person, at times rather fanatical, and in one or two scenes, a little hysterical."
james whale did not have an actor in mind to play the monster.
whale's companion, david lewis, had been impressed with boris karloff's performance as the rather ungainly and odd convict in the stage and screen versions of the criminal code.
he recommended that whale meet the actor to see for himself the potential.
whale and karloff arranged a meeting and whale decided to test him for the role.
whale said later on that he was fascinated by karloff's face:
"his physique was weaker than i could wish, but that queer, penetrating personality, i felt, was more important than his shape, which could easily be altered."
although karloff had been in american films since 1919, he was hardly a well-known performer.
most of his parts in silent films were small or not particularly significant, but just before frankenstein things were looking somewhat better, with showy parts in the criminal code and five star final.
by 1919, he was in hollywood playing extra and bit parts in films.
he also alternated as a truck driver until the mid-'20s to support himself.
colin clive gets an opportunity to shift gears now that he is away from graveyards and old watchtowers.
clive was from a military family, a descendant of the famous clive of india.
he made his london bow in 1919 and toured in many plays, including repertory companies.
james whale hired him to play the doomed captain stanhope in the extremely successful world war i drama journey's end.
he starred in the play and film version, which was also directed by whale.
other film roles following frankenstein include one more river, from the last of the forsyte saga novels, also directed by whale,
clive of india, about his ancestor, mad love, based on the hands of orlac,
the man who broke the bank at monte carlo, and, of course, the bride of frankenstein in 1935, in which he reprised his role for director whale.
mae clarke said in 1971 "oh, how i remember that voice."
"jim whale would say about colin 'his voice is like a pipe organ."'
"'you just arrange him, pull out the stops and his voice comes out like music."'
but clive in his personal life was tormented and anguished, fraught with his private demons - a kind of jekyll and hyde.
prior to the 1931 frankenstein there were three silent-film productions of the story, the first going back to 1910.
the edison company's approximately 15-minute-long version, according to the script, was a liberal adaptation of mrs shelley's famous story.
one character was established by being shown reading the story from a book.
when frankenstein died after killing the monster, the book was closed and each of the characters revealed to be alive and well.
the third filming was done in italy in 1920 and called the monster of frankenstein.
no known negatives or prints survive of the silent productions, with the exception of the 1910 version.
but now the production moved to what was almost certainly lake sherwood in the santa monica mountains near westlake village and close to the dividing line between los angeles county and ventura county.
lake sherwood and its immediate neighbour, sherwood forest, had been used for many years as a choice location for all kinds of outdoor pictures.
the name, according to various sources, derived from its use in douglas fairbanks's 1922 production of robin hood, and it was ideal for jungle epics, westerns, you name it.
seven-year-old marilyn harris was chosen to befriend the monster in this delicate portrayal.
"whale and i both saw the character of the monster as an innocent one."
"this was a pathetic creature who, like us all, had neither wish nor say in his creation, and certainly did not wish upon itself the hideous image which automatically terrified humans whom it tried to befriend."
in the peggy webling play the monster accidentally crushes a dove in his hands and throws it into the lake, where, much to his delight, it floats.
then he takes frankenstein's crippled sister, a character not in the novel or film, out in a boat and tries to make her float like the dove - but she drowns.
his remorse at this act is one of the motivations that leads to his flinging himself off the cliff in the 1927 play version.
the monster, as portrayed by hamilton deane in this play, was sympathetic.
boris karloff threw me in again and i went underwater out of camera range."
touched and excited with his first encounter with beauty, the monster tries to float the little girl and feels intense pain and confusion when she sinks.
later the scene was considerably cut and modified from what you see now, but more about that anon.
this european village was built on the back lot at universal for all quiet on the western front in 1930.
and, being somewhere in europe, they all speak with a british or american accent.
in another exchange between universal executive henry henigson and screenwriter garrett fort during the script-development stage,
henigson wrote "i think everyone in the production should speak perfect english and we should take away the jas, the herrs, the fräuleins and twists in the language's construction which give it a teutonic distinction."
"we're not trying to place the picture geographically in any particular spot, and i think that we can attend to this by taking the teutonic element out of it."
garrett fort replied "in a story laid in and around goldstadt, with names like frankenstein, waldman, moritz, fritz, etc, it seems that a teutonic element is inescapable."
"if we lay it elsewhere it will be necessary to change every name in the cast, probably even that of frankenstein, which certainly has teutonic connotations."
"this might lead to titles such as 'the monster', 'garibaldi', or 'love and murder in norway', etc."
"i have an idea that there is nothing offensive about the teutonic slant."
this time elizabeth's premonition of danger and death is about to become a reality.
in the novel, frankenstein reluctantly agrees to create a female for the monster, but he changes his mind and the outraged monster tells frankenstein
in edison's 1910 film version, the monster returns on frankenstein's wedding night and, hearing his bride scream, frankenstein interrupts the attack and the monster flees.
in peggy webling's 1927 british play, the monster falls in love with frankenstein's fiancée.
this production, as we know, was never presented on the stage.
the staging of this scene resembles a similar scene in the 1919 film the cabinet of dr caligari, whereby the character portrayed by conrad veidt has been sent to kill a lovely girl in her bedroom.
the suspense here is well orchestrated and both players do not go over the top in the realisation of the scene.
although mae clarke remembers tea breaks each mid-afternoon during filming, she never had an opportunity to get to know karloff very well.
"he would arrive at 4am and spend four hours in make-up."
"he didn't have lunch with us because it was easier for him, due to the make-up, to eat alone in his dressing-room bungalow, where he could remove some of his body padding."
"then a couple of hours would be spent removing his make-up at the day's end, and he would require a rubdown after stomping around all day with those weights on his shoes."
the woodcutter is carrying his drowned daughter to the burgomaster's office.
the scripts had maria being carried by her mother, who was also established earlier at their cottage.
this particularly long tracking shot - actually two tracking shots - apparently was difficult for both players.
michael mark, playing the father, appeared later in son of frankenstein,
the ghost of frankenstein and the house of frankenstein, with different roles in each.
going back to the drowning at the lake, this scene was cut entirely or in part by many local state and city censors and in foreign countries before the film's initial release.
but when the studio applied to the production code administration for a reissue seal of approval in 1937, various cuts were demanded.
this scene was modified in a manner that paradoxically compounded the problem.
the action played as photographed up to the point where the monster had thrown his last daisy into the water.
he watched it, then looked at his empty hands and held them out toward the child.
the rest of the scene was deleted, and it stayed deleted for decades until universal's restoration.
incidentally, has anyone noticed the disappearance of the old baron, henry's father?
he wasn't around before, during and after the monster was loose in the household, and he's not around now.
obviously, it is clearly understood that neither victor nor elizabeth are joining the hunting party.
there seems to be no question about the durability of the frankenstein theme, with its innumerable interpretations.
the cosmic theme of the limits of man and the power of god, which extends to man emulating god.
the disturbing idea that science could create life, possibly even eternal life.
the fascination with dolls, mechanical puppets and robots that effectively simulate life.
the faustian concept of the overreacher, who momentarily commands divine power, only to be destroyed because of it.
the theme of the divided self, in this instance creator and creature, that is part of the human psyche and derives from ancient legend.
the dumb innocent, craving love and understanding, but forced to become violent and exercise hatred because of the lack of compassion and the fear of others.
frustration and overwhelming rejection were the cause of the monster's brutality.
frankenstein, then, is a mixture of fascination and horror, dream and nightmare.
mary shelley succeeded in creating a tale that would, she said,
"speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror."
the enraged, driven villagers, frequently carrying torches, became a staple in universal's cavalcade of frankenstein films.
in bride of frankenstein, villagers seek the monster with lanterns and weapons.
in frankenstein meets the wolf man, the townspeople are in pursuit with guns and howling dogs.
in house of frankenstein, there is a band of torch-bearing villagers.
in house of dracula, the mob chases the murderer through the town, up the hills and through the cemetery.
the exterior chase scenes were shot on portions of the universal back lot, including pollard lake, and around the nearby hills.
lifted footage of the search party from frankenstein was later inserted in the bride of frankenstein, the mummy's tomb and house of dracula.
if frankenstein had been made just a year or two later, at this point we would be listening to rousing music underscoring.
we're no longer on the back lot, but on one of universal's sound stages with plaster rocks and a cyclorama in the background representing an ominous sky.
a cyclorama, incidentally, that had some problems, as you will soon notice.
incidentally, director james whale described this chase as "the pagan sport of a mountain manhunt".
note that the wounded man is character actor francis ford, who earlier had been a universal writer, director and leading player.
whale was in a prisoner-of-war camp in germany, where he directed and acted in plays for his fellow prisoners.
later he abandoned his job as a cartoonist for a london newspaper to become a full-time theatre person - actor, director, set and costume designer and stage manager.
according to whale biographer james curtis, the genesis of the look and interpretation of karloff in frankenstein goes back to whale's highly praised performance as the demented son of charles laughton in the london stage production of a man with red hair in 1928.
following frankenstein, karloff worked with whale again in the old dark house and the bride of frankenstein.
karloff continued to make films, work in television and appear in popular plays, such as arsenic and old lace in 1941, and peter pan, as captain hook, in 1950.
near the end of his life, boris karloff continued to work with half a lung, crippling arthritis and a bad heart.
karloff was always grateful for the monster characters that built his career.
he once said of frankenstein's monster "god bless the old boy."
a few years later he retired from films and started painting in his pacific palisades home.
in 1957, his maid discovered whale's fully dressed body in the pool out in the back.
there was an ugly gash on whale's forehead, and many suspected foul play, but ultimately it was revealed that whale committed suicide.
it wasn't easy for karloff in take after take to carry clive to the windmill and then up to the second level with all that heavy paraphernalia that he had on.
and certainly his physical conflicts were difficult for the same reason.
the exteriors of the windmill, built on the back lot at universal, were a combination of a full-scale lower structure of 12ft and an upper miniature.
the williams travelling matte process was used to effect overlapping elements.
the original plan was to have the monster seek the mill, the only refuge it knew from the time its life began.
frankenstein had been laid out to film in continuity for the most part, starting on august 24th.
the schedule ran over by five days and shooting was completed on october 3rd.
it made the new york times ten-best list for the year.
exploitation gimmicks that go back to grand guignol presentations in the 1920s and perhaps earlier were resurrected - ambulances stationed at the front of theatres, nurses on duty in the lobby, free nerve tonic, and so on.
"if the psychologists can be believed, at the familiar psychological moment".
"people like the tragic best at those times when their own spirits are depressed, and the economists tell us that even more than their spirits are at a low ebb."
the reference to the economists was referring to 1931-32 being the worst years of the great depression.
in 1937, when universal submitted frankenstein to the considerably tougher production code administration for reissue approval, a number of deletions were ordered.
"eliminate scene in which the creature throws the child into the water."
the ending of the film was changed at the last moment before its opening dates.
up to this time it was intended that both frankenstein and his creation would die at the conclusion of the film, as in the webling/balderston play.
reaction at the previews caused universal executives to decide on a new ending, which necessitated the filming of a short epilogue depicting henry frankenstein recovering from his injuries and reunited with elizabeth, while his father, the baron, and the maids drink a toast
colin clive was on his way to europe, so another actor was used instead.
and mae clarke could have been substituted, based upon the staging of the single shot.
frederick kerr, as the baron, reappeared from his prolonged absence from the footage.
the prologue with edward van sloan was also a late addition.
observe, ladies and gentlemen, the scarcity of convolutions on the frontal lobe as compared to that of the normal brain, and the distinct degeneration of the middle frontal lobe.
all of these degenerate characteristics check amazingly with the history of the dead man before us, whose life was one of brutality, of violence and murder.

mr. carl laemmle feels it would be a little unkind to present this picture without just a word of friendly warning.

this was an added scene, photographed long after the film completed production, in anticipation of objections from religious groups over the theme of divine presumption.
staff universal screenwriter at the time, john huston, wrote earlier drafts that included lines such as "frightful, supremely frightful, would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the creator."
scenario editor richard schayer wrote another version, which includes material used in the speech now being given:
"here we unfold the portentous record of frankenstein, man of science, who sought to create a man in his own image, not reckoning upon god."
the music is an original composition written for the picture by film composer bernhard kaun.
other than the end-title music, it is the only scoring used in the picture.
this was reminiscent of the very first stage production of frankenstein in 1823.
the character of the monster was billed only with a question mark at that time.
originally, this opening sequence began with a distant shot in profile of the funeral procession going up the hill.
this was dropped during editing, but appeared briefly during the flashback sequence in the bride of frankenstein.
the panning shot of mourners ends by a statue... and the statue is of the grim reaper.
here we are introduced to henry frankenstein, played by colin clive, and his assistant, played by dwight frye.
this sequence does not derive from the novel, nor does it derive from any of the play adaptations that followed.
but the novel that spawned the frankenstein phenomenon was radically different in many ways from the countless dramatisations that followed on stage and screen.
mary wollstonecraft godwin was staying there with her lover, later her husband, the poet shelley.
together with their neighbour lord byron, his physician, doctor polidori, and mary's stepsister claire, they would often gather on chilly, wet evenings and read ghost stories aloud.
one evening byron suggested they each try their hand at writing a story, a story of the supernatural.
on another night, mary heard an intense conversation between shelley and byron concerning the nature of the principle of life, and whether it might ever be discovered and communicated.
"i did not sleep, nor could i be said to think."
"i saw - with shut eyes, but acute mental vision -
i saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together."
and here's frankenstein literally throwing dirt on the face of death.
in 1831, mary shelley revised her novel for a new edition.
she also added an introduction, which tells the story of its origin and ends with mary bidding her "hideous progeny go forth and prosper."
the adaptability of the story to the theatre was recognised immediately.
in 1823, there were at least five stage versions, both serious and comic.
one, presumption; or, the fate of frankenstein by richard peake, was to serve as a basic transcription of the novel for the stage and a source for further elaboration.
action and melodrama were the keynotes of peake's play, and frankenstein the creator and his creature were presented as instant antagonists.
there is a major creation sequence - not in the novel - an assistant to frankenstein named fritz - not in the novel - and a non-talking monster.
in the book, frankenstein's creature eventually becomes absolutely verbose, with an impressive vocabulary and masterful syntax.
his monologues run on for pages and, on occasion, entire chapters.
here at the medical college we are going to meet again actor edward van sloan, this time in character as doctor waldman - a variation on his van helsing role in universal's dracula with bela lugosi that was released earlier in 1931.
van sloan also played van helsing in the new york stage production of dracula, with lugosi, in 1927.
later he played van helsing again in universal's 1936 sequel dracula's daughter, and a similar role, professor muller, in the mummy in 1932.
van sloan began his professional acting career on the stage in 1910.
he worked with stock companies in montreal, canada, and in boston, newark and cleveland, finally reaching the new york stage in 1923.
the death kiss, death takes a holiday, the black room, the phantom creeps,
before i hang, the monster and the girl, and so on and so on.
the character of fritz, played by dwight frye, was not in the novel, but was introduced in the 1823 richard peake stage dramatisation.
in early drafts of the film scripts the character was mute, but it made sense to give him speech so that frankenstein could have dialogue rather than talking to himself or resorting to pantomime during the rather nefarious preparatory work for the experiments.
the about-to-be-dropped-and-shattered "normal brain", followed by fritz taking the "criminal brain", was a later addition to the script by francis edwards faragoh.
this element had never been used before in novel or plays, and indeed took away from the basic innocence of the monster.
a rather unusual way to introduce a new sequence and new characters.
the room in elizabeth's home is a set left over from universal's the cat and the canary from 1927.
leading man john boles was given the thankless part of henry's friend and elizabeth's friend - although he would like to be much more than friend to elizabeth.
boles acted and sang on broadway, then came to hollywood and starred in several musicals, such as the desert song, rio rita and king of jazz, revealing a rich baritone voice.
later he became a leading man in screen soap operas, such as the 1932 back street, only yesterday, and the 1937 stella dallas.
and he was a father or father figure to shirley temple in the littlest rebel and curly top.
here it is planted that victor has strong romantic feelings toward elizabeth, but, being a gentleman, he doesn't overplay his hand, and for the most part stays in control with regard to his feelings.
henry henigson, a universal executive, early in the preparation of frankenstein complained to screenwriter garrett fort that the implied frustrated love affair between elizabeth and victor was "insufficient" as relief from the horror plot.
fort responded "the girl is not deeply in love with henry and does love victor."
"her wedding to henry is the result of a childhood arrangement between families, quite in keeping with the continental conception of such matters."
"the girl, in her scenes with henry, will receive all the sympathy because we realise she is making the best of a bad bargain, but doing it like a thoroughbred."
mae clarke, director james whale's leading lady in the recently completed waterloo bridge, whom he liked, was a natural choice for frankenstein's fiancée.
she had been in film since 1929, and before that was a dancer, actress, singer, appearing primarily in nightclubs, broadway musicals, vaudeville.
in 1974, author anita loos revealed that clarke was the inspiration for her lorelei lee in gentlemen prefer blondes in 1926.
mae had a stand-out and showy role as molly the prostitute in the 1931 version of the front page.
but her starring role in waterloo bridge, in which she played a woman forced to turn to prostitution by her circumstances, was clarke's favourite part - and she is excellent in it, delivering a performance of extraordinary delicacy.
"i asked for mae clarke for elizabeth because of her intelligence, fervour and sincere belief that frankenstein would claim the public interest."
the only other actress of record considered for the part was bette davis, under contract to universal for six months.
but apparently producer carl laemmle jr did not think too highly of her sex appeal.
after frankenstein, james whale immediately cast mae in the leading role in the lmpatient maiden.
back in 1927, english theatrical producer and actor hamilton deane decided to try out another subject for his company, to alternate with his version of bram stoker's novel dracula, on his tour of the english provinces.
this was to be a new adaptation of frankenstein by peggy webling.
the initial presentation of this frankenstein took place late in 1927 in preston, england.
it continued to alternate in the provinces with dracula, and it finally opened in london, considerably revised, in february 1930.
peggy webling retained some basic ideas from the novel and the previous plays, but she made substantial changes in time, locale, incidents and characters.
mary shelley's narrative took place over a considerable period of time.
in the novel, frankenstein vows to destroy his creation and pursues him to the arctic, where the scientist dies and his foe goes off into the ice and mist, presumably to his death.
shortly after the play opened in london, the london times announced that it would be produced on broadway.
as with deane's dracula, playwright and newspaper correspondent john l balderston - who had recently written the hit play berkeley square - was engaged to revise and brush up the material for american consumption.
he kept, for the most part, peggy webling's modifications and structure, but he added several touches of his own.
for example, fritz, the hunchback who assists frankenstein in his experiments, was added - although he is mute in balderston's version.
with the release of dracula in early 1931, universal pictures had a major success.
the film dracula was based more on the hamilton deane play than on the novel.
this stage version had been exceptionally well received in england and in america.
in may 1931, the screen rights for the play were purchased for $20,000,
at universal's stipulation, the play wasn't produced in america - never has been - contrary to the original plan.
rex ingram's 1926 film the magician has various aspects that were later used in frankenstein.
the dwarf assistant in the magician hobbled down a staircase similar to the one in this film when he was going to open the tower door.
also, there is a comic porter scene from shakespeare's macbeth, and that's often been cited as an influence.
in a letter, florey said that he and schayer "worked with garrett fort" - who wrote universal's dracula -
according to florey, the edited test ran for 20 minutes, which seems extremely long.
it was photographed by paul ivano, and it started with a short conversation between victor moritz and waldman, leading to both going into the frankenstein laboratory.
following a scene with frankenstein and fritz in the lab, there was the arrival of waldman and victor.
according to florey, the test lasted up to and including the initial awakening of the monster.
the actors involved were edward van sloan, dwight frye, lugosi - all of whom from the film dracula - and two stock players.
from all indications, lugosi's test make-up and garb were reminiscent of paul wegener in the golem, the 1920 german film about a legendary figure of clay brought to life by rabbi loew in the 15th century.
according to forrest j ackerman's interview with edward van sloan - who later played the major role of doctor waldman in frankenstein -
lugosi arrived for the test with a head "about four times normal size, with a broad wig on it."
mary shelley's and webling and balderston's talking monster had been relieved of speech, but he did speak in universal's first sequel, the bride of frankenstein, for which balderston received co-adaptation credit.
the evolving script at the time presented the monster as totally unsympathetic, devoid of any pathos.
florey claimed the test make-up was virtually identical to the final make-up worn by karloff, but obviously laemmle didn't regard the karloff version as funny in any way.
karloff himself recalled that he had been told the lugosi make-up was "a horrid, hairy thing.
though not followed to the letter, the general structure of the first half of the webling/balderston play was at least in evidence in the evolving film script for frankenstein.
but the last part of the play was not used until universal made bride of frankenstein four years later.
but the monster kills frankenstein in the play after his creator decides at the last moment not to provide him with a mate.
then the monster stumbles into the electrical apparatus and dies as a result of a flash of lightning and the machine that brought him to life.
between the time the play premiered in preston, england, in 1927 and its london opening in 1930, there were considerable changes in the script.
in the early version, the monster leaps from a cliff and destroys himself.
frankenstein and his fiancée, whom the monster had wanted to possess, are then happily reunited.
there is no material regarding the plan to create a mate for the monster.
his previous film-directing credits were the dialogue scenes in howard hughes' aviation epic, hell's angels, and all of journey's end - the screen version of the exceptionally popular rc sherriff world war i play that whale had directed on the stage in london and then in new york.
all of the elaborate electrical apparatus, full of sound and fury, but signifying and actually doing nothing, was built by kenneth strickfaden, who began his film career as an electrician in 1921.
the first film to use some of his electrical pyrotechnics was the 1929 return of sherlock holmes.
the devices that, as a hobby, he had collected over the years and stored, came from discarded industrial parts, old aeroplanes, sections of automobiles, radio-broadcast transmitters and odds and ends of electrical equipment.
"the styling all depended upon what kind of junk i had at hand."
the apparatus was leased by the studio and ray lindsay operated it.
in 1981, the academy of motion picture arts and sciences sponsored a gala affair in strickfaden's honour.
above the ceiling-opening of the lab set electricians operated large lightning-arc machines, which gave off bright flashes of intermittent light and showers of sparks.
boris karloff recalled years later "the scene made me as uneasy as anyone, for while i lay half-naked and strapped to doctor frankenstein's table,
i could see directly above me the special-effects men brandishing the white-hot, scissors-like carbons that made the lightning."
"i consider the creation of the monster to be the high spot of the film, because if the audience did not believe the thing had been really made, they would not be bothered with what it was supposed to do afterward."
"by this time, the audience must at least believe something is going to happen."
"it might be disaster, but at least they will settle down to see the show."
the lines "in the name of god" and "now i know what it feels like to be god"
were deleted by some local and regional censor groups at the time.
and in 1937, the production code office required that the lines, among other aspects, definitely be eliminated for reissue approval.
throughout this film, scenes of incredible intensity and dramatic impact are relieved by relatively mild scenes.
here we are introduced to henry's father, baron frankenstein, portrayed by british stage actor frederick kerr, who had recently worked with director whale on waterloo bridge.
incidentally, the baron here refers to "an old ruined windmill" where his son is.
in early drafts of the script, frankenstein's laboratory was in an old ruined windmill.
this was changed to a watchtower, but somehow this reference in the script wasn't changed.
frederick kerr was on the stage almost continuously for 50 years in both england and america.
in 1930, he commenced his film career and appeared in raffles with ronald colman, among other films.
whale requested kerr for both waterloo bridge and frankenstein and said that "he is an asset to any picture."
the british actor arrived in america in 1907 after being on the london stage.
for a long time he was with the old vitagraph studio in new york city.
belmore appeared in a great range of parts over the years, in such films as the 1922 oliver twist, the 1924 sea hawk,
the king of kings, the count of monte cristo, cleopatra, mutiny on the bounty,
little lord fauntleroy and the adventures of robin hood in 1938.
his so-called horror pictures are the vampire bat, son of frankenstein,
dracula and frankenstein were both pushed through to production by junior laemmle's efforts.
he was enthusiastic about this tale of the macabre, but his father, carl senior, founder and president of universal, was apprehensive.
but we are gradually building up to the revealment of the creature, better known as "the monster", although so far he has done nothing to deserve that title.
remember, in 1931 no one had seen what the character had looked like, other than advertisements, posters.
his visage was hardly that of the icon we have known through the decades.
also, we weren't sure what he would do, how he would react, what would happen.
it is a telling counterpoint to his utterly believable theatrics in the creation scene.
here is the intelligent, enquiring and sensitive human side of the obsessed and passionate man of science.
although universal wanted leslie howard for the role of henry frankenstein,
whale insisted on colin clive, the british leading player of the stage and screen versions of journey's end, both directed by whale.
the monster's criminal brain became a thread in many universal follow-ups.
the first son of frankenstein wanted to provide the monster with a healthy brain.
and now, after much anticipation, surely one of the great theatrical entrances.
whale chose to direct this in an unusual, but very effective manner.
and the dramatic turn, followed by a series of progressively closer shots, which allow us to be startled, and yet able to observe in detail that face.
whale certainly was involved in the concept of the monster's look.
he made several sketches and consulted with make-up artist jack pierce, but pierce was the man who executed the work.
he and karloff worked for several hours each evening over a three-week period to evolve the make-up prior to the start of production.
a top layer of blue-green greasepaint gave the skin a grey look on black-and-white film.
karloff, according to some accounts, suggested his eyelids be heavily caked, giving the creature a look of only partial awareness.
to add to the bulk, he wore a built-up and padded double-quilted suit and raised heavy boots.
these were weighted in such a way as to enable him to lean considerably forward.
the overall look of the monster in all of the subsequent universal sequels was never as effective as it was in the original production - at least, in my opinion.
karloff's test convinced whale and universal executives that he was perfect for the part.
"the dwarf drops on the floor on all fours, fumbles in his pocket, takes out a dirty package of cigarettes, strikes a match and lights a cigarette."
"the moment the monster sees the fire, it lets out an unearthly shriek."
"just at this moment, frankenstein's last match flares up, then dies out."
obviously, changing the matches to a torch made much more dramatic sense and was a precursor for things to come.
fritz is played by kansas-born dwight frye - neither a dwarf nor a hunchback, but another victim of typecasting after his role in the 1931 dracula as the crazed renfield.
after frankenstein, he was the village lunatic in the vampire bat, and so on.
but, before coming to hollywood in 1930, he had an impressive career on the stage.
after touring in stock, vaudeville and musical comedy, he then had leading roles in a variety of broadway plays, and in 1929 the critics voted him one of the ten best actors of the legitimate stage.
he treats the creature cruelly, and in balderston's adaptations makes considerable use of a whip and a hot iron.
he also finds satisfaction in having the monster perform tricks like a puppy, literally commanding him to "lie down, roll over", and he refers to him as a slave.
this cruelty is transferred in the final screen version to the character of fritz, who continually provokes frankenstein's creation with whip and torch, thereby making frankenstein more sympathetic.
incidentally, many people refer to the monster by the name of frankenstein.
in fact, in peggy webling's 1927 play, the revised 1930 presentation, and balderston's version of the play, the monster is called frankenstein after its creator, on many occasions by some of the characters.
whale was quoted, when asked why he decided to do frankenstein:
"of 30 available stories, it was the strongest meat, and gave me a chance to dabble in the macabre."
"i thought it would be amusing to try and make a physical impossibility seem believable."
"also it offered fine pictorial chances, had two grand characterisations, and had a subject matter that might go anywhere - and that's part of the fun of making pictures."
among the changes made in the script by the new writer, francis edwards faragoh, was giving dialogue to fritz, frankenstein's assistant, who in the previous universal scripts had been a mute.
most importantly, both frankenstein and the monster were modified into basically more sympathetic characters, given more dimension.
certainly now we feel sorry for the monster, as in the novel and the webling play.
in the novel frankenstein is a student of science, not a doctor, not the son of a baron.
the scene in which the monster is given life takes place in the upstairs room of frankenstein's house, not, as in this film, an old watchtower.
frankenstein's study, in an old house at goldstadt in switzerland, has been fashioned into a laboratory, and there's a storm during the creation scene.
in the early versions of the screenplay an abandoned windmill is used for the lab and a storm is raging.
a description of the setting in a preliminary script draft in the studio files mentions "something suggestive of the laboratory in metropolis."
the 1926 german silent film had a mad scientist involved in a laboratory creation scene amidst considerable electrical paraphernalia.
in mary shelley's book, the description of the procedures by which frankenstein gave his creation life is vague.
indeed, this major sequence of the creation, a high point in this film, is presented in one not-very-detailed paragraph in the book:
"i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation, but now, now that i had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart."
the monster has been described as a projection of mary shelley's feeling of isolation and hatred, which stem from the death of her mother when she was only ten days old.
in a letter sent to colin clive before production, director james whale described how he perceived the character of frankenstein:
"an intensely sane person, at times rather fanatical, and in one or two scenes, a little hysterical."
james whale did not have an actor in mind to play the monster.
whale's companion, david lewis, had been impressed with boris karloff's performance as the rather ungainly and odd convict in the stage and screen versions of the criminal code.
he recommended that whale meet the actor to see for himself the potential.
whale and karloff arranged a meeting and whale decided to test him for the role.
whale said later on that he was fascinated by karloff's face:
"his physique was weaker than i could wish, but that queer, penetrating personality, i felt, was more important than his shape, which could easily be altered."
although karloff had been in american films since 1919, he was hardly a well-known performer.
most of his parts in silent films were small or not particularly significant, but just before frankenstein things were looking somewhat better, with showy parts in the criminal code and five star final.
by 1919, he was in hollywood playing extra and bit parts in films.
he also alternated as a truck driver until the mid-'20s to support himself.
colin clive gets an opportunity to shift gears now that he is away from graveyards and old watchtowers.
clive was from a military family, a descendant of the famous clive of india.
he made his london bow in 1919 and toured in many plays, including repertory companies.
james whale hired him to play the doomed captain stanhope in the extremely successful world war i drama journey's end.
he starred in the play and film version, which was also directed by whale.
other film roles following frankenstein include one more river, from the last of the forsyte saga novels, also directed by whale,
clive of india, about his ancestor, mad love, based on the hands of orlac,
the man who broke the bank at monte carlo, and, of course, the bride of frankenstein in 1935, in which he reprised his role for director whale.
mae clarke said in 1971 "oh, how i remember that voice."
"jim whale would say about colin 'his voice is like a pipe organ."'
"'you just arrange him, pull out the stops and his voice comes out like music."'
but clive in his personal life was tormented and anguished, fraught with his private demons - a kind of jekyll and hyde.
prior to the 1931 frankenstein there were three silent-film productions of the story, the first going back to 1910.
the edison company's approximately 15-minute-long version, according to the script, was a liberal adaptation of mrs shelley's famous story.
one character was established by being shown reading the story from a book.
when frankenstein died after killing the monster, the book was closed and each of the characters revealed to be alive and well.
the third filming was done in italy in 1920 and called the monster of frankenstein.
no known negatives or prints survive of the silent productions, with the exception of the 1910 version.
but now the production moved to what was almost certainly lake sherwood in the santa monica mountains near westlake village and close to the dividing line between los angeles county and ventura county.
lake sherwood and its immediate neighbour, sherwood forest, had been used for many years as a choice location for all kinds of outdoor pictures.
the name, according to various sources, derived from its use in douglas fairbanks's 1922 production of robin hood, and it was ideal for jungle epics, westerns, you name it.
seven-year-old marilyn harris was chosen to befriend the monster in this delicate portrayal.
"whale and i both saw the character of the monster as an innocent one."
"this was a pathetic creature who, like us all, had neither wish nor say in his creation, and certainly did not wish upon itself the hideous image which automatically terrified humans whom it tried to befriend."
in the peggy webling play the monster accidentally crushes a dove in his hands and throws it into the lake, where, much to his delight, it floats.
then he takes frankenstein's crippled sister, a character not in the novel or film, out in a boat and tries to make her float like the dove - but she drowns.
his remorse at this act is one of the motivations that leads to his flinging himself off the cliff in the 1927 play version.
the monster, as portrayed by hamilton deane in this play, was sympathetic.
boris karloff threw me in again and i went underwater out of camera range."
touched and excited with his first encounter with beauty, the monster tries to float the little girl and feels intense pain and confusion when she sinks.
later the scene was considerably cut and modified from what you see now, but more about that anon.
this european village was built on the back lot at universal for all quiet on the western front in 1930.
and, being somewhere in europe, they all speak with a british or american accent.
in another exchange between universal executive henry henigson and screenwriter garrett fort during the script-development stage,
henigson wrote "i think everyone in the production should speak perfect english and we should take away the jas, the herrs, the frauleins and twists in the language's construction which give it a teutonic distinction."
"we're not trying to place the picture geographically in any particular spot, and i think that we can attend to this by taking the teutonic element out of it."
garrett fort replied "in a story laid in and around goldstadt, with names like frankenstein, waldman, moritz, fritz, etc, it seems that a teutonic element is inescapable."
"if we lay it elsewhere it will be necessary to change every name in the cast, probably even that of frankenstein, which certainly has teutonic connotations."
"this might lead to titles such as 'the monster', 'garibaldi', or 'love and murder in norway', etc."
"i have an idea that there is nothing offensive about the teutonic slant."
this time elizabeth's premonition of danger and death is about to become a reality.
in the novel, frankenstein reluctantly agrees to create a female for the monster, but he changes his mind and the outraged monster tells frankenstein
in edison's 1910 film version, the monster returns on frankenstein's wedding night and, hearing his bride scream, frankenstein interrupts the attack and the monster flees.
in peggy webling's 1927 british play, the monster falls in love with frankenstein's fiancée.
this production, as we know, was never presented on the stage.
the staging of this scene resembles a similar scene in the 1919 film the cabinet of dr caligari, whereby the character portrayed by conrad veidt has been sent to kill a lovely girl in her bedroom.
the suspense here is well orchestrated and both players do not go over the top in the realisation of the scene.
although mae clarke remembers tea breaks each mid-afternoon during filming, she never had an opportunity to get to know karloff very well.
"he would arrive at 4am and spend four hours in make-up."
"he didn't have lunch with us because it was easier for him, due to the make-up, to eat alone in his dressing-room bungalow, where he could remove some of his body padding."
"then a couple of hours would be spent removing his make-up at the day's end, and he would require a rubdown after stomping around all day with those weights on his shoes."
the woodcutter is carrying his drowned daughter to the burgomaster's office.
the scripts had maria being carried by her mother, who was also established earlier at their cottage.
this particularly long tracking shot - actually two tracking shots - apparently was difficult for both players.
michael mark, playing the father, appeared later in son of frankenstein,
the ghost of frankenstein and the house of frankenstein, with different roles in each.
going back to the drowning at the lake, this scene was cut entirely or in part by many local state and city censors and in foreign countries before the film's initial release.
but when the studio applied to the production code administration for a reissue seal of approval in 1937, various cuts were demanded.
this scene was modified in a manner that paradoxically compounded the problem.
the action played as photographed up to the point where the monster had thrown his last daisy into the water.
he watched it, then looked at his empty hands and held them out toward the child.
the rest of the scene was deleted, and it stayed deleted for decades until universal's restoration.
incidentally, has anyone noticed the disappearance of the old baron, henry's father?
he wasn't around before, during and after the monster was loose in the household, and he's not around now.
obviously, it is clearly understood that neither victor nor elizabeth are joining the hunting party.
there seems to be no question about the durability of the frankenstein theme, with its innumerable interpretations.
the cosmic theme of the limits of man and the power of god, which extends to man emulating god.
the disturbing idea that science could create life, possibly even eternal life.
the fascination with dolls, mechanical puppets and robots that effectively simulate life.
the faustian concept of the overreacher, who momentarily commands divine power, only to be destroyed because of it.
the theme of the divided self, in this instance creator and creature, that is part of the human psyche and derives from ancient legend.
the dumb innocent, craving love and understanding, but forced to become violent and exercise hatred because of the lack of compassion and the fear of others.
frustration and overwhelming rejection were the cause of the monster's brutality.
frankenstein, then, is a mixture of fascination and horror, dream and nightmare.
mary shelley succeeded in creating a tale that would, she said,
"speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror."
the enraged, driven villagers, frequently carrying torches, became a staple in universal's cavalcade of frankenstein films.
in bride of frankenstein, villagers seek the monster with lanterns and weapons.
in frankenstein meets the wolf man, the townspeople are in pursuit with guns and howling dogs.
in house of frankenstein, there is a band of torch-bearing villagers.
in house of dracula, the mob chases the murderer through the town, up the hills and through the cemetery.
the exterior chase scenes were shot on portions of the universal back lot, including pollard lake, and around the nearby hills.
lifted footage of the search party from frankenstein was later inserted in the bride of frankenstein, the mummy's tomb and house of dracula.
if frankenstein had been made just a year or two later, at this point we would be listening to rousing music underscoring.
we're no longer on the back lot, but on one of universal's sound stages with plaster rocks and a cyclorama in the background representing an ominous sky.
a cyclorama, incidentally, that had some problems, as you will soon notice.
incidentally, director james whale described this chase as "the pagan sport of a mountain manhunt".
note that the wounded man is character actor francis ford, who earlier had been a universal writer, director and leading player.
whale was in a prisoner-of-war camp in germany, where he directed and acted in plays for his fellow prisoners.
later he abandoned his job as a cartoonist for a london newspaper to become a full-time theatre person - actor, director, set and costume designer and stage manager.
according to whale biographer james curtis, the genesis of the look and interpretation of karloff in frankenstein goes back to whale's highly praised performance as the demented son of charles laughton in the london stage production of a man with red hair in 1928.
following frankenstein, karloff worked with whale again in the old dark house and the bride of frankenstein.
karloff continued to make films, work in television and appear in popular plays, such as arsenic and old lace in 1941, and peter pan, as captain hook, in 1950.
near the end of his life, boris karloff continued to work with half a lung, crippling arthritis and a bad heart.
karloff was always grateful for the monster characters that built his career.
he once said of frankenstein's monster "god bless the old boy."
a few years later he retired from films and started painting in his pacific palisades home.
in 1957, his maid discovered whale's fully dressed body in the pool out in the back.
there was an ugly gash on whale's forehead, and many suspected foul play, but ultimately it was revealed that whale committed suicide.
it wasn't easy for karloff in take after take to carry clive to the windmill and then up to the second level with all that heavy paraphernalia that he had on.
and certainly his physical conflicts were difficult for the same reason.
the exteriors of the windmill, built on the back lot at universal, were a combination of a full-scale lower structure of 12ft and an upper miniature.
the williams travelling matte process was used to effect overlapping elements.
the original plan was to have the monster seek the mill, the only refuge it knew from the time its life began.
frankenstein had been laid out to film in continuity for the most part, starting on august 24th.
the schedule ran over by five days and shooting was completed on october 3rd.
it made the new york times ten-best list for the year.
exploitation gimmicks that go back to grand guignol presentations in the 1920s and perhaps earlier were resurrected - ambulances stationed at the front of theatres, nurses on duty in the lobby, free nerve tonic, and so on.
"if the psychologists can be believed, at the familiar psychological moment".
"people like the tragic best at those times when their own spirits are depressed, and the economists tell us that even more than their spirits are at a low ebb."
the reference to the economists was referring to 1931-32 being the worst years of the great depression.
in 1937, when universal submitted frankenstein to the considerably tougher production code administration for reissue approval, a number of deletions were ordered.
"eliminate scene in which the creature throws the child into the water."
the ending of the film was changed at the last moment before its opening dates.
up to this time it was intended that both frankenstein and his creation would die at the conclusion of the film, as in the webling/balderston play.
reaction at the previews caused universal executives to decide on a new ending, which necessitated the filming of a short epilogue depicting henry frankenstein recovering from his injuries and reunited with elizabeth, while his father, the baron, and the maids drink a toast
colin clive was on his way to europe, so another actor was used instead.
and mae clarke could have been substituted, based upon the staging of the single shot.
frederick kerr, as the baron, reappeared from his prolonged absence from the footage.
the prologue with edward van sloan was also a late addition.
well it ain't no secret that dad sanders is blind as a bat without his glasses.
and i figure that anyone who would cheat a lone widow wouldn't hesitate to break an old man's glasses if there was a rich mine at stake.
when i saw little sammy and those two tough sidekicks of his hot on my trail,
i figured his father had changed his mind about letting me keep it.
i've just had four weeks with grandma ashe and the rest of them.
they think you're the worst father to the most distressful daughter.
department number 6 of the superior court in the city of san francisco, the state of california is now in session.
if my client is guilty of murder, i want him punished.
but if he's not i want to keep from your kind hearts the awful responsibility of not doing the right and just thing about it.
now, this, my friends, your honor was found by the side of the murdered man.
that might be adam wright or allan warren or adolph weems or it might be ace wilfong.
but that is the case for the prosecution, ladies and gentlemen.
a few illegal dollars and a clean shirt, and you move across the railroad tracks.
tell your boy to bring me some libations, and don't insult your guests.
now, there's only one reason why you've lost all the others.
i haven't criticized or preached, and i wouldn't let anyone else do it either.

come on, we'll go away and rough it for six months forget all about this.
goodness knows, i want it just as much as you do.
the reason we're here, i love you better than anything in the world.
we've been lost up here for three months and i don't know north, south, east or west.
well, you've made a man of the old man, all right.
there ain't anyone in your tribe good enough to call me a mongrel.
you must have listened to him or you wouldn't have left me that way.
i thought i had the right to do anything i liked.
i didn't know till last night what i was really doing to myself.
i'm not gonna carry you screaming from the hotel, but you can't get away from me.
i never was as nuts about you as i am right now.
you have no alternative except to bring in a verdict on the facts.
and the most important fact is that the defendant confessed he killed ace wilfong for a gambling debt.
they want to wreck the dignity of procedure and turn this courtroom into a playground for mountebanks.
if your honor please, my worthy opponent has lost his temper.
i'm going to prove that this killing was done in a fit of temporary insanity.
the determination of the defendant when he came to his senses to say "gambling debt," "gambling debt" and nothing else is one of the finest things i have ever heard of, in life or fiction.
the attorney for the prosecution has, in a few vicious moments wiped out the feeling i've tried to give you that this crime might have been done without cold, deliberate premeditation.
but, my friends i'm not tearing my very heart out here before you nor the heart of this child that i love above all things in the world.
i'm not doing that without the valid hope that it's going to help you in doing justice.
there's not one atom of the brutal evidence that i brought out that the defendant didn't know.
you who have sons should pray that they might have the nobility and kindness of this young man.
and you who have daughters must believe with him that she was not to blame.

a few illegal dollars and a clean shirt, and you move across the railroad tracks.
now, there's only one reason why you've lost all the others.
i haven't criticized or preached, and i wouldn't let anyone else do it either.
you know i love you better than anything in the world, don't you?
but another year like this last for you, why, it'd be the end of everything.
i love you too much to stand by and see you make a wreck of yourself like this.
i love ace, too, but i'll make a bargain with you.
i'm never gonna hurt you like this ever again, dear, i promise.
we've just got the two of us, dear and we've gotta take care of each other, haven't we?
it's this bargain i resent, that cuts me off from all normal living.
the bargain i had to make to keep you from playing with rattlesnakes.

it makes me sick to even hear you say the word.
i've lost the right ever again to think of what love can be or what it means.
i never was as nuts about you as i am right now.
you can be walking along the street or out in your car, but i'll get you.

they hit me first, and i´m alone and they all ganged up on me.
when that happens it´s all right to let them have it.
children have no fear, so you never know when tragedy will strike.
don´t you think this is a good opportunity to insure your children?
if your highness will be good enough to look out of the window... there is the famous old tower of the stephen's church.
to the right we have the st. paul's dome... and directly across, we have with us tonight...
a special edition arranged for flausenthurm... with all the interesting things left out.
now, when you smiled at me, you also did something else.
but before talking to you, naturally, she took up the matter with her father, his majesty, the king.
his majesty, the king, decided that her highness, the princess, should not talk to you first.
on the contrary, you should first talk to her highness, the princess.
but before talking to the princess, his majesty, the king, wants you to talk to him... so that he can give you permission to talk to the princess.
"i extend to you and to your daughter, princess anna... my heartiest welcome".
"unfortunately, i shall be unable to meet you at the station... as i have to open a cattle show".
an officer on duty presenting arms before passing royalty... and smiling at the girl he loves.
no, there is no excuse from a military point of view.
his majesty, the king, decided that her highness, the princess, should not talk to you first.
on the contrary, you should first talk to her highness, the princess.
but before talking to the princess, his majesty, the king, wants you to talk to him... so that he can give you permission to talk to the princess.
but then we all got together and had a little talk, and we came to the conclusion... that under the royal flausenthurm etiquette... you, being an ordinary lieutenant, cannot do the talking at all.
now, can't i call you "dear" when i say good night?
well, you may call me "dear,' but you shouldn't say good night.

then one day there came a man, his cause he never pled
he came to my room, his hat threw on my bed
now see the power of the beggar king self-styled "the poorest man in london"
any prospective beggar in london must be licenced by jonathan jeremiah peachum co.
an army of flea-bitten beggars and cripples will parade before the queen
thousands of them outside tha cathedral with hardly grace the festive spectacle
don't try to be good, you'll find it much too tough
you yearn for happiness, try to grab it on the fly
but no matter how you choose you see it pass you by
in this life mankind assumes that it's on top of things
and you the élite of beggardom, shall add your lustre to the ceremony
you would long be dead in the sewers of turnbridge had my tireless efforts not shown how your misery could earn your livings
johnny was the worse for whisky, jimmy's tum was acting frisky
but answering the sergeant's cry off they march to do or die
shouldn't the poorest man in london and wealthy mackie join in a common cause?
the poorest man in london is bankrupt a poor devil like any other
precisely; and what i learned today was the power of poverty
with your money and my experience we can launch an enterprise bigger than anyone's wildest dreams
this morning my father was to have delivered his farewell sermon to you, but he has been ill, as you all know, and today he cannot be with you.
but he dictated his sermon to me, as he has done for so many years.
i have it here, and i'm going to read it to you.
"friends, i leave you today after a score of years in this church as a servant of the lord, to whom i pray that he may let words of my mouth and troubled meditations of my heart be acceptable in his sight.
i have baptized many of you in the lord's grace, a few of you i have joined together in marriage, and over the bodies of some of your loved ones,
i have spoken the beautiful, triumphant victory that comes with the lord's salvation.
i would dearly love to stay as your pastor for the rest of my years, for i had hoped to live and die at this pulpit.
but you have seen fit to call another, a younger man to guide and serve you.
and though i leave you, i do not leave the lord.
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
when the heart is thirsty, there is drink in the testaments:
he died in my arms five minutes ago, before he could finish his message to you, but i'm gonna finish it for him.
miss fallon, the news you bring is painful, but i hardly think it proper...
this isn't the house of god, this is a meeting place for hypocrites.
you're out of your head, and i, for one, will not listen to such...
i'm gonna take my text this morning from chapter 23 of the gospel of matthew.
and i say unto you as christ said to the scribes and pharisees,
and i don't mind telling you that i was thinking all the things you just said.
this trip looked like a double zero to me, but i've got a hunch that it won't be a blank after all.
oh, my dear ones, i can't see you, but i can feel you all around me.
thousands and thousands of you tuning in on station g-o-d, god, on a wavelength that carries his blessed words to the furthermost reaches of the universe.
the moment they're put to any sort of test, they cave in.
the difference between a man and a jellyfish is the fact that a man has backbone.
dearly beloved, all you meek of the earth, all you that labour and are heavy-laden,
i come here to lift the heavy loads from your hearts.
i stand here in a den which is a cage of fear, behind these bars which are the bars of doubt.
i stand here among beasts that tear and destroy, and behold, they cannot hurt me.
- as daniel said unto darius, my god has sent an angel, and has shut the lion's mouth.
and i say unto you, there is not a single soul among you these beasts can hurt, if you come into this cage with love and understanding in your heart.
o ye that see, have the faith of this blind boy.
he answered the call of his god to come up here among the beasts of prey, just as he answered the call of his country to go among the beasts of war in france.
i thank the lord that you are here, for i love every one of you, and particularly this blind boy, who shames us all with a shining example of faith.
and i would take you into my arms and whisper in your ear the sweet secret of salvation.
why, you couldn't limp yourself into a pair of roller skates.
a week ago you slipped up on your cue to walk into the lion's den.
and you're supposed to be a widow, bereaved of all her loved ones, alone in the world.
you told me you had ten years in stock and could knock them over.
and you pull it like you're reading out of a telephone book.
how do you expect to get the hang of the trade with your mush full of gum?
how do you expect the customers to believe it if you don't?
sister gets them all hot and bothered, reaching for the clouds.
"don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
do you know why we're sitting on top of the world right now?
say, there's a carnival in town, a lot of old pals of mine.
i'll get them together, and we'll have a lot of laughs.
and folks, when we leave this burg, we're gonna own everything but next year's wheat crop.
how many times have i told you to lay off talking business when sister's around.
may i take off your hat and look across the alley?
oh, but all kidding aside, i know i'm keeping you from going someplace.
but i happen to know sister's voice as well as her face.
so speak up, and i'll tell you if you're sister or not.
why don't you come and sit down here by the fire.
i want you to know i don't approve of their selling that clay thing.
the funny part is you didn't know you were doing it.
he was gonna jump right out that window, but you happened to be on the air at that moment.
two is a company, three is a crowd, i always say.
you mean to say that something i said over the radio actually stopped you from jumping out of the window?
and you taught me how to laugh almost after i'd forgotten how.
now, you keep out of the rain and don't you go hamlet anymore, will you?
i'm sick of doing the hard work and seeing you two get all the gravy.
twenty percent to me, and i have to kick back half of that to my chiselers.
i suppose there'll be a couple of dicks around to see us.
if they should happen to get to you when i'm not around,
still, i suppose there'll be a couple of cops snooping around.
it might be a good idea for us to call time-out.
and it won't be safe for anyone to try to horn in.
you made a squawk around here about your being a prisoner.
sure you are, and i'm going to keep you a prisoner, because i'm nuts about you.
i fell for you the first time i ever saw you.
i should be forever grateful to him because he taught me how to laugh.
i've never had a birthday party before, and i'll never forget this one, that's a promise.
well, when you can't see the world, you invent one of your own.
and, folks, mine's been a lovely world, since the guest of the evening came into it.
monte carlo, champagne, roulette, and your old pal hornsby around, just to keep it from being a cook's tour.
i'm not going to monte carlo with you, or anyplace else.
i always keep my word, even with the rats like welford.
and i'm tipping you now, if you don't do as i say, you'll have a lot of time to regret it.
the more i think of it, the more it looks to me like welford was knocked off.
only tonight, i found out that he was on his way to a newspaper office when it happened.
i'm going to the river jordan and maybe swim in it.
and then to wailing wall i've read so much about in jerusalem.
and one of these days, i'll be coming back like a bad penny.
forgive me for being so selfish... but last night i forgot the thousands of others who need you.
say, keep the people off this wire for a few minutes, will you?
go out there, brown, and keep the rest of the people from coming in.
during the past few months, many of you have come up here to confess your sins and tell how you were saved.
tonight, i'm gonna tell you how i sinned and how i was saved.
when i named you gunboat, i must've been thinking of the swiss navy.
six months i've been feeding you, and you haven't won a fight for me yet.
when you get in the ring, all you do is throw a lot of rights.
where do you suppose dempsey would be without his left hook?
but he dictated his sermon to me, as he has done for so many years.
i have it here, and i'm going to read it to you.
"friends, i leave you today after a score of years in this church as a servant of the lord, to whom i pray that he may let words of my mouth and troubled meditations of my heart be acceptable in his sight.

surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
miss fallon, the news you bring is painful, but i hardly think it proper...
you're the head deacon of this church, mr. simpson, and i want you to listen to what i have to say, because it's your clique that started all this trouble.
i was brought up on the bible, and i know it by heart.
i'm gonna take my text this morning from chapter 23 of the gospel of matthew.
and i say unto you as christ said to the scribes and pharisees,
"woe unto you hypocrites, for you devour widows' homes, and for a pretence make long prayers."
some of you have listened to my father for 20 years, and you can't remember one word he said to you, but you'll remember this:
you subscribe to temperance, and i can tell you the names of your bootleggers.
if you have none, you can assume the ones that happen to pay.
you're sore at those people because they fired your old man, and it killed him.
and i bring you the promise and pledge that god's in his heaven, and all's right with the world.
oh, my dear ones, i can't see you, but i can feel you all around me.
thousands and thousands of you tuning in on station g-o-d, god, on a wavelength that carries his blessed words to the furthermost reaches of the universe.
just as the little microphone before me carries my voice to your ears...
and i say unto you, there is not a single soul among you these beasts can hurt, if you come into this cage with love and understanding in your heart.
who among you will prove there is no fear in god's kingdom?
you have shown it, brother, by coming up here with me tonight.
and i solemnly promise that the day will come when your faith will be rewarded.
we cook up a sob routine for you that would melt a mountain.
and you pull it like you're reading out of a telephone book.
sister gets them all hot and bothered, reaching for the clouds.
then you punks step up, and they start grabbing for their hats.
why don't you take a tip out of your bible where it says:
"don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
how many times have i told you to lay off talking business when sister's around.
i didn't think you'd object if i was telling her good news.
i've got 20 chiselers on my staff, and i have to split my commission with them.
you may think i'm getting too much, but i don't think 20 percent is enough.
my car is parked across the street, and my chauffeur's asleep.
i wonder if you'd be good enough to run over there and ask him to drive up here.
he was gonna jump right out that window, but you happened to be on the air at that moment.
and you stopped him with a few well-chosen words about quitters.
the spiel that i have cooked up for you this evening is on the subject of
"will you have ginger ale, or will you have white rum?"
if they should happen to get to you when i'm not around,
i advise you not to hold out anything you may know about it.
you made a squawk around here about your being a prisoner.
sure you are, and i'm going to keep you a prisoner, because i'm nuts about you.
al, ladies and gentlemen, unaccustomed as i am to public speaking,
i wanna take this opportunity to thank our host for this wonderful banquet.
i've never had a birthday party before, and i'll never forget this one, that's a promise.
and it reminds me of a promise i made to a young man a few weeks ago on the platform of the tabernacle.
we have with us tonight a man who is so well-known, he doesn't need any introduction.
i take great pleasure in presenting... that bon vivant, that accomplished rake, that experienced traveller, the donnest of don juans, the rummiest of romeos, aloysius k. eucalyptus.
my idea of the holy land is the south of france.
monte carlo, champagne, roulette, and your old pal hornsby around, just to keep it from being a cook's tour.
there must be thousands of people who contributed to that tabernacle fund.
what a swell dish it will be for them to read the inside story... of sister fallon.
and then to wailing wall i've read so much about in jerusalem.
i suppose i'll have to do some plain and fancy wailing.
listen, i'm taking along a dozen pair of scissors with me to write you with.
and one of these days, i'll be coming back like a bad penny.
forgive me for being so selfish... but last night i forgot the thousands of others who need you.
you and i were the only two people in the world.
i ought to make you see a few stars at that.
keeping sister out so late when she's got so many things to do.
if you only knew, those roses you threw at me tonight might have been stones.
during the past few months, many of you have come up here to confess your sins and tell how you were saved.
tonight, i'm gonna tell you how i sinned and how i was saved.
i've wandered far away from god... and now i'm coming home.
this morning my father was to have delivered his farewell sermon to you, but he has been ill, as you all know, and today he cannot be with you.
but he dictated his sermon to me, as he has done for so many years.

oh, but all kidding aside, i know i'm keeping you from going someplace.
but i happen to know sister's voice as well as her face.
so speak up, and i'll tell you if you're sister or not.
why don't you come and sit down here by the fire.
i want you to know i don't approve of their selling that clay thing.
the funny part is you didn't know you were doing it.
he was gonna jump right out that window, but you happened to be on the air at that moment.
two is a company, three is a crowd, i always say.
you mean to say that something i said over the radio actually stopped you from jumping out of the window?
and you taught me how to laugh almost after i'd forgotten how.
now, you keep out of the rain and don't you go hamlet anymore, will you?
i'm sick of doing the hard work and seeing you two get all the gravy.
twenty percent to me, and i have to kick back half of that to my chiselers.
i suppose there'll be a couple of dicks around to see us.
if they should happen to get to you when i'm not around,
still, i suppose there'll be a couple of cops snooping around.
it might be a good idea for us to call time-out.
and it won't be safe for anyone to try to horn in.
you made a squawk around here about your being a prisoner.
sure you are, and i'm going to keep you a prisoner, because i'm nuts about you.
i fell for you the first time i ever saw you.
i should be forever grateful to him because he taught me how to laugh.
i've never had a birthday party before, and i'll never forget this one, that's a promise.
well, when you can't see the world, you invent one of your own.
and, folks, mine's been a lovely world, since the guest of the evening came into it.
monte carlo, champagne, roulette, and your old pal hornsby around, just to keep it from being a cook's tour.
i'm not going to monte carlo with you, or anyplace else.
i always keep my word, even with the rats like welford.
and i'm tipping you now, if you don't do as i say, you'll have a lot of time to regret it.
the more i think of it, the more it looks to me like welford was knocked off.
only tonight, i found out that he was on his way to a newspaper office when it happened.
i'm going to the river jordan and maybe swim in it.
and then to wailing wall i've read so much about in jerusalem.
and one of these days, i'll be coming back like a bad penny.
forgive me for being so selfish... but last night i forgot the thousands of others who need you.
say, keep the people off this wire for a few minutes, will you?
go out there, brown, and keep the rest of the people from coming in.
during the past few months, many of you have come up here to confess your sins and tell how you were saved.
tonight, i'm gonna tell you how i sinned and how i was saved.
when i named you gunboat, i must've been thinking of the swiss navy.
six months i've been feeding you, and you haven't won a fight for me yet.
when you get in the ring, all you do is throw a lot of rights.
where do you suppose dempsey would be without his left hook?
this morning my father was to have delivered his farewell sermon to you, but he has been ill, as you all know, and today he cannot be with you.
but he dictated his sermon to me, as he has done for so many years.
i have it here, and i'm going to read it to you.
"friends, i leave you today after a score of years in this church as a servant of the lord, to whom i pray that he may let words of my mouth and troubled meditations of my heart be acceptable in his sight.
i have baptized many of you in the lord's grace, a few of you i have joined together in marriage, and over the bodies of some of your loved ones,
i have spoken the beautiful, triumphant victory that comes with the lord's salvation.
i would dearly love to stay as your pastor for the rest of my years, for i had hoped to live and die at this pulpit.
but you have seen fit to call another, a younger man to guide and serve you.
and though i leave you, i do not leave the lord.
surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
when the heart is thirsty, there is drink in the testaments:
he died in my arms five minutes ago, before he could finish his message to you, but i'm gonna finish it for him.
miss fallon, the news you bring is painful, but i hardly think it proper...
this isn't the house of god, this is a meeting place for hypocrites.
you're out of your head, and i, for one, will not listen to such...
i'm gonna take my text this morning from chapter 23 of the gospel of matthew.
and i say unto you as christ said to the scribes and pharisees,
and i don't mind telling you that i was thinking all the things you just said.
this trip looked like a double zero to me, but i've got a hunch that it won't be a blank after all.
oh, my de{y:i}ar one{y:i}s, i can't see {y:i}you, but i can fee{y:i}l you all around me.
thousands and thousands of you tuning in on station g-o-d, god, on a wave{y:i}le{y:i}ngth that carrie{y:i}s his ble{y:i}sse{y:i}d words
and i say unto you, there is not a single soul among you these beasts can hurt, if you come into this cage with love and understanding in your heart.
who among you will prove there is no fear in god's kingdom?
you have shown it, brother, by coming up here with me tonight.
and i solemnly promise that the day will come when your faith will be rewarded.
we cook up a sob routine for you that would melt a mountain.
and you pull it like you're reading out of a telephone book.
sister gets them all hot and bothered, reaching for the clouds.
then you punks step up, and they start grabbing for their hats.
why don't you take a tip out of your bible where it says:
"don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."
how many times have i told you to lay off talking business when sister's around.
i didn't think you'd object if i was telling her good news.
i've got 20 chiselers on my staff, and i have to split my commission with them.
you may think i'm getting too much, but i don't think 20 percent is enough.
my car is parked across the street, and my chauffeur's asleep.
i wonder if you'd be good enough to run over there and ask him to drive up here.
the funny part is you didn't know you were doing it.
he was gonna jump right out that window, but you happened to be on the air at that moment.
two is a company, three is a crowd, i always say.
you mean to say that something i said over the radio actually stopped you from jumping out of the window?

where do you suppose dempsey would be without his left hook?
to turn around... touch the edge with one hand and further down with the other, then turn around and push off with the legs.
that's all i ever get from you, a lot of hard-luck stories.
but i keep telling you how difficult it is, mrs. schuyler.
the last time i asked her, she made very uncouth noises with her mouth.
- pardon me, madam but what am i to say to the newspapermen?
dexter, go out and tell those ruffians i have nothing to say.
because my name's schuyler too, and i haven't done a thing.
but i'll have to suffer with michael, and so will mother.
when i was here, i had one of your books in my hand.
when i got outside, i realized i still had your book in my hand.
since i had your book, i thought i'd take it home and read it.
this morning, i put your book in my hand and here's your book in your hand.
after years of research i finally discovered that i was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play.
believe it or not, in my spare time, i'm now writing a play.
i've been sitting here for a half-hour looking at you and i don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
i'm j ust beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
because i begin to get goofy ideas and they concern you, anne.
none of your ideas could be goofy, stewart, if they concern me.
i make 75 bucks a week, and i got 847 bucks in the bank.
and i don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
the architecture has a little feeling of missouri gothic and the furniture sort of leans toward oklahoma renaissance with a tiny touch of grand rapids.
don't you think it's silly to think of living there when we have this big house?
i'll wash behind the ears but no, i won't, my dear
oh, yes, you will, my dear oh, yes, you will, my dear
or perhaps some slightly fried pansies or, better still, stuffed shirts.
and every one of them will give you a good, stiff pain in the neck.
that's j ust to give you an idea that i know how to treat a gal.
get fresh with me and i'll sock you in that little nose of yours.
for instance, a fish can putter in water but not on land, because he'd be out of place.
an eagle can putter around a rugged mountaintop but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy.
i'm on the coast of norway, and i can't get out.
will you come get me out of the coast of norway?
now, gallagher, if i could only get a great scene a tremendously emotional scene.
something to ring the hearts out of the public to bring the curtain down in the second act.
it's something i should have done long ago only i didn't have sense enough to do it.
no, i have to stick around and try to make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning.
the lawyer comes to see the kid to talk over the divorce, you know.
they insult the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony.
that little schnozzle of hers is the berries, i tell you.
and is it cute when she throws that little schnozzle to the high heavens!
i thought i might as well take it home and read it.
this morning i put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
i finally discovered that i was the only guy in the world who hadn't written a play.
so, believe it or not, in my spare time, i'm now writing a play.
i make 75 bucks a week, and i got 847 bucks in the bank.
and i don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
remember the time i was serving spaghetti and dropped it on the floor?
when those mugs weren't looking, i served it to 'em anyway.
anne and myself are gonna move downtown in a little flat.
we're gonna forget this social stuff and be known as mr and mrs stew smith.
i'm a lucky guy that i can even be near anne schuyler.
i've been hit with a carload of horseshoes and i know it.
keep this up, you'll have a breakdown before you go to europe.
it's a good thing your father passed away before he saw insanity ravage the family.
you mean you'd like to have me live here in your house?
we can have the whole left wing and be by ourselves all the time.
i'll wash behind the ears but, no, i won't, my dear
oh, yes, you will, my dear oh, yes, you will, my dear
you've made that clear to me, and i'm sick and tired of it.
i've given you party after party, taken you into the best homes, introduced you to people of importance.
for instance, a fish can putter in water but not on land, because he'd be out of place.
an eagle can putter around rugged mountaintops but not in a cage, because he'd be restless and unhappy.
if we could only get a great scene, a tremendously emotional scene.
something to ring the hearts out of the public, to bring the curtain down in the second act.
i should have done it long ago, only i didn't have sense enough to do it.
i have to try to make a success of something that i knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning.
i didn't marry that dame for her dough and i don't want any of her dough now.
i was too poor to get a wedding present, so i'll give her a divorce.
they insult the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony.
the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer and throws him out.
bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
you think i'm gonna let that guy go back to his wife?
"certain evidence leads us to believe that this is the same murderer who has already claimed eight victims from among our city's children.
we must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.

if you rely on a color-blind man for clues, don't be surprised if you get nowhere!
in their hunt for this unknown killer, the police have tracked down more than 1 ,500 detailed leads.
we set the best trackers on the faintest of traces, but they lost the scent and failed to pick it up again despite all efforts.
since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.

scotland yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in london.
there he was, hands up, back to the wall, cops all around him.
measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
we can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, cafe or even private home from the clutches of the police.
if we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
i don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
so we just wait for the police to catch the guy instead?
the difficulties in solving crimes of this nature are, in my experience, often insurmountable, since perpetrator and victim are often brought together by mere chance.
it's a fact well-known to all of us that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
that's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
i'm quite certain that information on the individual in question must already exist somewhere.

inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
cigar ad and a postcard with flowers and "regards, paul" on it, but no address of sender.
an empty cigarette pack, ariston brand, a bag of candy -
the day little elsie beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
he was with a little girl... and he whistled just like that!
everyone sitting here is an expert in the rule of law!
from six weeks in tegel prison... to 1 5 years in brandenburg.
it is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
and a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
no one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
not even the state, and all of you least of all!

since june 11, little klaus klawltzky and his sister klara have disappeared
evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a similar crime committed last fall against the doerlng sisters
clearly it held the candy ln a corner, we found some crumbs and some sugar grains
within a radius of 2 kilometers, we have searched in all the candy shops to find out where the bag came from
of course, but you're drivin' away my clientele and the guy you're looking for ain't here
do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who's causing a raid every night?
gentlemen, the cops are looking for the murderer in our ranks!
when i run into a cop while on business, he knows the risk and so do l. lf one of us dies, ok, that's a risk one takes lt can happen.
gentlemen, our members have to carry on normal business without being handicapped by nervous policemen
i ask you for advice i suggest a closer watch on id cards, systematic searches and police raids.
we must be allowed to search any house, apartment, back yard in order to find a clue
we have contacts, we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
well, we just can't wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow
the difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance
he hasn't come out yet or we would have seen him
he must be in the courtyard, he didn't come out this way
it's there all the time, driving me out to wander the streets following me, silently, but i can feel it there lt's me, pursuing myself i want to escape, to escape from myself!
but it's impossible l can't escape. i have to obey it.
our very honorable president, who is, i believe, wanted by the police for three murders -
that's got nothing to do with it ...claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse he is condemned to death
then the compulsion all over again, and so on, and on
no one can kill a man who isn't responsible for his actions

we should make it known that he isn't in the underworld
i'm sure it's a man who looks like he wouldn't hurt a fly
in his normal state, he might even play marbles with the kids or cards with his wife.
otherwise, murderers like grossmann or haarmann couldn't live for years like they did without their neighbors suspecting them at all
and the killer... as we know, in this kind of crime never leaves a mark behind
this is what makes our job so hard and our success so rare
"when searching homes, we must look for any clue which could establish where the murderer's letter to the papers originated
if there is an old wooden table, if there is a red pencil or writing paper of the same type.
and spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense
and then you'd escape, or else get a pardon, then there you are, free as air, with a law-protected pass because of mental illness, off again, chasing little girls
as this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence
someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out, like a candle
i won't allow a crime to be committed in my presence
i demand that this man... that this man be granted the protection of the law

mr. secretary, we cannot stop the murderer from writing to whomever he wishes!
this severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
but, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
despite all these setbacks, we're forced to press on in our investigation, always in uncertainty, and with little chance of success in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
mr. secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
we've dispatched all our forces to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched, every bush examined, since any bush or hollow could harbor some object that could finally set us on the right track.
since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
this does not, of course, make the police very popular, nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
but believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!

listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
you clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
so you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
and then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity... and you're back to chasing little children!
probably proud of it, too... proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.

measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
we can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, cafe or even private home from the clutches of the police.
if we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
i don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
this man may well be, when not engaged in the actual act of killing, a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
in his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
that's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
the police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
that's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
so you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
and then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity and you're back to chasing little children!
it is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
and a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
no one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
not even the state, and all of you least of all!
of course, but you're drivin' away my clientele and the guy you're looking for ain't here
do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who's causing a raid every night?
gentlemen, the cops are looking for the murderer in our ranks!
when i run into a cop while on business, he knows the risk and so do i.
the girls must take a little more notice of the cops
we get into trouble because one of the girls has talked too much to her cop boyfriend.
we have contacts, we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
we should make it known that he isn't in the underworld
i'm sure it's a man who looks like he wouldn't hurt a fly
in his normal state, he might even play marbles with the kids or cards with his wife.
well, we just can't wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow
the difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance
he hasn't come out yet or we would have seen him
he must be in the courtyard, he didn't come out this way
what have you do to with the murderer, and where'd you take him?
well, lnspector, you know the old distillery of kuntz and levy?
and spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense
and then you'd escape, or else get a pardon, then there you are, free as air, with a law-protected pass because of mental illness, off again, chasing little girls
as this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence
someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out, like a candle
i won't allow a crime to be committed in my presence
i demand that this man... that this man be granted the protection of the law
"little kurt klawitzky and his sister klara have been missing since june 11th.
evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the doering siblings".
we must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
a little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom".
"anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
but the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
this severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
we immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
the partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation, a form of acting which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
the writing as a whole displays elusive yet unmistakable signs of madness".
but, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
despite all these setbacks, we're forced to press on in our investigation, always in uncertainty, and with little chance of success in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
mr. secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
we've dispatched all our forces to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched, every bush examined, since any bush or hollow could harbor some object that could finally set us on the right track.
since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
this does not, of course, make the police very popular, nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
but believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
i know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.

but, of course no one remembers anything that would provide any leads since so much time has passed.
despite all these setbacks, we're forced to continue searching for clues, examining all avenues - always facing uncertainty and starting out with little chance of success in bringing this case even one step toward its conclusion.
we've dispatched all our available forces to systematically comb the surrounding areas of the city.
every undergrowth and thicket, every tree in a plantation is carefully examined, since in any bush or under any leaf a potential clue may be hiding that could finally put us on the right track.
we have the best trackers with their sniffer dogs going over even the slightest traces, but they've lost the scent and despite all efforts failed to pick it up again.

no, but you're driving my customers away, and you won't find the one you're lookin' for anyway!

especially the girls, even if they hustle - business is business - but believe me, sergeant, in every one of them is a mother!
i know lots of heavies who get all teary when they see kids playing.

now i've gotta look below the bed three times a night to check if the murderer is there.
you can't do business anymore 'cause you're always stumbling over coppers.

he was hands up against the wall with coppers all around him and two seconds later three corpses were lying there but he wasn't among them!

this is perhaps a man who is - aside from his urge to kill - a normal-looking citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
perhaps when he is not in the state of madness he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or he plays cards with friends.
that person, being a pathological case, no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.

there is just one thing i don't understand - that you're covering for the same gang that left you in a tough spot.
fine pals that scram when the going gets tough and leave you to take the rap.
hey, you, if i were in your shoes i wouldn't make big speeches, sir!
it's gonna be about your head - just in case you hadn't noticed!

in their hunt for the killer so far the police have followed up on 1,500 detailed leads.
every undergrowth and thicket, every tree in a plantation is carefully examined, since in any bush or under any leaf a potential clue may be hiding that could finally put us on the right track.
we have the best trackers with their sniffer dogs going over even the slightest traces, but they've lost the scent and despite all efforts failed to pick it up again.
since the first murders police officers have repeatedly searched homeless shelters everywhere and thoroughly checked the identities of every vagrant in them.
of course, this doesn't make the police very popular nor does it reduce the level of tension in the general public.
no, but you're driving my customers away, and you won't find the one you're lookin' for anyway!
if you knew how mad they are about the pig that got them into this every night!
especially the girls, even if they hustle - business is business - but believe me, sergeant, in every one of them is a mother!
i know lots of heavies who get all teary when they see kids playing.
the counter measures by the police, the nightly raids to catch this... child murderer are seriously undermining our work in an intolerable way.
it is no longer acceptable that we're not safe now at any hotel, pub, cafe or even private home from the grip of the police.
we have our connections - if we were to put an article into a paper that our...
well, respectable organisations don't want to be classed with this monster, that the cops should look for this pig somewhere else...
perhaps when he is not in the state of madness he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or he plays cards with friends.
without the - let me put it this way - private normality that these murderers have, it would've been impossible for the likes of grossman or haarmann to have lived right next to their neighbours for years without revealing even a clue to their true character.
it's a very well-known fact that murderers like this rarely leave a clue behind.
that's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
that's why we have to get the care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums to support us unequivocally.
we specifically need information on those who were released as no danger to society but who by their nature are a threat.
no red pencil, not even traces - in fact, no writing implements at all.
printed matter found in waste basket - cigar ad, postcard with flowers on it signed "best wishes
so, you said in your statement - listen carefully now, you might have to testify under oath later - that you overheard one of the burglars tell the fellow who was watching you,
"we got himl i have found the guyl he's in the loftl"
so that you can invoke section 51 and spend your life being cared for by the state!
and then you break out of the asylum or you fall under amnesty, and you're happy as can be, free to enjoy your licence to kill - since you're protected by law due to insanity - back to chasing little girls.
probably proud of it, too - that you can crack safes or are cat burglars or can cheat at cards!
all of these things, i think, you could just as easily give up if you'd learned something useful or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy prigs!
certain evidence leads us to believe that the murderer is the same one who has already killed eight children
we must remind you again that a mother's first duty is to guard her children from the danger which always threatens
we find, for instance, behind a hedge a little white paper bag
clearly it held the candy ln a corner, we found some crumbs and some sugar grains
daily raids by the police for the child murderer interfere with our business.
we can't put up with this pressure any longer in every hotel, cafe or pad
when i run into a cop while on business, he knows the risk and so do l. lf one of us dies, ok, that's a risk one takes lt can happen.
but you and i are not on the level of this murderer
the girls must take a little more notice of the cops
we get into trouble because one of the girls has talked too much to her cop boyfriend.
we have contacts, we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
we should make it known that he isn't in the underworld i'm sure it's a man who looks like he wouldn't hurt a fly ln his normal state, he might even play marbles with the kids
let's get one of those guys, a telepath one who finds handkerchiefs and pocketbooks that have been hidden l don't think the reward is enough
chief, we have to offer a real fortune for the murderer
and the killer... as we know, in this kind of crime never leaves a mark behind
this is what makes our job so hard and our success so rare
we've surrounded the whole block lf he wanted to get home, he'd run into us
now you have to wait i'll be in my office if you have some news
planning and assisting with a murder. lt's a bad show, franz i can't go on with it. i don't want to have anything to do with it i'll tell you everything, everything i know
very wise, but unfortunately too late inspector, it can't be too late...
what have you do to with the murderer, and where'd you take him?
well, inspector, you know the old distillery of kuntz and levy?
from 6 weeks in tegel prison to 15 years in brandenburg
you will get your rights, you will even get a lawyer
and spend the rest of your life in an institution at state expense
and then you'd escape, or else get a pardon, then there you are, free as air, with a law-protected pass because of mental illness, off again, chasing little girls
but it's impossible l can't escape. i have to obey it.
i have to run... endless streets i want to escape, to get away
as this is the case he has pronounced his own death sentence
someone who admits to being a compulsive murderer should be snuffed out, like a candle
i won't allow a crime to be committed in my presence i demand that this man... that this man be granted the protection of the law
i demand that this man be handed over to the police
since june 11, little klaus klawltzky and his sister klara have disappeared
evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a similar crime committed last fall against the doerlng sisters
clearly it held the candy ln a corner, we found some crumbs and some sugar grains
within a radius of 2 kilometers, we have searched in all the candy shops to find out where the bag came from
of course, but you're drivin' away my clientele and the guy you're looking for ain't here
do you know how mad everyone is about this guy who's causing a raid every night?
gentlemen, the cops are looking for the murderer in our ranks!
when i run into a cop while on business, he knows the risk and so do l. lf one of us dies, ok, that's a risk one takes lt can happen.
gentlemen, our members have to carry on normal business without being handicapped by nervous policemen
i ask you for advice i suggest a closer watch on id cards, systematic searches and police raids.
we must be allowed to search any house, apartment, back yard in order to find a clue
we have contacts, we have to make a statement to the press we have to tell them that we condemn the bastard too
well, we just can't wait until the police decide to arrest the fellow
the difficulty in solving crimes like this comes from the fact that the criminal and the victim are connected only by chance
he hasn't come out yet or we would have seen him
he must be in the courtyard, he didn't come out this way
it's there all the time, driving me out to wander the streets following me, silently, but i can feel it there lt's me, pursuing myself i want to escape, to escape from myself!
but it's impossible l can't escape. i have to obey it.
our very honorable president, who is, i believe, wanted by the police for three murders -
that's got nothing to do with it ...claims that because my client acts under an irresistible impulse he is condemned to death
then the compulsion all over again, and so on, and on
no one can kill a man who isn't responsible for his actions
the film was rereleased in a shortened 98-minute version in march of 1960 under the title m, dein mörder sieht dich an.
the original negative is preserved at the federal film archive in a 96-minute version.
"little kurt klawitzky and his sister klara have been missing since june 11th.
evidence leads us to believe the children were victims of a crime similar to that committed last fall against the doering siblings."
we must emphasize once again that it is, now more than ever, every mother and father's sacred duty to alert their children to this ever present danger and to the friendly guise it is likely to assume.
a little candy, a toy, or an apple can suffice to lure a child to his or her doom."
"anxiety among the general public is heightened by the police's failure to apprehend a suspect.
but the police are faced with the almost impossible task of catching a criminal who left not the slightest clue behind.
this severely pathological man probably takes great pleasure in seeing his crimes covered in the press.
we immediately got in touch with the newspaper and had them send us the original letter.
the partially disrupted and uneven style of his other letters is, in its interpretation, a form of acting which may manifest externally as indolence or even lethargy.
the writing as a whole displays elusive yet unmistakable signs of madness."
but, of course, after such a long time, no one remembers anything that could serve as a lead.
despite all these setbacks, we're forced to press on in our investigation, always in uncertainty, and with little chance of success in bringing the case even one step closer to its conclusion.
mr. secretary, you don't seem to have a clear picture of the enormous obstacles confronting our forces.
do you realize, for example, regarding the route the child took home, that there are 15 conflicting eyewitness accounts alone?
we've dispatched all our forces to systematically comb the area adjoining the city.
every piece of undergrowth is scoured, every thicket searched, every bush examined, since any bush or hollow could harbor some object that could finally set us on the right track.
since the first murders, the police have searched homeless shelters night after night, subjecting everyone in them to thorough scrutiny.
this does not, of course, make the police very popular, nor does it reduce the general public's anxiety.
but believe me, in every one of them beats a mother's heart!
i know a lot of toughs who get all teary-eyed just seein' the little ones at play.
scotland yard laid a trap for him once on a bank job he pulled in london.
there he was, hands up, back to the wall, cops all around him.
measures taken by the police and the daily raids to catch this child murderer are hampering our activities to an almost unbearable degree.
we can no longer tolerate the fact that we're not safe now in any hotel, bar, café or even private home from the clutches of the police.
if we can't get funds to support the wives of those members who currently enjoy room and board at state expense,
i don't know where we'll find the money to carry out our plans.
this man may well be... when not engaged in the actual act of killing... a harmless, upstanding citizen who wouldn't hurt a fly.
in his right mind, perhaps he plays marbles with his landlady's kids or plays cards with friends.
that's what makes our work so hard, our successes so few.
the police have been after this murderer for eight months now.
being the severely pathological case that he is, he has no doubt already had some kind of contact with the authorities.
that's why all health care facilities, prisons, clinics and insane asylums must be encouraged to cooperate with us unequivocally.
"in searching homes, be on the lookout for any clue which could establish the origin of the murderer's letter to the courier.
be on the lookout as well for an old wooden table..."
inspector, here are reports on mental patients who've been released as cured or deemed harmless over the last five years.
reports from every private and public institute, as well as from municipal hospitals and asylums.
the day little elsie beckmann was killed, a man bought a balloon from me.
he was with a little girl... and he whistled just like that!
listen carefully, in case you have to testify under oath later.
you clearly heard one of the burglars say to the guy guarding you,
so you can plead insanity and spend the rest of your life being cared for by the state.
and then you break out of the asylum or receive a pardon, and you're happy as can be, free to kill with impunity, protected by law on grounds of insanity... and you're back to chasing little children!
probably proud of it, too... proud you can crack a safe or sneak into houses or cheat at cards.
all of which it seems to me you could just as easily give up if you had learned something useful, or if you had jobs or if you weren't such lazy pigs.
it is precisely the nature of compulsion that relieves him of responsibility for his actions!
and a man cannot be punished for that for which he is not responsible!
no one has the right to kill a man who cannot be held responsible for his crimes!
not even the state, and all of you least of all!
i'm sure we'd all like to welcome an old member back into our midst,
a member who has, for the last three years, been traveling in the orient.
but i shouldn't be picking on hardy, because he's promised to do us a great favor.
he's promised to lend us that magnificent house of his for the milk fund ball.
i'm sure we all appreciate this, and i'm also certain that we'd like to hear a few words from mr. livingstone.
i daresay that when i tell you that i'm glad to be back, it sounds, to say the least, banal.
as for any possible generosity of mine in letting you have your milk fund ball at my house, don't consider it as that.
think of it, rather, as a slight gesture on my part to bring you together under my roof, where i may feel that i am somewhat, if not entirely, your host.
it's bad luck to talk, but i'm promoting something that may turn into gold any day.
you know, i take a positively clinical interest in this man.
well, i should say that your past had been rather international.
perhaps in knowing many women, one is able to appreciate the one woman when she comes along.
mr. livingstone, tell the court in your own way what happened on the night you were shot.
well, i'm afraid i'll have to go back a few days before that, to the occasion of a gambling debt.
he explained he was in financial difficulties and asked if i'd take his iou, which i did.
a few days later, i needed money, and i telephoned mr. carlyle and reminded him of his iou.
i threatened to expose him, have him put out of the club.
before i knew it, he rushed to the table drawer and opened it.
but those of us who know our livingstone have our suspicions.
but i shouldn't be picking on hardy, because he's promised to do us a great favor.
he's promised to lend us that magnificent house of his for the milk fund ball.
i'm sure we all appreciate this, and i'm also certain that we'd like to hear a few words from mr. livingstone.
i suppose you smoke opium here, and hold all sorts of exotic rituals?
opium has never agreed with me, but in the orient, some of us use it as you would cigarettes.
last year we used the american indian motif, and by the most peculiar coincidence, practically all the members came as pocahontas,
which the board objected to, because they said there was some doubt as to whether she really married john smith.
you have money now, and i'm of no further use to you.
but if you're trying to appeal to my better nature, it's hopeless!
i've been thinking all night about myself, how wicked and selfish and spoiled i am.
and how good you are, and how little i deserve you.
mr. carlyle had lost to me considerably at cards, to be exact, $10,000.
he explained he was in financial difficulties and asked if i'd take his iou, which i did.
as i went to a table drawer to get some cards,
oh... it happens that i keep a pistol in the same drawer...
before i knew it, he rushed to the table drawer and opened it.
i made a lunge for the pistol, but he got there first and he fired.
i don't care which of the which of you it was, if you wake me up again...
now, i don't want to hear another sound out of you.
but ma, the johnson's twins wear the bow on this side.
but susan, you're not a twin, and mother like it on this side.
pa's got a weak back and he just won't admit it.
besides, he's sort of waiting on a government job that's been promised to him.
therefore, in any proportion, the product of the means divided by either extreme, is equal to the other extreme.

isaac, will you step to the blackboard and give the class a demonstration of the theorem?
if you whip johnny, pa will whip him again after he gets home.
yes, pa always says, when we get a whipping in school, we'll get another when we get home.
when i woke up this morning i felt like jumping out of bed, grabbing my books and being off for school.
and i wish you were just that little, so i can bundle you all off, give you your lunch pails and send you to school.
i don't want anyone in there until minnie and isaac come with the children.
i was just trying to see what santa claus put in my stocking.
fellows i used to go to school with ducked in the stores, so they wouldn't have to meet me.
and when i came to the gate, some kids hollered "jailbird".
you haven't made the things too easy for any of us.
it's been like a black cloud hanging over the whole family.
this is phyllis's home and she should do as she please.

how many times have i gotta tell you fellas to let my phone alone?
if you want to talk through a mouthpiece, go and buy one like i did.

remember what he did to fenton when he wanted to go to hollywood?
got him into a fight, then had him thrown into jail for assault and battery.
i'd write 'em for a year to see him when he hears i'm getting married.
i'd write 'em for two years to get a load of what he says when he hears
you've made a fresh-air fiend of me, dear, and i'm not going back there unless you send me.
then, hildy, you go right up to walter burns and resign.
i wasn't going to give it to you until we got there.
but you take it, and after you take me home, you get the tickets.
didn't i go to the expense of hiring an airplane to take you up so you'd get your hearing back?
to the further expense of bribing the pilot so he'd land in the middle of a strike massacre?
the 5:15 out to some quiet suburb, a home-cooked dinner every night at exactly 7:00.
and by 10:00 in bed, unless after the tapioca the wife has some friends in for a neighborly chat.
the next time i see you, no matter where i am or what i'm doing,
i'm gonna walk right up to you and hammer on that monkey skull of yours till it rings like a chinese gong!
and if you know what's good for you, you'll stay west of gary, indiana, because a johnson never forgets!
and that, boys, is what is known as telling the managing editor.
yeah, he got me into polack mike's, filled me full of rotgut.
i'd have been there yet if it hadn't been for the toilet.
and you'll all end up on the copy desk, gray-headed, hump-backed slobs, dodging garnishees when you're 90.
you'll be out in the street the minute your contract's up.
can we help it if the people rise to support this administration's stand against the red menace?
personified by mr. earl williams, a guy who loses the job he's held for 14 years, joins a parade of the unemployed and, because he's goofy from lack of food, waves a red undershirt.
once and for all, will you hang this person at 5:00 am instead of 7:00?
it can't hurt you, and we can make the city edition.
roy, you can't hang a fella in his sleep just to please a newspaper.
no, but you can keep postponing the hanging so it'll come just before the election.
and to prove to the voters that the red menace is on the square,
sheriff hartman has just written himself four more letters threatening his life.
i never said i loved earl williams and was willing to marry him on the gallows.
you made that up, and about my being his soul mate and having a love nest with him.
i went up to him like any human being would, asked him what was the matter.
he told me about being fired after working at the same place for 14 years.
i'd like to know some curses bad enough for your greasy souls.
sure, i was his witness ̶ the only one he had.
the only one with guts enough to stand up for him.
that's why you're persecuting me ̶ 'cause he treated me decent and not like an animal, and i said so.
a poor, crazy little guy that never did anybody any harm, sitting out there alone, this minute, with the angel of death beside him, and you cracking jokes!
listen, if you don't shut up, i'll give you something to cry about.
i'll tell you something else, and you can pass it on to walter burns.
the post get no tickets for this hanging on account of the lies they been printing!
no, no, i tell you, no one knows where he got the gun.
he ran up eight flights of stairs to the infirmary, got out through the skylight.
mrs. phoebe dewolfe, 861 and a half south euclid street, colored.
well, she became the mother of a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with sheriff hartman's rifle squad acting as nurses.
so the police coaxed her into the patrol wagon and started a race with the stork.
when the baby was born they examined him carefully to see if it was earl williams, who they knew was hiding somewhere.
they named the baby peter hartman dewolfe in honor of the sheriff.
and they all pitched in a dollar a piece on account of it being the first baby ever born on a manhunt.
in what way can an unavoidable misfortune of this sort influence the duty of every citizen, colored or otherwise?
your honor, tell me, is there a red menace or ain't there?
i was tellin' the man that when he handed me the gun.
waking me up in the middle of the night, talkin' to me about things i don't understand, callin' me a bolshevik.
once he got on this roof, he could slide down the rain pipe and come in any of the windows.
well, if the story's going to walk right in the window...
we're gonna keep williams under cover so the post can break the story exclusive.
then we'll let the governor in on the capture and share the glory with him.
you never did love me, or you couldn't talk to me that way.
if you want me, take me as i am instead of trying to make a floozy out of me.
i'm going to get sipperly to make up a prayer for our fair city in eight-column, old english boldface, right across the top of the paper.
"our father, there were 421 murders in this, our fair city, last year."
the post again rode to the rescue of the city last night in the darkest hour of her history.
earl williams ̶ earl williams, the bolshevik tiger, who leapt snarling from the gallows upon the flanks of the city, was captured ̶
i can't tell you, mr. burns, how terribly grateful i am, yes, sir.
you don't suppose there might be an opening sometime for a foreign correspondent?
and the very next morning, what do i find in the tribune all over the front page?
my traction story that i'd been fool enough to tell my wife.
say, with that rap what i got against me and the bank job and the big blow right here,
i should stick around asking questions from a lot of cops?
williams gave away his whereabouts when he sent out for food.
the sheriff is now tracing a mysterious phone call that gave away williams' hiding place.
walter, i can't tell you how badly i feel about this.
there was no excuse for pete to fly off the handle.
wait till those two future pencil peddlers read the post in the morning.
say, hildy, get that guy pincus over to the office tomorrow ̶
i'm going to new york with you if you give me this one last chance.
i'm gonna cut out drinking and swearing and everything connected with the crazy newspaper business.
you're a great newspaperman, hildy, and i'm sorry to see you go.
if i ever come back to the business ̶ which i won't ̶ there's only one guy i'd work for.
a team of german miners belonging to a special rescue squad came from westphalia to join up with the french rescuers.
this film, which takes place in our time is based on that terrible catastrophe.
and again, it's because we're united as miners, that comrade kasper broke the gate in shaft 1315.
and it's also because on our side of the border we have only two enemies:
whether we dig it up on this side or the other.
and if they can't reach an agreement at the top we'll stick together.
"one mystery still remains in the mystery of the yellow room"
we all recall the spectacular conclusion to the yellow room affair two months ago
i leave without having seen you but i very much need to speak to you.
besides robert darzac, only you know of my previous marriage to larsan and you saved me from him when you drove him to take poison.
we were all at the table when she screamed and the light went out
she could have screamed the first time for any number of reasons for example, perhaps she saw the statue fall
he went to his room at 5:00 and didn't leave again
but when mr. darzac wrote a telegram the ink was still wet at 6:00 since that's when the wet ink stained old bob's skull
because if you aren't the real darzac if you're a lookalike - a cousin, for example an identical cousin who could fool us then you strangled the real darzac!
you watched and waited to get him out of the way so you could lead mrs. darzac to your accomplice larsan himself!
i was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
i was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
gibson, you've been drinking again... and you know what my orders were.
but those stowaways, i just caught one of them in there.
hey, you know, i think you give him one snoop too much.
hey, you know, i think you give him one snoop too much.
thomas lindbergh, mighty flier, and thomas shefsky, mighty like a rose.
just remember that if there weren't any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks... and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be no fish, and that would suit me fine.
i'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.
just as i thought, you're yellow, grabbing at a woman's skirts.
does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
i can't think of anything in the world that matters more.
that's my wife and i don't like the way you're acting here.
if you don't like our country, go back where you came from.
sheriff, i ain't much on flowery sentiments... but there's something i just got to tell you.
shucks, man, i'd be nothing but a poisonous varmint... and not fit to touch the hem of your pants... if i didn't tell you you've treated me square, mighty square... and i ain't forgetting.
here we are at the old barn, all set for a nice picnic lunch.
gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
let's wait till we eat, there's hardly enough lunch for two.
i don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
here we are again at the ringside, and it looks like a great battle.
now the boys are locked in the center of the ring.
i was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
i was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
hey, you know, i think you give him one snoop too much.
and i want you to know, i'm fed up on your alibis.
i'm after joe helton, i tell you, and he can't get away from me on this boat.
he's got to put his okay on my gang, or he's gonna get this.
thomas lindbergh, mighty flier, and thomas shefsky, mighty like a rose.
just remember that if there weren't any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks... and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be no fish, and that would suit me fine.
madam, before i get through with you, you will have a clear case for divorce... and so will my wife.
the first thing to do is to arrange for a settlement.
i'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.
just as i thought, you're yellow, grabbing at a woman's skirts.
i predict they're going to have the greatest year they've ever had.
is it true that you're gonna get married again while on this tour?
i was just thinking, after the boat lands, i may never see you again.
does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
well, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me.
he did get up early this morning, but you weren't here.
that's my wife and i don't like the way you're acting here.
if you don't like our country, go back where you came from.
sheriff, i ain't much on flowery sentiments... but there's something i just got to tell you.
shucks, man, i'd be nothing but a poisonous varmint... and not fit to touch the hem of your pants... if i didn't tell you you've treated me square, mighty square... and i ain't forgetting.
i can't even sleep anymore, wondering who he's chasing around with.
why can't we break away from all this, just you and i... and lodge with my fleas in the hills?
you'll be out in an hour if your dad comes through.
butch, you take care of the girl while i telephone joe.
gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
i know an indian who's got a couple of red aunts.
i don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
some dark night, i think i'll come and lay for you if the hens don't get sore.
here we are again at the ringside, and it looks like a great battle.
now the boys are locked in the centre of the ring.
i was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.

he's got to put his okay on my gang, or he's gonna get this.
do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
don't you think that although girls go out with boys like me... they always marry the other kind?
i think i'll get off this boat until this blows over.
if you know what's good for you, you'll stick with me.
i was just thinking, after the boat lands, i may never see you again.
does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
well, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me.
he did get up early this morning, but you weren't here.
i can't even sleep anymore, wondering who he's chasing around with.
why can't we break away from all this, just you and i... and lodge with my fleas in the hills?
gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
i know an indian who's got a couple of red aunts.
i don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
some dark night, i think i'll come and lay for you if the hens don't get sore.
how would you like to have somebody... steal one of your heifers?
i know, heifer cow is better than none... but this is no time for puns.
i was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
why not send for the old swine, let his beard come later?
if it's the captain, i'm gonna have a few words with him.
my hot water's been cold for three days and i haven't got room to swing a cat.
gibson, you've been drinking again... and you know what my orders were.
but those stowaways, i just caught one of them in there.
hey, you know, i think you give him one snoop too much.
hey, you know, i think you give him one snoop too much.
thomas lindbergh, mighty flier, and thomas shefsky, mighty like a rose.
just remember that if there weren't any closets, there wouldn't be any hooks... and if there weren't any hooks, there'd be no fish, and that would suit me fine.
i'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.
just as i thought, you're yellow, grabbing at a woman's skirts.
i predict they're going to have the greatest year they've ever had.
is it true that you're gonna get married again while on this tour?
i was just thinking, after the boat lands, i may never see you again.
does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
well, you'll have to get up pretty early in the morning to steal from me.
he did get up early this morning, but you weren't here.
with all the good shows in town, taking a girl to an old barn!
once we get a hold of that girl, he'll take orders from me.
here we are at the old barn, all set for a nice picnic lunch.
gosh, the picnic is off, we haven't got any red ants.
let's wait till we eat, there's hardly enough lunch for two.
i don't see why she couldn't get kidnapped near a restaurant.
here we are again at the ringside, and it looks like a great battle.
now the boys are locked in the center of the ring.
i was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
i was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.
gibson, you've been drinking again... and you know what my orders were.

madam, before i get through with you, you will have a clear case for divorce... and so will my wife.
the first thing to do is to arrange for a settlement.
i'm sorry, but we're using the old-fashioned iceman... and we find him very satisfactory for keeping the house warm.

he did get up early this morning, but you weren't here.
you know, mary, everyone seems to be having nearly as much fun as i am.
i beg your pardon, but there's someone to see you, miss helton.
you'll be out in an hour if your dad comes through.
butch, you take care of the girl while i telephone joe.

do you think that girls think less of a boy if he lets himself be kissed?
don't you think that although girls go out with boys like me... they always marry the other kind?
i think i'll get off this boat until this blows over.
if you know what's good for you, you'll stick with me.
does it matter to you whether you ever see me again?
i can't think of anything in the world that matters more.
with all the good shows in town, taking a girl to an old barn!

that's my wife and i don't like the way you're acting here.
if you don't like our country, go back where you came from.
sheriff, i ain't much on flowery sentiments... but there's something i just got to tell you.
shucks, man, i'd be nothing but a poisonous varmint... and not fit to touch the hem of your pants... if i didn't tell you you've treated me square, mighty square... and i ain't forgetting.

now the boys are locked in the center of the ring.
would you turn on the porch light and turn off that hall light?
close the door and be sure that it's locked... and i'll start the car.
i guess that's why it's having so little effect... on those chimpanzees we're experimenting with.
we've been giving it to them for over two months now.
why can't you be a genius before sundown... and a human being afterward?
because i never know in advance when i'm going to be a genius.
i think mr. entwhistle is disturbed... because he can't take you to the party tonight... and dance all over your feet as he did the last time.
i certainly didn't reserve a table and order flowers... just to look at your face.
it depends on which combination of those ingredients we use... and the proportions in which we use them.
mathematically, we may never find the right combination... or the exact proportions to produce the effect you're talking about.
if you'll just let me work in the laboratory for a couple of hours...
i'll be better able to prove what the formula will do.
i took a dose of the formula, and in a few minutes...
i began to behave exactly like a college boy... with 20/20 vision and no bursitis.
i want you to observe and make notes of everything i do.
knowing me so well, you'll be able to interpret... the exact meaning of my behavior pattern.
i tried to tell you out on the porch, but you wouldn't...
you know the reason very well, and don't pretend that you don't.
are you angry at me because of what i did last night?
edwina, now, i thought this over very carefully... and i've almost come to a conclusion.
how do i know there isn't some buried resentment... that you don't consciously realize?
well, i certainly don't consciously realize... and i think that's pretty rotten of you to say that.
you all know why you're here... to negotiate with dr. fulton for his formula.
as far as money goes, i say all out, and hang the expense.
- dr. linten, dr. fulton's assistant... brought me a dose of the formula, and i took it.
i can't tell you with what eagerness i awaited the results... but there were none.
now, there must be another ingredient... that he knows nothing about.
dr. fulton has made no record of it... and there's nothing in his notes to tell us what it is.
imagine, the secret of youth, locked up in the head of a monkey.
do you think they'll ever find out how to make it?
i was gonna bring the wife and kiddies... but the grocer couldn't spare another barrel.
i was gonna bring my grandfather, but there's no room for his beard.

i'm after joe helton, i tell you, and he can't get away from me on this boat.

ordinary people are correct... those living in obedience and who like living like that.
now, the extraordinary are those who create something new... all those who break the old laws, the destroyers.
i'm gonna do a history lesson about the internal combustion engine.
it's interesting because most people don't know it was developed in a little village in france.
i thought about what i was gonna buy with your allowance.
i want to hear all about the class when we get back from the movies, ok?
we're gonna be doing a little repair work on the burnett family bathroom.
to get the ball rolling we have our friend and master plumber,
nothing says "i love you" like a piece of steel right through the nostril.
i wanted to get a nose ring, but brett here thinks it's gross.
i figured i'd spend the rest of my life driving my van, listening to in-a-gadda-da-vida on an 8-track.
i guess it's not so bad to be 40 instead of 20.
we just have to worry about staying awake on new year's eve.
so, how was it, being married to a college kid for a couple of weeks?
their captain considers his crew, an all-vulcan crew, by the way, to be the finest in the fleet.
i think the people at this table comprise the finest crew in the quadrant.
"fly: the term for a batted ball while it is in the air."
right. "...fewer than two out, the batter hits a high fly,
i want a real person, not a collection of photons and magnetic fields.
i also want a person who can be completely impartial, and i can't think of anyone i trust more.
well, to make a long story short, i decided the best way to prove that humans were the equal of vulcans was to challenge him to a wrestling match.
i wanted to wipe that arrogant look off his face, so i challenged him.
he calls it an adolescent rivalry, but solok keeps it going.
now he's trying to beat the captain at his own game.

one weekend i was with friends at an off-campus bar, the launching pad, and solok came in with some vulcan cadets.
he said they were doing research on illogical human bonding rituals.
i decided the best way to prove that humans were the equal of vulcans was to challenge him to a wrestling match.
i wanted to wipe that arrogant look off his face, so i challenged him.
solok's written over a dozen papers on vulcan/human comparative profiles, and in the beginning of every paper, is an analysis of that damned wrestling match!
now he comes to your station and says he's put together a baseball team.
he calls it an adolescent rivalry, but solok keeps it going.
now he's trying to beat the captain at his own game.
as you probably know, the starship t'kumbra is docked at our station.
their captain considers his crew, an all-vulcan crew, by the way, to be the finest in the fleet.
"... and fewer than two outs, the batter hits a high fly... "
"fly: the term for a batted ball while it is in the air. "
it's a difficult game, even for seasoned professionals who spent their lifetime practising.
we have less than two weeks to build a team and face the opponent.
jake, i don't care how hard and long these two weeks are.
i am not going to lose to solok in a baseball game.

so there i am... drunk, and debating logic versus emotion with a smug and sober vulcan.
well, to make a long story short, i decided the best way to prove that humans were the equal of vulcans was to challenge him to a wrestling match.
i ended up in the infirmary with a separated shoulder, two cracked ribs and a very bruised ego.
oh, ben. i don't mean to laugh, but...what did you expect?

that planet is screaming out in distress... from the pain of having its body and soul gouged out by a meteor.
from the pain and shock of a sudden and violent form of evolution... that was forced upon it.
after the earth was severely devastated by the meteor's impact... there suddenly appeared a military regime, the trader force.
the trader force quickly subjugated the entire world... before it could fully recover from the impact of the meteor.
the professor is attempting to make this the center for... devising retaliatory measures against the trader force.
but, i must admit that i haven't devised anything yet... to counteract their military dominance.
i never intended to involve a young boy like you in our fight...
but, it seems as if this "center" will be needing your assistance.
i am restricted in what i can accomplish on this planet.
i can only be a guide... to lead the new human race towards their rightful existence.
in both cases, an inner strength... unknown to both individuals was activated.
but i'd like more case-studies of such a phenomenon to review.
with the exception of you two, there should be no other survivors.
then, these kids acquired this unique power... as a result of that meteor blast?
if there were no survivors, then what's the purpose of coming here?
the other day, our sensors detected emissions... from a living being somewhere inside here.
the meteor that struck the earth, long ago, had grazed off my planet.
it changed its course and headed for an impact with your earth.
their objective is the total obliteration of the earth... and to annihilate the next step in mankind's evolution.
the meteor changed it's course and headed for an impact with earth.
but in my efforts, it became necessary to utilize the strength... of the trader force.
however, i believe that with the cooperation of earth people... stability will be restored more peacefully.
you cannot hurt me, for i am a spiritual living substance.
fouton, you are the distorted will of the solar system... who is attempting to twist the evolution of earth!
i think she will be unconscious for a while, due to the shock.
let's get out of this fortress... before fouton can call up her reinforcements.
one of the effects of dna sights... is to alter the time axis of dna memory... so one can manipulate memories from the past, present and future.
it's a process that allows people born on our planet... and propel themselves into outer space.
so then, daiba's super human powers are dna memories from the future.
but wasn't it the restoration of memories from the distant past?
wasn't it customary in the past that children leave home... when they become a burden on their parents?
parents don't wish death upon their children... no matter what kind of children they are!
but to depart into outer space is not a simple matter.
oh, for a cat, you sure do worry a lot, don't you?
like you said, if that is to be my fate, then i will accept it.
i wish to share my fate together with my newly acquired friends.
regardless of how it may have been beneficial for daiba and his friends... how is it going to affect us from here on?
it doesn't matter, if research is needed to regenerate the earth... it can be carried out without a research center... as long as i posses a brain.
daiba and his friends have set out for the outer reaches of space.
mankind's evolution and mankind's history... is now entering a new stage.
that planet is screaming out in distress... from the pain of having its body and soul gouged out by a meteor.

direct all squadrons to converge immediately in the air-space... over nerima-ward in tokyo.
when the meteor bounced off our planet and altered its course... it picked up a certain substance that's only on our planet.
it's a process that allows people born on our planet... and propel themselves into outer space.
so then, daiba's super human powers are dna memories from the future.
but wasn't it the restoration of memories from the distant past?
mello, if the meteor was an unintentional accident... then we are a species that should not yet exist here on earth?
parents don't wish death upon their children... no matter what kind of children they are!
but to depart into outer space is not a simple matter.
i wish to share my fate together with my newly acquired friends.
that is the only way i can repay earth for my planet's sins...
it doesn't matter, if research is needed to regenerate the earth... it can be carried out without a research center... as long as i posses a brain.
okay then, but don't let that mighty brain of yours... get so soaked in alcohol that it becomes useless.
daiba and his friends have set out for the outer reaches of space.
mankind's evolution and mankind's history... is now entering a new stage.
in three months, no customer has filed a single complaint against you.
you haven't spilled a drink, mixed up a food order or short-changed a bill.
we all face banishment from ferengi society and he wants to play "tongo?"
he wants to play "tongo." l want to have a snack.
either you've been inhaling too much beetle snuff or you're the greatest visionary ever to sit atop the tower of commerce.
why don't you and i have dinner tonight and figure it out?
and once they start earning latinum, they're going to want to spend it.
which means ferenginar will be expanding its workforce and its consumer base at the same time.
where the rivers run with muck and the streets are full of happy females.
and where, if all goes according to plan, the fca commissioners will once again proclaim me grand nagus.
if ferengi females can wear clothes in public then they can leave their homes.
if they can leave their homes, they can go to work.
oh, either you've been inhaling too much beetle snuff or you're the greatest visionary ever to sit atop the tower of commerce.
well, uh, why don't you and i have dinner tonight and try to figure it out?
giving females the right to wear clothing allows them to... have pockets.
once they have pockets they're going to want to fill them with latinum.
we just wanted to say good-bye before we go back to ferenginar.
where the rivers run with muck and the streets are swarming with happy females.
and where, if all goes according to plan the fca commissioners will once again proclaim me grand nagus.
that would be nice, but brunt's going to fight you at every turn.
in three months, no customer has filed a single complaint against you.
you haven't spilled a drink, mixed up a food order or shortchanged a bill.
how many times have i told you not to mention moogie when i'm... working?
sorry but i tried contacting her this morning and i couldn't get through.
maybe not at first, but she'll win them over using her vast financial knowledge and her keen instinct for profit.
she'll prove once and for all that allowing females to wear clothing is the first step toward a healthier and more prosperous ferengi economy.
one day you're the grand nagus of the ferengi alliance, and the next you're nothing but a common barroom brawler.
you see what happens when you put your faith in a female?

only when you let go of the past, you have a chance of victory.
and the only way to free yourself ... is to ierþi.
two of us have hidden in a cargo ship and we went to their planet.
we avoid being capturaþi until i discovered one of their portals.
angry with my people, because they were so proºti to be fool.
hooray for gua, because they attacked us, even if it is in their nature.
we have to stop the infiltration of alien or be finished.
they suggest that our object is very intelligent, good analyst and at the same time extremely unsociable guy.
the things that have happened to me then, influenced my life.
one of these things could be your ex-girlfriend, eddie is not it?
if so, what began as a burst of speed, was completed limped into idiocy.
a terrible personal event, which transformed my school years, i was haunted to this day.
the bus was full of crazy talented who sang "99 bottles of beer on the wall"
and suddenly the place behind the bus, mimi vandenberg raised blouse and stunned the entire class.
suddenly the door opened and rushed a bunch of federal agents.
i did not know if it was a mistake hacker language.
he made us "bandits binary" taught us everything we know about hacking.
it was so loyal that when he was arrested, said nothing about us.
four days ago you've discovered a new star near ursa minor.
i thought for some reason that the light forebodes something, and felt anxious.
midway through the 20th century, two superpowers prepared for a conflict which might have ended life on the planet.
spring flowers the warm light of day... the pleasures of life.
this was the shelter for members of the united states congress in the event of nuclear war.
down here, the politicians would represent the dead and the dying in the world overhead.
for a handful of human beings, there was all they needed to wait out the nuclear winter.
but nerves might snap, then order would be kept by force.
but as a senator for the past ten years, as chairman of one of the most important
congressional committees of the war he was well aware of the major problems that a president had to face."
stalin's soviet union was revealed as a police state, not a workers' paradise.
but even in america, thousands stayed loyal to the communist dream.
in the 1930s, moscow called for a popular front of the left against hitler and fascism.
fighting the spread of fascism became the great cause for socialist and communist alike.
"despite what happens in continents overseas, the united states of america shall and must remain, as long ago the father of our country prayed that it would remain, unentangled and free!"
britain's prime minister, neville chamberlain, trusted that hitler would listen to reason.
it has allied itself with another dictatorship and it has invaded a neighbour so infinitesimally small
that it could do no conceivable possible harm to the soviet union."
he said, "but oughtn't we to be thinking about how we win the war?"
"no, no", said stalin, "i would like to have this clear at the very beginning".
"the russians have thus far lost in the common cause at least fifty per cent more men - killed wounded and missing - than all the rest of the european allies put together.
and moreover, they have killed, wounded and captured at least twenty times as many germans as the rest of the allies."
germany announced - truthfully, as it turned out - that the officers had been murdered by soviet security troops in 1940.
britain and america chose to ignore this evidence of stalin's methods.
"stalin told me that the task he was putting to our group, and particularly to me, was ethically very unattractive.
however, the position of the ussr was so serious that he had to know what our allies were thinking."
and they both had this idea that if you treated him the right way ...
the phrase was 'if you treat uncle joe like a member of our club, perhaps one day he will behave like a member of our club.'"
"every day at eight in the morning, i had to go to stalin.
i went with all the transcripts, in russian and in english.
the soviet flag unfurled in triumph over sarni, tarnapol, odessa, as the russian tide of victory rolls westwards towards germany.
as the red army approached warsaw, the polish resistance seized the city from the germans.
- us embassy moscow "the polish freedom fighters were abandoned by the russians, who were sitting with their forces across the river, and could easily have gone in to help them.
i thought for various reasons that that was the point at which american policy should have changed."
even when mr winston churchill said once, you know, sort of,
'oh i wish i had a lemon with my gin and tonic'
his polio and the strains of war leadership dragged him down.
in the former tsar's palace, the leaders faced a heavy agenda.
he's just sort of smoking - he was a chain smoker - and he was sort of smoking, and you think that probably he's not listening, you know.
then all of a sudden he would raise his fingers and say 'ah'.
- british foreign office "for us, of course, the major topic was the future of eastern europe and above all, poland.
and on that stalin obviously was bound to get what he wanted because the red army was in occupation of the whole area including poland, they had already gone through poland into germany by the time we were in yalta."
by now, the balkans and most of poland were in soviet hands;
so too was much of czechoslovakia and hungary battlefield facts that diplomacy could not alter.
i mean that there would be a coalition government in poland including people from the west, and there would be free elections in poland.
and then there was a declaration covering the whole of eastern europe called the declaration on liberated europe, which again was to be rebuilt on the basis of democracy and free elections and all the rest of it of course,
at villages, crossroads, way stations, the people who were so close to his heart stand silently, expressive of the devotion franklin roosevelt inspired."
as the president was buried, the last battles in europe were ending.
- us 69th infantry division "they were glad to see the american troops because they had a terrible fear of having russians occupy or come into their area."
as the allies advanced they discovered the full horror of german crimes.
well, none of us were too eager to go on that patrol really, because we realised the end of the war was imminent and we didn't know what was out there.
you know, we had gotten this far, why stick our necks out again?"
the moment of history, the meeting of ordinary soldiers from russia and america, was re-run, dramatically, with a bigger cast.
by allied agreement, the capture of berlin was left to the russians.
the war cost the soviet union 27 million lives nearly 40 times american and british losses put together.
the red flag destined to fly over the reichstag was a home made affair.
the first photograph i took was of the flag i'd brought from moscow the soviet flag over berlin."
as hitler's reich fell apart, hundreds gathered in san francisco to found the united nations organisation.
as the san francisco meeting continued, news came of germany's surrender.
us president harry truman, may 1945 "general eisenhower informs me that the forces of germany have surrendered to the united nations.
peace treaty or on how to carry out agreements reached at yalta.
stalin confirmed that his troops were ready for war with japan.
- aide to president truman "there was some question amongst the americans as to whether stalin had really understood what truman was saying.
as we now know, they knew all about the manhattan project through espionage and their own agents."
on august the 2nd the conference ended and the statesmen went home.
four days later, america dropped an atomic bomb on the city and people of hiroshima.
at each cold war crisis to come, the nuclear shadow threatened.
...and since i was the only crew member who could survive the corrosive atmosphere, it was up to me to retrieve the data module and save the day.
harry, you and i were lucky enough to enjoy the doctor's scintillating exhibition for two full hours.
would it really be fair of us to deny our friends the same unforgettable experience?
i'm betting that message we received was some sort of distress call and if we're going to help, i'd rather do it on voyager.
the physiology is so unusual the tricorder can't make heads or tails of it.
the interfaces on the alien's vessel can only be activated chemically.
i'm guessing that this life-form somehow interfaces directly with the ship's systems using biochemical secretions to give commands.
i can't remove it surgically, not without doing irreparable harm to b'elanna's internal organs.
can we get a lock on the creature-- transport it off?
oh, well... i've got a patient with a rather unusual problem.
she's become fused with a nonhumanoid life-form i know nothing about.
but if it needs her to survive, it's not about to let go without a fight.
i'd like to think that's a fight you and i can win.
would it be easier if we reduced the hologram's memory load?
maybe, but i don't want to do that unless we absolutely have to.
i'll skip the introductions if it's all the same to you.
suit yourself, but you should know i plan on asking the captain to keep him on as a permanent consultant.
i remember some of the maquis under my command talking about an infamous cardassian doctor.
could these simply have been rumors spread by bajorans who hated the cardassians?
every trace of that man's research should be deleted from the database.
i had a bad feeling about that hologram the second i saw him.
four days after he received the virus samples, there was a minor outbreak of fostossa in the vicinity of his hospital.
prior to that date, there had not been a single case in the entire province.
the borg are accused of assimilating information with no regard for life.
this cardassian did the same and yet, his behavior is tolerated.
your program, despite all its brilliance, is based on his work.
he infected patients, exposed them to polytrinic acid, mutilated their living bodies and now we're reaping the benefits of those experiments.
your kind of barbarism ended a long time ago or, at least, it should have.
what difference does it make how long ago the research occurred?
what matters is that we can use it to help patients today.
now, are you going to delete my program and all of the research it contains, or are we going to use it to save b'elanna's life?
as long as we're willing to benefit from his research, we're no better than he is.
if i had weeks, or even days, maybe i could come up with an alternative, but time is of the essence and moset's idea will work.
but when it comes down to it, the only issue i'm concerned about is the well-being of that crew member lying in sick bay.
we'll wrestle with the morality of this situation later-- after b'elanna is back on her feet.
both patients are thriving and we advanced the frontiers of medical science.
i've already outlined a paper that you and i will one day present to the federation medical academy:

my god, i think that's the first time you've used the words
"will" and "share" in the same sentence without "doesn't know how to" in-between.
this is about being late to meet harlin, because you're wasting my time.
it is about being galled at your level of presumptuousness, and finally, ladies and ladies of the jury, this is about my total frustration over helping someone get a job whose main requirement is cute guys in the mailroom!
and if you're having a problem with the bathroom, you should just say it now.
let me say this then, from now on, all pillows and food need to be cleared through me!
i mean, he's not funny, he doesn't know what your favorite flower is, he's passive-aggressive, the man high-five's you after sex, grace.
you're so afraid you're never going to get married, you can't even see how wrong he is for you.
you come, and you poison with the... the thorns from the-- the flower...
you know, i had this metaphor worked out earlier, but i'm just very upset right now.
this morning, on the way to the ceremony, danny looked at me and said,
"i can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you," and i turned to him and said...
sweetie, remember in college, we saw that french film about a man and a woman that were perfect for one another, but they kept missing each other, and in the last scene, they meet on a plane, because that's the way it was destined to be, remember?
and you said, "that's going to be me." gracie, you're just in the middle of your movie.
this scientific assignment is a welcome change from months of combat duty against the dominion.
three of my officers are taking a runabout into the anomaly's vortex.
the data collected here could provide starfleet with the key to creating transwarp corridors through space.
it could give us a substantial tactical advantage over the dominion.
well, believe it or not you're about a meter tall and shrinking fast.
in a few minutes you're going to be half the size of a combadge.
i'm not going to leave them in there if i can help it.
mr. worf, go down to auxiliary control and target the phasers manually.
well, the good news is we're alive, so we must have escaped the anomaly.
the bad news is the external sensors and the com system are down.
we will have impulse power back on line in 30 minutes but it will take several hours to restore warp capability.
it must be gratifying for an elder to end his career with a victory.
first of all, we don't know what happened to the rubicon.
for all we know, they got out of the anomaly on their own.
it took us a week just to learn how to pilot one of their ships.
we might have a chance to retake the defiant but we can't do anything unless we can get out of this room.
the impulse engine sustained only minor damage in our attack but the warp drive was severely damaged.
i will need your technical expertise in order to repair it.
giving him access to the engine room will only give him an opportunity to retake the ship.
in fact, he's working on a plan at this very moment.
your choice is to repair the warp drive or watch me execute your crew one at a time.
have sixth duran'adar select one of the prisoners for execution and bring him to the bridge.
i won't be baited by a prisoner... and neither should you.
okay, i'm in no hurry to reach a dominion prison camp.
we have restored impulse power and the warp drive will be operational in five hours.
excellent. it's good to see my faith in you has not been misplaced.
it means this entire conduit is about to be filled with superheated plasma.
when you say "superheated"... lf l can't find another way out of here we'll be vaporized.
he's trying to override the bridge control lockout so he can release the command codes.
if he can do that the captain can control the entire ship from the operations console.
and i have to say, i'm not fond of the idea.
i can think of a thousand ways a one-centimeter man could get fried walking around inside a circuit housing.
there's a four-way shunt at the base of a 58966 stroke delta isolinear chip... which is where?
the only four-way shunt near a 66/delta is at the base... of the master differential relay.
all the defiant's command functions have been transferred to engineering... but nothing's happening.
well, maybe the captain doesn't realize he has control of the ship yet.
i'm flooding all the compartments except the engine room with anesthezine gas.
major, get that virus out of the computer before someone on the bridge engages the warp drive.
the defiant is investigating a rare subspace compression recently found in federation space.
this assignment is a welcome change from combat duty against the dominion.
the good news is we're alive, so we escaped the anomaly.
the bad news is external sensors and the com system are down.
the bridge officers are in the mess hall, other survivors in the cargo bay.
we will have impulse power soon but it will take hours to restore warp capability.
it must be gratifying for an elder to end his career with victory.
i feel privileged to be here with you at such a moment.
i am first kudak'etan. ln a strange way, you are the reason i exist.
if you had not eliminated our fleet in the wormhole, there would be no need to breed alpha quadrant jem'hadar.

nog's smart, but it will take him weeks to release the codes from here.
the defiant has been ordered to investigate a rare subspace compression phenomenon recently discovered in federation space.
this scientific assignment is a welcome change from months of combat duty against the dominion.
three of my officers are taking a runabout into the anomaly's vortex.
the runabout and its crew will be subjected to sever spatial distortion, so we have activated a tractor beam to minimize the effect.
we're a sitting duck as long as we're tethered to the runabout.
i'm not going to leave them in there if i can help it.

if they did, they're headed home and in much better shape than we are.
i will need your technical expertise in order to repair it.
bring captain sisko to the engine room so he may begin necessary repairs.
i know what he's thinking because it's exactly what i would be doing in his position.
you should kill him now before he has a chance to put his plan into motion.
okay, i'm in no hurry to reach a dominion prison camp.
if you want me to teach your men how to repair a warp drive, that's fine with me.
the captain's trying to take control of the ship from engineering.
kira is the only one actually working on the warp drive but it doesn't look like she's in any hurry to get it done.
if he can do that the captain can control the entire ship from the operations console.
nog's a smart kid, but it's going to take him weeks to release the codes from here.
go to the plasma relay and power it up-- but slowly, just like i showed you.
i'm about ten minutes away from initiating the prestart sequence in the warp drive.
and i have to say, i'm not fond of the idea.
i can think of a thousand ways a one-centimeter man could get fried walking around inside a circuit housing.

well, maybe the captain doesn't realize he has control of the ship yet.
before we activate the warp drive we should check the entire system for possible sabotage.
that would take hours-- every minute we spend in federation space exposes us to detection and attack and i would hate for your last mission to end in failure, elder.
after completing repairs we were able to return to the anomaly and successfully restore our runabout and its crew to their normal size.
the surviving jem'hadar have been transferred to a federation p.o.w. camp.
and i want you to tell me of what they remind you.
doc, you got entirely too much free time on your hands.
as long as nobody does nothing stupid like have sex or go
looking for somebody in the dark alone, we should be all right.
years ago, when i first came into his employ he was contracted to find a man.
i can't give much detail but believe me, if this man had not been located our country's good diplomacy with a certain economic superpower might have a different face today.
on the 8th morning, a non-political third party contacted me with an unrelated private agenda.
my employer had never heard of this missing man, knew nothing about him.
you could meet him 5 times and not realize it's the same person.
he can tell you where you were born, how old your mother was at the time and what you had for breakfast, all within 30 seconds of meeting you.
he has a deeply nuanced and functional understanding of human behavior to rival the great psychoanalytical minds of our time.
he understands the criminal mind as well as the innocent mind the stable mind as well as the psychotic, sociopathic mind the male as well as the female.
when private investigation won its most worthy champion academia and the arts suffered a loss, a great loss.
in addition to his many scholarly gifts, he's a terrifically talented musician.
i left the firm, didn't know what i was going to do and i get this message on my machine.
he'd watched me argue a case in court said i was the only person for the job.
his old man, jordan had a big tax evasion suit against him in '82.
he was legally exonerated but karmically convicted because he died right after.
so whatever he's hiding, he keeps it in a safe deposit box.
but then he keeps the key to the box cleverly hidden on his key ring with his car keys and his house keys?
and while it comes at some cost this supreme objectivity is what makes me i dare say, the greatest observer the world has ever known.
observing a subject, particularly a client in his or her own element is usually very telling.
if he'd suspected me he would have remembered my name, which he didn't.
also, like most ivy league graduates, he drops his alma mater with almost no prompting whatsoever.
i'll meet you at the motel tonight when you get back.
instead of calling me, you had me fly up here to tell me to go back to the computer and then fly back again tonight?
transfer cash into bag replace in tank walk outside and trip the nearest fire alarm then leave immediately.
you have 3 minutes to get out of the building from the time you enter.
people know they're being followed when they turn and see someone following them.
they can't tell they're being followed if you get there first.
because anyone can find the crumbs the wheres, whats and whos.
the art is in the whys the ability to read between the crumbs not to mix metaphors.
i could see that your hair had been wet, but dried naturally.
but i smelled iodine, so you hadn't gone home to bathe or scrub down since your last shift.
did you see that poem that stark wrote in college, "an ode to clarissa?"
worst i've read since the case of the shrinking gypsy stripper's scribblings.
if ever a name deserved, begged to be in a poem, it's clarissa.
anyway, i did that phone book-database cross-reference thing you asked for and there are 1800 men in oregon with the initials 'k.v.'
is there any way i can get you to look over my tax returns?
you can speak 6 languages and fly a jetliner but you don't know how to file a tax return?
they pick him up, try him, give him life, no parole.
they think he works for someone but he won't talk even when they offer him a deal.
she's watched her father's life drip away and she's getting even.
she has something, some evidence or something that ties stark to the murder.
which means that that bed then was longer than this bed now.
so sometime in the last 30 years, somebody must have replaced the bed.
she must've been facing him, probably standing close to where you are now.
right away, before she could scream, she's down she's dead, it's over.
the only question is, once she was dead why didn't he get out of there?
instead he proceeds to touch the dresser, the sink the doorknob and the nightstand.
he then gave me a key to a safe deposit box.
said at the end of 25 years when kragen got out or if he should die i would be given the location of the box.
in the meantime i'm to hang onto this key with no lock and our friend would hang onto his lock with no key.
what would you do if someone was threatening you like that or blackmailing you like this?
i can't do it to myself and i'm sick and tired of working for the starks of the world the lowest scum of the earth, buying their way out of their own messes.
these people are victims of plots and they need our help.
so when my number's up, whether i'm walking down the street or doing something else that will be that.
and until then, i'm just going to do what i need to do.
at this point, you will receive a final message on the pager.
get on the corresponding bus and take it to the end of the line.
but he doesn't realize that you, less than a year old, are in the room.
he doesn't see you at first, because you're in a crawl space she's made for you by pulling the corner of the bed closer to the wall.
he'd rather risk life in prison than leave you in that room.
to protect you from stark, he gets rid of all the evidence.
he leaves the body, takes the baby and hauls ass out of there because he knows he's got to get you to his sister.
you grow up thinking vincent is your father and you're being raised by your aunt and uncle.
the case of the man who got so stressed-out over his lost keys that he eventually had a heart attack and it turned out they were in the sofa all along. "
i returned the first installment of my fee as i had not given a complete explanation.
some questions are for answering others are better left to torture and torment for all eternity.
a nagging itch for the rest of his life seemed reasonable, especially since i did solve his problem.
he thanked me and suggested that i not hold my breath.
i also attended the funeral of the hit man who died not long after these events described above.
let me tell you about the case of the man with the mismatched shoelaces.
years ago, when i first came into his employ he was contracted to find a man.
i can't give much detail but believe me, if this man had not been located our country's good diplomacy with a certain economic superpower might have a different face today.
federal, state, local authorities all over the world searched for a face whose significance they couldn't fathom.
my employer had never heard of this missing man, knew nothing about him.
after just one hour of desk work just an hour after accepting the case he picked up the telephone and placed a call.
he can tell you where you were born, how old your mother was at the time and what you had for breakfast, all within 30 seconds of meeting you.
he can get a criminal to confess without his realizing he's being questioned.
i'll get on the plane to portland at 11:15 tonight arriving portland at 1:32 am.
you'll give me the details on the way to the airport tonight.
it sounds like some sort of financial record, but he didn't want to tell me.
so whatever he's hiding, he keeps it in a safe deposit box.
and while it comes at some cost this supreme objectivity is what makes me i dare say, the greatest observer the world has ever known.
observing a subject, particularly a client in his or her own element is usually very telling.
he'd sooner lie to a complete stranger than to admit to being 3 levels below my guess.
as soon as i talk to him, he runs the other way.
he obviously didn't think to connect me to the blackmail business at all.
if he'd suspected me he would have remembered my name, which he didn't.
go to the toilet stall furthest from the door lock yourself in in tank of toilet, find plastic bag.
transfer cash into bag replace in tank walk outside and trip the nearest fire alarm then leave immediately.
you have 3 minutes to get out of the building from the time you enter.
you are not to be accompanied you are not to be followed.
that's a very specific scent that's unique largely to ambulances and hospitals.
i could see that your hair had been wet, but dried naturally.
but i smelled iodine, so you hadn't gone home to bathe or scrub down since your last shift.
then i assumed you worked the night before, when it rained.
i went back to l.a. and got that stuff that you sent me to get but since you then went back to l.a. yourself you probably don't need it anymore.
did you see that poem that stark wrote in college, "an ode to clarissa?"
also how do you write a poem about clarissa and never have the name in the poem?
if ever a name deserved, begged to be in a poem, it's clarissa.
anyway, i did that phone book-database cross-reference thing you asked for and there are 1800 men in oregon with the initials 'k.v.'
and about a million in the united states that are listed.
when you look for something specific your chances of finding it are very bad because of all things in the world, you only want one of them.
when you look for anything at all your chances of finding it are very good because of all the things in the world you're sure to find some of them.
mr. stark apparently doesn't want me to know about kragen vincent.
so we'll have to figure out who he is and where.
all you have to do is look around see how all the ordinary people are behaving and try to behave like one of them.
you know, when i was in l.a it seemed like such a lonely town.
they think he works for someone but he won't talk even when they offer him a deal.
and clarissa has quite an arrest record for a young girl.
she has something, some evidence or something that ties stark to the murder.
i got to figure out what it is and where she's keeping it.
right away, before she could scream, she's down she's dead, it's over.
the only question is, once she was dead why didn't he get out of there?
in 1972, it was against code to have a hotel bed 2 feet from a door that opens inwards 7 feet from a fish tank or a lava lamp or 3 feet from a radiant heater.
imagine if you will, a bed longer than this one and a heater over here.
she let me walk her home and she kissed me for the first and only time.
you can skip right to the part where you decide to kill her.
then he played me a copy of this tape and said if i refused he would turn the tape over to the police.
he then gave me a key to a safe deposit box.
said at the end of 25 years when kragen got out or if he should die i would be given the location of the box.
in the meantime i'm to hang onto this key with no lock and our friend would hang onto his lock with no key.
so the cost has no ceiling and the fear has no end.
that's why some knowledge, some information is like a terminal disease.
it's passion that moves the criminal to act that disrupts the static inertia of morality.
the client's passion for this dead woman had facilitated his downfall.
he doesn't see you at first, because you're in a crawl space she's made for you by pulling the corner of the bed closer to the wall.
and even with the silencer on the gun, and it all happening so quickly you start crying.
to protect you from stark, he gets rid of all the evidence.
diapers, diaper bag bottles, blankets something on the dresser, something in the sink something hanging off a doorknob something on the nightstand.
i returned the first installment of my fee as i had not given a complete explanation.
some questions are for answering others are better left to torture and torment for all eternity.
a nagging itch for the rest of his life seemed reasonable, especially since i did solve his problem.
he got the tape he'd been waiting for for so long.
this did, in fact, prove to be my final work experience with my longtime associate though i have assured him that when he someday finds that he cannot live without me his position will again be available to him.
he thanked me and suggested that i not hold my breath.
i also attended the funeral of the hit man who died not long after these events described above.
for some reason, i felt a certain kinship with this man whose life was forever changed after he failed to remain objective about the lady blackmailer.
and though i never would have have anticipated it in the end she did for me what i have done for so many.
helped solve a problem, first by observation then by careful intervention.
let me tell you about the case of the man with the mismatched shoelaces.

but then he keeps the key to the box cleverly hidden on his key ring with his car keys and his house keys?
observing a subject, particularly a client in his or her own element is usually very telling.
behavior is always more revealing than language if you know what to look for.
he'd sooner lie to a complete stranger than to admit to being 3 levels below my guess.

on the 8th morning, a non-political third party contacted me with an unrelated private agenda.
my employer had never heard of this missing man, knew nothing about him.
you could meet him 5 times and not realize it's the same person.
he can tell you where you were born, how old your mother was at the time and what you had for breakfast, all within 30 seconds of meeting you.
he has a deeply nuanced and functional understanding of human behavior to rival the great psychoanalytical minds of our time.
he understands the criminal mind as well as the innocent mind the stable mind as well as the psychotic, sociopathic mind the male as well as the female.
when private investigation won its most worthy champion academia and the arts suffered a loss, a great loss.
in addition to his many scholarly gifts, he's a terrifically talented musician.
i left the firm, didn't know what i was going to do and i get this message on my machine.
he'd watched me argue a case in court said i was the only person for the job.
his old man, jordan had a big tax evasion suit against him in '82.
he was legally exonerated but karmically convicted because he died right after.
it sounds like some sort of financial record, but he didn't want to tell me.
so whatever he's hiding, he keeps it in a safe deposit box.
and while it comes at some cost this supreme objectivity is what makes me i dare say, the greatest observer the world has ever known.
observing a subject, particularly a client in his or her own element is usually very telling.
if he'd suspected me he would have remembered my name, which he didn't.
also, like most ivy league graduates, he drops his alma mater with almost no prompting whatsoever.
i'll meet you at the motel tonight when you get back.
instead of calling me, you had me fly up here to tell me to go back to the computer and then fly back again tonight?
transfer cash into bag replace in tank walk outside and trip the nearest fire alarm then leave immediately.
you have 3 minutes to get out of the building from the time you enter.
people know they're being followed when they turn and see someone following them.
they can't tell they're being followed if you get there first.
because anyone can find the crumbs the wheres, whats and whos.
the art is in the whys the ability to read between the crumbs not to mix metaphors.
i could see that your hair had been wet, but dried naturally.
but i smelled iodine, so you hadn't gone home to bathe or scrub down since your last shift.
did you see that poem that stark wrote in college, "an ode to clarissa?"
worst i've read since the case of the shrinking gypsy stripper's scribblings.
if ever a name deserved, begged to be in a poem, it's clarissa.
anyway, i did that phone book-database cross-reference thing you asked for and there are 1800 men in oregon with the initials 'k.v.'
is there any way i can get you to look over my tax returns?
you can speak 6 languages and fly a jetliner but you don't know how to file a tax return?
they pick him up, try him, give him life, no parole.
they think he works for someone but he won't talk even when they offer him a deal.
she's watched her father's life drip away and she's getting even.
she has something, some evidence or something that ties stark to the murder.
which means that that bed then was longer than this bed now.
so sometime in the last 30 years, somebody must have replaced the bed.
she must've been facing him, probably standing close to where you are now.
right away, before she could scream, she's down she's dead, it's over.
the only question is, once she was dead why didn't he get out of there?
instead he proceeds to touch the dresser, the sink the doorknob and the nightstand.
he then gave me a key to a safe deposit box.
said at the end of 25 years when kragen got out or if he should die i would be given the location of the box.
in the meantime i'm to hang onto this key with no lock and our friend would hang onto his lock with no key.
what would you do if someone was threatening you like that or blackmailing you like this?

well, mostly that my salary isn't even covering my legal bills.
you know, niles, if this siege is going to continue, you may have to tighten your belt a bit.
but if you're gonna be economizing, perhaps you'll have to forgo the decorative antique pens.

she'd rather save a man than be with god, i think.

1900 and a lot of things arme.e year is especially the technology.
as long as there's a block of ice in there with it.
although some prosperous houses nearby are electrified the light here comes from gas and kerosene lamps.
rich folks have running water and toilets and use an outhouse in the back.
to take a bath, you have to pump enough water by hand and then heat it on a coal- or wood-burning stove.
it's a big job, so members of the family take turns in the tub on saturday night.
there's no telephone to get the latest news but there is one at the general store along with the daily paper full of incredible stories about new inventions.
one of the most exciting technologies at the turn of the century is the airplane.
orville and wilbur wright of dayton, ohio become the first to leave earth in this heavier-than-air machine in 1903 but not many people get to see it.
the brothers then work hard to improve their invention and the more successful they are the more secretive they become.
the new field of flight technology is already highly competitive and someone might copy their design.
out west, the first chance folks have to see an airplane is in 1910.
that's when an international air meet is held e up-and-coming city that's when an international of los angeles.d in th man:
the crowd is stunned, then stands and cheers as he makes a short turn around the countryside.
over the course of 11 days paulhan and curtiss compete fiercely for over $50,000 in prize money.
after all, the french have been experimenting with flight for more than a century.
it was naturally assumed that the first successful airplane would be built by a frenchman not two upstart americans like the wright brothers.
and they are stunned that they're flying for more than two hours.
and no one in europe is flying for any more than a few minutes or a alf an hour.
through a system of wires and pulleys the wings are warped, or bent in such a way that the aircraft can respond to air currents
despite the wrights' patents wing-warping is rapidly adopted by the french.
they didn't know what value this new thing, the airplane was going to have but they did know, if they were french that the germans were fiddling around with zeppelins and airplanes and so on over here.
'd better with zeppelins and airplanes keep up with what they're doing.
with the airplane he's found something even better for his boundless energy.
standing six feet four the handsome pilot is an ideal subject for hearst's cameras always flying with a cigar clenched firmly between his teeth.
on september 17, 1911, he takes off from a park in new york-- there's no such thing as an airport yet.
as he heads west, a special train will follow carrying his family, crew, spare parts and an ample supply of vin fiz.
rodgers finds his way across the state by following railroad tracks.
keeping his biplane under control requires brute strength and sharp reflexes but the first leg of the trip goes like a charm.
worse, the plane proves unstable on all but the calmest of days and the fields used for landings and takeoffs are filled with hazards.
but when the weather is good, and he's back in the air it's as if the mishaps never happened.
bells from fire stations call out crowds in every town he passes.
by the time rodgers reaches chicago o days remain by the time rodgers to finish the triponly tw e promises, "i mean to get there."
he's the first man to cross the continent by air even if it has taken him 49 days.
it's a victory of the spirit, widely celebrated a dramatic demonstration that an individual's competitive spirit can capture a nation's imagination and bring a new technology to the forefront.
if you look at europe before the first world war you have really sophisticated flight laboratories popping up in one country after another.
even in nations like russia, for example you have major sites where really important aerodynamic research is being conducted.
vulnerability from the air helps change the conduct of the war.
any forward advance can now be detected so most of the conflict is mired along 400 miles of trenches.
a german innovation takes the machine gun a crucial step further with a fixed-mount weapon synchronized to fire through the propeller.
the agile, one-man fighter develops into a distinct class of military aircraft.
by 1917, aerial bombardment leads to yet another class-- the heavy bomber.
german planes are the first to carry the war beyond the battlefield ondon.he first to carry the war beyond the battlefield there are few deaths, but it's a taste of things to come.
with the end of the war in 1918 there's no longer any compelling need for aircraft.
government contracts are canceled and american manufacturers are left almost where they started.
it may take years to bring aviation to the general public but there's no longer any question that those days will come.
when we think of technology we inevitably think of inventions like the airplane.
the birth of an invention like the automobile is only the beginning.
in the early years of the century to own a car like this 1908 packard, you need money to burn.
amed henry ford unless it becomes cheaper says he knows how to do it.n n
ford treats work like play and has an uncommon gift for attracting talented engineers.
he builds up a team which-- though largely self-taught like himself-- ranks among the finest automotive talent in detroit.
in an era when automobiles are handmade, expensive and difficult to repair they set out to design an inexpensive, reliable car.
they know that the secret to success is simplifying the technology-- creating a car that is easy to build and that the owner himself can maintain.
the cars of competitors need more than 8,000 parts but their car will have just 5,000.
they call the car the tin lizzie and make it part of the family.
there was one fellow by the name of tom ford and we used to go on picnics in chicago in the open model t.
demand is so high for the model t that ford can't build enough of them.
by 1912, the highland park plant is turning out 78,000 cars-- double the previous year-- and still the orders are flooding in.
we're now talking of volume of production that no one has ever thought of in history.
so if you're going to really turn out thousands and thousands of units you've got to now get very fine-grained the various subcomponents of a car-- how do you get them to where you want them, when you want them?
but henry ford and his men have already laid out their plant so that materials flow in a logical sequence of fabrication.
then in a brilliant stroke, they go one critical step further.
"no, not quite right," put it in the vise so it's called hand fitting and finishing.
it takes a revolution in the strength of cutting tools so that you've got knives to cut metal and they must be strong enough to not keep wearing out.
"just grab any one out of the box and it'll fit right on there the way it has to."
once you begin to have genuine interchangeable parts then the concept of flow changes.
parts are being made so fast that they overwhelm the final assembly of the car itself.
as an experiment, a moving line is set up here as well.
all told, chassis assembly time falls from 12 1/2 hours to under two.
between 1913 and 1914 production of the model t nearly doubles.
assembly-line technology will make possible the consumer society, with its huge number of products-- something we now take for granted.
but for the men on the line, productivity has its price.
the moving assembly line cuts you up and spits you out but people will put up with a lot if they're going to make double the money they were making before.
you read letters of immigrants going back to the various old countries in europe and they'll say, "this is very hard."
in america, there is this concept of freedom that you can reinvent yourself.
you don't have to live in the same town as your parents you don't have to live the same kind of life you don't have to do the job that they had.
i think the first step in making that a mass dream is the coming of an inexpensive car that can...
the car will go the furthest in reshaping the way we live.
that's when an american physicist generates a continuous wave signal which he then modulates with sound.
he tries it out on christmas eve along the massachusetts coast.
in the early years people assume that radio will be used as a wireless version of the telephone-- one-to-one communication between individuals.
it's an appealing idea to anyone living beneat-growing tangle of utility lines.
bes in their pockets as they left because there weren't any vacuum tubes available.
and when they got home after world war i they started building radio sets with vacuum tubes.
and so in 1920, on the roof of the westinghouse plant the company's station, kdka, goes on the air with one of the first radio broadcasts.
when the station announces election returns before they can be read in the papers, it causes a sensation.
go over and listen to music in his back porch to hear, "come on, let me try them, let me try them."
osgo and more compan ies set up their own stations as a good way to get free advertising.
they liked the feeling that they were in on the ground floor of this new technology.
the problem was how to fill up these hours so station managers would just pretty much take anyone who wandered in off the street and was willing to perform.
everybody in my childhood, like me and everybody spent a lot of time fussing with this little crystal radio.
and you tried to get the farthest distant station possible without regard to what the content of the programs was that you were listening to.
"it's okay to have our name in front of the public
"and to be cool but not if i'm going to lose big bucks."
another problem is that advertisers can only reach one small pocket of listeners at a time.
as a result, plans are made for a national system of broadcasting.
if a signal is sent out over telephone lines tations across the country ocal s the size of the audience increases dramatically.
to hold such a large audience, the programming has to improve which in turn should help to sell more radios.
as radio helps sell more and more mass-produced goods, like this refrigerator there are more new goods to sell thanks to another technological revolution.
this one has to do with materials-- what things are made of.
in 1930, before the revolution milk bottles are all made of glass.
you can see through them to tell just how pure the milk is but you do have to be careful when you put them down.
the tennis balls bounce just fine thanks to their malaysian rubber but malaysia is awfully far away.
in fact, this handkerchief is smooth and lightweight because it's made by silkworms in japan but in the 1930s, japan is getting less friendly each year.
all of these materials are natural but all of them are relatively expensive or hard to get.
then one day a chemist decides to find out just what gives these materials their desirable qualities.
the story of the first purely synthetic material begins in 1927, at the dupont chemical company in wilmington, delaware.
dupont has made a fortune transforming natural materials like wood into successful products like cellophane.
there was very little understanding of the fundamentals of what they were doing.
they only knew that things worked because they worked and stine had a real belief that if you tried to understand at a more fundamental level what was going on, what's the chemistry that's going on in these processes, that they would inevitably be able
the deal is clinched when stine assures carothers that he can pursue research of his own choosing.
carothers is assigned a first-rate staff and given the best equipment that money can buy.
julian hill waited for days and days until he thought the chemical reaction was completed.
and then, at the end of this period of time he broke open the apparatus carefully.
he had a warm mass of resin and he stuck into it a glass stirring rod...
then he pulled it out, and what he said was that... "i found i had a festoon of fibers."
bolton dealt with him very delicately but it does seem that for some reason in early 1934
bolton was able to convince carothers to go back and take another look at the fiber problem.
carothers' discovery was really the turning point in the synthetic-material revolution.
having done that, fiber, rubber and plastic became available to us by modifying the techniques that carothers first invented.
other polymer-based synthetics like plastic and synthetic rubber flow from the development of nylon.
with the tools of science applied to the needs of the marketplace a powerful new technology is created.
by the late 1930s, it's taken for granted that science and technology hold the key to a better life.
that belief is made concrete on a thousand acres of new york city marshland.
the wonders of science and technology will provide a world of comfort and plenty.
in the westinghouse pavilion, the crowd is amazed by a talking robot.
world war ii and the cold war after it create a life-and-death need for advanced technology.
jets, rockets, radar, computers, plastic were all developed in this new and more complex age.
competition is at a fever pitch among nations for military and political advantage among companies for more business and among universities for more research grants.
and to help fuel it all is the enormous wealth generated by the u.s. in the postwar e.
with europe and asia shattered by war and american production capacity expanded by the war the u.s. alone captures more than half of the world's gross national product.
by the 1950s there seems to be more than enough money to go around.
women who graduated from college in those days would probably not necessarily look back upon it as a time of equal opportunity.
but never had the wealth of a nation been shared by so many ordinary people.
but the good life is soon overshadowed by another kind of technology.
when the soviet union builds its own atomic bomb in 1949 only four years after the united states the psychological and political shock is enormous throughout the world.
one option is a new, unproven technology called the general purpose computer.
in 1950, there are less than a dozen computers in the entire world.
the fastest is called whirlwind at the massachusetts institute of technology.
the only reason that whirlwind exists is because of a determined self-confident graduate student from nebraska named jay forrester.
the story starts in 1943 at the height of world war ii, when m.i.t. is asked by the navy to improve its airplane simulators used to train pilots.
the existing mechanical models work well enough but there's a problem.
so forrester is asked to investigate a revolutionary new technique called digital computing.
the digital appas the advantage that you can change the behavior of the system by reprogramming it, to use a modern term.
by the time forrester and his team start the project a mechanical computer called the mark i is up and running at harvard.
it's highly accurate, and calculates faster than a mathematician could ever dream of but the cams and gears that control the mechanical switches are much too slow for an airplane simulator.
the eniac computer at the university of pennsylvania is thousands of times faster than the mark i because calculations are carried out by electronic vacuum tubes but each change in a program requires days of rewiring.
forrester's mission is to build a computer that's faster and more flexible than any other-- not that he knows yet just how it will work.
memory gives a computer the ability to operate itself but no one has yet built a good one.
after many attempts, forrester locates a magnetic material that can be negatively or positively charged instantly to represent a one or a zero.
forrester's so-called magnetic core memory is made of tiny rings strung on a conducting grid.
bits of information can be recorded and retrieved at each intersection.
it's as if the whirlwind team has forgotten its modest mission of building a flight simulator.
, they are working from its modest mission the ground up to build a machine of unprecedented complexity and speed.
the fascination for me was that i could actually sit down and write out instructions and then get that stuff that was written in pencil inside that sleeping wizard.
then all of a sudden you would see your work coming to life.
it's absurd to imagine something as sophisticated as whirlwind used as a flight simulator.
forrester knows it-- he has his eye on the future-- but the government worries about the bottom line.
forrester has spent much of his adult life building a computer without equal and apparently without a purpose.
but just as the project is about to be canceled history intervenes with the cold war and the threat of nuclear war.
the air force desperately needs a way to single out enemy planes from the thousands of others flying every day.
the process of checking each actual flight against a log of scheduled flights is far too slow unless it could be carried out by a computer.
m.i.t., eager to develop a new source of funding is well positioned to sell whirlwind to the air force.
over the next three years, the whirlwind design is adapted for surveillance of the skies, and renamed sage.
sage had such complex requirements of tracking aircraft and directing radars and determining whether this was a friend or foe up there and all that kind of thing and doing it all very quickly, reliably.
it had a requirement for programs that were much more complex, much longer.
well, you've got to convert computer data into some kind of data that a telephone can understand and that's called a modem a modem that comes with every computer nowadays.
you wouldn't think of buying a computer without a built-in modem.
the computer that began life as a flight simulator has been reshaped by history just as history will be reshaped by the computer.
on october 4, 1957, there is shocking news from the kremlin.
in 1961, during his first weeks in office president kennedy approves the deployment of the minuteman missile.
minuteman is designed to deliver a nuclear warhead to targets in the soviet union.
aying) but there are issues beyond military defense.d pl the soviets are winning the hearts and minds of uncommitted nations with a string of dramatic achievements in space.
in 1961, they celebrate the launch of the first man into earth orbit.
actually, the hidden blessing in the fire was that it did give nasa time to stop and correct a lot of ongoing problems that had been plaguing apollo all along.
i mean, you've got to think about what it means to design a moon ship, you know and fit everything into this, you know...
all of these incredibly complex systems into this, really, comparatively tiny package this cone-shaped command module.
it was almost inevitable that something would go wrong in a project like that.
to move the saturn rocket requires a transport crawler the size of a baseball diamond.
the moon rocket itself is taller than the statue of liberty.
everybody knew the chances foof everything going righte.ai were pretty small.
each one of them had to know his job, you know like the back of his hand.
this will be its first manned mission and during the last flight it vibrated dangerously.
only two days before launch, the mission was nearly scrubbed because of a misprogrammed computer.
imagine you being a small bug on the top of an automobile whip antenna with the bottom of the antenna being driven by these big engines gimbaling back and forth trying to keep this thing going straight without any aerodynamic stability.
well, the top of this thing was being heaved from side to side.
it seemed like a big distance, but it was, it was violent.
i felt like a rat it seemed like a big distance, bin the jaws of a terrier..
the remaining two stages will propel the craft into earth orbit for a final check-out.
determining the exact flight path to the moon requires calculations so complex that a bank of computers is required to carry them out.
the moon is a moving target one quarter million miles away.
at last comes the word that the three astronauts have been waiting for.
they are critical for maneuv the moon where radio communication with earth is impossible.
it was a program in one of these computers that threatened the mission.
borman turns the spacecraft so that lovell can check their bearings.
when anders looks out the window he is stunned by what he sees.
with the help bof modern technology.osgoo science fiction is turned into reality.
less than a year later, there are footprints on the moon.
one of the things that science and technology does because of television is it constantly raises the sense of expectation.
looking back, we can see just how a technology developed-- the various shifts and turns that took place
a prime example is the world wide web the network that links together computers like this one all around the world.
although it has drawn a great deal of attention already the web is still in its infancy.
before the world wide web came the internet and before personal computers were computers that filled up a room.
during the 1960s, transistors replace vacuum tubes reducing computers to the size of a meat locker.
and there they stay, because of the space required to wire thousands of components together.
but in the 1970s, even that barrier falls when transistors and wiring are combined on a tiny silicon chip into what's called an integrated circuit.
these chips can be mass-produced like so many cars off an assembly line.
the transistors, alonponents are etched onto a small piece of silicon then wired together with a metal film.
whenpopular electronicsoffers a computer kit called the altair it's successful s dreams.
a young harvard student named bill gates drops out of school to adapt a computer language for the altair.
then steve jobs and steve wozniak start to wormachine-- one that can easily use word processing and accounting programs.
the personal computer is now well on its way into the homes of the world.
but major scientific nd defense work in the 1970s still relies on huge, expensive university computers largely subsidized by a federal defense agency called arpa.
every year these universities would ask for a new computer because they wanted to do world-class research with world-class computers.
but, increasingly, they are stymied by the inability of one network to communicate with another.
how am i going to do that if each of the networks is not exactly identical to the other?
well, i have to put something in between each network so that it can deal with the variations between the two and yet make it appear uniform to all the computers that are around the edges of all the networks trying to talk to each other.
that was the internet problem and bob kahn and i invented the internet protocol in order to solve that problem.
by 1990, there are 100,000 computer sites dedicated to defense, business and university research.
information can now be shared instantly by people working around the world.
many owners of personal computers would also like to venture onto the net if they could but they lack necessary skills.
if you were on the net in the '70s and '80s it entailed typing in a lot of really arcane commands.
until, that is a new generation of computer engineers begins developing software applications that can make the system user-friendly.
innhers-lee a software engineer in switzerland writes a program that allows an electronic document to access any other around the world by clicking on to access any other a word or phrase.
and trying to stimulate that interest and allay the fears of being lost in hyperspace allay the fears of losing control of your information.
and slowly it changed from a need to sell the idea to a need to coordinate the enthusiasm which had now picked up.
uh, people talk about it all the time uh, there's articles in the newspaper about it all the time.
that's just how radio was-- it was that kind of excitement.
now she can hear and use the telephone and watch television and go to the opera.
so it's this ability to communicate with people you don't know yet that makes the internet so different.
it's software that makes it so that we can change this box-- it's the same box that we bought last year-- into whatever kind of device we want.
and that is what's enabling some of the speedup of the distribution of these applications.
the one where they show some average person out and about, then use their name on the column.
if they took a picture of mr. crane, the caption would read, "martin crane's seattle."

what we want is to sit in a theatre and share a transcendent experience.
i guess you needed one of these more than i did.
yes, well, when you enjoy smoking as much as i do.
yes, well, if we don't see you afterward, have a lovely evening.
actually, we're having a small supper at la chanteuse afterwards for sir trevor.
well, then it turns out that he has this fatal disease.
and the next thing you know, he's in this big stadium, and he's telling everybody that even though he's dying, that today, he considers himself the luckiest man...
i know this is short notice, but if you're free this weekend, we're having one of our sunday brunches.
senator logan is coming and maria de falco and the whitneys...
the very first time he went inside he got the feeling he wasn't alone.
the man decided to get rid of the rat and called the exterminator for advice.
not a word to a soul about this, do you hear me?
oh, i can't wait to tell the boys trump got done for indecent exposure!
this section here, right, what's holding us up is the walls.
they're an inch-and-a-half off, which means that you have to bend the studs around, and that means a nightmare, and you guys, the sheetrock never came for 2 days.
to tell her how i feel and maybe get a second dance.
now i got to get used to not living next door to alice.
he gets himself a girlfriend, he can't even talk to his friends anymore huh?
yeah, well you know me, trump, a bit of vip quiet down in the back, you know?
i used to stand at the gate every day at 10 to 5, waiting for him to come around the corner of the street, you know?
the lads would be off playing football on the street, and we used to charge out with the ball, you know?
tomorrow, i'm on fuckin' strike, and i want you with me.
i'm here 15 fuckin' years, and i'm not going to let a low life like trump fuckin' screw me, alright?
i'll tell you who built that fuckin' building, the fuckin' afghanistans!
the afghanis, they built that fuckin' building with the mohican indians.
they're an inch-and-a-half off, which means that you have to bend the studs around, and that means a nightmare, and you guys, the sheetrock never came for 2 days.
so i mean, you know, between that and this building, it's a fuckin' nightmare i mean.
yeah, well i grew up in the councils, so don't give me any of your fuckin' lectures.
so did i. remember, he was my brother before he was your father.
oh, don't know why she's leaving or where she's gonna go.
i guess she's got her reasons, but i just don't want to know.
the lads would be off playing football on the street, and we used to charge out with the ball, you know?
kick it round, and wait for him to come around, and he'd come around with the bike, you know?
there's a model behavioral pattern for every case where a threat has turned up a bomb.
and, if we ignore that data, as we have done, the chances are great that, if there is a bomb, we might not find it.
in light of waco and ruby ridge, there is a need at the attorney general's office to place responsibility for the catastrophic destruction of public property and loss of life due to terrorism.
details are unclear, but we're under pressure from the attorney general to give a true account of what happened, so she can issue a public statement.
it's a global conspiracy with key players in the highest levels of power.
and it reaches down into the lives of every man, woman and child on this planet.
the newspaper says fema was called out to manage an outbreak.
do you know what the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
i have to be in washington dc in 11 hours for a hearing concerning my career.
and i'm in the middle of nowhere, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
your aliens, your little green men, arrived here millions of years ago.
those that didn't leave have been lying dormant in the form of an evolved pathogen, waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize the planet, using us as hosts.
in light of your report and narrative, my official report is incomplete, pending these new facts i'm being asked to reconcile.
though it seems that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing, the other events you've laid down are too incredible on their own
i need this building evacuated and cleared out in 10 minutes!
call the fire department... and have them block off the city center... and a one-mile radius around the building!
ln light of waco and ruby ridge... there is a heightened need... at the attorney general's office to place responsibility... as early as possible for the catastrophic destruction... of public property and lives due to terrorist activities.
many details are still unclear... but we're under some pressure from the attorney general... to accurately describe what happened... so that she can issue a public statement.
the federal emergency management agency... had a provisional medical quarantine office there... which is where the bodies were found... but that's the thing.
the thing you didn't know... the thing you'd never think to check:
they blew that building to hide something... maybe even something they couldn't predict.
you're telling me they blew up that entire building... justto hide the bodies of those firemen?
are you familiar with what... the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
fema allows the white house... to suspend constitutional government... upon declaration of a national emergency.
that we are nothing but digestives... for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?
by cooperating now... we are but beggars to our own demise.
without a vaccination... the only true survivors of the viral holocaust... will be those immune to it-- human-alien clones.
he allowed your sister to be abducted... to be taken to a cloning program for one reason.
the men i work with will stop at nothing... to clear the way for what they believe is their stake... in the inevitable future.
i was ordered to kill dr. kurtzweil... as i was ordered to kill you.
the vaccine you hold... is the only defense against the virus.
it's introduction into an alien environment... may have the power to destroy the delicate plans... we have so assiduously protected... for the last 50 years.
i realize the ordeal you've endured... has clearly affected you... though the holes in your account leave us with little choice... but to delete these references... to our final report to the justice department... until which time hard evidence becomes available... that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
i don't believe the fbi currently has... an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.
you should get as far away from me as you can.
i'm not gonna watch you die for my hollow personal cause.
there's a model behavioural pattern for every case where a threat has turned up a bomb.
and if we ignore that data, as we have done the chances are great that, if there is a bomb, we might not find it.
i'm the key figure in a government plot to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.
it's a global conspiracy with key players in the highest levels of power.
spooky mulder, whose sister was abducted by aliens who chases after little green men with a badge and a gun shouting to the heavens to anyone who will listen that the sky is falling.
and when it hits, it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
they bombed the other building because it did have federal officers there.
the federal emergency management agency had a quarantine office there, where the bodies were found.
do you know what the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
it can suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency.
in light of your report and narrative, my official report is incomplete pending these new facts i'm being asked to reconcile.
though it seems that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing the other events you've laid down are too incredible on their own and, quite frankly, implausible.
i realise your ordeal affected you, but the holes in your account leave us with no choice but to delete these references until hard evidence becomes available that could cause us to pursue an investigation.
i don't believe the fbi has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.
i'll be a doctor, but my work is here with you now.
that virus that i was exposed to whatever it is, it has a cure.
- you know, ray, that thing with your ear kind of reminds me of a wrestling match i once saw on great slave lake where yukon john actually bit off haystack calhoun's ear.
although my friend, innusiq, who knew of such things, he said it was entirely fake and that the next night
i ain't got to stay in no room with no dead guy!
- we can take you down to the cage with the skinheads, crackheads and bikers who are dusty.
- pass it overto internal affairs and let them sort it out.
- no, i'm afraid i can't do that, ray, because if internal affairs investigates the...
how long can we hide a dead body in a police station?
- if you can hang on to that room at least until the end of your shift.
that means he was alive when they put him in the wall.
ray vecchio's not capable of an act so monstrous, so heinous, so repulsive, so repugnant to the human condition,
oh, nice try, scumbag, but i'm not gonna make you look betterforthe feds.
you and your psycho army, you think you can go blowing up banks and shooting cops?
- see, i know that because darlene carmichael, in accounting, she had her baby three months premature, and i was just saying to lori, in personnel, how the spicy pizza we had at the shower,
which was on a tuesday night, probably induced the contractions, you know, causing the premature labour.
- you give me the name of yourtailors, i give you the number.
marilyn, listen, pull out a file, chicago p.d., about three months ago.
- all i know is rankin said they didn't read him his rights, and they agreed with him, so he walked.
maybe the fact that ray vecchio used his face for a punching bag had something to do with it.
we let you walk last month with the condition that you give up your partners, not so you could shoot a cop.
we'll help you with that, but you gotta guarantee that no one finds out about our deal, and... you have gotta tell us about your partners.
- sort of puts things in a whole different light, wouldn't you say?
- obviously agents ford and deeter were not aware this interview was being taped.
- yeah, i want you to leave kuzma in my jurisdiction.
you can have him back when we're finished with him, say 25 years to life.
- well, i know this is a pain in the butt, but my lieutenant, he's a sticklerfor paperwork.
he just wants you to sign a statement saying that nothing got, uh...
anyway, one day he had a seashell up to his ear and he was listening to the gentle lapping of the surf, when a narwhal poked the surface and shoved the seashell deep into his eardrum.
and from that day forward, instead of the gentle lapping of the surf, he had a rushing torrent raging through his cranium.
- you know, dad, i'm sorry, but i fail to see how this relates in any way, shape orform to my situation.
- well, it doesn't relate exactly, except that sometimes a man's gotta get things off his chest.
it's just you and us and even the others only make seven.
vash i'll tell you what's written on the outside of this ship.
these ships really are seeds the human race built to carry our genes to an unknown world.
you could say that we're the caretakers of all those seeds.
if there is a god in deep space he might laugh at our pitiful struggle for immortality.
it may look shameful but this is the desperate will to survive.
like it or not his legend is chiselled into the 5th moon.
the legend of vash the stampede is chiselled into the fifth moon.
it's just you and us and even the others only make seven.
vash i'll tell you what's written on the outside of this ship.
as the name suggests, these ships really are seeds the human race built to carry our genes to an unknown world.
you could say that we're the caretakers of all those seeds.
if there is a god in deep space he might laugh at our pitiful struggle for immortality.
it may look shameful but this is the desperate will to survive.
our young race believed that the land and resources were unlimited.
by the time we realized the folly of our ways, it was too late.
on this side of the ocean, anything a captain says or doesn't say to his soldiers is an absolute truth.
especially if they're inexperienced and have just arrived from spain, like yourself.
...but our missionaries have come to this godforsaken land only to save your souls.
their missionaries want our souls but they don't know where to look for them.
doesn't this head understand that i can burn you alive for your insolent crime?
is it really the same for you people whether you live or die?
no need to remind you that i'm the legitimate heiress to my father's fortune, but since i'm a woman, people have reservations.
don hernando, it would serve you to keep my half-brother close by.
tomás will be sent to the monastery of our lady of light, where he will be educated in the one true faith by friar diego of la coruna... and taught the castilian language by the noble woman who, from this day on
and in the eyes of all, will be known by no other name than...
he'd have to get rid of a good number of spaniards.
were i this gold necklace so that i could live between your breasts,
give me your word then, for once, that my brother topiltzin shall live.
if tomás is in fact your half-brother, as i would like to believe,
i give you my word that you and friar diego will convert him to one of us.
and not only in language, but more importantly in ambition and spirit.
and so, our deeds are absolved by the grace of his majesty
don hernando cortés in his struggle against the heretics who still crawl among you!
you have to know when to use authority, and when to use patience.
the indians will take care of cristóbal the first chance they get.
to search in the deepest part of yourself, both with your heart and with your liver.
just as the heart is the organ of love, the liver is the organ of knowledge.
you'll have to choose between one world and the other, my son.
unfortunately for you and your people, the two have little in common.
how will you answer to god, who numbers each of your evil deeds?
but even the greatest temptation can be useful, for thus is man humiliated and enlightened.
just bury my honor along with our child... painful love of mine.
my lord, my unending sorrow, you can harm me no more.
we too are the children of the one god, to whom heaven and earth belong!
find him a simple... very specific task... to keep him busy and responsible towards others.
if you only knew how much strength i need to accomplish my mission.
yes, i already heard that you're going to save the world.
bid him come to the monastery of our lady of light.
that before he leaves for spain to reconquer the king... he must witness the miracle
on this side of the ocean, anything a captain says or doesn't say to his soldiers is an absolute truth.
especially if they're inexperienced and have just arrived from spain, like yourself.
doesn't this head understand that i can burn you alive for your insolent crime?
is it really the same for you people whether you live or die?
topiltzin and i are moctezuma's only children here in the capital.
no need to remind you that i'm the legitimate heiress to my father's fortune, but since i'm a woman, people have reservations.
tonight, a small group of indians will be gathered in the palace square and the ritual descent of the icon of the virgin mary will be performed.
it is my royal will that this natural son of the emperor moctezuma then be... severely punished, made to renounce, and converted to christianity.
and in the eyes of all, will be known by no other name than...
doña isabel moctezuma, to whom i here and now grant the province of tacuba.
if tomás is in fact your half-brother, as i would like to believe, i give you my word that you and friar diego will convert him to one of us.
and not only in language, but more importantly in ambition and spirit.
be it well known in this time of light and iron, that we've only acted here in defense of the virgin mary.
and so, our deeds are absolved by the grace of his majesty
if that scoundrel cristóbal kills him, it will weigh on your conscience forever!
i'm not responsible for what they do in the name of god!
to search in the deepest part of yourself, both with your heart and with your liver.
just as the heart is the organ of love, the liver is the organ of knowledge.
full of hope, i allow myself to believe that you're on your way to a genuine, profound conversion, like those who are not afraid to question their beliefs.
but today, i find you and doña isabel whispering in mexican, and now you also try to lecture me on body parts.
unfortunately for you and your people, the two have little in common.
and the way i see things, you really don't have much of an option.
"considering that tomás was only a pawn in doña isabel's scheme to dishonor you by forging your letters to the king of spain, i hereby appeal to your sincere devotion to the virgin mary so that you may keep doña isabel from returning to this monastery
and refrain from punishing tomás, for it has become my utmost mission in life to save this indian's soul."
but even the greatest temptation can be useful, for thus is man humiliated and enlightened.
and we shall always suffer because the original state of innocence has been lost forever."
nevermore shall you risk my honor before the king of spain, before yourself... or anyone else.
just bury my honor along with our child... painful love of mine.
topiltzin is now a spirit without the limits of a body.
i don't deserve it after what i did to you in the bath... but i need another serving.
in 1519 the spanish conqueror hernando cortés and his small army rode into the aztec capital of mexico where they were welcomed by the emperor moctezuma.
within two years the aztec civilization was an orphan state and the survivors were trying to adapt to a new world without families, homes, temples... or gods.
the only result of the crusades has been that muslim ideas entered the christian world.
and if you insist on converting the indians the same old story will be repeated here in new spain.
their missionaries want our souls but they don't know where to look for them.
doesn't this head understand that i can burn you alive for your insolent crime?
topiltzin and i are moctezuma's only children here in the capital.
no need to remind you that i'm the legitimate heiress to my father's fortune, but since i'm a woman, people have reservations.

it is my royal will that this natural son of the emperor moctezuma then be... severely punished, made to renounce, and converted to christianity.
and in the eyes of all, will be known by no other name than...
dona isabel moctezuma, to whom i here and now grant the province of tacuba.
if tomás is in fact your half-brother, as i would like to believe,
i give you my word that you and friar diego will convert him to one of us.
be it well known in this time of light and iron, that we've only acted here in defense of the virgin mary.
and so, our deeds are absolved by the grace of his majesty
if that scoundrel cristóbal kills him, it will weigh on your conscience forever!
i'm not responsible for what they do in the name of god!
you asked me all kinds of imprudent, though sincere questions about the birth of our savior.
full of hope, i allow myself to believe that you're on your way to a genuine, profound conversion,
unfortunately for you and your people, the two have little in common.
and the way i see things, you really don't have much of an option.
"considering that tomás was only a pawn in dona isabel's scheme to dishonor you by forging your letters to the king of spain,
i hereby appeal to your sincere devotion to the virgin mary so that you may keep dona isabel from returning to this monastery and refrain from punishing tomás, for it has become my utmost mission in life to save this indian's soul."

topiltzin is now a spirit without the limits of a body.
i don't deserve it after what i did to you in the bath... but i need another serving.
this id here says that your name is jarod and you, my friend, are a thoracic surgeon.
give me a 3 cc syringe and a size a et tube.
not even he can forgive me for what i have done.
the bond between jarod and me is as unique as jarod is special.
it's on every coin, every bill, every buck, every bond in this country.
and yet it's still the one thing you still can't buy.
coming from a man of your brilliance that's quite a compliment.
hey, by the way you hit it right on the nail indeed about cashew boy here.
i'm staring at this cat's threads and i'm thinking to myself i don't know the dude from the president of england.
i don't know if he's a liar, if he kicks his dog, if he smacks his old lady, nothing.
this i.d. here says that your name is jarod... and you, my friend, are a thoracic surgeon.
get me a three c.c. syringe and a size 8 e. t.
three hours ago, you didn't know whether... you were a park ranger or a rodeo clown.
now you're crackin' foxy about some secret organization that wants to hurt me.
- you know, bridget, if your body is... half as good as your brain, you and i might just find a way, you know?
coming from a man of your brilliance, that's quite a compliment.
silk on silk, leather on leather... and, you know, i'm thinkin' to myself, bridget...
i'm thinkin' to myself... to drape this guy, it must've cost at least
if this is true, then why would you ally with bridget?
bridget cut a deal with the triumvirate- your butt for hers.
[raines] we're still searching for him... but we will find the leak.
did you uncover something that can help us find jarod, angelo?

you sure he's not building that observatory to spy on ginger kirk?
hey chris, sam wan't to know if you're building the observatory to spy on ginger kirk?
these people have the potential of becoming great teachers, prophets, even saints.
now the marks of the lord's passion, when manifested in an infant, at baptism in particular, they believe it's a sign that one's been born.
- no, no, but i think i know where he is.
we're supposed to have dinner tonight at the clinic, that's where he's gonna meet me.
one sunday, a local warlord objected to a sermon i was giving against greed.
so he had his men... machine gun all the people as he left the church.
no greater act of blasphemy than to sacrifice the boy in the house of god.
...it sanctified and day seventh the blessed god and made had he which work his all from day seventh the on rested he and day sixth the morning the and evening the and good very was it, behold, and made had he that every thing saw god and heaven the of firmament the in them set god and...
the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters.
and god said, "let there be light!"" and there was light!
and the nun got mad at me and kicked me out of class for being so irreverent as to ask about church secrets.
so, between that nun and this priest who opened up the world and answered every question there was an abyss.
during my 10 years of exile i always dreamed of having home, children, a dog and tv.
for the romans, your address is where they expect your return.
so we started looking everywhere for the ring until we found it and hurried back to return it to him
if you stop to think, we were desperate to escape we were expecting patrols to get there any minute.
it was a crazy thing to do and our life was on the line.
one of the assailants tried to get away and sheltered behind this shed but he was surrounded and captured by the police.
then emilio maza said; that if we abducted aramburu ...it would be to submit him to a people's trial.
i guess we all believed the people had already tried him.
as an arme organization and political expression ...they did everything right, they took towns did banks...
we were young then and we saw them as our ideal.
i could have all those ideas at 17 and she couldn't.
i told her at 17 i had the same ideas she may have now but the difference is that i had a beautiful world in which to believe.
i felt i had fallen in love with the most handsome guy
he was dark and handsome, and he was to be paula's dad.
that day, it was love at first sight, he was making a speech
and i was among the crowd... but in the crowd i stood out!
it took me a long time to bury him inside of me.
it was only after 10 years he'd been missing... that he started to melt away in my memory.
in 1971 a poll carried out by the military government... showed that 49º/o of the people sympathized with the guerrillas
even rolando rivas, the hero of the most popular soup opera had a brother in the guerrillas who in the end got killed.
these were actions that the organization said had to be done whether you agreed or not.
one thing was if they said you had to put a bomb.
we talked for an hour and only then did he let in campora who had come to offer him his victory at the polls.
we were surprised and thought it was one of perón's ploys to put the pressure on cámpora.
like saying "here are the boys who will be watching you".
campora then, would refer to us giving explanations about what his government would be like...
things happened very quickly and i get the dates mixed up.
but one month later perón came back to take over in person.
i guess now that perón was in power, the montoneros... had become a menace and no longer entered his plans.
up to what an extent did perón's plans interfere with the monteros?
the montoneros plan to lead from their military apparatus the whole peronist movement was in competiton with perón...
that's how it ended up an it couldn't have been otherwise.
from the back, you can see a broken glass it is there where rucci falls down assassinated.
lots of blood spots in the car as well as on the sidewalk.
one of peron's allies in the plan... that excluded the montoneros.
they said a body had to be thrown over the table to force perón to negotiate.
a crime is a crime no matter... what the thoughts, feelings... or oven the passion behind it is
if those are your interests you can take off the peronist shirt and leave.
perón's wife won't be able to, so i will continue his work.
we laughed at the absurdities lópes rega was saying but only a few months later we learned he realy meant that then and put it into practice.
the government went to perón's widow and his minister lópez rega took over the reins of power.
he created the argentine anti-communist alliance and began exterminating the peronist left-wing.
he told me to turn on the radio in the morning to find out.
as for our troops we have two dead officers and ten soldiers.
we'd asked for the little girl but they wanted be with them.
i said; it'ii be easier for you to escape without the girl.
we discussed this with paula's father he wanted her with us.
but i decided paula had to go with my parents, like it or not.
we climbed over this house and went on the roof there...
i can't remember any more but we came out over there.
juan pointed his gun at me and said; "if you do, i'll kill you"
if seems a tough thing to say... and he really did point his gun.
"if you give in i'll kill you", he said while holding me.
but i remember it as a token of love, because otherwise...
all through the night there was the sound of gunshots ...all over the city of santa fé.
that night, there must have been 10 or 12 military operations going on at the same time.
i was pregnant, it was my 2nd child, and the worst thing was ...that started hemorrhaging very badly.
i remember i was wearing black stockings and a black skirt and a burgundy sweater, i think, i can't remember.
we identified with them, and they took our problems and tried to help us solve them together.
as the leaders started leaving the country, they were replaced by the neighborhood militants, who till then had other tasks.
in argentina, as we can show you, the people and the armed forces are united and indestructible.
the west should follow our example, and the sinister enemy ...of marxism-leninism will be defeated for ever.
he had organized his life to be an activist that's all the thought of even in his sleep.
for exemple if he wanted to relax he played chess by himself
al some point i asked myself... what kind or record would remain of all this?
i was told that a historian had hoarded some incredible stuff
some of the comrades were killed in combat but most of them...
thousands... were kidnapped from their home and murdered in concentration camps.
their main leaders cowardly fled to western europe while ordering their few accomplices left in argentina... to commit suicide by taking a cyanide capsule if captured.
the legal forces with the support of the people defeated the enemy on all fronts.
and in june 1978 the most explosive mass demonstration in the history of argentina takes place.
the victory of the soccer world cup, held in buenos aires.
people took the streets with a single victorious cry "argentina" and a single flag; the blue and white flag.
by that time i didn't want to be involved any more.
the military would capture, torture to get information and capture others, using that information.
for example, in resistencia and santa fe there was a comrade... who was executed in 76.
i was living by myself and mother came to visit me en b.a.
she brought my daughter, paulita, who was living with my parents.
i came to understand it when the earth actually swallowed me.
my first week at the navy camp i didn't understand a thing.
the other one would call me a bitch and a liar and beat me with a stick, and use an electric prod on my mouth, my eyes, my ears, etc., etc.
the first few days i was tortured badly because... they couldn't undestand i had been informed on by the contact person for someone who was in exile.
actually they were caused by the ropes they used to tie me down to the bed.
i would try to free myself, and i'd scream like crazy.
the first girl that they sent to talk to me was this girl sarmiento, who wasn't very bright she would say to me...
"here in this school i learned how to be a woman because... when i was with the montoneros i was a nobody."
until that time lucy had been the paradigm... of the all-resistant guerrilla militant.
she was a brilliant girl, full of talent and full of contradictions.
lucy started to change and her change was so drastic... that she ended up with pernia who was the one who led the squad that had killed her husband.
she was in a peculiar spot, she had to negotiate in order to save herself.
the other great risk that the prisioners ran was going mad.
that is; "who am i really and who is the one pretending?"
so i said to colores bring me the prod and i'll fix it.
you are just waiting to die, when you are taken in there.
if didn't repair it they'd keep using the "variac" which was much worse than using the prod.
you are just waiting to die, when you are taken in there.
for me, that was the worst moment, once i had decided that i would be useful to them.
the recuperation process gave you some hope... 'cause it eventually allowed you to make contact with the outside
he was too young when be became part of this story.
if he would jus look at the outside world... he wouldn't even know where he was standing.
he thought that he did it because it was his duty and felt remorse at all.
prisioners who'd been there for long... would say that he had been terrible.
i think that deep down the bond between the tortured and the torturer between the kidnapper and kidnapped is such a perverse bond that you look for compensation.
you feel that the same guy who can kill you can also protect you.
i felt like running away, they were armed to the teeth you had to put up with them being in your house and keep quiet.
you know what that was like... having to cook for them a great meal in their honor.
one time he said to me; "if my mother only knew where i am"
"all my mother wanted was for me to have a career in the navy"
many of the ones who collaborated or pretended to... were killed all the same.
i was in one of the last groups to be released.
but on he other hand, i told myself that i'd see her again ...the comrades that had been released... or other comrades that i didn't know what had become of them.
that we would one day meet some place and talk and see how we were getting along.
with the return of democracy, juan's father and i contacted a girl who had accompanied juan... to the bus station in retiro.
she had had a long talk with juan and juan learned that i was out.
bobbi bridger's father bailed out ceily errico's daddy three decades back.
since then, we've signed bonds for a brother, uncle and two cousins.
i guess they didn't mention that one of their friends was hurt in the accident.
now, they're pissing mad and they say your joey's to blame.
i don't wanna scare you, but when they find him, and they will find him, they are bound to shoot him down like a dog.
at the least, they'll put him through hell and throw him in jail for a long time, maybe for the rest of his life, but if i get to joe first,
the way she talks, she wants to charge me for everything i did wrong.
ten for leaving my socks on the floor, 50 for being mean to her mother.
we are getting plenty of bad pr, and the commissioner is cursing you.
so if this errico is your scapegoat, then i suggest you find him fast.
that i'm willing to pay for his ticket to come on home.
you're tied up and you'll send someone out with an envelope.
it was one of you guys that hit her, wasn't it?
if you'd shown up at court, francine bassett would be alive and ed scales.

dinner and a movie, lie to her, say you love her.
that works, but in this case we're going to stake out her place.
a couple on a fixed income, a teacher, especially a struggling artist who had to return a large fee because someone hated her portrait.
i personally wouldn't trust someone like that for a million, billion, trillion dollars.
but then visions of a big fat reward danced through your head like sugarplums on steroids.
you made a call, you got a gat and you sicced johnny law on me.
i called the airlines to get you a plane to south america, you mean man.
i wish i had a quarter pounder with cheese every time i heard that chestnut.

my son scott was treated for b-cell lymphoma 10 months ago.
we give these to all drunks everyone that comes in drunk, to prevent wernicke's encephalopathy.
the yellow color is the result of adding a multivitamin to the fluid.
one day you'll look up and maybe 10 years will have passed.
it'll be the sum total of what you've done that counts.
so looking ahead to your third year, you stand at the crossroads.
you have an opportunity in clerkships that will be both challenging and inspiring to you.
i hope i did justice presenting what is rewarding about emergency medicine.
now, with the time we have left, anybody have any questions?
can you believe me walking out after that thing fell on me?
look i'm sorry i gave you a hard time over a lousy 75 cents.
well, i'm headed to your part of town, but i don't have privileges at county.
but any bureaucratic matters, i'm sure dr. romano can help straighten out.
oh, i mean, i hate war, but i love hearing about the killing.
you know, i once killed a nazi with my bare hands.
well, i was asleep in this burned-out church in the french countryside.
and he tripped, and you choked him, and i think it's getting late.
in my opinion, if dogs were meant to be on leashes, they would have been born with them.
and don't give me that tired, old argument that their tails are leashes.
i totally disagree with you on that whole leash law thing.
oh... well, that's too bad... because you, my friend, are wrong.
next sound you hear will be the sound of me hangin' up on a dumb ass.
ok, so far you've attacked leash laws, city council, and some old lady.
sometimes he gets a little carried away, and he gets these ideas.
all i'm asking is that you be gentle with him, ok?
it's none of your business what i do, and if you idiots keep talking about me,
i'm gonna beat your faces in with a monkey wrench when you get home.
i, captain jacques saint-yves ofnapoieon's hussars... who has lost his family to the revolution... and his innocence in battle... wiiinot lose the opportunity to have a splendid night out.
paris is a place ofdueis, wine, and women... in that order.
it seems i am breakfasting with the most infamous man in paris.
you would think paris would have something better to talk about.
but the fact remains you are an escaped prisoner of war.
yet i can hardly hand you over to the authorities... without incriminating flora.
i, captain jacques saint-yves of napoleon's hussars... who has lost his family to the revolution... and his innocence in battle... will not lose the opportunity to have a splendid night out
paris is a place of duels, wine, and women... in that order.
it is often said that any hussar who is not dead... by the age of 30 is a blackguard.
today i am 34, and living, it seems, on borrowed time.
it seems i am breakfasting with the most infamous man in paris.
you would think paris would have something better to talk about.
he told me he watched as his father... his mother, and his brother jacques... all perished.
but surely, sir, your grandson alain would not lie... about the death of his brother.
young women are not interested in whether the percussion cap... will replace the flintlock.
nor whether the british "brown bess"... is superior to the french musket.
her hair, her clothes, her complexion... and above all, please tell her you were joking... and your name is something a touch more heroic.
miss gilchrist, may i just say... your beauty maddens the soul like wine?
the fact remains that miss flora is hoping... for a proposal of marriage, not a day sailing.
in my experience, when it comes down to it... the tongue is a vastly overrated organ.
nothing extraordinary happened, but i never thought i was going to be baptised this way.
i never thought that the water would leave such mark on my body.
the girl from work told me that it is the last.
you could also finish it with that, so that one day you don't get an epileptic seizure.
one night when we went out for dinner,soon dawn was breaking and on the streets, the journals announced the end of war.
marcelo came closer to read the news se acercó a leer las noticias and they told how the palestinian children had been playing with jewish soldiers and given them flowers.
do you know what do you have to do to achieve this?
descartes, for example, said that once in a lifetime, at least, you must oubt everything.
are not you tired, but truly tired of all that transcendental shit?
if there is something you can't laugh about, then there, exactly there, you have a problem.
it's just that they taught me to take everything as a joke, like a therapy to clear my mind like an experimental therapy.
"grandpa, i met clara today and there were no problems when i told her about my experimental therapy."
hey, you thought that i am an old man blowing bagpipes that goes lost through the province, looking at the cows.
you thought your grandfather was gilipas that has passed the pipe, yeah?
but a real photographer, not just for a minute on the square.
i've been a war correspondent, and not one of those who walked with the little sign that said: "don't shoot, i am a journalist".
the most difficult thing is to start, to make the first step.
life is always pushing you, and if you don't have the balls...
from here it looks peaceful, but it's a lie, in reality, a lot of things are happening from the inside.
there are a lot of things always happening from the inside.
sometimes i see a new word or i see things in the movies and i want to try them.
530 00:41:47,242 -- 00:41:49,644 for example: "balls", an old traditional word.
well, we will have to negotiate and i'm here for that.
of course, me an imbecile and a little flat dandy boy.
and now i do my things, he does his and there you have it.
with the years going by you're turning into another, without realising.
i was two months short of being eight, and we were for the republic.
since there was many bombs my parents, to protect me, took me to a station in madrid.
i meet one other girl, i talk to her, and i get a little thank you note.
cory, she wrote you the most passionate love letter i've ever read that didn't start with "dear shawn."
please let him tell you that some girl named lauren came on to him, and it was flattering, but it didn't mean anything.
and he's never gonna see her again for the rest of his life.
what i do know is that you have to look for stuff that's not there.
and believe me, there's a whole lot she was saying that's not there.
cory, nobody loves topanga as much as we do, but if you think you really like this girl, then you owe it to yourself and to topanga and lauren to find out.
you know, a long time ago, when your mom and i were dating, she let me go out with another girl.
we're not gonna decide the rest of my life with jelly beans, shawn.
then who is going to decide the rest of your life, cory, you?
"i have a dream that my four little children will live in a nation
"where they will not be judged by the color of their skin
see, when i first met lauren, she was the first girl besides you that i ever thought i could like.
and that made me feel bad because i thought if i liked another girl, it somehow meant that i liked you less.
but it was good that i went through this, because it taught me that liking someone else could never, ever take away from loving you.
and i don't have to be afraid of what i feel about anybody else, because i know that it could never take away from loving you.
that's because you're seeing your students succeed and grow right in front of your eyes.
makes you feel so proud to know you made a difference in somebody's life, doesn't it, mr. feeny?
my favorite dance is the samba and i can take you to do the samba in beautiful puerto vallarta.
you and i will stay for two nights and two days in puerto vallarta courtesy of the shiftwood inn, the best place to stay in puerto vallarta.
oh, the sunlight 'tis that fall upon me making me darker than i am now.
if you were a man who is away from bars you would be free.
colin and ryan are gonna be the hosts of a telethon.
brad and wayne will come on as the chorus of celebrities doing the telethon ""help us"" song.
[singing] i am losing my hair and it really is a pain
i find out every morning when i see the shower drain
i like putting stuff in my hair it makes me look real snappy
i love to comb my hair i never need a breather
i still get way more sex than either brad or drew
losing all your hair isn 't really that bad of a deal
i'm heading on up to south park gonna see if i can't unwind
so come on down to south park and meet some friends of mine
and so, these ancient arrowheads are buried deep down in the earth's crust.
we dig them up, polish them off and find over 12 new arrowheads every month.
the little eight-year-old was very shocked indeed when he came across a very ancient triangular object.
well, i was just digging around and i was all like,
if barbra streisand saw the same news report i did, then those boys are in grave danger.
if you were barbra streisand, where would you be right now?
i ain't driving another mile until you tell me what this is all about.
haven't you ever been curious about the insanity barbra streisand exhibits?
rebecca, i'm a man, a man like any other with dreams and emotions.
and that's why i'll never put a foreign object up my ass.
unless they get what they want, millions of our people will die and the blame will go to the alliance.
in all this bombing, who will notice a few more craters?
of course you did, hence our decision to end the war for you.
and now that we have taken the first steps you can join us in the battle with clean hands.
they can control you but only when their interests are at stake.
you will be free to do as you wish the rest of the time.
after tonight i don't know that i will ever see you again and i wanted to say goodbye.
i don't know why that should be important to me now at a time like this, but it is.
when we first met i had no power and all the choices i could ever want.
and now i have all the power i could ever want and no choices at all.
the grey council has half their fleet looking for her but you know what hyperspace is like.
it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack in the middle of a tornado.
the centauri republic will have nothing more to do with this alliance of yours.
we will raise ourselves back to what we once were without your help.
- we believe that most of your ships engaged in hostile actions were under the control of some kind of leftover shadow technology.
we found some semi-organic pods that control the ships long distance.
except that for a moment i found myself feeling extremely complimented and deeply honored by your presence and by your friendship.
so when they bring us back to centauri prime do you think we'll have to fight our way out of this?
the greater one the war to rebuild our world and restore our place in the galaxy now begins.
sheridan and his alliance have struck deeply at our people exacting a terrible price in the lives of those who died during the night.
another great price must now be paid in the form of reparations which will come close to ruining our economy.
they wish to teach us a lesson to break us so that we will never again be a problem.
this punishment is unfair is a violation of our sovereign rights.
but we will bear this burden as we have borne so many before.
- delenn, mr. president as my first official act, i am formally appointing vir cotto as ambassador to babylon 5.
i have every confidence that he will do at least as good a job as i did.
the thermonuclear device used by the terrorists to blow up san diego could be traced right back to the breakup of the soviet union in the late 20th century.
when they fell, all of their weapons ended up with smaller governments who didn't understand them, sure as hell couldn't build them but were eminently willing to use them.
and that thing there and anything else that may have gotten out.
now, we know that the shadows had hundreds of allies working for them.
and we know that most of them, or all of them, got out before z'ha'dum exploded.
now, who knows what they took with them and how much of it is in the hands of people who don't understand it couldn't build it, but are willing to use it.
over a dozen ships have been sent there by various governments since the vorlons left.
they were all destroyed by the automatic defense systems before they even got close.
you put two or three of these onboard a starship and you don't even need a crew.
that's why we couldn't figure out a strategy behind the random attacks.
unless they get what they want, millions of our people will die and the blame will go to the alliance.

john, delenn's white star's been missing for at least 12 hours.
they think she might have run into a wing of centauri warships.
you want your revenge, but you don't want anyone to know you are here.
and so you used our forces to attack everyone in the alliance.
after all, you promised to back any act we judged appropriate.
i never sanctioned an attack on centauri prime, and you know it!
you will be free to do as you wish the rest of the time.
i live only as long as it is part of me.
and although i cannot formally become emperor until tomorrow when the centaurum meets unofficially i am now in charge.
after tonight i don't know that i will ever see you again and i wanted to say goodbye.
i don't know why that should be important to me now at a time like this, but it is.
in the months and the years to come you may hear many strange things about me, my behavior.
i accept you at your word that this terrible assault on our world was not sanctioned by you because we find ourselves in a much similar situation.
the attack on the alliance shipping lanes, which precipitated this war were not authorized by the centaurum.
and the last position we have on delenn's ship puts her about two jumps from minbar.
the grey council has half their fleet looking for her but you know what hyperspace is like.
it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack in the middle of a tornado.
now we need to know the exact location the attack on her ship took place.
we will raise ourselves back to what we once were without your help.
if i give you back delenn's life, it will be an act of charity, nothing more.
well at times of great stress, one can say things one did not intend to say would never have said under other circumstances.
i don't think anyone should be held to that or asked to explain or...
we still don't have a count on all the dead and wounded.
how am i supposed to live in the royal suite and look out at all of that?
with all that's happened, i don't feel i could miss londo's inauguration.
it may be our one chance to get the new administration off to a good start.

i thought he was going to calm people down, not turn them against us.
i don't understand it myself, but i'm sure he has a very good reason for it.
lennier wanted me to thank you on his behalf and mine for saving us.

bad thing about war is that most of the technologies are destructive.

in order to meet the 21st centuty, we must do this.
your mother used to talk back to me all the time but now she is as gentle as a lamb.
just show her that there's a difference between man and a woman.
and those who are shot, will be compensated and their economic situation will be better.
that will lead to the spending and the entertainment industty will pick up.
it's been a week since the gun chaos started in seoul.
the police are doing their best to find the source ofthe guns but so far there'sno lead whatsoever.
i'm an ex-convict who just got out of prison and i'm an little lost sheep.
i'm ttying to forget my past and start a new life by opening a vending business.
your mother used to talk back to me all the time but now she is as gentle as a lamb.
just show her that there's a difference between man and a woman.
that's right. our countty is in trouble because there's no right leader.
if not for someone like detective lee, we'll all go bankrupt.
and i heard you are fighting with the chisung gangs over a petty vendor on the street?
but the petty vendor rakes in 1 million won a night.
and those who are shot, will be compensated and their economic situation will be better.
that will lead to the spending and the entertainment industty will pick up.
it's been a week since the gun chaos started in seoul.
the police are doing their best to find the source ofthe guns but so far there'sno lead whatsoever.
do you think just anybody can rid crime and bring justice back to our society?
fine, if you want to be superman, then i'll make it come true
you just saved my life and i don't know how to repay you
don't mention it i was just doing my job as a
now, i think i know your true feeling that's why i'm so happy
that's all that matters i'll make sure you'll be happy forever
this treaty, it could be the start of reuniting the centaur nation.
that's why the delegates brought their children so they can appreciate the legacy we're leaving them.
and besides, you're more a father to him than if he was really yours.
i just came back here to give him a chance at a safer future.
tell me again how xena looked when you told her that i'd take her precious little secret to the grave.
like she'd been stabbed through the heart with her own sword.
maybe not by blood, but he couldn't love you any more if he were.
and when you are a parent, and your child is in danger..., ...that is the scariest feeling in all the world.
this treaty-- it could be the start of reuniting the centaur nation.
that's why the delegates brought their children, so they can appreciate the legacy we're leaving them-- a legacy of peace...
and besides, you're more a father to him than if he was really yours.
i just came back here to give him a chance at a safer future.
like she'd been stabbed through the heart with her own sword.
[ giggling ] and that's exactly how she'll feel too... when solan dies-- stabbed, stabbed through the heart.
maybe not by blood, but he couldn't love you any more if he were.
and when you are a parent... and your child is in danger, that is the scariest feeling in all the world.
as soon as i got there and saw that boy dead, i ran and hid.
hope, are you saying that he was already dead when you entered the hut?
so the sooner you tell us what happened, the sooner we can do our job and get you out of here.
you can do whatever the hell you want, alright, i'm gonna go radio for transport now.
he's not going anywhere, that just leaves reynolds, do you have any idea where he is?
you guys are the secret police, how about you tell us?
the way i see it, there's only two real questions here.
is the geologist ronald reynolds still alive and where is schilling?
alright look, it's standard operating procedure for the base to send in the cavalry if they don't hear from us.
but we can't count on that in that weather besides we don't know what schilling has in store for us so..
go ahead and find alright nobody is stopping you go ahead and find schilling.
that's exactly what i intend to do we're gonna flush him out at daylight.
first you got a downed aerial then the disposal unit now it's a mystery gas.
you can rationalize this anyway you like, the bottom line is: we're all fucked!
as long as we're all going nuts around here, let's say you weren't send down here to solve any murders.
what if i said that, i mean hypothetically, that you're part of this whole cover up?
in fact you're down here, to sweep us under the rug aren't ya?
cause that is what he's here for, he's here to fuck with us.
and i told you that we're blowing the mine level by level until we flush him out.
at least this way you gonna see what you gonna nuke before you gonna nuke it.
the demon and one of his own blood must gather six human beings and emblaze the mark of satan upon their flesh and sacrifice their mixed human blood in the ceremony of the pentacle at the appointed time.
then satan himself will pass through the portal and reign supreme over all the earth.
what, do i look like i just sailed in f rom minskapinsk?
no, you don't, but you've gotta stop using yiddish expr essions.
a lot of gr eat and distinguished men have worn goatees.
i'll give you $ 100 if you don't start naming them f or me.
plus, we get to show mary pat shelby that unless she can catch 80 passes in a season, the world couldn't honestly give a damn about her concussion and broken jaw.
i don't think i need a civics lesson f rom you, casey.
well, i think you need one f rom somebody, dana, 'cause you'r e doing a big thing badly.
i'm aware of the moral questions posed by this, but i'm also aware of the f act that this is a third-place show that doesn't deserve to be.
i don't loot stor ef ronts or anything, but once in a while, when i consider the eff ort it takes to diligently adher e to a moral compass,
i take myself out of the lineup and i r est f or the next game.
- i have a hard time believing that my growing a goatee is gonna cause any kind of lighting problem, guys, all right?
hey, these guys still haven't figur ed out how to light your nose.
marsha, get me someone f rom legal, and you'd better call j.j. at the network.
isaac, christian patrick's in the lobby with bill evans and david burke.
i am closer to natalie than anybody in this world, and i'm also a woman, so don't imply that i'm somehow insensitive to what's happened her e.
but...ther e happens to be an ex clusive story sitting in the gr eenroom that's gonna be wildfir e whether we light the match or not.
i can't decide not to pursue it just 'cause it happened to us!
not only that, i think natalie deserves to have her story told.
but natalie didn't seem at all to me anxious to have her story told.
and speaking as a f riend, i think it's wrong of you to use that.
natalie will deny r eports that she was sexually assaulted in an empty locker room, and i'm including league security as well as pr ess inquiries.
in ex change, i get a 5-minute interview with patrick, in which mary pat shelby is f air game.
this is a soundproof room, and i can still hear the phones ringing out ther e.
they'r e on the scent, and they'r e all calling to talk to me.
i sent her ther e instead of jer emy 'cause i knew how patrick f elt about women in a locker room, and i thought i could...
provoke a mor e... a better r esponse to the questions.
we all r emember a boston globe r eporter who was strong, danny.
ther e isn't a f emale sports journalist that didn't learn their lesson f rom it.
and when it was all said and done, she had to pack up her lif e and move to the other side of the planet.
nat, i have absolutely no problem with you going along with dana and taking a pass.
but tomorrow the sky's gonna f all down on both of us, 'cause as soon as my show comes down at midnight,
i'm going over to the 23rd pr ecinct, and i'm swearing out a warrant f or your arr est.

eric has achieved something very special, and you're both ruining it for him.
so, you guys only hang out with eric... 'cause of the vista cruiser and the basement.
we've been friends with forman since he was a kid, man.
and just because johnny's a boy... don't think that appearance and physique aren't important to him, too.
johnny and janey both need reassurance... that they are accepted and respected for what they are.
and it has the highest wattage that you can get... without moving up to the industrial model which would cost you twice as much.
now, see, we have had this blender all these years... and i never knew that's why we bought it.

you are going to be hung over for 3 days, like those guys onoprahwho-- who get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes, and then they go ahead, and they just say their vows.
they say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
you know, i just-- i just want her to be happy.
same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button.
if you want to come, you better get your numbers in order by then.
all right, first of all-- no "first of all." i'm not in a game mood, ok?
ok, i'm going to go have fun with my friends, but not too much.
and you know in your heart that it is just a matter of time-- all day, bullets flying, babies are getting shot.
no, no, i'm not going to use you as a hand puppet or anything.
i just want to make sweet love to you because you have no idea what you've gotten into.
i mean, the room is covered with blow, moore looks like he went at it with a fucking mountain lion.
i mean, the room looks like the manson family stayed here a month.
one, we clean up this mess right now, bury it out in the desert, go home, and never look back.
or, we can easily call the police, roll the dice, take our chances, and pray to god that it's only michael who falls.
105 pounds that's got to be moved from point "a" to point "b."
now, a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, but we're denied the luxury of a visible straight line, but that line exists, and i see it.
true, it's helped me to unlock energies and see my options more clearly, but to give it credit for all of this is a little bit more than they deserve.
don't you think we ought to say some words over the bodies?
we promise, if you forgive us, that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good, not evil.
let us move from this day forward with new spirit and purpose.
you have given us a second chance, so let us take that second chance and use it to fuel our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two people that we buried here tonight can forever live on in our good deeds and positive achievements
that we, from this day forward, shall make our lives' work.
i mean, i just want to make sure that everything's sort of pressed.
i don't want to look like it's been hanging on a hanger all the time.
well, be that as it may, after camp came football, and for those of you who didn't follow the sports pages back in 1977, you might not remember the peewee powerhouse of oklahoma, who, under the leadership of yours truly,
managed to roll to an auspicious league record of 0 for 12... scoring exactly not one damn touchdown.
how the fuck am i supposed to comment on what a lot of other people thought, huh?
i mean, listen, we've all suffered an incredible trauma here, and we're in full-on grieving mode right now, and your questions are just a little bit poorly timed.
i was up at adam's study, and i found a note.
it seems to be some sort of confession about some horrible thing he did to a woman in las vegas, and... buried outside of vegas, about boyd being the ringleader... she wants to know what the hell's going on. i'm starting to freak out.
i'm just gonna bring them back home. i'm gonna come right back.
you have to pick up the cake in the morning, early.
that's what michael and adam were arguing about in the parking lot.
michael killed adam in a jealous rage, lois rejected michael, he strangled her to death... and he shot himself in the head.
adam failed to make his last payment, so his term life lapsed.
but he did have a pension account worth $150,000 and the house, valued at 350,000.
27 years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle, and i will not be derailed.
i will not be embarrassed, and i will not be denied!
i've been thinking about what you said that day-- the prayer.
about using this whole mess to bring out the good in me.
i know. i've been dealing with them, and believe me, i'm not playing with them.
kyle... i have been doing all of this by myself, ok?
i'm amazed that the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the ass-puckering rage in these soulless lizards.
you know, i just-- i just want her to be happy.
that's because-- hey, hey, hey-- we're leaving from my house in 3 hours, ok?
if you want to come, you better get your numbers in order by then.
ok, well, uh-- ok, first they said it wasunderstood that we were supposed to have gold-trimmed, padded seats, right?
and now they're trying to tell me that there's some sort of misunderstanding and that now we can't have padded ones!
"people who are wishing horrible, bad, bad things for you and your people."
[tv announcer shouting] kyle: the buck's going to stop right here, buddy.
no, no, i'm not going to use you as a hand puppet or anything.
i just want to make sweet love to you because you have no idea what you've gotten into.
i mean, the room is covered with blow, moore looks like he went at it with a fucking mountain lion.

105 pounds that's got to be moved from point "a" to point "b."
now, a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, but we're denied the luxury of a visible straight line, but that line exists, and i see it.
allow me to be the first to say that what we have done here is not a good thing.
it's clearly not a good thing, but it was, given the circumstances, the smart play.
given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we've all chosen life over death.
i mean, two wrongs don't make a right, so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
speaking for myself, i am deeply in love with the woman i'm about to marry, and i am very much looking forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society.
we promise, if you forgive us, that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good, not evil.
let us move from this day forward with new spirit and purpose.
you have given us a second chance, so let us take that second chance and use it to fuel our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two people that we buried here tonight can forever live on in our good deeds and positive achievements
that we, from this day forward, shall make our lives' work.
thank you, god, and once again, please give us your guidance and your forgiveness. amen.
the idea is to be able to, like, look at everybody and know that they're all in the same wedding, right?
i mean, i just want to make sure that everything's sort of pressed.
i don't want to look like it's been hanging on a hanger all the time.
i want everything to be, like... i just want them to all look like they're just...

i will not be embarrassed, and i will not be denied!
so tomorrow, i am walking down that aisle, come hell or high fucking water!
baby, i just want you to know that all this, everything i did, is 'cause i love you and i wanted you to have that wedding like you always wanted to have, ok?
you and moore are gonna go move those fucking bodies, do you understand me?
you are going to be hung over for 3 days, like those guys onoprahwho-- who get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes, and then they go ahead, and they just say their vows.
they say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.

kyle... i have been doing all of this by myself, ok?
i'm amazed that the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the ass-puckering rage in these soulless lizards.
you know, i just-- i just want her to be happy.
that's because-- hey, hey, hey-- we're leaving from my house in 3 hours, ok?
if you want to come, you better get your numbers in order by then.
ok, well, uh-- ok, first they said it wasunderstood that we were supposed to have gold-trimmed, padded seats, right?
and now they're trying to tell me that there's some sort of misunderstanding and that now we can't have padded ones!
"people who are wishing horrible, bad, bad things for you and your people."
[tv announcer shouting] kyle: the buck's going to stop right here, buddy.
no, no, i'm not going to use you as a hand puppet or anything.
i just want to make sweet love to you because you have no idea what you've gotten into.
i mean, the room is covered with blow, moore looks like he went at it with a fucking mountain lion.
i mean, the room looks like the manson family stayed here a month.
one, we clean up this mess right now, bury it out in the desert, go home, and never look back.
or, we can easily call the police, roll the dice, take our chances, and pray to god that it's only michael who falls.
105 pounds that's got to be moved from point "a" to point "b."
now, a straight line is the shortest distance between two points, but we're denied the luxury of a visible straight line, but that line exists, and i see it.
allow me to be the first to say that what we have done here is not a good thing.
it's clearly not a good thing, but it was, given the circumstances, the smart play.
given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not, we've all chosen life over death.
i mean, two wrongs don't make a right, so our conviction and execution would only mean more death here, not less.
speaking for myself, i am deeply in love with the woman i'm about to marry, and i am very much looking forward to raising a family and being a positive member of society.
we promise, if you forgive us, that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good, not evil.
let us move from this day forward with new spirit and purpose.
you have given us a second chance, so let us take that second chance and use it to fuel our fires of productivity so that the spirits of the two people that we buried here tonight can forever live on in our good deeds and positive achievements
that we, from this day forward, shall make our lives' work.
thank you, god, and once again, please give us your guidance and your forgiveness. amen.
the idea is to be able to, like, look at everybody and know that they're all in the same wedding, right?
i mean, i just want to make sure that everything's sort of pressed.
i don't want to look like it's been hanging on a hanger all the time.
i want everything to be, like... i just want them to all look like they're just...
how the fuck am i supposed to comment on what a lot of other people thought, huh?
i mean, listen, we've all suffered an incredible trauma here, and we're in full-on grieving mode right now, and your questions are just a little bit poorly timed.
i was up at adam's study, and i found a note.
it seems to be some sort of confession about some horrible thing he did to a woman in las vegas, and... buried outside of vegas, about boyd being the ringleader... she wants to know what the hell's going on. i'm starting to freak out.
that's what michael and adam were arguing about in the parking lot.
michael killed adam in a jealous rage, lois rejected michael, he strangled her to death... and he shot himself in the head.
adam failed to make his last payment, so his term life lapsed.
but he did have a pension account worth $150,000 and the house, valued at 350,000.
i will not be embarrassed, and i will not be denied!
so tomorrow, i am walking down that aisle, come hell or high fucking water!
baby, i just want you to know that all this, everything i did, is 'cause i love you and i wanted you to have that wedding like you always wanted to have, ok?
you and moore are gonna go move those fucking bodies, do you understand me?
hey, hey, hey-- we're leaving from my house in 3 hours, ok?
if you want to come, you better get your numbers in order by then.
i mean, the room is covered with blow, moore looks like he went at it with a fucking mountain lion.

you are going to be hung over for 3 days, like those guys onoprahwho-- who get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes, and then they go ahead, and they just say their vows.
they say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them.
you know, i just-- i just want her to be happy.
same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button.
i--i just start getting, like, lightheaded and dizzy, and then the next thing i know, i realize i haven't breathed in, like--in two minutes.
that's because-- hey, hey, hey-- we're leaving from my house in 3 hours, ok?
if you want to come, you better get your numbers in order by then.
all right, first of all-- no "first of all." i'm not in a game mood, ok?
[tv crowd cheering] boyd: and you know in your heart that it is just a matter of time-- all day, bullets flying, babies are getting shot.
if i'm the king of israel, right-- israel does not have a king.
i mean, i tell mine-- i tell mine they're little men.
i tell them that they're strong, that they make me feel joy.
according to jewish law, the blood and the limbs are considered to be a sacred part of the human spirit.
the body has to be united, or the soul can't rest in peace.
true, it's helped me to unlock energies and see my options more clearly, but to give it credit for all of this is a little bit more than they deserve.
kyle: don't you think we ought to say some words over the bodies?
we promise, if you forgive us, that we will never forget this tragedy and we will try with all our power to use it as a daily reminder that we are on this earth to do good, not evil.

i don't want to look like it's been hanging on a hanger all the time.
here's a picture of kyle, age 4, and his good friend, jo-jo the mule.
[laughing] now... evidently, when they got to camp, kyle and boyd over there had some serious arguments.
mr. fisher: ...who exactly was kyle's best friend, boyd or the mule?
boyd: well, fish had a less than normal relationship with that ass.
well, be that as it may, after camp came football, and for those of you who didn't follow the sports pages back in 1977, you might not remember the peewee powerhouse of oklahoma, who, under the leadership of yours truly,
managed to roll to an auspicious league record of 0 for 12... scoring exactly not one damn touchdown.
i'm just gonna bring them back home. i'm gonna come right back.
you have to pick up the cake in the morning, early.
the sparkler would burn hot, then hotter, then even hotter, and then there'd be this one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook perfect-- just perfect.
it would only last a second, but that second was it.
27 years i have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle, and i will not be derailed.
i will not be embarrassed, and i will not be denied!
i've been thinking about what you said that day-- the prayer.
about using this whole mess to bring out the good in me.
i'm amazed that the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the ass-puckering rage in these soulless lizards.
you know, i just-- i just want her to be happy.

this way, i can drive both of us to the motor-vehicle bureau in your car.
then, soon as you pass the test, you can be driving.
i have ordered the reopening of this prison to send a message to the criminals of springfield.
if you commit a violent crime in my town... you are going to end up here.
you may remember me from such automated information kiosks... as "welcome to springfield airport" and "where's nordstrom?"
while you're enjoying our hall of wonders... your car will, unfortunately, be subject to repeated break-ins-
there must be some cool stuff around here- bullets, dead body photos, what have you.
he keeps that stuff in his closet, but he says i'm not allowed in there.
i have ordered the reopening of this prison to send a message to the criminals of springfield.

i just don't know if i can keep doing this every night.
well, you know, every once in a while you could stay home.
the one day you drive in is the one day someone parks in your spot?
actually, the attendant says that same miata has been parking in my spot for the last few months.
suppose person a knew of a commodity that was never used by its owner, person b.
however, person c was in need of said commodity and person a was able to provide it, knowing person b would never be inconvenienced... hypothetically.
i got another photographer to do that montréal thing, so you can go.
oh, well, i already lined up another writer, so you can go.
oh, well, i also sold my watch to buy you a comb.
oh, no, i just sold my hair to buy you a watch chain.
i know a little something about women, and i know when i'm being kissed.
and yet, you have no idea when you're being tossed out.
i'm going all the way to the country house... in connecticut.
well, i thought you and dad sold that place years ago.
in fact, it's more than a marriage, because it's based on trust.
look, i know i shouldn't have rented out your parking spot, but that was one indiscretion in eight years of loyal service.
my accountant says i need to drive in once a year for tax purposes.
the one day you drive in is the one day someone parks in your spot?
i did for a good part of the evening, but about 7:15, my friend binnie came over.
when i opened the door, the cat ran out, and when we went to look for it, it wasn't at tavern on the green, so we--

but then when we win the celebration goes all night until the break of 8 p.m.
you could put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
george, the susan ross foundation is having an event this weekend.
oh, i just, uh, leased a house out in the hamptons, and i have got to get out there this weekend and sign the papers.
well, you know, i've been lying about my income for a few years.
i figured i could afford a fake house in the hamptons.
but then when we win, the celebration goes all night until the break of 8pm.
you know, you can put that whole schedule right in your daily planner.
and sippel gets out tomorrow morning without a job, without a place to live, and no support.
so i called a friend at the diocese to see if a bed was available anywhere and he laughed.
i'm a priest forever, but not allowed to be a priest.
i'm a man forever, but not allowed to be a man.
but the church is still a part of his life and--
but if you abandon him... i am aware of the victim.
sippel spent ten years in jail for the molestation of a 1 4-year-old boy upstate.
a state law requires sippel must register as a sex offender with police and is expected to reside in the area.

and when this little goldfish is hungry, he thinks he's been hungry his whole life.
and when he's dying, this little goldfish thinks he's been dying his whole life.
he keeps talking to his father, as if nino was still alive.
this adebisi who raped peter, we can't kill him, at least not yet.
all those wild beasts attacking each other, ferocious lions running down to the watering hole, brutalizing antelopes and gazelles.

i don't want my grandson to know where it came from.
we are, of course, pleased that the state budget increased its line item for more correctional officers.
your presence here will help alleviate stress between the cos and the inmates as well as increase safety for all.
now, i myself stood where you're standing some 30 years ago.
the warden back then gave us a piece of advice i'd like to pass on to you.
if jojo or muffy are gonna pass through those pearly gates.
how much you wanna bet the animals are wondering if their masters are gonna make it?
you leave cyril where he is and schillinger will suck his bones dry.
well, schillinger's gonna suck anyway, so why should your brother be the one that's spared?
a federal court today upheld a new state law that requires sex offenders released from prison to register with local police.
victims' rights groups are calling the decision a total victory because the law permits neighbours to be notified if a sex offender moves into their community.

in other words, when this little goldfish is happy, he thinks he's been happy his whole life since his whole life was only 30 seconds ago.
and when this little goldfish is hungry, he thinks he's been hungry his whole life.
i tell you, antonio, i think that peter's mind has snapped.
he keeps talking to his father, as if nino was still alive.
how come there's never a programme where the animals get along, where they help each other?
is it possible for, say, a flat-billed platypus to help a green-eyed cockatoo cross the street?

then he'd take his shirt off and his trousers and make us do likewise
he'd lie us across the green couch that's been thrown out now... and abuse us sexually.
i realised that helge was a very clean man, with all those baths
i thought i'd share it with the rest of the family
i've been waiting for this ever since, and you just run away
from your father, who drew lots for you and your sister
your ears can take a story from across the seven seas
when helge was a young lad he told me he had trouble finding ladyfriends
i also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my helge
though it may be hard to find the words to describe what you have meant and still mean to me
so i think it would be appropriate if you stood up, leaving snoot in his seat, and gave your father an apology
it won't belittle you in any way to say you're sorry
i'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that i hope you die
i'm sorry that you're all such cunts that you believe her
i also realise now that what i did to my children is unforgivable
i know that all of you especially my children will hate me for the rest of your lives
all the same, i wanted to tell you that you will always be my children
i have always loved you and i love you now wherever you are or whatever you do
we grew up here, so we know how to treat customers

i want to say how much i appreciate your coming today
i also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my helge
though it may be hard to find the words to describe what you have meant and still mean to me
but with your appetite for life and infinite love for your family, you have given me everything a wife could wish for
i think i'll take the opportunity to say a word or two to my children
i think it is fantastic to see how well you have done, especially when i consider how little you once were
so i think it would be appropriate if you stood up, leaving snoot in his seat, and gave your father an apology
it won't belittle you in any way to say you're sorry
i'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that i hope you die
i'm sorry that you're all such cunts that you believe her
after the dance around the house a note appears on the toastmaster's glass and here is what it says:
a certain man urges his sister to read letter to his father a letter
in any case... it is kind of your brother to help you get started
and it seems that there is peace in the family again
- especially my children will hate me for the rest of your lives
all the same, i wanted to tell you that you will always be my children
it all seems like yesterday... the moment we closed the negotiations and bought the landed estates.
still, it was 1971... the year our family walked up the stairs.
i've waited for years for this and now you're walking away.
for your father, who decided on yours and your sisters fate..
sorry that i speak up so late, but i'm still shocked.
at a quarter past seven, your father will give me instructions.
words can not describe... how much you still mean to me.
besides your lust for life and good care for your family... you've gave me everything a woman can ask for.
ever since you told us you wanted to become a singer... and you joined the trotsk...
the socialistic youth... we knew you would go your own way.
but there are hardly any cultures and countries... which you didn't visit.
with this i want to welcome your boyfriend to the family.

and i understand now... that it's unforgivable what i've done to my children.
and i know that all of you... and especially my children... will hate me for the rest of my live.
that i, when all of you have gone home... never will see you again.
and i understand now... that it's unforgivable what i've done to my children.
i always loved you and will keep doing so for the rest of my life... where ever in this world you may be.
christian, to you i would like to say... you put up a good fight, my son.
i've been asked to inquire whether you are interested in the lodge.
i don't see you as one of the brethren, i must say.
yet it was right back in the summer of 1971 when my little family walked up the steps.
my dear wife, helene, michael, and the twins and the twins.
then he'd take his shirt off, and his trousers, and made us do likewise.
then he'd put us across the green couch, that's been thrown out now, and raped us.
i realised that helge was a very clean man, with all those baths.
i thought i'd share it with the rest of the family.
forgive me for disturbing you again, but i forgot the most important bit.
we're here for my father's birthday, not all kinds of other stuff.
lovely women you let go by year after year because there is so little man in you.
i could also make a speech about you and your sister.
as ever, you were only interested in yourself and your sick mind.
now you sling mud at the family that only ever wanted the best for you.
i want to say how much i appreciate your coming today.
i also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my helge.
though it may be hard, as i can hardly find the words to describe what you have meant, and mean to me.
but with your appetite for life and infinite care for your family,
most interesting, although your father and i had hoped you'd chose law.
but goodness, the contacts you haven't had with foreign countries and peoples aren't worth mentioning.
i always thought you'd make a really good author one day.
when christian was small, for all of you who don't know, he had a loyal companion called snoot,
christian, i think that snoot has been with you today and, quite frankly, i think you both rather upset your father.
so i think it would be appropriate if you stood up, leaving snoot in his seat, and gave your father an apology.
i'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that i hope you die.
i'm sorry you're all such cunts that you listen to her.
i've seen a real black sambo his face was black as pitch

i know that all of you especially my children, will hate me for the rest of your lives.
all the same, i want to tell you that you will always be my children,
and i have loved you and love you no matter where in the world you are or what you do.
yet it was right back in the summer of 1971 when my little family walked up the steps.
my dear wife, helene, michael, and the twins and the twins.
i don't know if you remember, but dad was always having baths.
he'd take linda and me into the study as there was something he had to do first.
lovely women you let go by year after year because there is so little man in you.
i could also make a speech about you and your sister.
i also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my helge.

i always thought you'd make a really good author one day.
when christian was small, for all of you who don't know, he had a loyal companion called snoot, who didn't exist.
if you were the one at the receiving end, there was nothing you could do about it.
but dear christian, it is so important to be able to distinguish fact from fiction.
christian, i think that snoot has been with you today and quite frankly, i think you both rather upset your father.
so i think it would be appropriate if you stood up leaving snoot in his seat...
and that your husband told you to get out and that you did so.
i'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that i hope you die.
in any case, it is kind of your brother to help you get started.
and it seems that there is peace in the family again.

i just want to say that i know that when you pack up and go home it will be the last time i see you.
i also see now that what i did to my children is unforgivable.
it all seems like yesterday... the moment we closed the negotiations and bought the estate.
still, it was only 1971... that our family walked up the stairs.
for your father, who decided on yours and your sisters fate..
brilliant, to let him choose his own fate in your speech...
when helge was a little boy... he told me he couldn't get a girlfriend.
i told him, listen boy... buy a big potatoe and stick it in your swimmingtrunks.
i mean by the looks of your waitresses over there it seems you're still a quite popular man here.
i was getting to think that it actually pays like to drop a bomb the way you did.
ever since you told us you wanted to become a singer... and you joined the trotsk...
the socialistic youth... we knew you would go your own way.
but you'll have to solve that between the both of you.
you've told us exiting stories tonight... maybe a bit too exiting.
...fidliha kola tomrassi gassi bum the black masses comes from umblagidarum
i saw a little indian just lately his face was fire-red he talked very strange.
helene is a bit too shy to do it herself, isn't that so helene?
anyway it's sweet of your brother that he helps you to get started.
pour my daughter some port, so we can raise glasses too.
pour my daughter some port, so we can raise glasses too.
that i, when all of you have gone home... never will see you again.
and i understand now... that it's unforgivable what i've done to my children.
i always loved you and will keep doing so for the rest of my life... where ever in this world you may be.
christian, to you i would like to say... you put up a good fight.
i've been asked to inquire whether you are interested in the lodge
i don't see you as one of the brethren, i must say
i don't know if you remember, but dad was always having baths
he'd take linda and me into the study... as there was something he had to do first
as ever, you were only interested in yourself and your sick mind
now you sling mud at the family that only ever wanted the best for you
i also want to say a word or two to thank my husband, my helge
though it may be hard to find the words to describe what you have meant and still mean to me
i always thought you'd make a really good author one day
when christian was small, for all of you who don't know, he had a loyal companion called snoot
christian, i think that snoot has been with you today and i think you both rather upset your father
so i think it would be appropriate if you stood up, leaving snoot in his seat, and gave your father an apology
yet you left the room when your husband ordered you out
i'm sorry you're so hypocritical and corrupt that i hope you die
pour my daughter some port, so that i can drink a toast with her
pass the port to my daughter so i can drink a toast with her
i know that when you pack up and go home... it will be the last time i see you
i also realise now that what i did to my children is unforgivable
all the same, i wanted to tell you that you will always be my children
i have always loved you and i love you now wherever you are or whatever you do
it all seems like yesterday... the moment we closed the negotiations and bought the landed estates.
still, it was 1971... the year our family walked up the stairs.
i've waited for years for this and now you're walking away.
for your father, who decided on yours and your sisters fate..
sorry that i speak up so late, but i'm still shocked.
at a quarter past seven, your father will give me instructions.
words can not describe... how much you still mean to me.
besides your lust for life and good care for your family... you've gave me everything a woman can ask for.
ever since you told us you wanted to become a singer... and you joined the trotsk...
the socialistic youth... we knew you would go your own way.
but there are hardly any cultures and countries... which you didn't visit.
with this i want to welcome your boyfriend to the family.

it's like this... sometimes when you feed peas to a baby, you gotta make that airplane sound?
as a woman, how can you not only defend such sexism but perpetuate it with your own articles, like... "shut up and maybe he'll love you"?
look who's here- the one who made us all look foolish.
you have a lot of nerve showing up at work today, lady.
it's why boxers duck or possums play dead or magicians wave this hand while they're doing something else with this one.
it's how i've survived all these years, and that's a lesson from me to you.

if you'd read the article, you'd know that it was about listening to your partner with compassion.
look, i have the same criticism of blush as you do, and sure, our editors can be superficial and sexist and...
but they projected things on the wall and quoted feminist poets and i got all turned around.
you should've come back with some of the good things that this magazine does for women.

- aniel, that's female for lamb by the way,he doesn't speak of french at all,or just a bit like there aren't unemployed french guys in any case, the mpe girl sure wasn't blind
marc,you show him his tasks and how do i do that if he deosn't speak french?
-osa i find you rather excited girls why, we're not made of stone maybe he's more into fresh flesh?
hey, your memory is as short as the rest of you?
hey, no joke, you sure he figured out how it works?
he may look good, but he's not more clever for all that.
you could wait for me we got to pick up your suit for the wedding unreal, you could have thought about it sooner what.. what could i have thought about - i'm fed up spending my weekends in shopping malls
if you want to go naked to that wedding, that's your business.
..i'll call you back you little prick,you really got a kick out of that one hey?
it's not the mpe who sent you, they haven't sent anyone go, get out .. asshole
of course it isn't, they're all bullshitting, you're not going to play their game?
you were with him...answer marc,you were with him i teel you i was drunk, anyway what does it change?
you know too well what it changes you think i haven't understood what's going on?
-well, tell me then, if you know... nothing happened, fuck i know you marc,you're not the same since that guy got here
what you talking about, what's all this: you can't stay here?
you can't understand what's happening, it will never be as before as before what?
this is not a man about to fight to his last breath.
he was out of ammunition, the mexican army was storming the battlements.

there will come a day, darok, when your services as my aide are no longer required.
now get out of here before i forget we are brothers.
i plan to attack the trelka v starbase and push into cardassian territory.
i'll hit the manora shipyards, the jem'hadar breeding facility, the supply depots...
it would take half the ninth fleet to destroy trelka v.
- the defiant should remain here, just in case the jem'hadar try their own cavalry raid.
but it may be prudent for the defiant and a dozen other starships to be waiting for us when we return.

i did not expect to hear anything further on this subject from you.

kor came to see me, asking my help as a friend.
he is an old man, with no family and no influence left in the empire.
he asked nothing except for the chance to fight and die as a klingon warrior.
i told him i would speak with you about finding him a command.
he couldn't bear someone like me joining the elite officer ranks.
so to my father's embarrassment and my everlasting shame, my application was denied.
with the mark of kor on my record, i could not join as a common soldier.
i spent five years as a labourer aboard general shivang's flagship.
it is an unworthy reason to bar a man from serving the empire.
worf, you've been living among this democratic rabble for too long.
i'm contradicting what i said about wanting to set myself apart from my previous hosts, but the memories i have of being with him are so vivid.
i'd give almost anything for the chance to be together one more time, the two of us side by side.
have you settled on an attack plan for the starbase on trelka v?
i'm sending the malpara and ning'tao in ahead of the squadron.
only a handful of engineers in the fleet knew how to operate them.
before we left chronos, i spent three days taking the device apart with my bare hands and putting it back together again.
worf has done nothing, and i mean nothing, to deserve you.
shouldn't you find someone who's willing to win your heart, not just inherit it?
what will become of him when we return to deep space 9?
i plan to speak with chancellor gowron to try and find kor some assignment on the homeworld.
it will take us 3 hours, 45 minutes to reach them.
if the jem'hadar could be forced to drop out of warp, they would not have time to catch us before we rendezvous with the defiant.
and such a man would have to be certain of his abilities.
such a man would not take the job unless he were certain.
if he had executed davy crockett, he would have considered it a point of pride.
in 1836 crockett was 49, quite old for the standards of the time.
if you do, then you should not doubt that he died a hero's death.
if you do not believe in the legend, then he was just a man and it does not matter how he died.

the usual. i have the same conversation over and over again.
everyone's shocked at first, then they scan my face for signs of the person they knew as dax.

i was a young officer once. i know how irrelevant the past can seem.
we would be honoured if you would tell us about caleb iv.
you must remember that in those days the cloaking device was a new piece of technology.
only a handful of engineers in the fleet knew how to operate them.
the federation will rue the day they dared to challenge the klingon empire!
we will take caleb iv and raise our banner over the smoking ruins of their outpost!

one of the cia's greatest spies dmitri polyakov is caught by the kgb and strip-searched
his head is held in an arm lock to prevent him taking poison
the soldiers may have been on alert but for us and the others who went out in the cold it was actual war."
--- captioned by luis luque santoro --- --- cnn's cold war series ---
allied scientists of los alamos leave for the new mexico desert to watch the test of the first atomic bomb.
they had been working for years under a blanket of total secrecy
ted hall at 19 was the youngest scientist on the project.
"i was there or at least i was there in a truck or a lorry some distance away or what it was considered to be a safe distance away.
for ted hall the cold war had begun the year before.
"i decided to give atomic secrets to the russians because seemed to me that it was important that there should be no monopoly which could turn one nation into a menace and turn it loose on the world as nazi germany developed.
the kgb had several sources inside los alamos, unknown to one another.
the scientist klaus fuchs and ted hall, both passed on details on how to detonate nuclear weapons by implossion.
a principle so new to soviet science that there was no equivalent word in russian.
in 1949 the soviets exploded their first atom bomb, triggered by implossion, it copied key elements of the american bomb that destroyed nagasaki.
the atom spies had saved the soviet union perhaps 2 years of research.
ted hall was questioned by the fbi in march 1951, but not charged for lack of evidence.
a month later kgb agents julius and ethel rosenberg were sentenced to death.
amid the anti-soviet fervor of the time they became the only spies ever executed in peace-time america.
the kgb operated in the west but the cia confronted a closed world.
trains crossing the finnish border into russia was sealed by steel shutters.
most early infiltration operations into the soviet union were doomed from the start.
western agents were betrayed by kgb spies like the british inteligence officer kim philby.
"philby on the right holds a press conference to deny charges that he was involved in the disappearance of burgess and maclean."
- "if there was a third man, weren't you in fact the third man?"
he told us about the numbers of people, he told us about the coordinates, where and how the operations would be carried out, whether they would be parachuted in or send in by sea.
those areas were of course surrounded by soviet counterinteligence and they were caught.
"after we were dropped in, we were tied up and taken off to the kgb.
when the investigator from moscow arrived, and he arrived suspiciously quickly by nightfall,
before we spoke at that conference we were given scripts that we had two days to learn by heart."
kudriavtsev told the world of his great error in ever thinking ill of the soviet union let alone trying to topple it.
"it was hard for me to say those things, very hard,
but i had to do it in order to not be taken back to the lubyanka."
"you began to believe... that this was a service that really had enormous coverage and that everything we did not a sparrow could fall... without this enormous kgb finding out about it, because in terms of our own individual experiences
we know, or we knew... that the operations we were involved in had been betrayed by people like kim philby."
the korean war provided further blows to the cia's self confidence, highlighting gaps in forecasting and assessment.
"the cia was wrong about the start of the war, they were wrong about the chinese involvement and intervention in the war and they were wrong about the capabilities of the north korean forces.
i think the korean war, in terms of its intelligence failures left a lot of lessons for the policy community and the intelligence community.
and one of those lessons was that indeed we would have to get better technical intelligence and make more of a commitment to signals intelligence and communications intelligence.
berlin was a communications hub where countless soviet bloc phone and teleprinter lines crisscrossed beneath the city.
to intercept them the americans and britishs drove a tunnel deep into the soviet sector.
the purpose of the berlin tunnel was to tap the communications lines of the soviet forces in east germany, in poland and their links with moscow.
in order to provide current intelligence on those forces and also early warning.
the lines from the taps would come down into the tunnel itself and first they would be amplified, because then we had to run the lines up into the area of the warehouse where we had hundreds and hundreds of recorders
that operated day and night and recorded every single bit of this stuff."
captured by the north koreans, he witnessed the west's bombing of civilians.
"when i saw these enormous american flying fortresses, flying low over what seemed to be defenseless korean villages,
blake went home to britain in the first group of pows released from korea after the 1953 armistice.
- "how did you find the food out there, mr. blake?"
blake slipped back into british intelligence only now he was a kgb spy.
"i was given a minox camera and i carried that minox camera with me whenever i went to work,
"this was an argument not to take any measures against the tunnel.
not to send any disinformation down the tunnel, not to show that we knew anything about the tunnel.
this was a very important consideration, because as long as blake remained inside british intelligence we knew he'd be of great value to us.
so the berlin tunnel operated courtesy of the kgb and the cia basked in a signals intelligence bonanza.
"we got military order of battle on soviet forces in germany and in poland.
we got information which came from moscow, for example on the whole reorganization of the ministry of defense
but the real, the real kicker in all this was the fact that we got something we never expected to get:
we got all kinds of, of personality data, operational data on the operations of the soviet military counterintelligence.
so that we were, at that point, totally on top, we thought of the counterintelligence picture in ... in ... in berlin."
but the kgb was just choosing its moment to pull the plug on the tunnel.
"they warned me before hand that it was going to happen, so i was rather on tenterhooks... as you can imagine, what the outcome would be."
heavy rain one april night in 1956 caused a cable failure, giving the kgb the excuse it needed
five years later george blake was himself betrayed and sentenced to 42 years in prison.
he had given the kgb the names of nearly 400 agents working for the west, supposedly on condition that they wouldn't be harmed.
"during my trial, which was held in camera, so everything could be said there there was no mention at all, it wasn't part of the prosecution's case, that i had been responsible for the death of any number of agents."
but armed with blake's names, moscow simply waited until they had sufficient additional evidence.
"george blake had that innocent mind in a sense; he's still a very naive man.
he didn't want to know that many people he betrayed were executed and i think we even discussed this subject at one point, and he wouldn't believe it.
the west was desperate for detail about the size and strength of soviet forces, glimpsed, and photographed, at moscow air shows or may day parades.
it was the soviet missile force which worried the cia most and about which they knew the least.
"there was limited human intelligence about the missile deployments in the soviet union.
there were some communications intelligence which would suggest that this facility or this town may be involved in missile activities, because of communications with known missile sites.
the cia's own reconnaissance plane, the u-2, flew high over russia to photograph soviet bases
but in four years of searching, found no operational intercontinental ballistic missile launch sites.
then in 1960, the americans successfully launched a satellite fitted with a camera.
after 17 orbits the film capsule was ejected, caught mid-air and brought back to earth for analysis.
a subsequent flight confirmed the existence of just one soviet icbm launch site.
the rest of the puzzle's pieces were provided by perhaps the greatest spy of the cold war.
"this is a photograph of oleg penkovsky, colonel in the red army with all of his medals which he earned during world war ii a handsome soldier... and a great american patriot.
this photograph was taken in the hotel in london in april 1961, after one of our meetings where oleg penkovsky on the left and me on the right enjoying a small glass of wine."
they were not 10 feet tall, they were about my size, 6 foot 2."
penkovsky revealed the soviets' lack of atomic warheads and their problems with guidance systems.
then you've got a weapon that no technical amount of information can give you and this is what penkovsky was able to give us."
penkovsky's information was critical to the united states during the 1962 cuban missile crisis.
u-2 photographs revealed the presence on cuba of soviet missiles for which penkovsky had already handed over the operating manuals.
with the world closer to nuclear conflict than at any time in the cold war, intelligence experts were summoned to the white house to brief president kennedy
the last time joe bulik had seen him, was in paris.
"i never had the feeling that he was in danger otherwise i would have insisted that he stay.
"we'd gotten a signal from penkovsky that a dead drop was loaded and then we sent dick jacobs to service that dead drop.
he was arrested... and as soon as that happened, we knew the case was over, it was dead and that penkovsky was in the hands of the kgb.
'only if you confess everything, and repent fully, can you hope for mercy'.
that's probably why penkovsky's life was not spared... he didn't confess everything.
in the event of war, they would be in place to spy behind enemy lines.
the kgb never lacked recruits, some served for money, some for ideology and some for the sheer excitement of living a secret life.
because there is this smell of adventure, the smell of risk, the smell of uncertainty.
because when you go off to meet an agent, you never know whether you're going to be arrested.
we would be invited to private parties, and the attitude towards us was good.
but as the sixties went on, there were those big disasters, with blake and the other kgb spies.
satellites could now intercept radio communications and data from test launches of the opposition's missiles.
film taken in space no longer even had to be returned to earth.
through photography and electronic eavesdropping, each side received huge flows of information, often too much for the analysts to handle.
technological spying even played a part in helping the superpowers edge towards peace.
"the technical systems were almost essential to our arms control process.
we learnt just all kinds of things about russian military systems from the photographs and from the electronic listening.
'if you ratify this treaty... this is how closely i can monitor it... and check on whether they are complying with the terms of the treaty'".
despite a fleet of spy ships, listening posts worldwide and sputniks overhead,
"relations between the various areas of counterintelligence and with the department which handled interrogations were very amicable.
there were all sorts of people there, and it was a friendly atmosphere.
there were many cases of injustice, particularly in the later years which really bothered me.
reprisals were taken against people solely on the grounds that they had different political opinions
or against people who wanted a different, better form of socialism."
vera wollenberger joined the east german peace movement in 1981, encouraged by her husband knud.
it was such an extreme situation, rather as if one had died for a moment, and then returned to life.
the surprising thing was the reports were written as if about a stranger, not about a wife.
in 1978 bulgarian intelligence asked the kgb to help them kill the emigre writer and broadcaster georgi markov.
markov was murdered at a london bus stop by a stranger who "accidentally"
i was not involved in any execution, but i was aware
and i always say that knowledge... does not imply a misdeed, does it?
the temptation was always there for the spymasters to earn favor from the leadership whether by covert action, or just slanting a routine report.
"when we drew up reports... of course we dramatized those bits which pointed out the threat to the soviet union.
by emphasizing the right things, i'd ensure that my report would go straight to the top, to the politburo.
if the report was dull and boring, it would just get filed away.
i don't think correct intelligence or incorrect intelligence... is going to bring any great changes in that course."
1988, kim philby is buried with full honors in a moscow cemetery.
to the end the kgb opened his mail and bugged his phone.
it seemed as if the age of the spy was over.
in fact throughout the eighties, the cia had been carefully establishing agents... within soviet intelligence and defense circles.
precious sources like avionics expert, adolf tolkachev, seen here on his way to a meeting in moscow with his cia contact.
the kgb suddenly started to arrest the cia's most important soviet spies.
"in 1985, we began to lose cases, by which i mean soviet officials working for us and some of them disappeared.
polyakov had retired after 18 years of spying, when the kgb pounced.
he had been recruited while at the united nations in new york.
"he said: 'i'm dissatisfied with the way things are in the soviet union, the government does not look out for the people, they're headed on a course of war with the united states
and, they can't possibly win it and the only people that are going to suffer out of this are the russian people.
we'd met on the queen elizabeth every day that it was at sea, sometimes twice a day, we reviewed literally thousands of pictures of soviets who had been in the united states ...or stationed around the world
and he identified a number of them by picture and by name."
with polyakov eventually we were able to look at that organization, the gru, his organization, from the top down, as well as look at the kgb... and the soviet ministry of foreign affairs and... the communist party apparatus."
in 1991, sandy grimes joined the team investigating the cia's agent losses.
in charge, jeanne vertefeuille... now suspicious there was a kgb mole in their ranks.
trying to pin down a counterintelligence case when you're looking for a mole is always a very difficult and long-term job.
when we compiled a list of how many people could have done it we came up with 198 people."
the mole hunt took three years... homing in on cia counterintelligence officer aldrich ames.
"we had just received records from one of the banks rick had and dan is reading these things off and i'm entering them in the in the computer and, my god, it was unbelievable.
on 17 may, rick would had reported having had a lunch with his soviet contact chuvakhin
18 may there's a deposit into his checking account for $9,000.
on the 21st february 1994, ames was arrested for spying along with his wife, rosario, after years of high living.
she was the one who was interested in spending money and who liked to live high on the hog and i think he wanted to sort of to buy her love and the way to buy her love was to get her expensive things."
ames had no illusions about the real price of his treachery.
"i knew quite well, when i gave the names of... of our agents in the soviet union, that i was exposing them to... to the full machinery of...
counterespionage and the law and then prosecution, and capital punishment certainly, in the case of kgb and gru officers.
i inured myself to ... against... you know... a reaction to that."
dmitri polyakov was one of the 25 agents betrayed by ames.
polyakov was tried in secret, critical of the soviet leadership to the end.
he had given the west precious information on soviet missiles, nuclear strategy, chemical and biological warfare.
yet so many spies paid with their freedom, or their lives in destructive cycles of tit for tat.
"the men like polyakov gave up names, they gave up secrets.
i did the same thing... for reasons that i considered sufficient to myself.
i gave up the names... of some of the same people who had earlier... given up others.
when edward ware bought a building plot in a west country village, he thought he would make a killing.
but his plans for six luxury homes were halted when archaeologists uncovered an ancient burial ground.
this sounds like a really exciting site, at least 2 to 3,000 years old, but the big unknown is how many were buried there and who were they?
'the site lies in an old farmyard in the small village of bleadon near weston-super-mare.
'before being allowed to build, the developer had to have an archaeological survey done.
'by chance, one of the first trenches uncovered a ring of six strange pits.
'but the bones in the first one were in a very poor state.'
as you can see, there are a number of long bones - two parallel here, and a socket end, possibly a femur, in front of us.
'with the skull and the leg bones starting to appear, 'it looked like a male.'
i suppose we're used to graves being elongated and people being buried laid out.
this pit here is a more appropriate grave for somebody buried in this crouched position.
a position that maybe has ideas of being asleep or slightly submissive or maybe even reflects the way in which a baby lies in the foetal position.
what you can see here is the excavation of human remains of late bronze age date - that's probably about 1000 bc.
they're important as it's rare to find skeletons of this date.
not an archaeological feature in the way potshards or a grain are.
they are dead people and we must consider that all the time.
'andy had the evidence - fragments of pottery from a burial pit.'
we could only say late prehistoric - plain, black and not roman or later.
'every part is labelled and bagged before going to the bone specialist.
'records show that the village of bleadon dates back to saxon times.
'but i wanted to know what the area would have been like in the bronze age.
'our illustrator, jane brayne, is an expert at recreating the past.
and the edge seems to come just behind those houses there.
and the site is right at the edge of the dry area and by those drainage ditches. it would have been a wet, marshy environment.
'much of the information jane needs will come from the site itself.
'every bucket of excavated soil is painstakingly sieved, 'revealing tiny carbonised seeds 'and the bones of fish and small animals.
'samples of soil are taken, which will tell us about the vegetation 'which once covered and surrounded the site.
'and in fields below the village, deep cores are bored from the soil 'to find out how long ago it stopped being a marsh.'
i hope i've got a head for heights 'cause i'm going up to look at the site from above.
what you get from up here, about 60ft above the site, is an idea of its layout.
for the first time i can really see that there's a cluster of six pits in a circle, two of which we know have got complete burials in them.
another contains bits of human bone and the others haven't been studied.
and further on from that, they've been burying animals - sheep, possibly some bits of pig so there were all sorts of strange, probably ritual activities going on.
'back at the burial, there were problems - time to remove the skull 'but it just wouldn't budge.'
we have been but with the gravel on the side, you can't get much down.
see if you can give him a gentle rock now - see if you get any movement at all.
'to find out, simon will send a bit of leg bone away for carbon dating.
'the discovery of the bleadon man made me wonder if any of his relatives live in the village today.
'to find out, we called a meeting 'and asked for volunteers to take part in a dna survey.
'all were asked to give details of their forebears and donate a blood sample for analysis.
'the blood samples we sent to erica helgelberg, at cambridge university, 'who specialises in comparing dna from different populations.'
anthropologists are always rushing off and trying to get dna samples from people all over the world.
we don't really know that much about the background of british people - they're a mix of celtic, anglo-saxon and viking, and relatively few studies have been done on british populations.
it's a challenge to go to an english village and find out from scratch just how many dna sequences we will detect among these villagers.
'from cambridge, it was off to manchester university 'to meet facial reconstruction specialist richard neave.
'i was very anxious to know if he could rebuild the shattered skull.'
it's as if someone's just broken it into bits, to give me hours of amusement putting it together again.
but all the indications are that it's going to be possible to do that.
'now the skull is complete, a plaster cast is made 'and this becomes the foundation for the facial reconstruction.
'richard's assistant, caroline, has to drill and insert over 20 pegs into the cast, 'each one representing the depth of facial tissue at that exact point.'
the pegs were bad enough but when you put the eyeballs in as well!
'next, the layers of muscle, soft tissue and skin are added.'
it looks like a strange hat at the moment, doesn't it?
'while i was away, the excavation of the second burial had been done.
the one day we weren't on site, look what came up with the burial.
i think this object will change the whole way we think about the site.
'at the conservation centre in salisbury, i met with mark corney.
'i wanted his expert opinion on this new find 'which had now been x-rayed.'
i would think it was late prehistoric, um, most probably iron age.
'at southampton university, animal bones specialist dale sergeantson 'had just received a huge pile of bones from the site.'
my image of this man from bleadon is that he's a farmer.
does your first look at the animal bones bear this out?
they certainly had dogs to guard the sheep and cattle and we found a bit of evidence for them in the site.
that's a tooth and we can get an idea from that of the sort of size of dog it was.
it was perfectly normal - people ate their horses in the iron age, they ate every animal that died on the site.
and, in fact, that's a cow's tibia and it's been butchered to be put into a cooking pot and stewed, so that the lovely nutritious marrow can come out of the bone to be eaten.
i think we've probably got a fairly typical iron age assemblage here.
'some of these ancient breeds are very different from today's 'as i found out at the cotswold countryside park.'
these are soays - small, slender, their wool can be plucked instead of shorn and both sexes have horns.
these are dexter cattle, the sort our iron age man would have had.
'but the evidence was pointing 'to a later date and only the radiocarbon dates would finally resolve this.'
this is the drawing i made on site to get a good sense of the landscape and the feel of the place generally.
we know now that, the whole area was much more wooded than thought, so i've brought the trees forward and hopefully given a sense of the settlement being surrounded by trees, by quite dense woodland - the species that you would find today in this kind of environment
where it was really quite wet - willows, which cover the somerset levels, but also oak and a lot of ash, there's a lot of ash.
we know from the faunal remains that these people had horses - three skulls were found on site - and they would have been quite small, something like an exmoor pony.
and we know that people in the iron age had dogs.
so, a drawing like this is very much a coming-together of a lot of different information.
'in jane's final illustration, we see a landscape of fields and farms.
'and downhill from the settlement, lying in a woodland clearing 'at the edge of the salt marsh, is the burial site.'
'in manchester, richard was putting the final touches to bleadon man.'
i feel i've almost got to know him from having seeing him in the ground as a skeleton, and then seeing richard rebuilding the skull, and the face emerging, but it's still a surprise.
i think it's a very strong face, it's almost got a touch of authority or nobility about it.
yet, it's a person who probably had a hard life - which figures in the iron age.
i'd love to have met him in real life and been able to talk to him but that's one thing archaeology will never let us do.
i think it's primarily because the archaeological evidence that we gathered meticulously doesn't correlate with this instrumental data.
and it's nice that when you look at a site in that detail, you expect to be able to correlate the finds, the pottery with the instrumental data fairly tightly - here, we have a huge difference.
but the unpredictability is the very reason why andrew and i actually do this.
now, we've got to explain how we fit this all together again.
'another surprise was the results of the dna study 'and erica was here to explain.'
we can't say for sure that you're direct descendants but it's quite clear that you do trace back to a common origin with this man and i think that's nice.
or so i felt, and that's where i made my mistake

before ah ching worked at sm bay, he was a clerk in an office
one day, he met some one new i just started today.
how cool lf it wasn't for you, you think i'd be a hustler now?
if it wasn't for you, you think i'd be living in this dump?
jet looked every detail of that house, he pictures on the wall... the souvenirs on the shelves... the old clock... and the room warmly lit by the sun
suddenly, he realized that it was all he would have wanted
ah ching was good to him, and he thought he was faithful to ah ching
sometimes, he wondered if love was so deep, how could... he ever change for a mere stranger

your honour, the man who claims to be jimmy's son bears the physical features of his mother.
his father's genetic information could simply have been recessive in this case.
margaret blackhorse is a renowned practitioner of the navajo healing art, whose published journals are presently archived in the library of congress.
this is more than just the testimony of a medicine woman.
and, as it turns out, both were necessary in revealing the truth.
but not only do the remains belong to pfc jimmy blackhorse, but they reflect the spirit of a different man.
in 1804, president thomas jefferson... commissioned meriwether lewis and william clark... to explore the vast, uncharted territories of the northwest.
what most people don't know is that there was a second expedition... led by two other men... men that may not have possessed the courage... vision, or intelligence of lewis and clark... but men nonetheless.
i'm a man of science, a man of learning... a man who knows how to buy the finest books.
fear will be our breakfast, and stark-raving terror our daily luncheon.
an old bag of bones like you wouldn't make it 100 yards upriver.
on my worst day i could still beat the stuffing out of you... you puffed-up crow's cock.
i seen a bear so powerful... that it snapped a man's body in half with his huge jaws.
i seen a badger with paws as big as frying pans.
my brother and i had just finished cutting a field of hay... and were enjoying the evening meal under the shade of an elm tree.
he went down for water by the creek, and while he was gone...
i took a bowl that was filled with delicious plum pudding... and placed into it, not one... but two large pieces of sheep shit.
when he returned, i encouraged him to taste the plum pudding.
in the name of all that is good and decent... no more for today!
in exchange for reading lessons, mr. hunt reciprocates... by teaching me some of his frontier skills.
i've driven the men hard... and i'm positive we've closed the gap on lewis and clark.
however, because of the currents, i surmised that we'd be better off... portaging for the next several miles.
i'm here to tell you... that i'm not unfamiliar with the ways of men who've been long in the wilderness.
i understand their cravings for food and drink... and also their cravings for the companionship of young women.
your mother wants her roasting pan back when you're done playing with it.
i challenge you and the rest of your ladies in armor to a duel.
let's retrieve hunt from the tavern and get back to the boat.
i think we've seen all that snakes bend has to offer.
i want to check on her bandages and see if she can keep some food down.
you realize, of course, this woman of yours... is made of straw?
our journey is half finished, but our food supply is nearly depleted.
the only man who seems to be thriving is pratt... who is eating what remains of his straw woman.
if we do not give bears the right to vote they will rise up... and bears will be in congress.
and we will be the ones performing in carnivals wearing little hats.
president jefferson, a few months ago i saw a naked indian woman.
when i saw the naked indian woman, i had certain impure thoughts.
mr. hunt, this is our chance to overtake lewis and clark.
sure, we may overtake them... but it ain't worth risking the lives of the men.
or would you rather have mr. hunt do your thinking for you?
my heavenly father does my thinking for me... and he thinks i'd be a damn fool not to go with hunt.
and now we kill you, senor, and take your head back to hidalgo.
but we do have one tiny favor to ask of you.
we appreciate you showing up and all, but... we're going to probably just do this alone.
at the moment of battle... our spirits will soar and give us the strength... to fight.
{\chffe7c5}pressing the button while using the aiming device on the cover
{\chffe7c5}will launch a tranquilizer needle that can knock a person out instantly!
enough to have been one of the best shots on the entire force!
{\chffe7c5} i guess everyone's good at something... something odd was found where the crossbow was fired.
{\chffe7c5}the old guy never came home... why would murakami joe leave clues that point straight to him?
{\chffe7c5}is he trying to challenge the old guy and the police?
so he came up with the idea of combining these "name numbers with playing cards to pin his crimes on murakami.
and i were attacked was to act as camouflage to make us think
that's why he decided to leave his position and return to the country.
but not before getting revenge on nana-san and everyone else who had caused him to lose his sense of taste!
so what was it doing in your pocket? at which time the cork slipped inside your pocket!
the press-on nail on the floor likely came off at this time.
i just happened to meet him in front of the mouri detective agency.
that's the day he went to play mahjong! so i invited him over as an acquaintance of mouri-san.
i had actually hoped "one" kudo shinichi would come too... my wish didn't come true.
did you ever stop to consider if innocent people were killed!
the report you are about to see contains graphic descriptions of war and death.
it involves a breaking story about war crimes committed by american marines during operation desert storm, here in kuwait, at the el bakkar compound.
the war crime was discovered by then second lieutenant franco cefalu.
two days ago, i interviewed franco cefalu, now a marine captain, at his home in northern virginia.
video footage shot that night shows the force recon team surrounding building 5.
encountering fierce resistance, the marines fired canisters of what later proved to be sarin gas into the building.
classified intelligence documents indicate that the american military knew of the presence of these engineers at el bakkar.
a source high up in the pentagon confirmed that these men posed a serious threat to our war effort.
well, in that case, ma'am, what do you need from me?
i want lt. cmdr. rabb assigned to my staff on temporary duty.
announcing the arrival of flight 274 from sydney, at gate 20b.
at this time we would like to pre-board flight number 676 to barcelona.
when i was a kid, i never dreamed i'd be anywhere near this place.
when i was a kid, it was all i dreamt about.
one dark night, me uncle jack gets separated from his unit on recon.
and he finds himself sitting 5 feet off the ho chi minh trail.
two days prior to the start of the ground-war phase of operation desert storm,
i inserted a six-man force recon team into kuwait to gather intel on the shore batteries in the area of safwan.
can you be absolutely sure that your force recon team didn't kill the americans?
i wasn't there, sir, but i trust my marines and that's not what they reported.
i have a recently declassified document prepared by the cia two months prior to operation sirocco.
this intel report indicates that there were three american engineers working at el bakkar.
the report indicates that the american engineers posed a clear and present danger to our national interest.
colonel, did anyone give you an order to eliminate that danger?
i spent a lot of nights trying to figure that out.
look, chris, i was drunk the day we got married and on the honeymoon and up until the day they put you in prison.
sir, ma'am, i think there's something you should see on channel 3.
my squadron received a medevac frag from sergeant morrison at 0400.
ask him what time it was that his bird landed near safwan.
sergeant ford, what time was it when your helo landed near safwan?
before the start of the ground war, the navy pounded the shoreline with 16-inch guns.
the iraqis were expecting amphibious landing, so they held several divisions of republican guards in the area.
why'd sergeant ford tell norman delaporte that you had gb canisters?
delaporte, he'll get you to say anything he wants you to say if you talk to him long enough.
it's been sitting here a while, but we've been waiting for a new case from processing.
maybe your tape got put in the sandhawk box by mistake.
mr. delaporte, in the preparation for your report, did you ever attempt to interview sergeant morrison?
i did, his story didn't track and he had every good reason to cover up what he did.

mr. jackson, i will ask you questions based upon your pre-parole summary and your institutional profile.
after this hearing, i will make a written recommendation to the parole commissioner.
plain and simple, we need more cos and the budget can't handle both.
we would need less cos if there were fewer prisoners, which is exactly what's happening with education programmes like ours, governor.
it is with great pride that i stand before you now to mark not only the academic achievement of the individuals we are here to honour, but also the communal victory to which every person in this room has contributed.
these students have taught me that the ged diploma is only part of a much larger goal.
in the new budget that will soon be considered by our legislature, the equivalency programme will be terminated.
this tragic decision won't affect today's graduates, but their dedication and hard work have left a legacy which inevitably will disappear.
even the ballet is thriving, and as for education, we now have the second highest literacy rate in the u.s. of a.
so do you seriously think that john and jane q. public give a shit that some drugged-out homeboy is gonna get a diploma, knowing that their own little darlings are going to yale?
people move the way that they do because they're still working out some shit with their fathers.
they're still pissed at their mothers for not potty-training them properly.
yo, poet, man, i know i been giving you a lot of shit lately.
you know, calling you a faggot, talking about your poetry and everything else.
my mom's in the hospital, so she hasn't been able to take care of her.
i have this friend janice who also has a daughter and she lives a couple blocks from here, so she's been helping me out a couple days a week watching deedee.
i'm just saying we don't all live in the same world as you.
for most of us, what has to be done matters more than what should be done.
but that don't mean me and you still can't do business.
listen, i got a little slice of news for you that might be helpful.
we come into this world looking for unconditional love from our parents.
and when we don't get it, we find someone, anyone, and we marry them.
this chemo's making me pretty sick and i think i need a check-up.
fine. i'll arrange for dr. prestopnik to see you this afternoon.
both people have to care for each other equally, and when half that equation is missing--
listen to me, when half that equation is missing, it's no longer love.
every once in a while, i remember something i did when i was a child.
or something that was done to me, by my father or my brother or a cousin.
i'm not really sure if what i remember really took place at all.
you can't build your life relying on the perception of a little boy, on the echoes of some memory.
mr. jackson, i will ask you questions based upon your pre-parole summary and your institutional profile.
after this hearing, i will make a written recommendation to the parole commissioner.
plain and simple, we need more cos and the budget can't handle both.
we would need less cos if there were fewer prisoners, which is exactly what's happening with education programmes like ours, governor.

this tragic decision won't affect today's graduates, but their dedication and hard work have left a legacy which inevitably will disappear.
and the wonder of the where after i've discerned the disaster
and drank dom pérignon and armageddon i have drank the sacred ambrosia
i didn't even have the heart to call my mom, man.
you know, she been so proud of me lately, learning to read and school and all that shit.
i know you have doubts about what really happened to scott ross.
do you remember the look in his eyes when he fired that gun at you?
and when we don't get it, we find someone, anyone, and we marry them.
and we spend the rest of our lives together beating the shit out of each other, trying to prove that we didn't deserve unconditional love in the first place.
fine. i'll arrange for dr. prestopnik to see you this afternoon.
no, but l-- l want you to take care of me.
what i mean is, your life was in danger just a short time ago, and now, your chances for recovery are excellent.
so that all the fear that you experienced has to be replaced by something else.
and it seems like it happened to another person a century or two ago.
i'm not really sure if what i remember really took place at all.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.
now see, it's that near as i can figure part that's got me a little worried.
but the whole concept of chain of command... undermines the idea of free will.
so as soldiers,... we have to do some pretty awful stuff.
but it does put some of the responsibility on the guy giving those orders.
then you are saying apophis is responsible for hanno's father's death?
i see the horror on the faces of many others,... as their loved ones prepare for goa'uld absorption.
worse yet is the face of the victims whom i selected... as they realize they are about to take their final human breath.
well, the way i look at it, teal'c has already pled guilty.
so to draw a parallel to an american trial,... we have to look at this as sort of like the sentencing phase.
but the fact is you now work side by side... with the man responsible for your wife's fate.
it was difficult for me at first, i wanted to hate him.
it would be made lovelier were it not for the goa'ulds, and the jaffa.
the one thing i can't seem to figure out is, where you live.
as a member of the clan, he would never be left behind.
so in other words, your group can only move as fast as its slowest member.
i am trying to prove to you that teal'c is a good man.
he is very important to all of us in fighting the goa'ulds and the jaffa.
i'm hoping once they see our superior numbers and firepower,... they'll release him without incident.
colonel, the united states is not in the business... of interfering in other people's affairs.
even setting aside that teal'c is our friend,... how can you let such a valuable information resource be taken away?
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
now teal'c spent many years serving the goa'uld doing some damned distasteful things.
surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
- i would like to volunteer my lifeless body, and that of my symbiote, for your scientists to study.
perhaps you can better learn ways to battle the goa'uld and the jaffa.
well, don't worry, teal'c, there's not going to be any body to donate.
jack and carter should be back any minute with the troops.
you know i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
i mean, i respect your wishes, but i don't believe that you deserve to die.
we can help you, but he is no good to you like this.
now i give you my word he will not try to run away.
if you are right, he will be put through cor- ai.
but we do not take revenge like this, or we are no better than the jaffa.
i mean all they said was they want to put him through cor- ai.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.
now see, it's that near as i can figure part that's got me a little worried.
what if their idea of a simple trial is a simple beheading?
has it occurred to anyone that he might not be guilty?
if he were not guilty, there would be no cor- ai.
when i first saw you, i let my anger control me, and i threatened your life.
this is counter to byrsa mandates,... and by doing it i shamed myself and my whole clan.
it doesn't make it easier, it certainly doesn't make it right.
but it does put some of the responsibility on the guy giving those orders.
worse yet is the face of the victims whom i selected... as they realize they are about to take their final human breath.
hanno's father is not the first nor the last... of those whose lives i've taken.
so to draw a parallel to an american trial,... we have to look at this as sort of like the sentencing phase.
we need to prove to these people that he doesn't deserve to die.
and how did she get to be one of the victims?
the leader of the serpent guards picked her out of a crowd of other women, at random, really.
it was difficult for me at first, i wanted to hate him.
but now i know that it was a different teal'c that chose sha'uri... and i know that if there were any way for him to help me get my wife back,... this teal'c would do it gladly.
apophis ordered me to kill one of the villagers so the rest would obey.
okay, well i think we've all heard the reader's digest version of the story,... but there's more to it, isn't there?
you have defended this jaffa repeatedly by saying he is a changed man.
and for proof you have given many examples of his firing upon his former comrades.
teal'c may have killed hanno's father,... but in doing so he saved you, and you,... and all of you.
teal'c's death will not change the past,... but his continued life can help all of our future.
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
we don't stop pursuing war criminals, because they have a change of heart.
like it or not, what the jaffa have done to these people... and thousands of other people is a crime.
now teal'c spent many years serving the goa'uld doing some damned distasteful things.
surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
general hammond, i have spent a lot of years in the service of my country,... and i have been ordered to do some damned distasteful things.
perhaps you can better learn ways to battle the goa'uld and the jaffa.
well, don't worry, teal'c, there's not going to be any body to donate.
you must not allow colonel o'neill... to deny the retribution the byrsa deserve.
you know i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
now o'neill has proved to me not only where his loyalties lie but yours as well.
if you believe that it was o'neill that informed the goa'uld, you are mistaken.
i mean all they said was they want to put him through cor-ai.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.
now see, it's that near as i can figure part that's got me a little worried.
what if their idea of a simple trial is a simple beheading?

we can help you, but he is no good to you like this.
now i give you my word he will not try to run away.
now there could still be survivors out there, shouldn't we be looking for them?
no, not until i examine you, will use the barracks room.
i know i must look pretty scary in this mask but i'm not going to hurt you.
colonel, there's someone in the bushes and they won't come out.
are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
yes sir, in fact i think we may have brought back the cure.
now i'm hoping she has some sort of natural immunity... that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on earth.
why didn't the telescope team report that this outbreak was going on?
one side of the object is made up of iron and potassium.
the other is made up of the element that makes up the stargate.
and then they made us think that it was our fault... because they new we wouldn't leave her there... they new we would bring her back here.
and they used there technology to put that thing inside of her.
according to dr. fraiser, measurements of the devices atomic decay... we have one hour and 20 minutes left.
the girl should be prepared to go back though the stargate.
it occurred to me that she first slipped into the coma when we brought her close to the stargate.
as soon as we got her far enough away from the stargate, she woke up... and i knew.
i'll be holding your hand the whole way, all right ?
i know it looks kind of scary, but it's really a lot of fun.
one side of the object is made up of a combination of iron and potassium.
the other side is made up of the element that makes up the stargate.
the goa'ulds wiped out every last living person on that planet except cassandra,
and then they made us think that it was our fault...
and they used their technology to put that thing inside of her.
it's like they designed a way for us to help them create the device...
if you are right, he will be put through cor- ai.
but we do not take revenge like this, or we are no better than the jaffa.
i mean all they said was they want to put him through cor- ai.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.

colonel, there's someone in the bushes and they won't come out.
it learned traits from a local organism and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain i've ever encountered.
are you positive you haven't brought back any of this disease?
i'm hoping she has a natural immunity that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on earth.
why didn't the telescope team report that this outbreak was going on?
teal'c, dr. fraiser says this device inside the girl is on some sort of timer.
you're sure it will go off if we send her through the stargate?
she first slipped into the coma when we brought her close to the stargate.
as soon as we got her far enough away from the stargate, she woke up.

the leader of the serpent guards picked her out of a crowd of other women, at random, really.
it was difficult for me at first, i wanted to hate him.
but now i know that it was a different teal'c that chose sha'uri... and i know that if there were any way for him to help me get my wife back,... this teal'c would do it gladly.
apophis ordered me to kill one of the villagers so the rest would obey.
okay, well i think we've all heard the reader's digest version of the story,... but there's more to it, isn't there?
you have defended this jaffa repeatedly by saying he is a changed man.
and for proof you have given many examples of his firing upon his former comrades.
teal'c may have killed hanno's father,... but in doing so he saved you, and you,... and all of you.
teal'c's death will not change the past,... but his continued life can help all of our future.
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
we don't stop pursuing war criminals, because they have a change of heart.
like it or not, what the jaffa have done to these people... and thousands of other people is a crime.
now teal'c spent many years serving the goa'uld doing some damned distasteful things.
surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
general hammond, i have spent a lot of years in the service of my country,... and i have been ordered to do some damned distasteful things.
perhaps you can better learn ways to battle the goa'uld and the jaffa.
well, don't worry, teal'c, there's not going to be any body to donate.
you must not allow colonel o'neill... to deny the retribution the byrsa deserve.
you know i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
now o'neill has proved to me not only where his loyalties lie but yours as well.
if you believe that it was o'neill that informed the goa'uld, you are mistaken.
no daniel, your right, you can't actually see it, not the singularity... it's self it's so massive not even light can escape it.
but during the totality phase of the eclipse... we should be able to see matter spiraling towards it.
no, not until i examine you, will use the barracks room.
colonel, you said you touched one of the victims before putting on gloves?
they told me when we came here three months ago... that with darkness would come the apocalypse.
it was part of there mythology, and what did we tell them?
don't be afraid, i'll be holding your hand the whole way, all right?
i know it looks kind of scary, but it's really a lot of fun.
it's possible someone from earth brought a normally harmless bacteria to that planet... it learned some new traits from a local organism... and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain i've ever encountered.
are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
sir, somehow this little girl survived against all odds on a completely contaminated planet.
now i'm hoping she has some sort of natural immunity... that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on earth.
i'm assuming it's the naquada that was in her blood, some how the object is collecting it.
now potassium can be one of the most volatile alkali metals on earth.
the goa'uld wiped out every last living person on that plant except cassandra.
and then they made us think that it was our fault... because they new we wouldn't leave her there... they new we would bring her back here.
and they used there technology to put that thing inside of her.
it's like they designed away for us to help them create the device after she came through the stargate... so we wouldn't detect it until it was to late.
dr. frasier says this device inside the girl is on some kind of timer.
your sure it will go off if we send the girl through the stargate?
we should be ruling the humans, not running around making back-alley treaties with them.
for fuck's sake, these people are our food, not our allies.
he can withstand garlic, silver, even sunlight, and he's got their strength.
this time tomorrow, all those wounds of his will be healed.
he toyed with 'em first, tried to make me decide which order they'd die in.
we kill as many of 'em as we can find, but it's gettin' worse.
by the time you watch this, your friend whistler should be dead.
if it makes any difference to you, he put up quite a fight.
the goa'uld usually send an advance scout... ..to determine a planet's worth and vulnerability.
if no scout reports back, it is a deterrent to invasion.
the point is, sir, the goa'uld are there... ..and the locals aren't much of a match for them.
general, if we did screw up their world, we should help fix it, don't you think?
sam could use one of these ribbon devices to help us fight the goa'ulds!
she could use one of those healing devices we saw kendra use.
if we use all the c4 to blow the camps now,... ..what do we use when the ships and gliders show up later?
guys, there's a... third option here we might want to consider.
with respect, we thought thor's hammer was a myth until we proved it was real.
jack, i think thor's might may refer to... uh... ..an alien weapon or weapons that have been hidden away for centuries.
like he wants to be sure his children have grown up enough... ..before he hands them the keys to the armoury.
it doesn't make sense that he would waste time when the planet's under attack.
in the ten-span since i created this world... ..you are the first to reach this level of contact.
you have finally grown wise enough to see me in my true form.
you see, we came here a year ago... ..to meet you and your people, to make an alliance against the goa'uld.
one of our party, a jaffa, was trapped in your labyrinth.
he stands with them, and now with us, to fight the etins.
we had no choice but to destroy the hammer to free our friend.
he told me to give you a message to satisfy your curiosity.
i'm to tell you he's a member of a species who have visited your world often.
if no scout reports back, it is a deterrent to invasion.
the point is, sir, the goa'uld are there... ..and the locals aren't much of a match for them.
sam could use one of these ribbon devices to help us fight the goa'ulds!
she could use one of those healing devices we saw kendra use.
and i will remain to do battle with you until the goa'uld are driven from this land.
of course, we have to know what we're up against first.
the new pyramids are landing pedestals for the goa'uld mother ships.
they will arrive soon and contain large numbers of death gliders.
i don't suppose this is the time to bring up my problem with heights.
we had to cross a beam worse than this in basic training.

well, two days ago, the probe sent back this image from p3r- 272.
you'll see that the symbols match one of the inscriptions from the meeting place... .. on ernest's planet.
but, based on the norse rune at the bottom of this inscription,... .. i'm positive one of the four races in the alliance is thor's race - the asgard.
obviously, that would make the aliens that belong to this language their allies.
that program you entered rewrote massive amounts of the machine code.
jack's lost the ability to speak anything but the alien language.
if sam and teal'c make contact with the ancients and they can report back,... .. then jack and i will go.
until then, translating this language... .. may be the most important thing we've done since we opened the stargate.
you see, i'm pretty sure... .. jack is speaking the language of the original gate builders.
at the least, it's one of the races... .. who created the repository of information on ernest's planet.
the temperature here is increasing rapidly,... .. which probably explains why we haven't found any indigenous life forms.
the probe's data did not reveal a second sun, which rose halfan hour ago.
captain, we're sending through... .. heat- resistant tents and portable air coolers.
general, i don't think you understand how hot it's gonna get.
jack built it,... .. but no one seems to be able to figure out what it is.
colonel, you have no idea what it is or why you built it?
i thought stargate addresses were six points in space... .. with the seventh being the point of origin.
the extra chevron must add a new distance calculation to the existing points.
without the remote code device, he won't be able to get back.
without knowing where he's going and why, that could put us in further jeopardy.
that's the radioactive stuff we left in the sagan institute box on cimmeria.
i wanted it there so it would leave a very recognisable signature.

the point is, sir, the goa'uld are there... ..and the locals aren't much of a match for them.
it's customary to leave a person's favourite items outside their grave... ..to take with them on their journey to thor.
these items are of no use now to any of us.
kendra could use goa'uld technology because she was a host to a goa'uld.
you must be able to cos you were a host to jolinar.

now you fuck this up between thurman jr. and me, you won't have a future in this state.
now, i'll fix it so that you never practice the law again.
i don't know what you want me to say, but i'm the best.
pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall.
about exact details of each crime, details that were never released to the press.
i mean, minute details, man, right down to the color of the car.
we are talkin' about things only the victims or the killer could've known.
so i need to ask you, lawson, where did you get all of the information for your book?
i'd destroyed the only evidence that could prove that i didn't write the book.
of course, there's the distinct possibility that nobody told you any of the details of these murders.
there's a distinct possibility that one disgusted, disgruntled, disbarred lawyer, angry at the system that shut him out, took revenge on the very men who refused to make the same moral sacrifice he did.
nobody had to tell you any of these details because you were there, mr. russell.
tell them that i need time to confer with counsel and to prepare a statement.
tell them i'll be more than happy to cooperate in every way possible, including naming my source, but i need out of here now.
it was given to me by an old man i met in key west.
he gave me the original manuscript to read, and then he died of a heart attack.
earn 10 times as much as we do to tear apart our investigations and lab work.
while we're underpaid, overworked, understaffed, and constantly being pushed into the ground as if we were the criminals.
christopher marlowe was the english writer who first interpreted the medieval legend faust, the man who sold his soul to the devil.
goethe, of course, was the german poet whose crowning work, faust, was the most famous version of the tale.
i took a flight from miami to baton rouge and caught a greyhound down to the city.
all the calls from the phone booth in key west were local except for one in the 504 area code.
i'm very glad that you could come here and talk to me.
why don't you just come on in here and stay for a spell?
but then again, you've always been kind of unpredictable, haven't you?
like that evening in your study when you called judge banning, withdrew yourself from the parks case.
* * hoo hoo hoo * yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *
* i never was a believer * * until you came and showed me the way * * just like the rays of light * * that turn each night * into day * and all the doubts
* i could not live without * * they all drown in the depth of your love * * you fell down * on my desert one day * like a rain from above *
* i put my faith in you * lay it down for you * and only you * upon your wings i fly, so high * * forever put my faith in you *
* i put my faith in you * hoo hoo hoo hoo
* i used to think i knew freedom * * when i would live to please someone else * * but you embrace me for all that i am * * you love me for myself * * and like a rock
* that remains strong and true * * you anchor my heart and my soul * * and if this world is ever incomplete * * you're the one who makes it whole *
* i put my faith in you * lay it down for you and only you * * upon your wings i fly, so high * * forever put my faith in you *
* i put my faith in you * lay it down for you and only you * * only you * upon your wings i fly, so high * * forever put my faith in you *

every moment that we delay increases the risk to the commonality and to the future of the taelon race.
i have no doubt that miss petrenko is the human who has invaded the commonality.
when you activate the device she must be the only one killed.
i understood your instructions the first time you gave them to me.
all i know is that you and you alone are katya's main focus.
she believes that you're her reason for being at this moment in her life.
there may be a way for you to convey what you know to boone.
for years we've been trying to extract information from one brain and convey it into another.
i think i finally succeeded with a little help from some borrowed taelon technology.
are you saying boone would be able to read katya's mind?
well, we can't forget katya's psychic ability and her willingness to convey this information.
essentially, i would create a hardwire connection between katya's brain and boone's cvi.
although i did not feel the same link with her as all taelon feel as a part of the commonality,
i would agree that this woman is connected to us in some way that we have not seen in humans.
but it is not clear that this is the force that has broken through our commonality.
the wisest course is to continue the inquiry with the balance of the psychics as planned.
we all share a bond born from this gift we possess.
it is vital that we use our power to make better of the human condition.
ma'el thought that with this ability we could better understand the taelons and convince them that we could indeed become their partners.
and he did this without the knowledge of the taelon's synod.
they were actually involved in altering the course of the human development.
i was given this gift to give it to you, william.
she said that ma'el gave humanity this gift so that we could commune more effectively with taelons, and convince you that we could work together as partners.
ma'el apparently did this without the consent or knowledge of the synod.
the speed with which the soviets had produced ah atomic bomb astonished america.
i think what surprised us was that considering the devastation which had taken place in the soviet union as a result of world war ll, we didn't think they would be able to amass the necessary infrastructure to develop the bomb,
but they certainly did and they clearly were in our knickers, so to speak.
more and more we learned how well they had infiltrated the whole manhattan project.
people used him as a baby-sitter, he was a very polite, very quiet individual.
no idea at all that he had this dual personality or this dual endeavor.
the united states looked to its scientists to regain the lead.
at the los alamos nuclear laboratories, they planned the hydrogen bomb.
we thought at the time of atomic bombs as being limited in yield to approximately the yield that had been used in the war in japan.
whereas we thought of hydrogen bombs as being absolutely unlimited in what the yield could be and more specifically, we thought of the hydrogen bomb as being a thousand times as big as atomic bombs, just as atomic bombs had been
a thousand times bigger than the chemical bombs used in world war ll.
this enormous destructive power shocked robert oppenheimer -- former leader of the manhattan project.
he and several of his colleagues argued that such weapons put the whole world at risk.
if there is another world war, this civilization may go under.
we need to ask ourselves whether we're doing everything we can to avert that.
america feared that if it didn't build an h-bomb, the russians would.
it required a huge refrigeration system, weighed over 82 tons and was 20 feet high.
in less than a minute you will see the most powerful explosion ever witnessed by human eyes.
minus 10 seconds, nine, eight seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, t zero.
on november 1, 1952, the world's first hydrogen bomb exploded with a force equivalent to over 10 million tons of tnt... 1,000 times the power of the bomb dropped on hiroshima.
you don't know what heat is until you've seen the heat from a 10-megaton hydrogen bomb.
it doesn't stop, it just gets hotter and hotter and you start to really worry even though you're 20-some miles away.
and of course, the whole island disappeared, too, which was subsequently very impressive, and the whole lagoon was just sort of a milky white.
and then we were asked to go collect samples, so we got into a little motor boat with buckets and went charging into the crater scooping up the radioactive material and taking it back for the chemists to analyze so we could determine the yield.
but we were young, and it was a lot of fun.
while america was developing the hydrogen bomb, a conventional war had broken out in asia.
general dwight d. eisenhower, the former supreme allied commander, campaigned to succeed truman.
ike was determined not to get caught in any more conventional wars.
stalin was dead, and a struggle for power was taking place between nikita khrushchev and georgi malehkov.
malenkov said we have to warn our people and all of humanity that nuclear war threatens everyone with annihilation.
later that year, the soviet leadership witnessed a demonstration of their nuclear power.
a 20-kiloton atomic bomb was dropped in the middle of a military exercise in totskoye in the urals.
i was a member of the assessment team for that exercise.
i remember very well how marshal bulganin, the minister of defense, stated that
i think called the lucky dragon, where some of this fallout came down on them and they had no information as to what this was and they were a long ways away.
and before any information got to them or they were detected, some of the people did suffer some radiation effects.
the fishermen had been over 80 miles away when they were caught in a cloud of radioactive dust.
"once again the japanese have been poisoned by ashes of death,"
with british philosopher bertrand russell, they put their names to a manifesto.
there lies before us if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge and wisdom.
we would get under our desks and stay there until we were told to come out or, in some cases, in some of the classrooms we had coat-rooms off to the side of each classroom and we'd walk through and we'd get our coat
and we'd go out into the hallways and we would literally duck down facing against the wall.
bomb shelters, you know, building bomb shelters in the back yard it was certainly something you saw a lot in magazines and this connotation that this was happening somewhere in suburbia usa.
i do remember thinking of places in our homes where these enemy people, these russians, would never ever find us and we would again be, of course, very safe forever.
in the 1950s, it didn't even cross our minds that the americans were frightened of a soviet invasion.
we thought they knew we only had peaceful aims -- that all we wanted was to live in peace.
in the summer of 1955, the major powers convened in geneva.
the russian delegation was led by marshal bulganin and nikita khrushchev.
open skies involved both the freedom to overfly each other and observe... photograph and observe what was happening, and second, an exchange of blueprints, as eisenhower termed it, of the military programs on both sides.
we broke up for tea shortly after that and as we were standing there,
later that year at the moscow air show, the soviets allowed the west to see their new jet bombers, code named "bison."
significantly, overhead flew 10 long-range tu-95s, capable of delivering a nuclear bomb all the way to america.
for the americans, seeing 10 planes capable of reaching the united states was a shock.
at that time, in the absence of ballistic missiles, they supposed that the soviet union didn't have any means of delivery to america.
america needed to find out how much of a gap there really was.
in california, the wraps were coming off a secret photographic reconnaissance plane.
i came across the engels... so-called engels airfield, and much to my surprise and joy it was loaded with bison bombers.
i knew right then that i had found that there was a bomber gap, that this had to be the most important picture ever taken by a reconnaissance pilot.
i kind of expected congressional medals of honor when i landed.
however, it turned out what i'd taken a picture of was not just a portion of the entire russian air force bomber fleet, but in fact i'd taken a picture of the entire russian bomber fleet,
khrushchev, around that period, came to the conclusion that missiles were the weapons of the future and that warships were getting obsolete, bombers were getting obsolete.
that we should concentrate everything on missiles, and as he said somewhere that,
on the 15th of may 1957, they began testing the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile, an icbm.
we were kept in such strict secrecy that we couldn't mention the word "missile"
i could hear this little chirping sound, more like a cricket chirping than it was a beep, if you will.
to me, it was the confirmation of the fact that the russians had indeed put a satellite into orbit and sitting there listening to that signal and watching the booster go overhead you couldn't help but get goose bumps
the american military and others realized that the period when they were out of reach had ended.
a new era had begun when instead of a sputnik, a nuclear weapon could not merely circle the earth, but land where it was ordered to.
it had given our people quite a jolt, almost of panic proportions to think that the soviets could do that and that meant they could hit the united states with missiles.
well, eisenhower had been thinking about that for years and this was no news to him.
our satellite program has never been conducted as a race with other nations.
rather it has been carefully scheduled as part of the scientific work of the international geophysical year.
i consider our country's satellite program to be well-designed and properly scheduled to achieve the scientific purposes for which it was initiated.
eisenhower's critics charged that his lethargy had given away an advantage.
this government needs to start telling the truth to the american people.
quit kidding ourselves, and quit trying to fool our friends and our neighbors.
and by that i mean let's find out just where we stand in this race and this armament picture, and let's find out just what we're going to do about it.
let's quit acting as if nothing happened because something has happened, and it has embarrassed us throughout the world.
the world's mass media was choking with excitement that man had now entered into space.
we would liked to have had some rest... but one must give credit to khrushchev.
american public opinion was split between fear of soviet missiles and worries about the safety of the dog they called curly.
we can only pray in this time of aloneness and suffering for curly, that god will be merciful and speed the end.
this voiceless cry of mercy, as this satellite spans the earth, should be long remembered as the symbol of the torture the animal world must go through.
and i don't mean to be facetious at all, but something to be remembered is that there is a female up there circling mother earth.
the army and the air force were very eager to put up a satellite.
eisenhower was dubious about their proposals and decided to call on the navy to produce a new satellite, called the vanguard, to carry this out for peaceful civilian purposes only.
after rising but a few feet, the three-stage, 72-foot rocket loses its thrust.
the remarkable slow motion films tell the rest of the story.
the race in space was between capitalism and communism -- a competition the west feared russia was winning.
russia was bursting with pride, and celebrated its new, scientific heroes.
as a result, my ex-husband became an engineer, my brother became an engineer.
most of the people that i knew in my small environment went to become engineers.
after that, after they did that, they went into other things but they were --
i mean we were all sort of conditioned to think we should definitely-- this is what we need to do.
in 1959, vice-president richard nixon opened the american national exhibition in moscow.
he tried to impress khrushchev with america's advances in color television.
there are some instances where you may be ahead of us.
for example in the development of the thrust of your rockets for the investigation of outer space.
the american people were convinced that the missile gap favored russia.
ike was questioning how much of a gap there really was.
pilot gary powers was selected for one of the longest and most dangerous spy missions ever flown.
he would take off from pakistan and fly north right across russia.
eisenhower was told the plane was missing, and that a public statement might be needed.
i reminded him that we had a cover story that we would use, that the plane was a high altitude weather plane and it must have been off course and so on.
he had with him a poisoned pen and a silenced pistol.
khrushchev sprang the trap and having us in it, said we not only have the plane, we have the pilot.
and it wasn't a plane that was off course -- it was on course.
it was not a high altitude weather plane, it was a spy plane and we know all of that and demanded an apology from the united states.
"look we are going to take a very tough position because otherwise our public simply would not understand.
we'll have to make a statement saying that the president should apologize, should punish those responsible for those flights, and should say that they will not be repeated any longer."
john f. kennedy attacked the republicans on their weak stance on communism, and in particular, for the missile gap he claimed eisenhower had let develop.
kennedy promised that his defense experts would sort out the problem.
i hardly knew the difference between a nuclear weapon and a conventional weapon.
but my introduction and indoctrination was swift because a major element of the election campaign that president kennedy had just won was the charge by the democrats, including president kennedy, that eisenhower had left a missile gap, that the soviets had been permitted
by inaction on the part of the us to build up a superior nuclear missile force.
so, clearly my first responsibility as secretary of defense was to determine the degree of the gap and initiate action to close it and it took us about three weeks to determine -- yes, there was a gap.
when construction on the base is complete, you'll be joined by many others.
you'll be preparing for the day of the invasion and the subjugation of earth.
i will not pay except on the gambling table, are you green?
prince, i know your old man is the boss of hung tai, but this doesn't mean you can refuse to pay your debt.

i think it's not wise of me to stay and ruin your appetite.

if we help you, the other groups will tease us of bullying a dummy, you know?
the americans can check it out if anyone sells drugs in hong kong.

well, i listen to you and should listen to me too.
you work in a club, do you think you are miss hong kong?

in these five years, i spent all my money for an appeal.

but he is selling drugs, how can i help him then?
how do i know whether he is dealing drugs or not?

besides, half of the time, the lemons and the limes around this joint got more sense than the two of youse.
and i am not pointing the finger at you, young lady.
mr. hobson, if i paid attention to all the threats i receive in this office, i'd never get any work done.
now, i assume you mean well, but i have to warn you, if you barge in here again, i'll have you arrested.
the guy he killed, he was walking away from him in a bar.
hernandez hit him in the back of the head with a bottle.
i keep telling myself there's got to be a reason for all this.
well, when you find out what it is, would you let me know, please?
oh, a guy's got two hostages, ran two of my men out of the house.
now, one of these hostages, good-looking fella, about six foot, brown hair, leather jacket?
i know you want more than what you got right now.
you need to blame someone else for something that happened years ago.
besides, half of the time, the lemons and the limes around this joint got more sense than the two of youse.
and i am not pointing the finger at you, young lady.
you say he wants to kill me, but you won't reveal your source of information.
so perhaps you'll tell me this-- why should i believe a word you say?
mr. hobson, if i paid attention to all the threats i receive in this office, i'd never get any work done.
now, i assume you mean well, but i have to warn you, if you barge in here again, i'll have you arrested.
the guy he killed, he was walking away from him in a bar.
hernandez hit him in the back of the head with a bottle.
okay, here's what's going on-- um, we've been able to relieve the immediate pressure on his brain.
but i have to tell you that the next 24 hours are gonna be critical, so if anything happens, i'll let you know, all right?
i keep telling myself there's got to be a reason for all this.
well, when you find out what it is, would you let me know, please?
oh, a guy's got two hostages, ran two of my men out of the house.

you need to blame someone else for something that happened years ago.
what was, what is, what shall be... pieces of a puzzle falling into place.
(young man) if my story starts anywhere, it starts when i was a kid.
this is the story of how a boy became a man-cub, and how that man-cub became a man.
even though this is my story, it's not all about me, it's also about my friends, the animals.
so i took off down the trail trying to find my parents.
you know how things don't always work out according to plan?
mowgli couldn't hurt a tsetse fly, much less bag a tiger.
well, he did, and shere khan's dying wish was to get even, so give him up.
one of those wolves who like to chase us up trees?
aw, did poor old biranyi get an owwy on his paw?
that's why it's important that mowgli be trained as a hunter.
mowgli, are you ready to join the pack and to honor our traditions?
sometimes, i don't know what to think, or where i belong.
maybe i need to go away before i cause any more trouble.
mowg, what do you say we hustle up a little fish for breakfast?
the way things are going, by the time i catch one, it'll be time for lunch.
i monkey time a' now, the dance that the people do i don't know how it started
i all i know that when the beat brings a feel
once i'm through with you, everyone will know that i, shere khan, rule all and that i answer to no man.
come, look into my eyes, boy, just like your mother did.
if you wish captain crawley to be her heir you're doing your best to serve him.
i believe the old lady hasn't changed her will as yet.
you'll dine here tomorrow and every day that miss swartz honors us with her company and you'll be pleasant to her, sir.
now, if you want for money, go and see mr. chopper.
but, by god, sir, you take your pack and walk out of this house and forever, sir.
now, will you do as i tell you and marry miss swartz... once and for all, sir?
dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of god and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate instituted of god in the time of man's innocency
signifying unto us the mystical union that is betwixt christ and his church and is commended of st. paul to be honorable among all men and therefore is not by any to be enterprised nor taken in hand unadvisedly, lightly or wantonly
and i daresay you've heard all about me from that husband of yours.
if you please, ma'am, he has told me that major o'dowd goes in command of the regiment but mrs. o'dowd goes in command of the major.
i hope there'll be no women besides our own party, blanche.
gracious heaven, mama, you don't suppose the man would bring his wife?
there's more society here than there is in london in the season.
there'll be society of a different kind soon enough, eh, dobbin?
six pounds... eight and tuppence and the grocer's got his man out on the pavement.
get up and go to the club and fleece some poor fellow at billiards or something.
but, by god, sir, you take your pack and walk out of this house and forever, sir.
now, will you do as i tell you and marry miss swartz... once and for all, sir?
they don't understand here what i was and what i've come to.
could any man have speculated on that scoundrel napoleon getting off elba and landing in france?
dearly beloved, we are gathered together here in the sight of god and in the face of this congregation to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate instituted of god in the time of man's innocency

ah, but, sure, there's no danger for us ladies and civilians, mr. sedley.

but it doesn't mean i know how, where to find them, howto make them believe.
the future's as much a question to me as it is to you.
sounds like none of us knows if we're doing the right thing.
maybe that's the only thing we have in common at this point.
look, it was you... who led me and prodded me all through mortal kombat and afterwards.
your whole life, your training, your victory... and everything since was meant to letyou take control of you.
to control one element of the four that make up life is power.
a twist of nature, an aberration, one who brings forth true killing force.

kyong-hee who's been with us for over three years has decided to leave us
we should wish her all the best and hope to meet again
completely naked with a belt, a pager and one mirror glasses.

those two criminals ... are having fun in the strip club.
you keep only live if you pay 70 grand plus interest.
which tv does not work and your uncle has deflowered my sister.
because you on tuesday never fuck you're not a virgin yet.
so, we all know that this is going to take an enormous amount of time.
because, well, he kissed another girl and then he went on a date with her.
i realized, yeah, it's possible that they may not belong together.
i mean, the heartless cruelty you inflicted on each other, who does that to each other?
is there some anger that the two of you still need to work out?
you know, i never knew you could be so cold and unforgiving.
because we're in high school, and you think you're supposed to.
but when two people are really in love, it doesn't matter that there are disagreements sometimes.
i'm sorry we ever put any pressure on you to get us back together.
you know, i mean, even though you're my best friend, no one could ever do that.
yeah, well, when you live next door to a house full of psychos...
hey, dad, you know what i heard from the radio this morning?
i was actually talking about something fairly significant about us building a better family unit.
i'm sorry, will you forgive me this morning because i need to finish this before i get to work.

i've been working on a ventriloquism routine and, actually i'd like to bring out my little friend right now.
well, i feel like everything i say now might be overshadowed by the death threat, but, uh, i'm gonna say it anyway...
no, i think you should live your life as if everything is normal, because that's the one thing that i will not let this guy do is turn my world upside down.
was it a typical death threat like, "i'm gonna kill you"
or did he mention like he's gonna kill you and your family?
i'm just saying that every pet you ever had died from neglect.
dad, we're talking about a 4-year-old boy here not some dumb guinea pig that has to eat every single day!
so i've been staying with some friends which is, uh... nice.
but i don't understand why people assume that you don't wanna stay in a hotel.
i always clean up after dinner, but what can you do when you're cleaning up?
all you can do is just bring your plate into the kitchen.
i was just recovering from the 2 cancellations when she hits me with that!
uh, not that i don't love you and all that but could you sit over there from now on?
you know, not knowing whether i would be dead or alive tomorrow,
i was living each day like it was my next to the last.
...but i've been taking self-defense courses because i want to defend myself and i think i've been getting ripped off, doctor, with these self-defense courses.
maybe you can learn from my mistake but if ever you find yourself in a dark alley and there's a big guy coming towards you, don't do this to defend yourself...

in other words, i found out what it's like... to be you.
we do know it's being funded by a hostile country... through bank accounts maintained at an embassy in brussels.

they would gain control of the millennium group in 666 days.
of course, they believe the roosters create hysteria crowing about the impending dawn.
there's only one person who could do that, whom both roosters and owls respect, and at this moment is our only hope.
aerotech's a south american company that's won their first big north american contract.
how many times in history has theological apocrypha created hysteria, been used to assume power, diverted focus from actual vital concerns?
how many times must ezekiel, mark 13 and revelation be wrong?
over the last year of your candidacy, this group has shown you a plane of good and evil and a prophetic direction that you have come to understand and to accept.
past and future events that we understand can only be known to a select few in order to guide the world through the coming crisis which is inevitable.
i have an idea what those men were about, what they created.
the fact is i know nothing about the man standing in the darkness of my house.
until i know more, i don't want anything to do with millennium, or you.
robert le fur, based in paris, but did some exceptional work for us in the middle east.
early in the fourth century, the emperor constantine allowed his mother helena to travel to jerusalem in search of the cross.
beneath the church of the holy sepulcher she found three crosses, two marked "thief" and one "inrl" - "one to be mocked or humiliated."
she cut this cross into three pieces, sending one to constantinople, one to rome and leaving one in jerusalem.
the first two pieces were lost, but the third was captured by the muslims in the crusades.
the muslims were prepared to return the cross until richard lionheart slaughtered his arab prisoners.
legend indicated saladin then had the cross buried beneath a mosque in damascus as a means of humiliating the christians.
obviously you weren't gonna display it in the millennium group believe it or not museum.
i can't imagine you putting it up for auction or selling it to the vatican.
the patriarch of jerusalem carried the cross into battle before the crusaders.
for nearly a century they did not suffer a single defeat unless the cross was not present.
should armageddon occur, we must have the cross in our possession.
even if some members believe that it's still the middle of the night?
we're so pleased to have both of you in our family.
i have a meeting to run off to, but if you need to use my phone, go right ahead.
i just hope that next time, i don't have to run so much.
ok children, what do you think barneby jones meant when he said this is not a victimless crime?

i know that you think plane-ariums are boring, but i'm gonna try to change the way you think about that.
today children we are going to learn about japenese poems called haikus.
a haiku is just like a normal american poem except that it doesn't rhyme and it's totally stupid.
well it's an ancient technique handed down from school counselor to school counselor.
- i don't like to use it, but it may be our only hope.
they just begged to come back, i couldn't get them to shut up about it.
well i'm sure we're gonna have a marvelous time, won't we children?

so bring the whole family to the planetarium, for a night of excitement and wonder.
and then we turned the dial and kenny went into a kind of... hypnosis.
- well just as soon as i handle all the other crime in south park,
i'm gonna go with you to the planetarium so i can prove that nothing's wrong.
i just wanted to remind you i'm gonna be on television tonight, so be sure to watch.
oh i will eric.you know i remember when i was a little girl and had my first talent show audition...
except that the plane-arium is the best thing you've ever known.
well well well, you guys can now kiss my ass because i was on television!
why don't you just forget what barneby jones has to say.
why don't you not pay attention to barneby jones and let's see how far you get in society.
ok stanley, why don't you tell us how barneby jones knew the poison was in the milk.
can't we just be like normal third graders for a little while?

well i don't know, but anyway boys and girls soon you'll be witnessing the wonders of the universe.
- but first i wanna show you how the plane-arium works.

well hello, it's all my little friends with all their little dreams.
well children, i'm so glad you came back to learn more.
they just begged to come back, i couldn't get them to shut up about it.
it appears that more and more south park residents are dicovering the wonder and joy of the planetarium.
here with a special report is a 34 year old asian man who looks strikingly simila to recardo montebon.
i guarantee, it'll change the way you think about the plane-arium.
so bring the whole family to the planetarium, for a night of excitement and wonder.
hello, the marshes aren't in right now, please leave a message.
stan, i'm gonna be on tv tonight, be sure to watch.
all you gotta do is sit through a four-hour training course.
you're telling me there's a poorly-trained, quasi-legal police force... that operates with few, if any, government controls?
yeah, i'd love to give you a raise, but the accounting department said:
"buck, stop letting the employees put your lemons in a vice."
seems like just yesterday mom and dad brought her home for me... on account of me not having any brothers and sisters to play with.
if i'd been old enough to talk, i would have asked for a monkey.
although i suspected as much... when it took you 30 minutes to produce a urine sample.
you want it done it quick, or you want it done right?
now, i saw something on the news... about a procedure called in vitro fertilization.
they mix your boys with one of my ladies in a test tube.
as i recall, your mama was having trouble getting pregnant... on account of your daddy's narrow doohickey.
and eventually, they just gave up on ever having a child of their own... and they did the next best thing.
i always kind of believed that playing with that puppy, was the one thing that finally relaxed me and my ure,
well, me, enough for us to have a baby, i just thought if we had another puppy in the house... you know....
even if i get hank to see the doctor, he refuses to take his pants off.
you don't take your clothes off at the doctor's anymore, sug'.
anything they need to see, they do it with a new machine called an mri.
are you sure they can use it to look at hank?
of course, the average man has a count of 100 million.
hank, honey, just because you scored 8 million on your sperm test... does not mean you did not give 1 10 million0/0.
dad, i think what peggy's saying is... that it's not very often that a man of 75 fathers a child.
-l mean, when the boy's 18, you'll be-- -l'll be dead.
if i knew this could happen, i'd have worked harder over the years.
you know, exercised, cut back on the fruit pies... gotten a few "b's" to raise my average.
you think i like to see that out my kitchen window?
well, if you wanna keep trying, you can keep trying by yourself.
but this really nice policeman gave me his home phone number.
i'm probably not gonna be able to help you look any more tonight.
but if you are asking if i am a licensed professional bounty hunter... i think this hat speaks for itself.
well, all right, i guess i could use some help driving.
i can recover a large percentage of the case material that was destroyed in my office ﬁre several months ago.
while this process is tedious, what i've already recovered will allow agent scully and i to begin work on the x-files immediately.
..who are growing corn in the desert, which features pollen, which was genetically altered to hold a virus, which will be taken away by bees whose sting transmits the virus, causing the growth of an extraterrestrial biological entity inside the human host?
which we will prove how that the x-files have been reopened.
let us remind you that the fbi is not a school for science or for the grinding of personal axes.
hopefully, you can present us with some material evidence to support an investigation.
the body of the other victim was found on the sofa, his viscera torn from his torso.
the me's report says the times of death were hours apart, which means that this victim was dead hours before the second attack.
you told me that my science kept you honest, that it made you question your assumptions, that by it i'd made you a whole person.
if i change now, it... it wouldn't be right... or honest.
as i said, and as i am forced to reiterate, agent mulder, the fbi is not here for vendettas or for the grinding of personal axes.
this holds not just for you, but for everyone at the bureau.
you force us to put a point on this, to make some hard changes.
you and agent scully will cease all material association with the x-files.
and though it may not say it in her report, diana saw it, too.
she's certainly not gonna go around saying that just because science can't prove it, it isn't true.

agent fowley's report states that the man you saw attacked was bludgeoned by an unknown subject.
she makes no mention of a little boy who is nowhere to be found.
using a process that restores moisture to the documents and by a reassembling of fragments i should be able to recover a large percentage of the case material that was destroyed in my office fire several months ago.

the ice had become superheated by the ship as it rose beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.
this entire story is essentially unintelligible and, therefore, encourages unintelligible analysis.
who are growing corn in the middle of the desert which features pollen which was genetically altered to hold a virus which will be taken away by bees whose sting transmits the virus, causing the growth of an extraterrestrial biological entity inside the human host?
which we will prove now that the x-files have been reopened.
scientific proof that the virus she was infected with is, in fact, extraterrestrial.
next time, i'll wear a clown suit and do balloon tricks.
mulder, yes there is a scientific basis for what happened to me.
i was exposed to a virus but as it turns out, mulder, that virus is not what you thought.
i trumped up a story about a crazy indian on the loose.
never underestimate the public's willingness to blame the red man for...
inside or out, i don't see that there's a damn thing you can do for me.
you can break their backs, agent mulder, with the proof about this virus.
the first victim must have gotten infected with the virus somehow.
right here on the sofa was where the creature was born.
you think i can destroy you for what i know, because of what i am.
you're thinking you could've destroyed me, too and if i don't find this creature, you will.
if there was a problem, we would have heard about it.
like arizona's going to go without air conditioning for ten minutes.
and though it may not say it in her report, diana saw it, too.
and no matter what you think she's certainly not going to go around saying that just because science can't prove it isn't true.
agent mulder, i'm reading here a very pie-in-the-sky report about global domination plans by vicious, long-clawed spacelings?
is there going to be data to back this vague, omnibus account?
you're asking us to accept this report of a spaceship buried under polar ice and your death-defying escape from it?
the ice had become superheated by the ship as it rose beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.
this entire story is essentially unintelligible and, therefore, encourages unintelligible analysis.
well, i was hoping that you'd look more closely at the reports of mine and agent scully's medical conditions.
which we will prove now that the x-files have been reopened.
your presumption, agent mulder, is far greater than the case you make for that eventuality.
not that you can't question me and what i saw but what you can't question is the science.
there was some sloppiness in phoenix where they found the body.
i'm not going to let some brown-nose just slide in and take it all away from me.
i don't believe in your work, in the paranormal mumbo jumbo.
the body of the other victim was found here on the sofa his viscera torn from his torso.
but the mes report says that the times of death were hours apart which means that this victim was dead hours before the second attack.
- that would account for the violence done to the man's torso.
the virus producing an extraterrestrial biological entity that ripped away his chest as it birthed itself right here.
you've ignored your superiors and come here without cause or permission.
i'm going to get you censured for this and demand a review of ad skinner's actions.
as i said and as i am forced to reiterate, agent mulder, the fbi is not here for vendettas or for the grinding of personal axes.
now, this holds not just for you but for everyone at the bureau.

agent mulder, i'm reading here a very pie-in-the-sky report... about global domination plans by vicious, long-clawed spacelings?
is there going to be data to back this vague, omnibus account?
you're asking us to accept this report... of a spaceship buried under polar ice... and your death-defying escape from it?
the ice had become superheated by the ship... as it rose beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.
who are growing corn in the middle of the desert, which features... pollen which was genetically altered... to hold a virus which will be taken away by bees... whose sting transmits the virus, causing the growth... of an extraterrestrial biological entity inside the human host?
which we will prove now that the x-files have been reopened.
let us remind you that the f.b.i. is not a school for science, nor for the grinding of personal axes.
hopefully, you will be able to present us with some material evidence... to support a continued investigation.
agent scully, who was assigned to the x-files... as a scientist, was stung by one of these bees and was infected with this virus.
she is here today with hard and incontrovertible evidence, scientific proof that the virus she was infected with... is, in fact, extraterrestrial.
- the only reason i was in there... is because you assured me there was a scientific basis for what we saw.
let me remind you once again, what i saw was very little.
look, i don't like telling you this, and i know that you don't want to hear it.
not that you can't question me in what i saw, but what you can't question is the science.
i trumped up a story about a crazy indian on the loose.
never underestimate the public's willingness to blame the red man for... anything they can't explain.
he must've accidentally injected himself while he was working on the virus.
it took just 1 2 hours for the creature to gestate.
inside or out, i don't see that there's a damn thing you can do for me.
you can break their backs with proof about this virus, proof that what you say it does is true.
you've ignored your superiors and come here without cause or permission.
i'm gonna get you censured for this and demand a review of a.d. skinner's actions.
we have to take every precaution, make every effort... to ensure that nothing happens to this boy.
because whatever he is, whatever gives him the ability to do what he does, he's your scientific evidence, just like we said.
[ maslin ] as i said, and as i am forced to reiterate, agent mulder, the f.b.i. is not here for vendettas... or for the grinding of personal axes.
this holds not just for you but for everyone at the bureau.
you force us to put a point on this, to make some hard changes.

and no matter what you think, she's certainly not gonna go around saying... that just because science can't prove it, it isn't true.
- i see your renowned arrogance has been left quite intact.
you're asking us to accept this report... of a spaceship buried under polar ice... and your death-defying escape from it?
i was hoping you'd look more closely at the reports... of my and agent scully's medical conditions.
these spacelings, agent mulder -- they weren't something i saw in men in black ?
as much as this sounds like science fiction, we can and will... prove the validity of our report.
and so the plot -- i'm just trying to get this straight -- the plot is for these spacelings to take over the planet... aided by a group of men here on earth?
which we will prove now that the x-files have been reopened.
your presumption is greater than the case you make for that eventuality.

agent fowley took me to that plant at great risk to herself, where i saw something that you refuse to believe in-- saw it again, scully.
and though it may not say it in her report, diana saw it too.
by the way, i talked to lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.
you know, i shouldn't go out with a friend of yours.
i had to fish around in the evidence room for it.
you know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this new psycho-serial killer, the lopper.
you know the police, they found another victim of the lopper in riverside park.
i saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.
you know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
hey, so i talked to lisi and she has got a big surprise for you.
get well, get well soon, we want you to get well.
get well, get well soon, we want you to get well.
wanna come to mario's pizza and help me pick up the frogger?
hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you move it?
i saw the photo and it looked a lot like you.
there's a lot of people walking around that look like me.
well, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more of it.
hey, so i talked to lisi and she has got a big surprise for you.
you're better off sitting around reading comic books and eating spaghetti at 2 in the morning.
hey, speaking of tomato sauce, wanna come with me to mario's pizza?
oh, no, no, i had to fish around in the evidence room for it.
they're all preoccupied trying to hunt down this new psycho serial killer the lopper.
the police found another victim of the lopper in riverside park.

i have the sense on occasions that i go splat not to hurl myself again.
there's a difference between losing and being a loser who on some level, seeks out defeat.
i once asked him, " happy, what would you like your legacy to be? "
he said, that by the time he died he hoped it mattered that he lived.
and i think many of us here were caught off guard by the void he's left.
and little that i did know, i'm left with the feeling this was a person we should have known better.
there are three things we could do to make happy happy.
first call someone you should have called and tell them how you feel.
it is his business, but firing someone for skin color and i think you' re a nice color.
there've been many times i wished my wife glowed in the dark.
i don't know why i keep walking in a door too soon.
one day, i'm apt to come in and catch you naked.
members of the jury our witness has a small piece of spinach caught in an incisor.
when oral decay builds up between the teeth bacteria starts to build up colonies.
he had a certain radar for people who could maybe use some company.
i once asked him, " happy, what would you like your legacy to be? "
and little that i did know, i'm left with the feeling this was a person we should have known better.
that makes the hurt worse the sense that he's gone before we could....
first call someone you should have called and tell them how you feel.
second, go to lunch with someone you want to know better.
later i saw her laughing hysterically with some jerk who could flip a cigarette and catch it in his mouth.
given the choice, would you be interested in quantum correlations, or in learning how to catch cigarettes?
i have to wait for the team car to replace it.
we only have one car, to service me and the pack.
i know it'll come eventually, but i'm worried about losing my lead.
at that point, i turn and look in the other direction, and what do i see?
offers me water, asks if i need help, and i just stand there.
i forget where i am, i don't even know if i'm breathing.
i swear, beecher, you need to go see a doctor, man.
smelly farts is a sign of something seriously wrong on the inside.
that cocksucker doesn't come in here again unless you ask me.
how the fuck am i supposed to stop him from coming in?
the u.s. department of justice reports that the typical prisoner in america is an undereducated, young male minority, but you could've guessed that.
if that undereducated, young male minority receives his ged in prison, he is far less likely to come back.
judge richard kibler was sentenced today to 1 6 months in prison.
the veteran of the state criminal court was convicted of taking bribes in exchange for leniency in three murder cases...
now, it says here in this article that kibler took bribes in november.
and you weren't approached by him or anyone else about taking bribes?
mr. sprague, if you knew what was going on, why did you not go to the state judicial commission?
come on. i go to the state commission and nothing happens.
they share the same style of murder, same lawyer, same skin tone?
you're not gonna be able to turn this into something racial.
i need to be able to get calls as well as make them.
well, why don't we just run a switchboard into your pod?
is this because you don't like what i said about you in my book?
no, this is about the fact that you always ask for help and you're never willing to do anything for me in return.
yo, what was that you were saying about nothing good coming easy?
life in prison is some tough shit to wrap your mind around.
and our friends, they were amazed because shannon never got pregnant.
so one day before we got married, she decided to get tested.
and we find out that her tubes or whatever are blocked, so she can't have any kids.
i married her anyway, because i knew she felt like shit.
they most often have to be followed up with radiation or chemo.
so then the prison is footing the bill for this whole wingding?
- we can do a lot with that 1 8 grand.
i don't mean to sound cold, but whether ryan o'reily lives another two months or another 20 years means dick to me.
but, look, you may have to go live with other people who are more like you.
so if shannon tells you that you gotta go, i don't want you to cry, and i don't want you to give shannon a hard time.
look, i know he's just a criminal to you, but he's my fucking husband, understand?
now, i asked around and this operation is the cheapest thing that you can do.
well, if the aryan brotherhood's not involved, why was "jew" carved on his chest?
maybe some gang is trying to lay the blame on us.
shirley bellinger, who was convicted for the murder of her 4-year-old daughter, was sentenced to death today.
the first woman in this state to be executed since 1 84 1.
she will receive a lethal injection next month at oswald state penitentiary.
bellinger's lawyer has already filed an appeal in federal court and will hold a press conference tomorrow.
this call was made in the past week from em city by miguel alvarez.
warden, you know as well as i do, we monitor prisoners' calls randomly.
he was one of the most influential african-americans of his time.
he believed that education was the key to success for any man's life.
"l have great faith in the power and influence of fact.
it is seldom that anything is permanently gained by holding back fact. "
so he may have been harsh with those who did not.
look, all we ask is for the opportunity to explore the merits of the case.
come on. i go to the state commission and nothing happens.
except, the next time i'm in front of kibler, he cuts off my balls.
so one day before we got married, she decided to get tested.
and we find out that her tubes or whatever are blocked, so she can't have any kids.
look, ryan o'reily's going through enough shit dealing with being a man and having breast cancer.
i mean, his survival depends as much on a positive outlook as it does on the surgery.
well, if the aryan brotherhood's not involved, why was "jew" carved on his chest?
maybe some gang is trying to lay the blame on us.

your daughter and i are supposed to leave tonight for our honeymoon.

i was going through a hard time in london with my brother getting married and that guy thinking i was ross' mother.
i'd walk back to london for another frosty one of those bad boys.
they have them at the british pub by the trade center.
when you make out the card, be sure to make it out to "emily."
it's good that you had such a good time in greece.
i wanted to talk to you about this whole new european thing you've got going on.
and i need to say it makes me very uncomfortable and i just, you know, just stop it!
you couldn't just do me a favor and, like, hold them in?
sorry, i'm in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do.
he's hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her.
i don't care if i said some other girl's name, you prissy old twit!
i bet if i talked to carol and susan i could convince them to move to london with ben.
i'm sure your ex-wife would be more than happy to move so you can patch things up with your new wife.
i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed.
i went down to the park and i let a bee sting me.
i'm still mad at them, but they bring happiness to lots of kids whose moms didn't kill themselves.
by supporting them, i'm doing a good thing, but i'm not happy about it.
look i got carried away before, but there's something you got to know.
if i'm the best, it's only because you made me the best.
remember when they fought and broke up and we were stuck here all night with no food?
when ross said "rachel" at the wedding, i figured it'd happen again.
but i've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
i don't know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there.
i'm also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition.
if i pretend to not know about you then you pretend there's nothing to know.
i have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
just filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.
he came at us, so rachel used a bug bomb on him.
i pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass.
how about we have this conversation when one of you marries?
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work.
besides, i don't go for guys right after they get divorced.
right, you only go for them five minutes before they get married.
since you'll be here a while we could put your name on the answering machine.
i hope you don't mind but i kind of already jazzed it up a little.
i took larry there, but it was all violated, so we shut it down.
if this guy keeps closing our favorite places, where will we eat?
"as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health till death parts us."
as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health until death parts us.
"as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health till death parts us."
as my lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health until death parts us.

listen, since we're on that subject i just wanted to tell you that....
l was going through a hard time in london with my brother getting married and that guy thinking i was ross' mother.
in this programme we're going to look... at some important areas of british life.
we're going to find out what the british do on holiday... what kinds of animals are common in britain... what people watch and read... and what they do in their free time.
women work about 31 hours a week and usually retire at the age of 60.
for women the average is less because many of them work part-time.
although manufacturing is still important... more and more people now work in offices... and spend a lot of the day working with computers.
one very big business in britain today is finance ... money.
london's the number one financial centre in europe... and number three in the world behind new york and tokyo.
retailing is important, too ... selling goods to people like you and me.
these days we can send information all over the world... at the touch of a button.
as more people go on-line, so more people are working from home.
although july and august are the most popular months... not everyone takes their holidays at the same time.
lots of people take a two-week break, but they can choose when to take it.
over 25 per cent of all british holiday makers go there.
why do so many british people go abroad for their holidays?
bournemouth... and here, brighton, which is only 100 kilometres from london.
people come here to swim, windsurf, sunbathe or just sit in a deckchair.
brighton is a place for family holidays... because there are lots of things to do.
they all have a good time... and it doesn't matter how old you are!
over 2 million british people spend their holidays in devon or cornwall... in the south-west of england.
in the north, the lake district and scotland are both very popular.
not everyone wants to spend 2 weeks lying on a beach.
many british people have activity holidays... doing things such as climbing, cycling, walking in the hills, or... sailing on a narrow boat along a canal.
you can travel gently through the countryside... and spend a little time visiting interesting places.
you don't have to book a hotel, because you sleep on the boat.
but there are even more sheep than pigs and cows together.
there are about 44 and a half million sheep in britain.
it's also one of the easiest to see because they live all over britain.
fallow deer live in the countryside but you can see them in some parks too.
you can easily recognise a badger because of its black and white nose.
they usually come out at night so you'll be lucky to see one.
the grey squirrel is a little bit bigger than the red squirrel... and it's much better at finding food.
nowadays you can only find red squirrels in scotland... and some parts of england.
there are just over 800 golden eagles left in the wild.
they are one of the largest british birds and one of the most beautiful.
one is the rspca... the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.
it started in 1824 and was the first society in the world to protect animals.
... her knee here and that's what i can feel ... and that's what the vet who saw her yesterday said.
we've got two choices in terms of what to do with her:
the two most popular daily newspapers are tabloids... the sun and the mirror.
over three and half million people buy the sun every day... and over two and a quarter million buy the mirror.
on average british people watch almost 24 hours of television a week.
most households have at least one television... and 46 per cent of british children have a television in their bedroom.
in my free time i usually play sport... which is usually tennis if the weather is nice or swimming.
i like playing rugby. i'm a member of a rugby team.
and, of course, watching sport is a big free time activity.
favourite sports include football... horseracing... and cricket, a traditional english sport.
the london eye opened in march 2000... and is one of london's most popular attractions.
but what to british do at home in their free time?
it covers an area of about 1500 square kilometres in the centre of england.
the government created national parks in 1949 to protect the environment.
the peak district lies between manchester and sheffield... and near several other large towns and cities.
a third of the population of britain can get here in less than an hour.
pollution has been a problem in britain since the nineteenth century.
at that time london became famous for its smog... a mixture of smoke and fog.
smog continued to be a big problem in the twentieth century, too.
in 1952, four thousand people died when the smog lasted for several days.
looking after the environment has become an important part of british life.
in such a crowded country... it's essential to protect the countryside so that people can enjoy it.
if you need medicine, your gp will write a prescription for you... to take to a chemist's or pharmacy.
you don't have to pay to see your doctor... but you will probably have to pay part of the cost of your medicine... unless you belong to one of the groups of people who get their medicine free... for example, you're a student, or over 60, or expecting a baby.
when the nhs started in 1948... it provided free visits to doctors and dentists... free treatment, free prescriptions, free eye tests and free glasses.
but today many people have to pay for prescriptions... for eye tests and glasses... and for trips to the dentist.
nearly a million people work in the national health service in britain... and it costs almost 40 billion a year.
it's a lot of money ... and there are still problems.
people sometimes have to wait a long time before they can see a specialist... or have an operation.
because of this, many people see private doctors and use other kinds of treatment... or alternative medicine, like reflexology, homeopathy, and acupuncture.
ok, and where were you, under what circumstances was it taken?
we were in the park, and we were eating our lunch.
unlike police in many other countries, these officers don't carry guns.
i've covered the city for a good ten years as a foot officer.
i've found that a pleasure to do that, and the locals have been very supportive.
i think the public's view of the police, and the police's view of the public... is very very similar.
and we work very hard with the community... to try and solve their problems.
i would say oxford during the day, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.... is like every city very beautiful... it's got a lot of nice places where the tourists and the locals can go.
and then on a night time, 7 at night onwards... it's like manchester and london.
it becomes very busy, a lot of people out, socialising, drinking... and the drink then adds to the problems.
there are about one hundred and fifty thousand police officers in britain.
another important part of their work is the fight against crime.
after people are arrested, they come to somewhere like this ... a court.
in scotland the system is a little different... but in england and wales there are two main types of court... the magistrates' court and the crown court.
that's the second highest proportion of the population... in any country in western europe.
in britain the death penalty for murder was abolished in 1969.
tomorrow, master, when the sun is high, vladislas will be dust.
you are a never ending source of joy to me, serena.
she will destroy vladislas for us and be trapped in the labyrinth.
and when the sunsets we can ravish her and seize the bloodstone.
each day i pray to god to make me mortal again.
to be feel the warmth of the sand upon my face.
penny and stephen are coming tomorrow, i shall be cooking all morning.
they're not going to be crawling about looking for bits of fluff, are they?
but if i'm not back in two days, send out a search party.
this may sound a very basic question, but you did switch on at the plug?
somewhat against the odds perhaps, and with sandy to help, but she did.
the agency is doing very well and maybe judy doesn't want to go back to...
she's a decent sort at heart but, my god, does she meddle?
she'd be into all my patients' affairs before you could say "lower bicuspid."
i am in the prime of life and have all my faculties.
except for occasional numbness in the little toe of my left foot.
mum, when sandy and harry go away for this week in jersey,
i really would like it if you would come into the office and give me a hand.
i'm sure they are, but hasn't he got his priorities mixed up?
which would you prefer, a week's holiday with sandy or a rugby tour?
well, i'm sorry for sandy, but it does take the strain off, doesn't it?
if she'd gone, we'd have had two weeks of sheer tension about whether you should go to work, it'd be like the build-up to the world cup.
i came to believe she was lying cos she's kind and that comes to the same thing.
i'll work on that one when i've got a week or two to spare.
this little weed came to the school, little arthur, and tom brown helped him.
i'm tom brown, you're not little arthur and you're certainly not a new boy.
assuming you're right, look at it from judy's point of view.
do you know how she once described her function in that agency when you were in charge?
she's a decent sort at heart but, my god, does she meddle?
she'd be into all my patients' affairs before you could say "lower bicuspid."
i am in the prime of life and have all my faculties.
except for occasional numbness in the little toe of my left foot.

-rafe there's enough hurt to go around without your vicious tongue.
i should never have let you be anywhere near that reservation.
no, but he's been caught and he's gonna stand trial for kidnapping.
bring him here. lf he did this, he'll be punished by tribal law.
people think you took her so you could have your way with her.
but you'd have done that long before we found you if that were so.
yeah, but she'd still be alive if i hadn't let him get away.
thought i had a sense of him knew who he was.
well, maybe when he gets to be my age, he'll regret that, like i do.
it is our belief that each person has their own path.
you can't condemn a whole people for the actions of one man.
if we allow this atrocity to pass, how many more will we face?
maybe you good samaritans ought to take this party out of here.
you call yourself a man of god, but you're a heathen.
well we can't all be as pure as you, can we, mr. mosley?
i'm gonna search this reservation till i find him and then i'm gonna find a tall tree.
but, mom, it's just a costume party, you've gotta let me go,
the whole world is going, if i don't go, i'll be a freak,
i have my reasons, and i will explain them to you when you're, taller,
mom, you've been saying that for, like, my whole life, ok?
could i talk to you in the kitchen for just one minute?
absolutely, dear, as soon as i get the children into their costumes,
nothing has to hold me here, mother, i like being here,
i can have a normal life here, they can have a normal life here,
you can't tell what's in a monster's heart just by looking at 'em,
i mean, sometimes, some of the slimiest, raunchiest, ugliest little monsters turn out to be the nicest,
and after i specifically told you not to tell them anything about it,
i was only trying to do what you should have done long ago,
marnie is my daughter, and if i decide not to train her like a witch, then it's none of your business,
a witch's 13th halloween is supposed to mark the completion of her training,
do you really want them to go through life doing things the hard way?
i mean, look at you, with your plastic bowls, when you know leftover chicken keeps better when it's back on the bone,
the clock has finally run out, and you can just go home,
gwen, as much as i think you're making a terrible mistake with marnie, you're wrong about why i came here tonight,
oh, i've tried, you know how it is today, no one wants to get involved,
mother, i'm sure that you believe that there's some kind of problem,
then she talked about all this weird stuff that's happening in halloweentown, like it's a real place, and then she turned our leftovers into a live chicken, standing right there in the bowl,
and that's why i knew that she is a witch, and so is mom and so am i!
we kind of lost her in the crowd getting off the bus, do you know where she lives?
oh, of course, she's lived in the same house for 200 years,
need you to give them a lift up to their grandma's place,
sure, it's just over the river and through the woods, ha!
yeah, well, i suppose it would be all right if you could stay a little while,
as long as we get you home before it's midnight in the mortal world,
are you gonna use your magic to raise some spirits, have a big séance and call on the forces of darkness to get it going?
no, i'm just gonna fill it up and see if the light goes on,
well, let's look at the original recipe, come, come, come over here,
now, let's look, let's all look, quick, now see, that's it!
i like halloweentown, but why do you have to live so far away, grandma?
well, there was a time when humans and monsters and witches and vampires and all the rest of us could be together,
i want you to leave this alone for now, especially with the children,
it's much too dangerous for you to be involved with by yourself,
i'm friends with some very powerful creatures around here, you know,
oh, that luke dude - he's turned into such a wiener,
i have big plans for all of us here in halloweentown,
you are the last person i ever expected to see here,
you always did let your magic do the talking, thank you,
you used to like it, or have you forgotten that part?
say, i ought to show you around, we could take the styx river cruise,
have a little dinner, then i could show you all our old haunts, eh?
oh, and if you marry him, i am not calling him "dad,"
i'm not marrying anyone, and this discussion is over, we are going home,
but, mom, i mean, you can go home if you want to,
i mean, sophie probably doesn't belong here, and dylan thinks he's hallucinating anyway, i'll be all right by myself,
i mean, give me a break, i have trouble remembering agua.
i thought you said you're a witch, the least you can do is remember a dumb spell,
you can't be serious, you're not actually thinking of going into that thing,
i have to, it's the only way to save mom and grandma,
no, he'll see you, you'll end up just like the others,
, to our true natures, to celebrate the evil within us, to reveal ourselves as we really are,
you could have ruled with me as my queen, but you chose a human instead,
well, it turns out she was a pretty good judge of character,
no way, i don't have any powers, i'm the normal one in this family,
hey, chocolate bar, you better give that talisman back or you're in big trouble,
i guess i didn't turn into a handsome prince though, huh?
no, but you did that before when you decided to help me,
look, marnie, i am sorry, but you are not going out on halloween, why?
i have my reasons, and i will explain them to you when you're, , taller, mom, you've been saying that for, like, my whole life, ok?
i mean, seeing as how marnie likes weird stuff so much,
- yeah, halloween is, like, made for her, - skeletons, witches, vampires, , she spends our whole math class drawing ghosts in her notebook,
i think it's obvious why halloween is bad, that whole razor-blade-in-the-apple thing was an urban myth, of course, but then, all that candy causes cavities and gum disease, and those masks everybody wears have these weird kind of toxic fumes inside
that make your arms go limp, and, , and, , it's totally too late for him, marnie, i'm sorry, i know that you want to go out with your friends, but there are just some things about halloween that you don't understand,
right, like there's some big, mysterious reason why we can't go out, face it, mom, you don't trust your own kids,
- that is not true, - yes, it is, you keep us all in this big bubble, how are we supposed to grow up if we can't explore the world, try new stuff and take some risks?
- ooh, that's the spirit, - wow, put on our bikinis and go swimming in it!
and then we'll put up the decorations so we can get this party started!
i've always said the movies can teach us about life, mother, as i just got through telling marnie, halloween is not, , what else can i do, grandma?
well, now, why don't you put out the pumpkins, you see?
- encouragement, not good, - no, and you know what else?
i have déja vu a lot, i mean, like, all the time, really?
- well, you know, if you could practice, , - mother!
could i talk to you in the kitchen for just one minute?
- but mom, , - no, no, she's right, she's right,
- we'll eat the candy later, - ok, come on, here we go, whoo!
i mean, there's plenty of room for all of you at my house, mother, , and since william's passed on, there's nothing to hold you here, nothing has to hold me here, mother, i like being here,
i can have a normal life here, they can have a normal life here, being normal is vastly overrated, well, i like being normal,
you know, mother, as much as i want the kids to know their family, the fact is, , you're not normal,
every time you come into this house, it's-it's chaos, and the candy and the decorations and the, ,
no, i wouldn't think so, my story is about a magical place where many sorts of different creatures live together in peace, like cleveland?
i hear they have a nice school district, well, actually, the place i'm speaking of is called halloweentown, and the residents are a bit more, , exotic, monsters, goblins, ghosts, vampires, gnomes and skeletons,
i don't like witches, they're mean and scary, no, no, no, sweetheart,
i mean, they're just like everyone else, some are kind, some are mean, that's the way they use their magic, you can't tell what's in a monster's heart just by looking at 'em,
- all right, look, a ghost, just like we were playing, grandma,
look, and there's a werewolf and a vampire and a gnome, dog man, grandma, this book is so neat, it has, like, all the stuff i'm interested in, great, the weirdo encyclopedia,
perhaps marnie has a secret life we don't know anything about, well, if she is a witch, she's got the weird part down pat, it's just the magic powers she's missing, what about it, dear?
have you cast any spells or taken midnight flights through the sky?
i wish, but the truth is, , there's nothing special about me, no, dear, you're very special, you're a cromwell!
and since the dawn of time, the cromwells have been the most powerful, , mother,
i was only trying to do what you should have done long ago, why, you're on the verge of breaking a tradition that goes back more than 1,000 years, , your tradition, mother, not mine,
marnie is my daughter, and if i decide not to train her like a witch, then it's none of your business, a witch's 13th halloween is supposed to mark the completion of her training, if marnie's training doesn't at least begin tonight, her powers will be lost forever,
she'll finally be normal, like her brother, like her father and like sophie will be after her,
gwen, a human father, why, you're only lucky that you have two children that are showing powers at all!
do you really want them to go through life doing things the hard way?
i mean, look at you, with your plastic bowls, when you know leftover chicken keeps better when it's back on the bone, mother, get that thing out of here right now,
for years, you have been coming here, you've been dropping hints to marnie, and you've been badgering me to start her training,
i know that that's why you came here tonight, mother, but the fight is over, you know that?
the clock has finally run out, and you can just go home,
gwen, as much as i think you're making a terrible mistake with marnie, you're wrong about why i came here tonight, the fact is, i came to ask for your help, my help, with what?
well, something is wrong at home, something's happening, every day, i find another neighbor has changed, turned hateful, it's frightening, and soon after that, they disappear altogether, please, mother, my neighbors disappear sometimes too, it's called moving,
gwendolyn, i'm quite serious about this, it's as though something or someone is trying to return us to the dark times, and i fear my powers alone may not be enough to stop it,
i need another cromwell witch, i need you, mother, there are plenty of other witches and warlocks in halloweentown, why don't you recruit one of them?
i've tried, you know how it is today, no one wants to get involved, mother, i'm sure that you believe that there's some kind of problem, but i can't just leave my kids to go fight some nameless force in another world
that i have nothing to do with, nothing to do with?
well, fine, bury your head in the sand of the precious mortal world of yours, perhaps the cromwell line will end with you, but let's just hope that halloweentown doesn't come to an end along with it,
i think it proves insanity is hereditary, i just hope boys are immune,
it must be, um, one of those radio-controlled models, she's leaving, she's going back to halloweentown, i gotta go after her, go after her?
i could lose my powers forever, you don't really believe all this witch stuff is true, do ya?
dylan, haven't you ever wondered about the stuff that goes on in our house?
no, like why mom won't let us talk about, watch or read anything that has the word "magic" in it?
no, haven't you ever wondered why we pretend halloween doesn't exist?
- no, - well, i have, and now that i've found out the truth,
i'm not gonna stay here and turn all boring and human like you, what do you mean, boring like me?
- i don't know, can i put my shoe on now?
- i'm having the déja vu feeling again, - you knew i was gonna put on my shoe?
it's not like the old days, people are jaded, i raise a demon from the underworld, and they say, "big deal, i saw the same thing on jerry springer."
i've always loved a good scare for old time's sake, must be, you know, one of those charter buses coming back from a costume party at the moose lodge, or maybe, ,!
- dylan, this is it, - mom said they were just pretend,
dylan, this is halloweentown, just like the book, or maybe we fell asleep on the bus, yeah, that's it, it's all a dream, the decorations, the goblins, the witches, the ghosts, ,
and grandma - she was a dream, too, no - grandma, where'd she go?
she's gotta be around here somewhere, we've got to find her, what are you doing?
you're a bad influence, the pumpkin doesn't look very nice like in the book, you're right, it is different,
- it's the bad thing, - how do you know about that?
well, i did a long time ago, is she here with you?
um, , no, but that's ok, see, we came with our grandma, we kind of lost her in the crowd getting off the bus, do you know where she lives?
well, i found a bunch of cromwells in the town square, need you to give them a lift up to their grandma's place, sure, it's just over the river and through the woods, ha!
no, actually, it's just two streets over, up a quarter mile past the old movie theater, say hi to aggie for me and, , there you go,
yeah, well, i suppose it would be all right if you could stay a little while, as long as we get you home before it's midnight in the mortal world, but that's only two hours from now,
well, don't panic, dear, you see, time works differently in halloweentown, two hours there might be two days here, or two weeks, if we're on vacation,
are you gonna use your magic to raise some spirits, have a big séance and call on the forces of darkness to get it going?
no, i'm just gonna fill it up and see if the light goes on, ooh, if i can get it lit and install it properly, it should suffice to drive away this force that threatens us,
i do have to say a spell over it, that's why i came - to ask your mother to help me, you see, spells are much more powerful when more than one witch joins in,
- especially if they're cromwells, - well, i'll help you, that's very sweet of you, dear, but you haven't been trained yet, and since your mother isn't of the mind to help,
ha, drat, that's what i get for trying to use instant,
just doesn't work like it does when you make it from scratch, well, that's something i can help you with!
well, let's look at the original recipe, come, come, come over here, now, let's look, let's all look, quick, now see, , that's it!
"vampire's fang, hair of a werewolf, sweat of a ghost, ,"
well, there was a time when humans and monsters and witches and vampires and all the rest of us could be together, it was the dark times, that was a bad mix, because humans feared us and tried to destroy us,
so we did our best to make them miserable in return, but it was turning us evil, which we are not!
come along, children, but let's be real careful, and marnie, not a wor, , marnie!
she's found the brooms, cool, flying brooms, wow, well, marnie, grandma, look at these things!
if you think you can handle it, handle it, this is a cromwell you're talking to, dear, she'll be an expert in no time, check it out, well, um, how do you make it go?
you know, by magic, right, i knew that, how sweet, buying little marlie here her first broom?
it's marnie, this is a local boy, luke, hey, don't sell me too short there, grammy,
i'm something of a big cheese around here, maybe i could show you around sometime, buy you an ice cream, the abominable snowman has a little shop down the street, you know, i was kind of hungry,
but then, , i smelled something stinky, it must have been the big cheese, perhaps another time, yeah, like never,
you know, if you people were smart, you'd be nice to me,
i'm friends with some very powerful creatures around here, you know, ,
that luke dude - he's turned into such a wiener, all right, now, if you want to be totally rad, , you've got to have the day-glo bristles, now, the purple dragonfly here - it's awesome,
- and i thought you were brave, - hey, this is mom, stop it, i don't want to hear any more excuses,
i want you all just to get back on that bus, because we are going home, but, mom, grandma needs help, and since you won't help her, she needs the only other cromwell witch there is - me,
- you are not a witch, - yes, i am, no thanks to you, you were gonna let my powers go away forever, marnie, there is so much more involved in this than you understand,
i understand that i am here, and i've got a broom, and i'm gonna learn everything that grandma can teach me,
she was born in the human world and human is what she'll be, no, i won't, you put that broom down right now, young lady, you are grounded,
say goodbye to grandma, everybody, it's time for us to go home,
- that's the only one we've got, - hey, hey, that's my espresso,
- no, no, hey, , - and i'm never going to school again!
i have big plans for all of us here in halloweentown, you are the last person i ever expected to see here, it's been a long time?
you always did let your magic do the talking, thank you, you used to like it, or have you forgotten that part?
- i have no idea, you know, i always hoped you'd come back, now here you are, say, i ought to show you around, we could take the styx river cruise, have a little dinner, then i could show you all our old haunts?
um, actually, i'm trying to leave, it seems the bus was delayed, and i was hoping that the, , you were hoping the mayor could help you out,
that's enough, and if you marry him, i am not calling him "dad,"
i'm not marrying anyone, and this discussion is over, we are going home,
go away, luke, i'm not in the mood, family trouble, grammy?
guess it's just you again, you know, it must get pretty frustrating, fighting this thing all alone, no one believing you, what do you know about that?
but, mom, i mean, you can go home if you want to,
i mean, sophie probably doesn't belong here, and dylan thinks he's hallucinating anyway, i'll be all right by myself, marnie, you're 13, but all the other witches get to do all kinds of stuff when they're 13,
yes, yes, you showed signs of having the powers, and i hid them from you, just like i am doing with sophie, and i did it for you, because this is not your world,
your father was human, and that is the world that we live in, period, look, if you want to give up your roots, that's fine, but i don't, and it's not right for you to try to make me,
first you put them under an evil spell, and then you turn them into statues, no, not statues, they're very much alive!
merely frozen in time until i need them, to do what?
- well, he is a werewolf, - can i help you kids?
yeah, um, i was just wondering if you had any part-time jobs available,
- maybe even doing some hairstyling, - don't touch that, ok?
- don't worry, i use these all the time, - put that down, the other button!
- no, no, the other button, what i need you to do, , it's only to be used by a trained professionals so just put the thing down,
i got it, i got it, the other button, sweetheart, put the thing down,
come back here, you little hum, , hey, this could be a good look for me, yeah, baby,
round, round, run around, turn and turn, and number two, and turn and turn, and stir the cauldron, one, two, three, with your left hand, now we're gonna stroke and stroke,
keep those hips moving, and stroke, keep on going, now, stroke, and, dogs, keep on up with the others, no slobbering on people?
please, stroke and stroke, keep on going now, stroke and stroke, there's gotta be a ghost around here someplace, come on,
all right, distract him long enough so i can get the sweat, would you get a grip?
he can't sweat, he doesn't have a body, just distract him,
i hear your mother's in town, um, well, yeah, she just, she's hanging out with our grandma, we just came to do a little shopping, but we're done now, ok?
so, bye, hey, i got a fare up that way anyway, why don't you let me give you a lift?
i mean, give me a break, i have trouble remembering agua.
i thought you said you're a witch, the least you can do is remember a dumb spell, ok, ok,
it sounded pretty, so i made up a song for it, bet y march, bet y guythur...
i like to make up songs, you know, grandma says that spells are stronger when you have more than one witch, you wanna help me?
grandma says that spells are simple, that you just have to want it and then let yourself have it, ok, let's do it,
bet y march, bet y guythur, bet y gugaun, cledyfrutm anoeth bid.
you can't be serious, you're not actually thinking of going into that thing,
i have to, it's the only way to save mom and grandma, but what are we gonna do?
- marnie, it's a trap, he's waiting for you, - out of my way, luke, look, about what happened earlier,
i didn't know he was gonna do that to your mom and grandma, save your tricks, twerp, ok?
i offer you the chance to return to our days of glory, to end this exile from the mortal world, which the humans have stolen from us,
follow me, my fellow citizens of halloweentown, too long have we been exiled to this second-class world, forced to live here in this halloweentown,
i've got to install this thing before it's too late, no, he'll see you, you'll end up just like the others,
, , to our true natures, to celebrate the evil within us, to reveal ourselves as we really are, calabar?
- look, i made an awful mistake, so let me try and make up for it, it's our only chance, but before we can be sure of success, we must find the one who would stop us,
the one who is half human, young cromwell, you thought you could hide from me?
your days of rule are at an end, calabar, do not underestimate me, agatha,
now my darkness will spread unchecked and i will be ruler of both worlds!
, , like a dark shadow over, , no way, i don't have any powers, i'm the normal one in this family, hey, chocolate bar, you better give that talisman back or you're in big trouble,
you half-human brat, do you think that your magic is any match for mine?
no, but let's see if my powers and my mom's and my grandmother's and my sister's and my brother's might do it, hit it, guys,
silly witches, you cromwells have failed, come on, dylan, we need you, believe,
you were right, there was a lot about halloweentown that i, , i didn't understand, and i'm sorry about the things i said and did, and i'm sorry that i didn't trust you,
you are everything i could've ever hoped for in a daughter and so much more, thank you, my, you've got quite a coven here, my dear,
no, but you did that before when you decided to help me,
i never could've done it without you, thanks, hey, if you ever come back to halloweentown, look me up,
i could use a babysitter on thursday nights, you know my pta meetings, sometimes they go on forever, well, dear, you know that i can't cross over, only on halloween night,
well, then i guess you're just gonna have to come live with us, that is, if you want to,
i mean, i only opened the portal to save the entire world, thank me very much!
i should be getting a parade, but no, no, no, i get a summons instead,
- you got her started, - any idea how to turn her off?
oh, and you know why they don't like my idea of letting the kids from halloween town go to school here?
i say that if the portal's open, we might as well use it, right?
now, council president dalloway, i really must put several of my feet down, you and this council are determined to leave us defenseless, the idea of sending children into the human world...
they'll have me, and my mother and my grandmother, they'll have the entire cromwell clan protecting them,
i doubt that even you are a match for the knights, knights, you mean, like, round table, shields, lances, metal suits knights?
besides, we have nothing to worry about, there aren't any knights, well, of course not, it's just a story parents in halloween town tell their kids to scare them, it's like... the bogeyman,
oh, he's back in town, he's been asking about you, for the 10,000th time, mother, no,
i'd really rather that we weren't late on our first day of school, oy, soph!
yeah, i'm not screwing up my perfect attendance record just because you want to bring a little peace and harmony to the universe, some things are more important than your perfect attendance record, like reuniting the worlds, for example,
why does reuniting the worlds have to involve me sharing a bathroom with an ogre and a gremlin named bobby?
if i can get this spell right, none of us will have to share any bathrooms,
- we'll just meet you at school, dear, - wait, grandma, wait, see?
no problem, she's gonna meet us at school, what is she thinking?
she can't come to school dressed like that, oh, i wouldn't worry, if she brings the flying school bus, people won't even notice what she's wearing, flying school bus?
she wouldn't, oh, my gosh, we'd better go, come on, let's go, everybody, quick, sophie, come on,
i've never met a human before, my guidebook says it's important to make direct eye contact and not to show fear, ha, hi, i'm marnie, and that would be lesson number one on how not to greet humans,
see, people around here automatically assume that everyone they meet is human, oh, well, that's good to know, this is cassie, she's a neighbor of mine, where are the other kids?
- better write that down, ok, well, hi, and welcome, we don't really have a lot of time for introductions, but i wanna take a moment to stress how important it is that you try and blend in,
- wish me luck, - good luck, ok, come on, guys, let's go,
- bye, - see you later, good luck, guys, i have your school schedules here, cassie?
well, if you'll excuse me, i've got to go see a man about a job,
- you know, it's not quite an exact science, - yes, it is, it is a science, that's why they call it science 101, you're supposed to be here
- so this kind of thing doesn't happen, - what's a green puff of smoke, anyway?
marnie, you of all people should know that things aren't always what they seem, hm, this is way better than a teachers' lounge, can i please take this off now?
of course, dear, you're perfectly safe in here, oh, and if anyone else wants to unzip, it's ok, oh, it's about time,
oh, no, things are definitely not what they seem, how much longer do i have to wear this stupid human suit?
you guys have to remember that to most humans, you don't exist, you're make-believe, but hopefully, over time, we can change all that,
i had three, everyone keeps saying, "hey, what's up?" what's up where?
- yeah, i heard that, too, - ok, it's your turn,
- i really think this is gonna work, - was there ever any doubt?
you had an idea, you followed it through, i am so proud of you,
i just hope that someday i won't feel like i'm leading separate lives,
- you know, that i'm two different people, - both of them equally annoying, oh, do you have any unicorn milk?
i said i was sorry, come on, guys, keep up, uh, you know, you really don't need to show us where our classes are, well, maybe not, but everybody is counting on me,
and i want to make sure that absolutely nothing goes wrong, ok,
i waited around for you yesterday after school, but you kind of disappeared, oh, i was...
i must've been at a meeting or something, you waited for me?
i don't know, but that's what we're going to find out, and if there really are knights?
we have a lot more to lose than just our magic,
what do you know about that boy you were talking to?
i don't know that much about him, i mean, he's new and he...
i thought this was a progressive school, and i'll have you know not one of my students went to sleep, true, though one did get a little infection when the llama spit in his eye,
i'd like you to fill in over in the history department, as a favor to me, hm, how can i refuse?
oh, so many fond memories, now, the renaissance was also called the age of enlightenment, and that's just because between the plague and all of the boneheads in charge refusing to write things down, people pretty much forgot everything they learned for the last 5,000 years,
and divine the ancients were, except for their breath, it's always hummus this and hummus that, oh, but that's another topic, it was also where we supposedly discovered the new world,
columbus did not discover america, he couldn't find his socks, let alone a continent,
tomorrow, somebody remind me to tell you a funny story about da vinci, oh, there was a good reason the mona lisa was smiling,
i was observing the eating habits of your average human, apparently you cram as much food into your mouth as possible, then start to talk,
yeah, ok, wi don't know if that's all humans, but you definitely have teenage boys down,
we're not risking our futures so you guys can hide out in the back of a locker,
i mean, come on, you guys gotta get out there, participate, participate?
yeah, she's right, ooh, and nancy, how about the gardening club?
no better gardener than a wood nymph, mm-hm, and chester, how about trying for the wrestling team?
i think auditions are this week, see, we're all here to make connections and celebrate common bonds,
i mean, if we're gonna do it, then let's do it right, right?
i come to you by that which you profess, how ere you come to know it, answer me!
he's pretty good, oh, shakespeare offered me a part in the original production, mm-hm!
ok, now, i know this may seem a little overwhelming at first,
i mean, we're definitely not in halloween town anymore, but if you really want to get the full human world experience it's important that you sample all of our customs, and like it or not, the mall is definitely one of the most human things that...
- not me, you, it's been 15 minutes and you haven't gone running off with a crazy excuse,
i know, i'm sorry, it must seem like i'm always running off,
there was a fight and this smoke came out of nowhere,
- i couldn't see anything, - it's ok, everything's gonna be fine, come on, ethan, let's go, what?
i thought the threat had come from halloween town, that someone here was trying to scare us into getting what they wanted - our magic and the portal sealed,
i offer a compromise, we end the program, shut down the portal, no, you can't do that!
and you and your family can keep your precious magic, marnie, considering everything that's happened,
i think that's a very generous offer, we may never get this opportunity again...
you said i have my magic until midnight on halloween, right?
well, i intend to use every ounce of my power and every second of time to prove to you that you are wrong about humans, so you know what?
we'd never abandon you, we were there, there weren't any knights,
- yeah, there were just a couple of punks, - and most of it was our fault, this... this wasn't my fault, look, if we all just stick together, we'll figure out what's going on,
yeah, good luck, we only have till next week, we are so gonna do this,
if you don't start talking to me, we're definitely gonna lose our magic, fine, but what am i supposed to do?
i try and bring it to life every time, well, actually, that's part of the problem, parents have been complaining about, well, some of your teaching methods,
oh, it's just this old briefcase, it keeps coming open and snapping closed on things,
i mean, if we were dealing with somebody from halloween town, they wouldn't have had to smash their way in, so maybe we really are dealing with somebody from this world,
i have to talk to grandma, well, wait, what do you want me to do?
but if there's one thing i can do, it's keep a secret, oh, and what is that supposed to mean?
i know you didn't do it on purpose, but maybe you just said a little something to your little friend, oh, my little friend?
oh, i didn't say that, but we have to be open to the possibilities, there's no possibility, you know why?
- 'cause i'm done talking to you, - good, because i'm through listening, fine!
yeah, i saw the note that your grandma gave you on the first day, aggie was right,
i can't believe it, i don't know what game you're trying to play, but i'm warning you, you better knock it off, now, hey, don't worry, the only thing i was trying to do was to get to know you better,
oh, poor cassie, i can't believe they got her, do you think they're gonna come after us next?
no, you have nothing to worry about, how can you say that?
i was beginning to think you had disappeared, too, oh, no, i was doing a little investigating and i needed your mother's help, aggie put a spell on the clubhouse, something i remembered from the dark days,
it's a spell to prevent humans from crossing the threshold, we checked the clubhouse and the spell hasn't been broken, wait, so that means that somebody from halloween town was definitely responsible, or it could just mean that it's one of us,
so no one is going back to halloween town just yet, we all have to try and stick together, all of us, even though one of us is a pigheaded old woman who can't stop using magic for two seconds,
or if one of us is in over her head and says stupid, selfish things because she's scared and frustrated, we definitely have to stick together, oh, grandma, i love you, do you ever get the feeling you missed something?
ethan has one, he uses it to call his dad all the time,
- oh, go get it, - wait, don't you have one?
i think i see something going by the window, hm, eyes in the back of her head, explains why i never got away with anything growing up,
i just saw it, too, hm, which explains why we never got away with anything, keep talking, just...
yeah, oh, i know you and cassie were good friends, but try not to worry too much,
i'm sure she's gonna be just fine... wherever she is, hm, what?
oh, no, that's ok, i have my own method of transportation, hm...
- see ya later, - see you later, more like me every day, ha!
yes, for centuries, my family has been keeping a vigil, a vigil to ensure that our world remains pure of the magical,
i'm the last remaining descendant of a noble order, please, you wouldn't have even known that the knights of the iron dagger existed if i hadn't found you and told you, but i'm still a knight, right?
but you are such a good boy, did everything you were told, i...
you said no one was gonna get hurt, you said they would just give up,
no offense, then they'll understand that this portal must be closed permanently, a separate world for freaks?
i'm all for it, nothing's going to stop us now, the cromwell's will stop you.
i think so, then we better get started, wish me luck finding cassie,
it's very important that we keep our eyes open and that we're aware of our surroundings, aggie, i am so sorry about...
oh, shoot, being reassigned again, honestly, these kids are so whiny, so he lost an ear, it's not like it won't grow back, no, you're doing just fine, though i hadn't heard about the ear,
no, i'm just sorry that we're not gonna have your haunted house in our carnival, why wouldn't we do our haunted house?
i'm tired of people being scared of us, yeah, you know what?
so am i, whoever heard of a haunted house without buckets of fake blood?
can't we at least have mealy worms crawling out of them?
my mom makes the best oatmeal mealy worm cookies, happy halloween!
anyone care to hear about the positive contributions trolls have made to society?
um, welcome to the halloween wax museum, see the ogres picnicking in their natural setting, excuse me, would you like to see the...
come on, i've known most of you since the first grade!
- marnie, it's almost midnight, - hey, it's us or them!
no, you can't take our magic, humans have changed, no one was threatening us until you showed up, well, that's just because they never got to know the real you, and now that they do...
you cromwells don't deserve magic, now your magic is mine, magicus fixum!
marnie is your friend, so she's different, now that she's lost her magic, are you gonna like her again?
i kept thinking that we needed to fit in, but how do you know if someone truly cares about you if you don't show them who you really are?
i don't know what werewolves are like inside, but pete's the best halfback we've ever had!
- natalie's president of the science club, - uh, co-president, you know what?
it took some time, but i finally found the right witch's glass, what is going on?
you forgot that witches' glasses, while excellent for imprisoning witches, are also good for communicating between the worlds, and i believe that all of halloween town just saw that humans have changed, which means...
i was doing this for the good of halloween town, you see, humans...
are apparently much more accepting than you led us to believe, if they're willing to give us a chance, then we should be willing to return the favor,
i just never met a girl like you before, we have so much in common, and i like being with you,
i feel the same way, no, i'm sorry, it's just too gross!
i mean, i only opened the portal to save the entire world, thank me very much!
i should be getting a parade, but no, no, no, i get a summons instead,
- you got her started, - any idea how to turn her off?
oh, and you know why they don't like my idea of letting the kids from halloween town go to school here?
i say that if the portal's open, we might as well use it, right?
now, council president dalloway, i really must put several of my feet down, you and this council are determined to leave us defenseless, the idea of sending children into the human world...
they'll have me, and my mother and my grandmother, they'll have the entire cromwell clan protecting them,
i doubt that even you are a match for the knights, knights, you mean, like, round table, shields, lances, metal suits knights?
i mean, nothing can go wrong if nobody comes to live with us, oh, and i was so looking forward to sharing my room with a werewolf, no, this is too important, we have to show people that they have nothing to be afraid of,
besides, we have nothing to worry about, there aren't any knights, well, of course not, it's just a story parents in halloween town tell their kids to scare them, it's like... the bogeyman,
i'd really rather that we weren't late on our first day of school, oy, soph!
yeah, i'm not screwing up my perfect attendance record just because you want to bring a little peace and harmony to the universe, some things are more important than your perfect attendance record, like reuniting the worlds, for example,
why does reuniting the worlds have to involve me sharing a bathroom with an ogre and a gremlin named bobby?
if i can get this spell right, none of us will have to share any bathrooms,
(sophie) mom, grandma's on the witch's glass, grandma, where are you?
school starts in 20 minutes, and you promised you wouldn't be late, and we're on our way, i'm just getting everybody loaded up,
- we'll just meet you at school, dear, - wait, grandma, wait, see?
no problem, she's gonna meet us at school, what is she thinking?
she can't come to school dressed like that, oh, i wouldn't worry, if she brings the flying school bus, people won't even notice what she's wearing, flying school bus?
she wouldn't, oh, my gosh, we'd better go, come on, let's go, everybody, quick, sophie, come on,
- yes, yes, yes, it's me, it's me, it's me, oh, my, don't i look stylish?
mother, i am so impressed, yeah, i mean, i didn't even know you could drive, oh, well, i can't, oh, i asked two leprechauns that i know to help work the pedals for me,
- you're all from canada, - (whispering) better write that down, ok, well, hi, and welcome, we don't really have a lot of time for introductions, but i wanna take a moment to stress how important it is that you try and blend in,
- wish me luck, - good luck, ok, come on, guys, let's go,
- bye, - see you later, good luck, guys, i have your school schedules here, cassie?
well, if you'll excuse me, i've got to go see a man about a job,
i've got to be honest with you, mrs, cromwell, when you first contacted me this summer about enrolling nearly a dozen foreign exchange students, well, i said to myself, "there's just no way,"
but here you are, paperwork done, it's like magic, oh, well, remarkably similar, you just have to know how to work the system, mr, flanagan, oh, call me phil,
i'll let you know when aggie's found a place for us to meet, but in the meantime, if you have any problems, just find me or dylan, ok?
i'm sorry, but dylan is jumping off this welcome wagon, ap calculus starts in two minutes,
wow, some things really are universal, um, ok, then dylan, why don't you show natalie where those with dazzling intellects congregate?
and the rest of you, follow me, come on, hey, you've got to keep up, and lose the tail, what are you, some power-mad hall monitor?
- you know, it's not quite an exact science, - yes, it is, it is a science, that's why they call it science 101, you're supposed to be here
- so this kind of thing doesn't happen, - what's a green puff of smoke, anyway?
marnie, you of all people should know that things aren't always what they seem, hm, this is way better than a teachers' lounge, can i please take this off now?
of course, dear, you're perfectly safe in here, oh, and if anyone else wants to unzip, it's ok, oh, it's about time,
oh, no, things are definitely not what they seem, how much longer do i have to wear this stupid human suit?
you guys have to remember that to most humans, you don't exist, you're make-believe, but hopefully, over time, we can change all that,
oh, don't worry, it's probably just the pipes, my magic hasn't set yet, oh, oh, that's it,
i'm already starting to make new friends, these two cheerleaders walked past me and said... (scoffs) "what are you looking at, freak?"
i had three, everyone keeps saying, "hey, what's up?" what's up where?
- yeah, i heard that, too, - ok, it's your turn,
i wish you could've been there, today was, like, the greatest day of my whole life, everything went so perfectly,
- i really think this is gonna work, - was there ever any doubt?
you had an idea, you followed it through, i am so proud of you,
i just hope that someday i won't feel like i'm leading separate lives,
i think there's some in the back of the fridge, oh, i'll help you, oh, and i didn't even tell you the best part, i met a boy, he's new, and i think he likes me,
smart, snag him before he has the chance to meet anyone else, marnie!
