so, why did you come all the way out to tokyo?
the imperial capital has successfully fought off two great demon invasions, and paris has recently repelled the parishii.
more than anyone else, she took pride in her role as a guardian of the people against the darkness.
but no matter how exceptional their skill and abilities were, as a group, they were just too fragile.
we'll have to see if lachette has come to realize the real reason why star division was disbanded.
our imperial capital of tokyo is enjoying great prosperity at the moment.
the capital is open in all directions, linked to the country via her waterways.
this geographic advantage has brought about the prosperity we enjoy today.
even if that were the case, the capital can rely on the imperial fighting troupe for her defense.
is it wise to be completely dependent on those young girls?
there are, no doubt, issues we must address, but they are trivial.
we need look no further than our own capital and paris to see that the fighting troupe program is a success.
our nation needs a capital city, and to be prosperous, a city needs to be open to the free movement of people.
it is unavoidable for the bright lights of prosperity to give rise to dark shadows.
at this time, then, nothing can replace the fighting troupe's flower division.
however, in the spirit of being constantly mindful of our surroundings,
i believe we should not shy away from introducing new blood to meet new challenges as the need arises.
i venture to say that the darkness will come upon us yet again.
she's talking to mr. yoneda right now, but she'll probably pass through here afterwards.
true, but we need to hear your first impression of her.
a fire has broken out, but moon division is at work putting it out.
fires can spread quickly this time of year, so be mindful of the surrounding houses during combat.
and so, it has been decided that this unit will be leased to the army along with technical advisors from douglas-stewart.
it may be that we are still in the trial stages, but i'm certain they will be officially adopted into service within a year.
you're saying that you see governance and gambling as the same thing?
my dear count, it is often said that life is one big gamble.
for the duration of the repairs, we plan to make do with two eisenkleids which had previously been mothballed.
next, regarding the status of the imperial army 13th special mechanized squad.
moon division and dream division are currently doing all they can to find him.
actually, lt. general yoneda isn't the only one who has disappeared.
the operation of the imperial operetta troupe has been indefinitely suspended.
as of today, we are all to relocate to the flower mansion branch.
this entire affair seems to have to do with a branch of the army that's been goaded into action by a politician named tanuma.
which means douglas-stewart and this tanuma fellow must be in cahoots.
looks like your fixation on the imperial theater got the better of you.
i could easily sink your entire imperial navy with my japhkiels.
flower division was able to carry on this far thanks to you, mr. oogami.
more than anything else, it was because you were here that we won.
when maria showed up all battered and bruised, we were shocked.
we couldn't get back to the imperial theater with the army guarding it, so we were at a loss as to what to do.
this was what allowed me to save the lady in waiting from the sharks.
alas, i have come to a land filled with terror... ls there such a thing as a nation without enemies?
strip down to me boxer shorts sat down on the sofa, picked up an album cover, and i start rolling a joint.
tell him about the bird bending over with the big earthas.
so he gets up to his turn to go to the screw.
he goes, "good morning, i'll have egg and bacon, tomato and fried bread."
no, it was off the plots, up the fucking road a bit.
he's had a row with a couple of geezers outside a fucking club.
so he's had a row with these two geezers fucking one's opened their mouth, it's come out the wrong way.
next thing you know, he's fucking shot them with a fucking revolver.
they could've fucking stuck them up their asses, as far as i was concerned.
i used to give them to my cellmate when i was banged up in the scrubs.
we're taking uppers, downers, sidewinders reddies, greenies, blueys, greenies, auntie fucking jeanies.
they're like smarties, they're going down, and we're out of it.
micky tyne is murder in a motor at the best of times.
think nothing of going down a one-way street the wrong way.
next thing we know, we're down this one-way the wrong way.
suddenly, there's this big bus in front of us with the biggest black man behind the wheel you've ever seen.
we caught him coming out of the cafe like we arranged, right?
he goes up and gives him a shot in the eye.
i was duly fitted for a dress in the finest silk with trimmings of english lace.
however, merely to dress as a woman was not enough to satisfy me.
all right, because i missed it and all that, and it was fucking dead.
i tell you, man he was just fucking mean, my old man.
and then i went smack into the road on me face and when i looked up he'd gone.
i mean, it was lucky i didn't have michelle with me.
now, one day, right, he's staggering across the pub pissed from the night before.
he's gone over, right on his mooey like a fucking ironing board.
she told him this was gonna happen because danny's been putting the word about that billy's a grass.
the geezer that's done him ain't nothing to do with danny?
"we did this, didn't do that," to help clear their books and mark danny's cards.
so billy's been sent to the mount and danny's in wandsworth.
but the geezer that cut him has got fuck-all to do with the danny business.
yeah, billy's got this mate, right, who's doing a 1 2-and-half.
it's nothing for him to kill someone, so he done billy on the exercise yard for the bird, not the thing with danny.
it's got nothing to do with that, it's the other thing.
it was like a toothbrush with bic razorblades bound around it, see?
so that's why billy is in the fraggle wing with the weirdoes.
i mean, you can get anything in there that you can get out here.
i mean, there's geezers in there doing all sorts, you know?
she is getting a severe portion right up the fucking gary, right?
the bird looks down at me rolling the joint, and she said:
so he gets up to his turn to go to the screw.
he goes, "good morning, i'll have egg and bacon, tomato and fried bread."
no, it was off the plots, up the fucking road a bit.
he's had a row with a couple of geezers outside a fucking club.
so he's had a row with these two geezers... fucking one's opened their mouth, it's come out the wrong way.
next thing you know, he's fucking shot them with a fucking revolver.
they're like smarties, they're going down, and we're out of it.
all of a sudden, i get these pains right across my chest.
all across me chest, right across here, all me arms, all tight, you know?
because one minute i'm having a laugh, he thinks i'm mucking about.
now, the three of us are totally out of our heads.
micky tyne is murder in a motor at the best of times.
he goes up and gives him a shot in the eye.
gives him a black eye so it looks pucker, you know what i mean?
when they're nice and short, you see her ass... and you say to her, "do a little b, i, t of dusting over there, sweetheart.
and as they bend over, you give them a right good portion right up from behind.
merely to dress as a woman was not enough to satisfy me.
it was imperative that i also be legally declared a woman.
i'm surprised you still know where a pair of bollocks are!
the last time someone was hanging out of you... they must've been fucking on horseback!
yeah, me dad fucking put her down when i was little.
i went on holiday with me nan... and when i come back, he's fobbed us off... with some right swaggy story about how it bit someone over at the park.
the first thing i wanted to do when i got back was to see the dog, right?
all right, because i missed it and all that, and it was fucking dead.
and then i went smack into the road on me face and then when i looked up, he'd gone.
i mean, it was lucky i didn't have michelle with me, you know?
mum will be home in a minute and she'll only have the hump.
yeah, mon, you can't even leave me to soak... for two minute, mon.
well, i ain't that interested, so i'm having a little mooch about.
i looked above his bed, and there's this sign, right... with some weird writing on it.
he was my fucking dad... but he weren't like other kids' dads, you know?
it was as if the word itself was enough... and it ain't.
when you go out, you go with your mates... and when you are in, you're pissed asleep in front of the television.
i'll turn the television off, go to bed... you follow me at 3:00 in the morning stinking of booze.
she told him this was gonna happen... because danny's been putting the word about that billy's a grass.
the geezer that's done him ain't nothing to do with danny?
"we did this, didn't do that," to help clear their books... and mark danny's cards.

strip down to me boxer shorts sat down on the sofa, picked up an album cover, and i start rolling a joint.
tell him about the bird bending over with the big earthas.
and after you fuck them, you can drop them off anywhere.
so he gets up to his turn to go to the screw.
so he went, "i'll have egg and bacon and... " and he went, "no, no, no.
you can have egg or bacon." he went, "you're having a fucking laugh, cunt."
they're like smarties, they're going down, and we're out of it.
all of a sudden, i get these pains right across my chest.
all across me chest, right across here, all me arms, all tight, you know?

i needed it to get to the hospital, know what i mean?

then, on his 1 (th birthday... he was blown up in a silo explosion.
during his long recuperation, he taught himself to hear... and feel pain again.
as the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day... to study science by mail.
and, last week, frank grimes... the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got... received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics- with a minor in determination.
hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip.
if you turn that security camera around... you can sleep and no one will ever know.
i didn't think he'd come, so i said i have something really important to tell him...
- and that i could only tell him about it here.
you coast through life, you do as little as possible... and you leach off decent, hard-working people- like me.
[laughs] if you lived in any other country in the world...
this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am.
lenny, tell mr. burns i'm going home to work on the contest.
abandoned by his parents at age 4, frank never got to go to school.
he spent his childhood years as a delivery boy delivering toys to more fortunate children.
then, on his 18th birthday, he was blown up in a silo explosion.
during his long recuperation he taught himself to hear and feel pain again.
as the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day to study science by mail.
and last week, frank grimes the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics with a minor in determination.
well, listen, i'm sure we all have a lot of work to do.
hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a tip.
i'd appreciate it if you'd stay out of my office, simpson.
i wish i had a nickel for every time i heard that.
how dare you destroy my valuable wall and my priceless acid.
did you think you were going to get away with it?
you coast through life, you do as little as possible and you leech off decent, hardworking people like me.
if you lived in any other country, you'd have starved to death long ago.
this is my chance to show everyone how professional i am.
lenny, tell mr. burns i've gone home to work on the contest.
then, on his 1 (th birthday... he was blown up in a silo explosion.
during his long recuperation, he taught himself to hear... and feel pain again.
as the years passed, he used his few leisure moments each day... to study science by mail.
and, last week, frank grimes... the man who had to struggle for everything he ever got... received his correspondence school diploma in nuclear physics- with a minor in determination.
hey, you seem like a great guy, so i'll give you a little tip.
if you turn that security camera around... you can sleep and no one will ever know.
i didn't think he'd come, so i said i have something really important to tell him...
- and that i could only tell him about it here.
you coast through life, you do as little as possible... and you leach off decent, hard-working people- like me.
[laughs] if you lived in any other country in the world...

with the scent of lemons, we returned the apartment to the state of innocence.
however later at the sight of vegetables we didn't manage... to develop the desired enthusiasm.
and my parents put me in a girl's boarding school as a punishment.
perhaps they thought i was a risk for the male sex.
and so began this story, the nightmare of my fulfilled wishes.
take the 2nd right and then left, i still have to see my grandfather.
we had a kilo of heroin in the car, that was a stupid story.
dieter then took everything on himself, or else the old man would have disowned me.
under the precondition that miss moormann... marries levin within one year.
if the wedding does not take place, the assets revert to an sos children's village.
and i guessed, that we would still have much fun with each other.
finally we had time left to clean the house and get rid of everything superfluous.
i know that in the future past, the brunnen g civilisation led humanity to victory in the great insect wars.
i know that centuries later the descendants of the brunnen g were exterminated by his shadow's divine order, and i know that kai, the last of his people to die, had his life taken by his shadow himself.
kai's memory was stolen, and his mindless corpse was reanimated from time to time by protoblood to become an assassin for his shadow, and the line of divine shadows that followed.
but after 2000 years kai regained his memory, and along with stanley tweedle and zev bellringer of b3k escaped into the dark zone.
the cleansing was the feeding of all human life, from thousands of planets, into the hungry depths of the cluster.
it was an unparalleled orgy of death - the old, the young, the weak, the strong, the willing
clerics loyal to his shadow had long prayed for the rebirth.
for them, there was no higher calling than to be one of the eight chosen to oversee the ritual, and now, after thousands of years, eight were finally called forth.
we have to get kai more protoblood or we'll lose him forever
look, of course i want to help, but protoblood can only be found back at the cluster.
the fractal core has exactly the same attributes in both universes.
we could pass back through it into the light zone by precisely reversing our entry trajectory route.
it's obvious - we have to go back to the cluster, to get you more protoblood.
i have no wish to endanger you or stan by undertaking such a voyage.
we're all human, and of course as a man i have certain desires, so what really is wrong with expressing them?
what i mean, commander, is, we all know the reputation of the women on celes, and here we are with the celes pleasure transport practically next door for the first time this century, and with my job i'm not always a hundred percent busy, so i thought - why not?
but now he's the captain of the lexx on an intergalactic tour
still he dreams at night of the time of his life
in the playpen of feppo and smoor ha ha ha ha ha!
if you desire, i will stay here, where it is cooler.
it's all that has been keeping you alive for the last 2000 years
i only know that i was kept in a mortuary below the hall of the predecessors with thousands like myself.
there i received protoblood from a tube in my storage drawer
since it was so important to you, weren't you at all curious about it?
as a mindless servant of death for his shadow, i was not prone to curiosity
if it were possible to repair the cryogenic regulator, kai would have already done so.
there is no point in your attempting it, as calling you incompetent would qualify as high praise.
you are beyond useless in almost every respect, which is of course why zev has no interest in you, sexually or otherwise.
- zev, woman of all women, has a highly accelerated love slave libido.
you are the only living man she has contact with, but has she ever thought of enlisting you to satisfy her exceptional physical needs?
the egg must have been laid before we escaped from the light universe.
yeah, well, that's very nice, but i think we should act sensible here and dispose of it.
i know only that when your time is past, there will emerge the gigashadow it is unclear
i see only a fleeting image of the insect wars, but they were thousands of years past.
i have lost half of my blood, i have lost half of my time, but we have learned much.
first, that the prophecy may not be certain, and second, that the gigashadow is something we should fear.
this is stanley tweedle, the captain of the lexx, the most powerful destructive force in the two universes.
if anybody can hear me, and would like to make contact please transmit now, we are monitoring all frequencies
going back to the cluster does not mean that kai wil live, it means that we all will die
improbable as it may be, the security guard has a point.
say, while you're down there, why don't you stay down there?
say, while you're up here, why don't you contact some old friends?
i bet the cluster would love to see the famous arch traitor come home
maybe there's a candle burning for you outside the protein bank
i've been there, it's something i would not wish on my worst enemy
how do i know you're not working for the divine order?
i am the gigashadow, and you, kai, are nothing but a microbe inside me, infecting my system
i will extinguish you - and, cleric - you cannot help him
and ate it right up, and then it separated out the essential tweedle from the indigestible sub nebula mercenaries, ha ha!
i knew what they'd do and i did them one better
i have been gifted to see more or less into the cycles of time.
i know that in the future past, the brunnen g civilisation led humanity to victory in the great insect wars.
i know that centuries later the descendants of the brunnen g were exterminated by his shadow's divine order, and i know that kai, the last of his people to die, had his life taken by his shadow himself.

but after 2000 years kai regained his memory, and along with stanley tweedle and zev bellringer of b3k escaped into the dark zone.
his shadow pursued them, and kai killed the body that contained his former master.
upon the death of the last human on the cluster, the cleansing was complete.
the meat from countless millions of slaughtered souls was fed into the greedy belly of the cluster.
for them, there was no higher calling than to be one of the eight chosen to oversee the ritual, and now, after thousands of years, eight were finally called forth.
but fear of the divine order had chilled the blood of much of humankind, and seeds of doubt had taken root in the most unlikely soil.
his shadow's brain was to ascend into an orifice that waited above its pillar.
its essence would pass to the gigashadow, and the rebirth would begin.
well, for one thing, we don't know the way back and 790 - do you know the way back through the fractal core?
it is not a course i would recommend, bio-mass of beauty.
in fact, by reaching into the great storehouse of our all-encompassing knowledge,
journey back with us eight and a half years, security guard.
but now he's the captain of the lexx on an intergalactic tour
still he dreams at night of the time of his life
in the playpen of feppo and smoor ha ha ha ha ha!

we have to go back through the fractal core we have to go back to the cluster, we have to get kai some new protoblood.
going back to the cluster does not mean that kai wil live, it means that we all will die
and, from now on, i want to be known as stanley the brave,
as you command, stanley the brave, who risked his skin for his friends.
say, while you're up here, why don't you contact some old friends?
mind squish until i return, and if i do not -
lexx, when you eat, can you separate out the yummy stuff from the nasty indigestible bits?
yes, stanley the perfect, the mighty and terrible champion of the oppressed
if i want to transmit something, does it have to go out over all frequencies, or can i select a specific band?
i am able to transmit on any frequency band you choose, stanley the legendary all powerful space stud man
maybe you're aware i was once an assistant deputy backup courier for the ostral b heretics.
and that on one mission in particular i got a little side-tracked when his shadow attacked -
some rebel clerics found a way to make my pillar descend.
good for them, i say - not at the time, of course, but -
i've been there, it's something i would not wish on my worst enemy

it is not a course i would recommend, bio-mass of beauty.
in fact, by reaching into the great storehouse of our all-encompassing knowledge, we have summoned an episode from your past.
journey back with us eight and a half years, security guard.
tell me stanley, how often do ships normally pass this way?
and aren't we both transmitting on an encrypted stream i didn't know any mercenaries had access to?
still he dreams at night of the time of his life
in the playpen of feppo and smoor ha ha ha ha ha!
i only know that i was kept in a mortuary below the hall of the predecessors with thousands like myself.

we are not fit to suck his feet or dine on his excrement
at night we croon by the light of the moon of his courage and his creed
as one gifted to see into the old cycles of time, i should be able to see beyond your order, but i cannot.
i know only that when your time is past, there will emerge the gigashadow it is unclear

good for them, i say - not at the time, of course, but -
i estimate i only have forty minutes of oxygen supply left
how long do you think it will take you to reach me?
its positive mass is too large for it to pass through.
it would combine with the fractal core's anti-mass and the two would cancel each other out
as you request, stanley the fearless warrior god swooping down from on high to protect the weak and innocent.
mastermind of the downfall of the shining star of the cosmos
i passed on my essence to humans, rightly believing that i would be more successful using humans to defeat themselves.
yours has been an enslaved species, working tirelessly to achieve my rebirth
and then, following captain stanley's carefully constructed plan exactly, the lexx cruised on over to feppo and smoor's
and ate it right up, and then it separated out the essential tweedle from the indigestible sub nebula mercenaries, ha ha!
he is my captain now because he got my key from heretics who wanted to steal me.
take us away from here, take us out past the frontier, take us someplace better!
the time prophet said that kai would destroy his shadow's order
they will be destroyed at the hands of the brunnen g.
but that will be hard because his protoblood is running out and he must stay inside a very cold box.
be certain of your need before you choose to reanimate me.
his shadow wants me back, and he wants his divine predecessors back too.
but he especially wants kai destroyed because he is afraid of the prophecy.
i know that in the future past, the brunnen g civilisation led humanity to victory in the great insect wars.

mala, at the peak of her career, was second-in-command of planetary defenses answering only to the high general himself, jax-ur.
and when our defenses have been diminished to a pitiful strike force who will save krypton from its enemies?
krypton needs a strong leader to reclaim its former greatness, and i am that leader.
together, we will usher in a new age of strength and order for all.
the images i saw didn't say anything about her being so power-hungry.
the fact is, i wonder if even brainiac knew the whole truth about maia.
i don't believe that they don't trust you to clip a toe.
i clipped a couple of toes when i was a student.
warm compresses or a dab of nitro paste can dilate a hidden vein.
but before we do that, let's find one in a lower extremity like the saphenous vein in the leg.
the thing is, when we do find him it would be good if he could talk to a man about the orchiectomy.
explain that his life's not over because he's losing a testicle.
you know, when your son was in the nicu, everyone gladly bent over to accommodate you because we all felt sympathy for you.
but now your baby's out of the hospital and as you've probably noted dr. corday has raised the bar considerably for surgical residents.

you think we're going to let you put us to sleep again, you dirty old geezer?
but, because i was unable to completely erase the feelings he had from when he was human, he hated me, after i had rebuilt him.
however... this additional no. 1 7 will turn that other, imperfect one into his perfect form.
when the two no. 1 7 s in that world and the next world become one, all of the parts within his body will become perfected, and he will become an unprecedented, final weapon, with dominating hidden power!
and then, he will kill all of those earthlings who cast me out!
before that happens, there is a monkey that must be disposed of.
say, say, how is it that this world and the next world are stuck together?
is that hole that opened up in the sky a tunnel?
you're going to live the rest of your life in hell!
goku, without you here on earth, the whole world is in our hands!
it could be really bad judgement but it's certainly not tax fraud.
we need to meet with you and your client at his office tomorrow at 10.00.
mr sexton, not only have you no respect for religion, but you have ruined my favourite balenciaga.
i can assure you that if you go ahead with this... heresy, you and anyone else stupid enough to get involved will burn in hell.
i'll just confess to them that i'm married to a moron.
that way they'll feel sorry for me, then they'll forgive me.
i think i'm tired of busting my ass while you sit on your ever-widening one, criticizing everything i do.
i spent the last six months busting this ever-widening ass, and for what?
you know, if you had a brain, which you clearly don't, you would have spoken to your attorney back in new york.
hey, i was being chased around by a guy with a big gun.
just a cell mate named wanda poking her with a toilet brush.
i can't believe we are fleeing the city like a couple of fugitives.
your name was right next to my name on that tax return.
so as far as the government is concerned, we are both criminals.
when i get back to the country l'll be living ln a tin
ma and pa will surely mess about how much money i've spent
we've come together in the spirit of simplicity to honour the beautiful rainbow which god has provided.
so sit back and enjoy, as we celebrate the glory of nature in rainbow harvest '97.
- the only way to solve cases is running down leads, grilling suspects, long, lonely nights.
sure, occasionally you come home and your wife's in bed with the bottled-water guy, but so what?
forbearing one another in love, endeavouring to hold the unity of the spirit with a bond of peace.
neither time nor temperament nor force of nature shall diminish the solemnity of this holy union in the eyes of god.
this commitment you make to each other is sanctified in his name.
so will you, rebecca, take henner to be your husband, to love and to cherish, to honour and obey till death do you part?
it could be really bad judgement but it's certainly not tax fraud.

i spent the last six months busting this ever-widening ass, and for what?
you snap my head off every time i open my mouth.
if being with me ils so dilstasteful to you, you can leave.
but we can't go back to the city till i've figured this out.
you know, if you had a brain, which you clearly don't, you would have spoken to your attorney back in new york.
no, but you had time to steal a cab, didn't you, brad?
i'm sorry i didn't find the time to lift a limo for you.
two nights tops, till i get phil to pull some strings for us.
it'll work, but you might wanna tuck those bad boys in.
when i get back to the country l'll be living ln a tin

isn't it a strange custom to destroy the keys of one's former partners before getting married?
not the keys of the partners, the keys to their flats.
though we can't be sure till the last moment with young people.
it's very important for us that our daughter is treated well.
some claim this project is of the same importance as the landing on the moon or dropping of the atomic bomb.
the main aim of the project is to take frozen human sperm into space so that life may continue somewhere else when it will not be possible here on earth.
here we use this apparatus to preserve the most important part of the sperm, the dna.
it turns out to be the same substance used in chinese food.
only human sperm is being sent although of all animals on earth humans are exceptionally aggressive, cruel and arrogant.
if our planet is ever destroyed we are bound to be responsible.
by the way, franta brabec is good at plenty of other things.
he isn't so stupid that he has to gob at trains.
men love to shove their pricks somewhere all the time only this time it will be the andromeda.
if my husband does not care where his sperm is going then i do not care who will be the father of my baby.
the music is to calm people so they get on to the planes.
then we have shopping centres which are also full of music.

i hate to break it to you, anabel, but there is no fairy godmothers.
there's no tooth fairy, there's no angels, there's no genie in the bottle, there's no wizard of oz.
what difference does it really make where the magic comes from?
i mean, isn't the real question, can the person do the job?
you see, i could arrest you for a lot of things.
that would require a lot of paperwork, and a lot of my time.
and i imagine that would be your day at the gym.
and then knowing the system the way i do, you probably wouldn't do even one night behind bars.
to be truly effective and monstrously evil, one needs to control the power of white magic as well.
now, see, every living soul in this city has some desperate wish, some secret desire they think will improve their miserable little lives.
(mimicking duane) now you just listen up, you good old boy.
now you get those greasy taters out of your ears so you listen real good.
he's the one with the brown coat and the big hat.
okay, close your eyes and just visualize your wish coming true and just...
for what we're up against, it's going to need a quick fix.
i'm sorry. "for what we're up against." what would that mean, dear?
-murray, remember last night when you told me that i had to take a rain check?
okay, go backstage, find your dad's agent and tell him to stall, okay?
murray, i'm just about ready to break every bone in your body.
"murray, i'm just about ready to break every bone in your..."
i hate to break it to you, anabel, but there is no fairy godmothers.
there's no tooth fairy, there's no angels, there's no genie in the bottle, there's no wizard of oz.
what difference does it really make where the magic comes from?
i mean, isn't the real question, can the person do the job?
you see, i could arrest you for a lot of things.
that would require a lot of paperwork, and a lot of my time.
and i imagine that would be your day at the gym.
and then knowing the system the way i do, you probably wouldn't do even one night behind bars.

murray, i'm just about ready to break every bone in your body.
"murray, i'm just about ready to break every bone in your..."
you have to do it, you have no excuse not to.
if you do a lousy job, i'll fix it up when i edit it.
you want to always be with him, but you know you can't.
you're afraid that he may suffer and you can't even think he could die.
at times i want to convince myself i don't love him.
when i realize how far away he is and i get scared.
you'd like me to talk about freedom against moral crap, but without having the balls to live like i do.
you're as amoral as i am, but you don't practice it.
what when jay sees the parade of faggots, whores, teenage junkies that fuck you for a fix and late night drug dealers?
talk about his overdose, while you spend three days doing coke, smoking opium and taking and odd shot of heroin?
if you take it seriously, if you think you change it you're fucked.
it's a country without a future, the people who've plundered it won't let you change it.
don't be afraid of them, you're lucid, you have to try them.
never lose control, there's no danger if they don't control you.
i was hooked on heroin, and i almost couldn't get off it.
i left madrid and spent six months in hell, but i got off it.
you don't like the world you live in, but that's the way it is.
you can't change it and you have to play the game.
i don't have any time, i've got a movie to do.
location hunting and writing during the day, the night for your son.
he gave him a text as if it were dialogue for an actor!
"the only thing that is not an utter idiocy is to feel pleasure in doing what you like without thinking of a goal..."
i don't want to kill myself, i don't want to die.
you three worry about me and that makes me feel good.
then you won't feel like a foreigner or an exile or a tourist.
you'll have worse problems, but if she's worth it, you'll solve them.
it's humiliating to do a job you can't stand just to survive.
that "bread is made of one's brow" was invented to keep us slaves, because the power needs slaves.
but if you don't decide to do it, you will be mediocre.
if you choose that, tough luck, i have to accept it.
i was always wanting him to approve of me, but he never did.
nothing that i could do had the quality or the perfection that he expected from me.
anyway, it'd be my fault for not accepting things the way they are.
it was obvious that there was no future in our relationship.
he'll never say he loves you or that he needs you or anybody.
if he doesn't say it, it's because he doesn't feel it or feel it strongly.
and in the event of a tie, the winner will be decided by peanut butter wrestling.
oh, there will be a tie and griff's got the jif.
the votes will be tabulated by ike and bob rooney from the accounting firm ike and bob rooney.
please take your hands out of your pants for chesty larue.
this is really not turning out the way i'd hoped it would.
who'd have thought tricking your husband into falling in love with a stripper would be bad for your marriage?
plus, one more night of this i can buy this really cute pair of boots.
bud, i am going to kill you and then i'm going to bury you alive.
grandma wanker gains that much every time we go to sizzler.
well, if the camera adds 10 pounds why can't they just use three cameras?
oh, there will be a tie and griff's got the jif.
the votes will be tabulated by ike and bob rooney from the accounting firm ike and bob rooney.
how was i supposed to know you wouldn't gain weight evenly?
well, if you would have let me stand up it wouldn't have all gone to my butt.
and now your wife and your fantasy are one and the same.
so now every time you have sex, you'll think about me.
a desperation born from being locked down in a 10-by-10 cell... for 20, 30 years, sometimes longer.
i would say that desperation was a good word for that, sir.
[man] so, jarod, how many men did they run on a shift at folsom?
oh, we had a crew of 35 during the week, slightly less on the weekends.
[male reporter] tonight we bring you a story of love, law... and its connection between a man on death row... and a daughter whose life has been a fight to free him.
ten years ago, carl will, a career criminal... was sentenced to five years for car theft.
only weeks away from parole, he was involved in a bloody altercation... inside oakfield penitentiary, in which inmate anthony lewis was stabbed to death.
after a speedy trial conducted by then state attorney... and present governor charles edwards...
will was convicted of first-degree murder... and sentenced to die in the gas chamber... which is where the story takes a most unusual turn.
at the time of will's initial arrest, his daughterjessica was a senior in high school.
jessica's belief in her father fueled her to spend the next seven years... in college and law school, and every day since, fighting to free her father.
but with the governor's denying final appeal... and the execution scheduled for midnight friday... her odyssey oflaw and love appears to be at an end.
[jessica's voice] i love my father, i believe in him... and i will never stop fighting.
how do you respond tojessica will's call for clemency from the governor?
unfortunate as it is, when you concentrate transgressors in the system... these things happen, but they won't be tolerated by me or the governor.
the time has come for us to do our job, and we're going to do it at dawn saturday.
[over listening device] oh, darlin', i miss you so damn bad.
i ache all over thinking how pretty you looked laying in that bathtub.
that mr. bubble dancing on your skin like a love potion.
and you stood up and i drank in the vision of your peryectly shaped...
you're welcome to borrow one of my books if you want.
you're welcome to borrow one of my books if you want.
we lived in this rusted-out airstream for most of my life.
you know, we didn't have much... but he always made sure i had what i needed.
look, i'm not saying that my father is the epitome of virtue.
i mean, he was... he was pretty wild when he was younger.
i keep praying maybe... one day i'll actually get the chance to show how much i loved her.
but michaels, he's set on making... a statement with this place.
- well, i'm a little bit embarrassed to admit this... but i'm not sure i can handle this execution.
i know it's what we do, but i've never seen a man die before.
did you ever notice that these things are just like guilt?
you can move it from one place to another... but it always comes back.
each one of them belonged to the same chicago crime family.
my guess would be that somebody paid to have them silenced.
and inspired by these events, changes will be made here... that hopefully benefit all the inmates.
my resignation will become final in 24 hours... after my last official act as warden.

[man] never forget, mr. bradley, that in this place... we are dealing strictly with a mentality of desperation.
a desperation born from being locked down in a 10-by-10 cell... for 20, 30 years, sometimes longer.
i would say that desperation was a good word for that, sir.
a man's fiber, if he had any to begin with, quickly frays.
with the carl will execution on saturday, there promises to be plenty of that.
sounds like he's got all the classic symptoms of a career criminal.
ten years ago, carl will, a career criminal... was sentenced to five years for car theft.
only weeks away from parole, he was involved in a bloody altercation... inside oakfield penitentiary, in which inmate anthony lewis was stabbed to death.
after a speedy trial conducted by then state attorney... and present governor charles edwards...

[jessica's voice] i love my father, i believe in him... and i will never stop fighting.
officers clancy and larson found carl will next to the body of anthony lewis... holding the murder weapon.
unfortunate as it is, when you concentrate transgressors in the system... these things happen, but they won't be tolerated by me or the governor.
you stare at them long enough, and you swear they start creeping in on you.
you sound like a man that's been on this side of the bars.
i ache all over thinking how pretty you looked laying in that bathtub.
that mr. bubble dancing on your skin like a love potion.
well, it's not healthy, you know, keeping all of that animal emotion bottled up.
next thing you know, you'll be on the roof with a rifle in your hands.
my mother left when i was little, but he never left me.
we lived in this rusted-out airstream for most of my life.
you know, we didn't have much... but he always made sure i had what i needed.
look, i'm not saying that my father is the epitome of virtue.
talk like that, and no one will believe you're really a bull.
only thing the other guards know how to grow is resentment.
- for now, i'm going to prescribe... a mild acid inhibitor.
i'm not sure that it will be helpful... given the fact that she smokes... and has an unusually stressful demeanor.
i broke the law, and i've paid every day for the last 27 years.
but there's certain things that a man... can't allow to be taken from him.
you set up carl will to take the fall for it.
you were going to let an innocent man die... for something you did.
nah, i think it's time for justice to win this one.
i'd ask if you had a last request... but the truth is... you don't really deserve it.
unfortunately, there are events that would prove we have corruption on our staff.
and inspired by these events, changes will be made here... that hopefully benefit all the inmates.
people may get up for that kind of thing in los angeles or san francisco... or wherever you come from, but not around here.
now i don't care who the hell you are-- f.b.i. or whatever--
but if sally dumont hadn't been attacked, you wouldn't be here right now, would you?
the red dots represent reported attacks on horses over the past 29 months.
his anger and resentment will be building up again... until he has no choice but to act out his fantasy.
but, by then, he will be much harder to catch... because he will have had time to refine notjust how he kills... but also how he escapes detection.
they got a knife, but they beat the poor bastard to death?
these tracks move back and forward between here... the truck and the woods where the driver was dragged.
i've seen horses trapped in the killing box at the slaughterhouse.
they can smell the blood and the death of the animal that was in that box before them.
you wish you could wake up and find this never happened.
whatever humanity kept you from doing this before... whatever good, you better listen to it now.
in north america, up to 80,000 mares are kept pregnant... and their urine collected so that women can stay healthier longer.
but each time a mare gets pregnant, she has a foal.
if he grew up on a p.m.u. farm, his earliest memories would've been of horses held captive... foals slaughtered.
he learned that's how food was put on his table, clothes on his back.
i don't care who the hell you are, fbi or whatever,
i'm telling you right now you are not talking to my wife!
but if sally dumont hadn't been attacked, you wouldn't be here right now, would you?
the red dots represent attacks on horses over the past 29 months.
"help" was written in human blood, there was a fingerprint, no matches, but it definitely wasn't sally dumont's.
and they found semen in the stall next to where the horse was killed.
we've learnt from past experience that a close call expands his sexual fantasy.
his only source of feeling alive is his urge for sexual pleasure.
three or four times a year this parking lot becomes a killing field.
they're not satisfied with just killing the driver, they attack the hogs too.
these tracks move back and forward between here, the truck, and the woods where the driver was dragged.
we got three sets - work boots matching the ones the driver was wearing, pair of cowboy boots and something with a flatter sole, the tread all worn down.
i feel sorry for sally dumont and the man that died here tonight.
- i'm just working to find out why he does it.
they can smell the blood and the death of the animal that was in before them, but, despite that, they trust in man.
their executioner's standing above them with a bolt gun, they look to him for help and he fires a steel bolt straight into their heads.
in north america, up to 80,000 mares are kept pregnant and their urine collected so that women can stay healthier longer.
but when a mare gets pregnant she has a foal, and the quickest way to make money off of 80,000 foals is to kill them and sell the meat.
part of the ritual is wearing clothes that bring him back to that time.
growing up, his earliest memories would've been horses held captive, foals slaughtered.
you're gonna be ajoke for a couple of weeks in little fats'.
you ain't gonna know cos you're gonna be hanging from a hook.
and they found semen... in the stall next to where the horse was killed.
for a few brief moments, he had something he's never had before... not a horse but a woman in his power.
we've learned from past experience that an event like this, a close call... expands his sexual fantasy.
his only source of feeling alive is his urge for sexual pleasure.
they got a knife, but they beat the poor bastard to death?

i can tell you everything you need to know in about five minutes.
she seemed to enjoy the elizabethans but when we moved on, she slipped back.
after a while, it all gets mixed up together in your head.
you can't remember whether life's shit because arsenal's shit or the other way round.
i've been to watch far too many games, spent far too much money.
fretted about arsenal when i should have been fretting about something else.
three minutes to go and you're two-one up in a semi-final.
you look around and see thousands of faces contorted with fear and hope and worry.
and the fact that you care so much, that the noise you've made has been such a crucial part of it, is what makes it special.
you've been as important as the players and if you hadn't been there, who'd have been bothered about football, really?
if we don't win the league, i'll cope because of sarah and the baby.
when you've got nothing else going on, arsenal fill all the gaps.
yes, i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall.
got a pay rise, got off with caroline walsh the night before.
if i did still want the same things, i'd have gone wrong.
i don't want to marry david cassidy, have bigger tits, do well in my mock 'o's.
i know that many of you will be anxious to get home to start your homework.
but... those who feel they can spare the time, and wish to lend their vocal encouragement, will be most welcome.
but we really enjoyed it and we think we'll pass our exams so you must be a good teacher.
scott, who's at home watching football, says you're like george graham because you push us hard and get results.
will you please, please, please, please, please just fucking fuck off!
you have arrived during the worst 60 seconds of my life and i really don't want to see you!
but i do know this - my relationship with arsenal changed that night.
it was as if i'd jumped on to the shoulders of the team and they'd carried me into the light that had suddenly shone down on all of us.
and the lift they gave me enabled me to part company with them in some ways.
we still see each other all the time and i still love them and hate them.
no one could think of two words to say to me.
yet they queue for hours to hear your pearls of wisdom on next week's game against wolves united!
it's a miracle if we plan a weekend before friday afternoon.
and yet you know what arsenal are doing for months in advance.
all those stupid stories about how your mum's cats are called after great players and how she drove through the snow to get you a cup ticket.
you stopped seeing your father when you didn't need him to take you to the games any more.
football has meant too much to me and come to represent too many things.
after a while, it all gets mixed up together in your head.
you can't remember whether life's shit because arsenal's shit or the other way round.
i've been to watch far too many games, spent far too much money.
and just for those few minutes, you're at the centre of the whole world.
and the fact that you care so much, that the noise you've made has been such a crucial part of it, is what makes it special.
but every now and then - not very often, but it happens - you catch a glimpse of a world that doesn't work like that.
a world that doesn't stop in may and begin again in august.
i've wanted arsenal to win the league longer than i've wanted anything.
i've been after that head of year job for about two weeks.
and if you had, and if you'd spent three months thinking that finally you were gonna get it and just when you think it's there, it's taken away from you!
i don't care what it is - a car, a job, an oscar.
there isn't anything i've wanted for 18 years because i was a kid
if i did still want the same things, i'd have gone wrong.
i know that many of you will be anxious to get home to start your homework.
but... those who feel they can spare the time, and wish to lend their vocal encouragement, will be most welcome.
they need two so they score one just to get us all going.
you want 'em to score a second before they scored the first?
well, we didn't like you at first 'cause you gave us too much work.
but we really enjoyed it and we think we'll pass our exams so you must be a good teacher.
'you can see we're now 'well into time added on. '
will you please, please, please, please please just fucking fuck off!

she seemed to enjoy the elizabethans but when we moved on, she slipped back.
but if you put in the hours, you're welcomed, without question, into a new family.
except in this family, you care about the same people and hope for the same things.
do i look like the sort of man who'd have a "bread" album?
no, you look like the kind of man who has a "bollock brothers" album.
'.. that what happened 'was the result of violence amongst fans. '
they must've realised something like this was gonna happen one day.

you've been as important as the players and if you hadn't been there, who'd have been bothered about football, really?
i felt brilliant the day we got knocked out of the league by walsall.
got a pay rise, got off with caroline walsh the night before.
what does it matter how close to the ground you live as long as you can come to the games?
when i was a kid, i read this... story about what used to happen round here on cup final days if arsenal were playing.
i want to go to sleep for the next ten seasons.
seasons. i am sick to death of hearing about bloody seasons!
they need two so they score one just to get us all going.
you want 'em to score a second before they scored the first?
but we really enjoyed it and we think we'll pass our exams so you must be a good teacher.
scott, who's at home watching football, says you're like george graham because you push us hard and get results.
will you please, please, please, please please just fucking fuck off!
you have arrived during the worst 60 seconds of my life and i don't want to see you!
it was as if i'd jumped on to the shoulders of the team and they'd carried me into the light that had suddenly shone down on all of us.
and the lift they gave me enabled be to part company with them in some ways.
i can tell you everything you need to know in about five minutes.
she seemed to enjoy the elizabethans but when we moved on, she slipped back.
no one could think of two words to say to me.
yet they queue for hours to hear your pearls of wisdom on next week's game against wolves united!
do i look like the sort of man who'd have a "bread" album?
no, you look like the kind of man who has a "bollock brothers" album.
it's a miracle if we plan a weekend before friday afternoon.
and yet you know what arsenal are doing for months in advance.
all those stupid stories about how your mum's cats are called after great players and how she drove through the snow to get you a cup ticket.
you stopped seeing your father when you didn't need him to take you to the games any more.
after a while, it all gets mixed up together in your head.
you can't remember whether life's shit because arsenal's shit or the other way round.
i've been to watch far too many games, spent far too much money.
fretted about arsenal when i should have been fretting about something else.
three minutes to go and you're two-one up in a semi-final.
you look around and see thousands of faces contorted with fear and hope and worry.
and the fact that you care so much, that the noise you've made has been such a crucial part of it, is what makes it special.

and the lift they gave me enabled be to part company with them in some ways.
well, how do you explain the crop circle and the burn marks?
well, i-- i was running laps with a flaming 2x4 dragging behind me.
wha-- in fact, there are a lot of things that i don't love about this planet.
this broom... this stupid-ass apron... these stupid dishes... and your family!
just the two of us, no one else, by the ocean..
palm trees swaying in the breeze, you sunning yourself in front of me, sensually removing your gauzy dress, your underwire bra,
in fact, there are a lot of things that i don't love about this planet.
this broom... this stupid-ass apron... and...these stupid dishes... and your family!
i already sent a patient into your office about 15 minutes ago.
see, that's why, laura, you should always buzz me before you send patients in.
my mother used to drive us nuts with food when we were kids.
"don't eat the mayonnaise if it's been out in the sun.
is there any chance you brushed in the last, say, 30, 40 days?
because all i'm gonna say to you is every time you open your mouth, it reminds me i haven't been to the elephant house in the zoo for awhile.
i'm genetically engineered to live in a bog in northern ireland.
so it's just such a big production to go to the beach.
i have to wear a shirt and long pants, and actually, shoes.
i have to wear big black shoes when i go in the water.
you put a lot of work into how you come dressed.
well, first of all, i love the way i dress normally, and i love my hat on backwards and all, and i love my sneakers and my butt.
you know what, to be quite honest with you, it's a big, steaming load.
remember when i said to you there are no losers in this contest?
instead of you blowing medical steam that don't make no damn sense.
carla, what happened to that boy's penis should have been left up to me.
as the swelling increases, it may affect her ability to breathe.
then the question becomes whether it's in her best interest to put her on a ventilator.
but the question is, what kind of life would it be?
i can't believe it's all just gonna be over like this.
but if you take that home, there's a kit for 70 bucks.
my neighbor has this dog that barks all night, every night.
you'll feel a little pressure at the top of your leg.
i've found ice and trendelenburg excellent adjuvant therapies for the reduction of these inguinal hernias.
well, you sounded a little vague, so i'm giving it a face-to-face try.
it's such a coup if i show up with a handsome doctor.
i can't believe it's all just gonna be over like this.
you might think about whether organ donation is something that she'd want.
you couldn't pay me enough to ride a horse in this city.
it's hard to cross the street in sneakers let alone six feet in the air on a jittery, glassy-eyed dinosaur.
look, george i'm really enjoying spending time with you but i'm not sure this is gonna work out.
at some point you're going back to your job at tyler chicken and your three-legged dog, willy.
nobody wants to go on a three-hour bus tour of a totally unknown person's life.
i'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and dessert.
but when i saw you in that paper hat and that apron--
what if i cut you in for 30 percent of the profits?
i'm not from around here, so it's okay if i'm stupid.
and she knows i'm only in town visiting so there's no messy break-ups.
mr. lippman, when i worked for you at pendant publishing i believed in you, you know, as a man of integrity.
but when i saw you in that paper hat and that apron...
okay, we got three hours left on this thing and i can't drive and argue with you rubes all at the same time.
okay, lomez's place of worship is right on the right here.
you know, if you go on this thing, it could create a minor stir.
you bring that little girlfriend of yours and i'll only charge you 60 bucks.

my thoughts are with you, froia, as are those of my colleague, veer.
look, drop the force field and tell me what's going on.
then, maybe we can make first contact in a civilized way.

i couid well imagine this creature giving rise to a more complex iife-form.
earth has been devastated by countless natural disasters over the course of its history-- asteroids, volcanoes, earthquakes.
aii evidence of your race could be at the bottom of the ocean or under kilometers of rock.
three months ago, you circulated a study criticizing what you called "resistance to truth"-- once again, disputing doctrine.
i apologize if i wrote anything that offended the elders, but i never even mentioned the word "doctrine."
you are reckless and irresponsible, and you are a destructive influence to our society.
but it is not too late for you to redress the damage you have done.
that held your race back for millennia until someone took a chance and challenged that prediction.
they succeeded, and your society entered a new chapter of exploration and your doctrine was changed accordingly.
when i open my eyes to this theory, what i see appaiis me.
i see my race fleeing your wretched pianet-- a group of pathetic refugees crawling and scratching their way across the galaxy, stumbling into this domain.
and when the planet was threatened with disaster, they boldly launched themselves into space, crossed what must have seemed like unimaginable distances, facing the unknown every day, but somehow, they stayed together, kept going with the same courage that had served them before
until they reached this quadrant, where they laid the foundation of what was to become the great voth culture.
deny that past... and you deny the struggle and achievements of your ancestors.
deny your origins on earth... and you deny your true heritage.
it is my judgment you will suffer the consequences of your obstinacy.

we simply have to get them to open their eyes and see it.

all i ask is that you admit the possibility that your interpretation is wrong.
an incredible achievement, and yet, your ancient doctrine predicted terrible disasters if it were even attempted.
that held your race back for millennia until someone took a chance and challenged that prediction.
they succeeded, and your society entered a new chapter of exploration and your doctrine was changed accordingly.

there is suspicion of an accomplice, based on one piece of evidence,... ..a so-called death card used by soldiers in vietnam to mark their kills.
and by burkholder's possible ties to a paramilitary group called the right hand,... ..whose stated aim is violent revolution.
we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this.
a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of officials are in washington today... ..for a re-dedication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
unless we can determine a motive,... ..we will consider any one of them to be a target.
one misstep, markham smells a shakedown,... ..he's gonna disappear and find another way to push the button.
and i've already seen more dead soldiers than i ever wanna see.
you can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual... ..over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
i'll bet he's got more weapons than most third world armies.
he told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.
i'm sure you're aware that in 1973 the defense department... ..determined there were no more pows in vietnam.
maybe that's why they tried to kidnap sergeant teager when we brought him home.
i don't know about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
sir, i have to ask you to trust my risk assessment and take every caution.
if he's invisible, then why is he on this video clear as day?
i think he can hide himself by manipulating what scully refers to as a blind spot.
we've got four miles of streets where 31 officers... ..are staging for a parade into freedom square.
if what you're saying is true, i can't protect these men.
as it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason.
if both those fall through, there is still enough evidence to convict you... ..for possession and transport of illegal arms.
i am offering you a deal,... ..for you and the people you represent.
if you think i've got any sway with teager, you're mistaken.
how are you so convinced that bloch was his next target?
i found out about bloch from the person... ..who told me we were never meant to save bloch's life.
the pentagon claims that the man who was killed was thomas lynch.
a vet who's been in and out of va psychiatric hospitals for 15 years.
and by burkholder's possible ties to a paramilitary group called the right hand, whose stated aim is violent revolution.
we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this.
a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of officials are in washington today for a rededication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
2,000 names on that list. i can't keep track of every one.
- we'd like to go over that list with you, sir.
you can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
i'll bet he's got more weapons than most third world armies.
he told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.
just after the right hand liberated him from a pow camp outside the u minh forest.
i'm sure you're aware that in 1973 the defense department determined there were no more pows in vietnam.
given the facts of the case and the polygraph test, it's the only explanation we've got.
or it's a clever story being proffered as a cover-up for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.
i don't know about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
sir, i have to ask you to trust my risk assessment and take every caution.
the general's secretary was in here no more than 15 minutes before the general was shot.
he never saw this card and he never saw anyone go in, aside from the general and his agents.
if he's invisible, then why is he on this video clear as day?
i think he can hide himself by manipulating what scully refers to as a blind spot.
we've got four miles of streets where 31 officers are staging for a parade into freedom square.
if what you're saying is true, i can't protect these men.
as it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason.

how are you so convinced that bloch was his next target?
i found out about bloch from the person who told me we were never meant to save bloch's life.
it gives me great pleasure to introduce a very special man.
wounded and decorated for gallantry in vietnam, he had an idea.
we are here to rededicate this memorial on this important day.
we especially remember those who cannot share this day with us.
_.a so-called death card used by soldiers in vietnam to mark their kills.

maybe that's why they tried to kidnap sergeant teager when we brought him home.
the man we're looking for, the man she saw, has a knack for vanishing in plain sight.
she has a subconjunctival haemorrhage, probably brought on by her emotional state.
general steffan, this is special agent fox mulder with the fbi.
we have reason to believe your life may be in danger.
i don't know about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
sir, i have to ask you to trust my risk assessment and take every caution.
the general's secretary was in here no more than 15 minutes before the general was shot.
he never saw this card and he never saw anyone go in,___
we've got four miles of streets where 31 officers... _.are staging for a parade into freedom square.

as it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason.

you know what he wants, and we both know you can't give it to him.
not without dragging that nice, clean uniform of yours through the mud.
a recent news story extremely embarrassing to the us military... _.about the disposing of south vietnamese soldiers.
ivien employed by our government as spies... _.and then left behind enemy lines to certain death.
(pa) it gives me great pleasure to introduce a very special man.
wounded and decorated for gallantly in vietnam, he had an idea.
it says here n.a.a. tests confirm the private did not do the shooting.
there is suspicion of an accomplice, based on the one piece of evidence found at the crime scene, a so-called death card used by soldiers in vietnam to mark their kills... and by private burkholder's possible ties to a radical paramilitary group... called the right hand whose stated aim is violent revolution.
after speaking with general bloch, he believes we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this, a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of high-ranking military officials are in washington today... for a rededication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
unless we can determine a clear motive, we will consider any one of them to be a target.
what if private burkholder is telling the truth, that he's innocent?
if i have to devise a strategy around that story, then there is no strategy.
somebody killed the general, which means somebody is not telling the truth.
one misstep and markham smells a shakedown, he's going to disappear or find another way to push the button.
and i've already seen more dead soldiers than i ever want to see.
you can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual... over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
we're prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary.
lives will have to be sacrificed, but that day has not yet come.
i'll bet he's got more weapons and ammo than most third-world armies.
he told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.
i'm sure you're aware in 1973 the defense department... determined there were no more p.o.w.'s in vietnam.
maybe that's why they tried to kidnap sergeant teager when we brought him home.
based on a death certificate you may have put your signature on, the death certificate for sergeant nathaniel teager.
i don't know anything about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
the general's secretary had been in here organizing his desk... no more than 15 minutes before the general was shot.
he never saw this card, and he never saw anyone go in and out of the office... aside from the general and the agents assigned to him.
that's beyond my capabilities here to make that kind of analysis.
i think it's beyond all our capabilities, but somebody's got to explain... how a four-star general could be shot and killed in what is symbolically... the best-guarded military base in the country.
i think teager has an ability, the ability to effectively erase himself from the visual field.
if he's invisible, then why is he on this video clear as day?
maybe teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.
we've got four miles of crowded streets where 31 military officers... are staging for a parade into freedom square.
maybe you can tell me why they can't seem to find him.
the same reason you can't, which i imagine is the same reason you're here right now.
as it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy to commit homicide and treason.
but if both those fall through, there is still enough evidence to convict you... for possession and transport of illegal arms.
men employed by our government as spies and commandoes... and then left behind enemy lines to certain capture and death.
the operation was disavowed, and their lives were erased from the records.
it gives me great pleasure to introduce a very special man.
wounded and decorated for gallantry in vietnam, he had an idea, teager?
a vision... to create a national memorial... hey, man, is that you?
for all americans who gave their lives in the vietnam war.
teager... the pentagon is claiming that the man who was killed was a thomas lynch.
he's a vet who's been in and out of v.a. psychiatric hospitals for the last 15 years.
and by burkholder's possible ties to a paramilitary group called the right hand, whose stated aim is violent revolution.
we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this.
a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of officials are in washington today for a rededication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
we have a warrant for your arrest if you don't cooperate.
under the new antiterrorism law, we can and will hold you until we get the information.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
we're prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary.
he belonged to green beret detachment b-11, the squad known as the bloody sabers.
in 1971, the b-11 was being transported when their chopper was shot down.
i'm sure you're aware that in 1973 the defense department determined there were no more pows in vietnam.
maybe that's why they tried to kidnap sergeant teager when we brought him home.
i don't know about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
sir, i have to ask you to trust my risk assessment and take every caution.
maybe teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.

wounded and decorated for gallantry in vietnam, he had an idea.
we are here to rededicate this memorial on this important day.
we especially remember those who cannot share this day with us.
and by burkholder's possible ties to a paramilitary group called the right hand whose stated aim is violent revolution.
we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this.
a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of officials are in washington today for a rededication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
we have a warrant for your arrest if you don't cooperate.
under the new antiterrorism law, we can and will hold you until we get the information.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
we're prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary.
i'll bet he's got more weapons than most third world armies.
he told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.
just after the right hand liberated him from a pow camp outside the u minh forest.
i'm sure you're aware that in 1973 the defense department determined there were no more pows in vietnam.
given the facts of the case and the polygraph test it's the only explanation we've got.
or it's a clever story being proffered as a cover-up for an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.
the man we're looking for, the man she saw, has a knack for vanishing in plain sight.
she has a subconjunctival haemorrhage, probably brought on by her emotional state.
i don't know about that, but i'm on my way to the pentagon right now.
sir, i have to ask you to trust my risk assessment and take every caution.
maybe teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.
we've got four miles of streets where 31 officers are staging for a parade into freedom square.
you know what he wants, and we both know you can't give it to him.
not without dragging that nice, clean uniform of yours through the mud.
a recent news story extremely embarrassing to the us military about the disposing of south vietnamese soldiers.
men employed by our government as spies and then left behind enemy lines to certain death.
the pentagon claims that the man who was killed was thomas lynch.
a vet who's been in and out of va psychiatric hospitals for 15 years.
it says here n.a.a. tests confirm the private did not do the shooting.
there is suspicion of an accomplice, based on the one piece of evidence found at the crime scene, a so-called death card used by soldiers in vietnam to mark their kills... and by private burkholder's possible ties to a radical paramilitary group... called the right hand, whose stated aim is violent revolution.
after speaking with general bloch, he believes we have a high probability of opportunity for a group like this, a unique situation that could result in the very public loss of lives.
dozens of high-ranking military officials are in washington today... for a rededication of the vietnam veterans war memorial.
unless we can determine a clear motive, we will consider any one of them to be a target.
what if private burkholder is telling the truth, that he's innocent?
i found his story compelling, personally, but then again, i believed the warren commission.
if i have to devise a strategy around that story, then there is no strategy.
he's going to disappear, or find another way to push the button.
and i've already seen more dead soldiers than i ever want to see.
- sir, we have a warrant for your arrest... if you don't cooperate.
under the new antiterrorism law, we can and will hold you until we get the information.
the right hand believes in empowering the individual... over a corrupt and corrupting federal government.
we're prepared for the time when armed resistance will be necessary.
i'm sure you're aware in 1 973 the defense department... determined there were no more p.o.w.'s in vietnam.
maybe that's why they tried to kidnap sergeant teager... when we brought him home.
general steffan, this is special agent fox mulder with the fbi.
i'm calling because we have reason to believe your life may be in danger.
the general's secretary had been in here organizing his desk... no more than 1 5 minutes before the general was shot.
he never saw this card, and he never saw anyone go in and out of the office... aside from the general and the agents assigned to him.
that's beyond my capabilities here to make that kind of analysis.
it's beyond all our capabilities, but somebody's got to explain... how a four-star general could be shot and killed in what is symbolically... the best-guarded military base in the country.
-i think teager has an ability-- the ability to effectively erase himself from the visual field.
if he's invisible, then why is he on this video clear as day?
maybe teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.
we've got four miles of crowded streets where 31 military officers... are staging for a parade into freedom square.
maybe you can tell me why they can't seem to find him.
the same reason you can't, which i imagine is the same reason you're here right now.
as it stands, you are facing charges of conspiracy... to commit homicide and treason.
but if both those fall through, there is still enough evidence to convict you... for possession and transport of illegal arms.
you know what he wants, and we both know you can't give it to him, not without dragging that nice, clean uniform of yours through the mud.
not without dragging that nice, clean uniform of yours through the mud.
men employed by our government as spies and commandoes... and then left behind enemy lines to certain capture and death.
the operation was disavowed, and their lives were erased from the records.
how are you so convinced that general bloch was his next target?
i found out about general bloch from the same person... who told me we were never meant to save bloch's life, or the other generals.
given the nature of the case, they knew you'd bring us in.
the government is not about to sacrifice... the lives of ranking military officers just to discredit us.
these survivors are heading for bosnia... hoping to escape the war.
but tonight we must face the possibility... that this is only the beginning.
keep on telling them until i hope they will move us.
if it is possible to treat the children on the spot... near to their families, with people around them who speak their language... and in relatively familiar surroundings... then that is obviously the best way.
we have to deal with 13 countries in the world... which are worse than sarajevo.
uh, excuse me, sir, just out of curiosity... could you tell me what those 13 places are... and are we sliding' up or down that scale?
- [bosnian] - [henderson] emira has been here since she was a baby.
now she is so frightened by the shelling she can't sleep at night.
since the war, the orphanage has had to take in not only babies... but also older children, many of whom have witnessed terrible events... as well as being separated from their families.
- [bosnian] - [henderson] "my mum had a job, and one day...
"she went to work and was told she couldn't work there anymore because she was a muslim.
that day it was announced that all muslims had to leave the town."
it's extraordinary, is it not, that when there are children... trapped in the most dangerous corner of the most dangerous city on earth... that this plane is going to fly out of here completely empty.
it would be a simple matter to move the children... but someone, somewhere along the bureaucratic line, is saying no.
history has shown us... that you can't allow the mass extermination of people... and just sit by and watch it happen.
we do not see any evidence of a program... of systematic or massive killing of innocent people.
fifty and sixty years ago, the leaders of the world said...
"oh, we didn't know it was happening, and it was misinterpreted."
i don't want you to sit near her on the bus.
i want you to treat emira just like all the other kids.
- [chattering] - [henderson] at last, there is some... good news for the children of the ljubica ivezic orphanage.
five of the babies have got places on a convoy taking children to italy... where they can stay till the fighting is over.
land mines, mortars, and roadblocks are just some... of the hazards that lie between them and the safety of italy.
only last week, snipers opened fire on a bus... as it tried to leave sarajevo.
can't help but think that if the situation were reversed, and the...
muslims were slaughtering christians, we would have done something by now.
i figure one day soon even inela herself will be for sale.
i got a packet of marlboro... and cake of soap hidden away for that day.
you have said that you will bring her back after the war.
yes, i know i said that, but, uh... things have changed a bit since then.
these survivors are heading for bosnia, hoping to escape the war.
but tonight we must face the possibility that this... is only the beginning.
i know it's difficult but we have to keep our perspective.
we deal with 13 countries in the world which are worse than sarajevo.
'his father and two older brothers 'were taken prisoner by serb irregulars, 'the feared chetniks.
'his mother was shot by a sniper whilst queuing for water.'
it's extraordinary, is it not, that with children trapped in the most dangerous corner of the most dangerous city on earth that this plane will fly out of here completely empty.
'lt would be a simple matter to move the children 'but someone somewhere along the bureaucratic line is saying no.'
'five babies have got places on a convoy 'taking children to italy, 'where they can stay till the fighting is over.
'they'll have to leave behind more than 100 older children 'who aren't so lucky.
'landmines and mortars are some of the hazards 'that lie between them and the safety of italy.
'last week, snipers fired on a bus trying to leave sarajevo.
'the mothers of the children leaving today 'clearly feel it is more dangerous to stay than to go.'
i'd like to apologise on behalf of the american people for not delivering on those air strikes.
i figure one day soon, even inela herself will be for sale.
i got a packet of marlboro and cake of soap hidden away for then.
listen, i'm going to find her and she will be for sale.
i will buy her, dang, dang, dang, and die really, really happy.
in the past two months, the serbs have pounded it with more than two million shells.
these survivors are heading for bosnia, hoping to escape the war.
we deal with 13 countries in the world which are worse than sarajevo.
sir, just out of curiosity, what are those other 13 places?
'his mother was shot by a sniper whilst queuing for water. '
got a permission letter from radovan karadjic so we can get behind serb lines.
since the war, the orphanage has taken in not only babies but also older children, many of whom have witnessed terrible events as well as being separated from their families.
'one day my mum went to work 'and was told she couldn't work there any more 'because she was a muslim.
'we came here this evening 'to make another report on the ljubica ivezic orphanage.
'when we arrived, the building next door was on fire 'and one room of the orphanage had been destroyed. '
'history has shown us that you can't allow 'the mass extermination of people and just let it happen. '

munira, tell him now, we have papers to get us through this territory.

i do not appreciate company policy, allowing her to freely intermingle with inmates and the staff.
our brother means to say we view the presence of any outsider, especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony, a potential break in the spiritual unity.
- wanna get me some clothes, or should i go like this?
given the nature of our indigenous population, i would suggest clothes.
but it might be helpful if ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners, as i am told she did in the last hour.
it might also be helpful if you informed me of any change in her physical status.

this is a maximum-security prison and you have no weapons of any kind?
when i asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question.
then when i asked about the prison id tattooed on your head, you ducked me again.
not as a result of the accident, but because i prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller.
i got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a three-c.
i saw a drum of this stuff fall into a beachhead bunker once.
the blast put a tug in dry dock for 17 weeks.

fine little ass like that make a man walk, you know what i mean?
mind you, i think she's just a tad curious about this transaction of ours.
every dirty little covert op the government ever dreamed up is in there.
and this, you, the aliens, even the crew from the betty.
i do not appreciate company policy, allowing her to freely intermingle with inmates and the staff.
our brother means to say we view the presence of any outsider, especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony, a potential break in the spiritual unity.
- wanna get me some clothes, or should i go like this?
given the nature of our indigenous population, i would suggest clothes.
but it might be helpful if ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners, as i am told she did in the last hour.
it might also be helpful if you informed me of any change in her physical status.
- it would appear that the child drowned, but without proper laboratory tests it's impossible to be certain.
i would consider it unwise to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus.
she won't ever know the hardship and grief for those of us left behind.
we commit these bodies to the void... with a glad heart.
for within each seed, there is a promise of a flower.
and within each death, no matter how small, there's always a new life.
there's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here.
any of you guys wanna tell me what the problem is?
we're waiting for god to return and raise his servants to redemption.
dillon and the rest of the alternative people embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago.
i just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies.
and now that i'm in your cot, you think i owe you an answer.
this is a maximum-security prison and you have no weapons of any kind?
we have some carving knives in the abattoir, a few more in the mess hall, some fire axes.
during my first residency i did a 36-hour stretch on an er.
so i went out and i got more than a little drunk.
i'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but i'm getting rescued.
i don't care about these prisoners, but i've got a wife and a kid.
you're the guy that's made a deal with god to live forever, huh?
and all the rest of you pussies can sit it out, too.

also, your pillowcase carried the floral scent that i notice you favour.
- give me one hour, i'll tell you what he had for supper.
- well, you know, i might be able to do that now.
he smokes russian cigarettes, he has a cyanide cap in his tooth.
some people might conclude, as mr. hanrahan does, that he is a russian spy.
come on, the russians can't afford food, let alone spies, fraser.
well, people can starve, ray, but a government can always afford spies.
not to mention the dangers inherent of applying one's lips to brass instruments in sub-zero temperatures.
as a matter of fact, there was a very amusing, if somewhat painful, incident at the '67 centennial.
i checked with the fbi file, but i couldn't find squat.
- if the fbi files are closed to us, perhaps the rcmp will be more generous with their information sharing.
but this is a fragile cover, so they need to coverthe cover.
they need a new ray vecchio to slide in there at division 27, chicago p.d.
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
a marine f-18 squadron deployed on the carrier reprisal was testing a new version of the amraam missile.
one of the missiles brought down a north korean civilian airliner.
in an hour, the president starts apologising to everyone on the planet.
the white house has a lot of questions and they want the answers.
sir, the salvage vessel reports the north korean cruiser, choson, has fired a warning shot across her bow.
get a section of tomcats up to cover the salvage ship until we get there.
there's not a soul on this carrier who's not upset by it.
you say there's no way the missile was defective, but there is another possibility.
i know you wanna wrap this thing up quickly, so you can go home.
i wanna wrap this up quickly so the admiral can get his report.
quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, but this time it's a goose.
you see, for the life of me, i have no idea where that radar came from.
i understand you'd want to observe combat operations, but leaving the galley mid-shift is not a good idea.
i'm gone for, like, 15 minutes and there's a fire and the senior chief blames me.
we are to leave the area by dawn and take the salvage vessel with us.
if we refuse, they will consider it an act of war.
more than you'd expect a lieutenant commander to have lying around.
he's either a wiz in the stock market or he has a beautiful source of outside income.
which is why they didn't want us to find the wreckage.
someone aboard ship knew about the missile test the day before, sent a coded message to the north koreans around 0900, probably from cic.
when newbies come on board, they're assigned 90 days of mess duty.
they can use their off-duty hours to learn their operational speciality.
well, maybe the mess chief is biting a little too hard.
i mean, after all, the kid was just trying to be a good sailor.
if i wanted to send a communication from here, could i do it?
well, you could send one, major, but nobody would be able to read it.

the white house has a lot of questions and they want the answers.
what was a north korean airliner doing in a navy test zone anyway?
it must have gone by so fast that i missed it.
is it possible you didn't mention it earlier because it implicates someone in your own squadron?
conclusion, one of your pilots is responsible and he isn't admitting it.
quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, but this time it's a goose.
you see, for the life of me, i have no idea where that radar came from.
i know guys who'd give up a month's pay for this duty.
there was no communication regarding an altered flight plan from the koreans.
then there should be no problem with our checking the tapes.
it's gonna take me a couple hours to break this down.
maybe you'd like to go get a cup of coffee, sir.
oh, well, they basically said to get out of town and the captain told them to stick it.
and then he sonic boomed one of the lead korean ships.
it took me a while to decode it, but it's very clean.
someone on this ship sent a message specifying the time and place of the amraam test.
but if they fire upon us again, we will defend ourselves using whatever means necessary.
this is exactly what we've trained for, each and every one of us.
then they transmitted a phoney iff code to make themselves look like an innocent civilian plane that strayed off course.
but then their own search radar triggered the missile that shot them down.
i asked the operations chief if i could put in some training time.
he gave me 10 minutes and then i came back here.
they can use their off-duty hours to learn their operational speciality.
well, maybe the mess chief is biting a little too hard.
i mean, after all, the kid was just trying to be a good sailor.
if i wanted to send a communication from here, could i do it?
well, you could send one, major, but nobody would be able to read it.
you see, all transmissions from here are encrypted before they go out.
all you need is a calling card that you buy at the store.
could she have sent a message from one of the phones?
so she goes to cic, spends two, three minutes on the tracer as an alibi.
on the way back to the galley, she stops at this phone, sends the message.
we are facing a confrontation with the korean navy, petty officer.
just get me in the air and then you can check with whoever you want.
twenty-five years ago an ancient legend of this sacred art came alive.
it spoke of a foreign child who would come among us and become a ninja master like none other.
how he arrived on our shores will forever remain a mystery.
we ninjas thought that this child would be the great white ninja of the legend.
this holds the teachings of all ninjutsu that have been passed down for generations over five centuries.
and in this writ there's a legend about a great white ninja?
the final technique for ripping a man's head off is by simply using your bare hands.
this requires hard work and discipline years, sometimes decades, to achieve.
i'm sorry to tell you this but your boyfriend is a counterfeiter and a killer.

i was merely trying to get close to the temple, not inside.

hey, i see you got the t-200 spiit-ievei barber ink printing press.
these came out when i was printing for the "shave the whale" campaign.
i guess i'm going to have to quantify the 7-f reading on this and that would run it through with the surface-gravity viscosity.
i couid plug it into the marshall formula, and that would that would give me an accurate mix design.
my son we would all be lucky to have a heart as big as yours.
in fact, gobei will not become a great ninja, until he learns that lesson.
you are, without a doubt, the greatest ninja of all time.
believe it or not, there were times when i doubted myself.
whether i am or am not the great white ninja you made me believe in myself.

i understand that, don gregorio, but how can i settle down?
you're a very lucky lady... because your leo ascendant... gives you the anchor you need.
since you were a girl, i've filled your head... with the idea that... getting married in a white dress... was the greatest thing you could aspire to as a woman.
now i'm going... to confess... something that has been a family secret since....
in order to keep up such a relationship... for seven years.
she crosses and uncrosses her legs... showing her knees, golden... round... perfectly shaped.
and how did you hook don virginio... and commit bigamy for the first time?
he was dying... and his last wish was to marry me.
he makes a basil pesto sauce that makes you want to lick your fingers.
when you two got married, he already knew you had another husband?

i don't know when i'll be able to pay her back.
a thousand years ago it was the richest city of them all, the eye of all the world.
in the very center, the ancient church of saint sofia, converted now into a mosque.
here, the emperors of byzantium met the king of heaven, the lords of this world and the next, the center of the christian universe.
visions of this holy city and its golden emperors filled the mind and the imagination of every medieval prince and king until one day an army of the christian west came here and destroyed it.
beside the church, above the sea, a shadowed park with five centuries of buildings in it, the palace of byzantium.
a thousand years ago there were gold pavilions here, chapels, mansions, set in a sea of green.
an earthly paradise, one of the most potent ancient legends of our planet, the home of god's emperor on earth.
so, where is the holy palace of byzantium in modern istanbul?
the enormous curve of the imperial race track still stands there, shattered wonder of the medieval world.
we're right at the very heart of the palace of imperial byzantium.
those are the doors through which the emperor once walked to board the royal yacht, the greyhound.
the emperors liked to live beside the seaside, so it's always a good idea to, when you're walking along the seaside walls of constantinople, to look and see if these little gates give you something of the entrance of the palace.
it's part of a greek version of the book of habakkuk, a text we know once was laid around the base of a great statue of the emperor justinian, who stood in the center of the city.
so this, then, is not an ancient gateway, because that statue was still standing a few hundred years ago.
where on earth can we find the picture of the palace of byzantium?
it's still here, of course, in its imitations and echoes of the great palace of constantinople that stand in sicily and spain and syria and rome.
villas, gardens, the verandahs, all set like tents across the hill.
scented courtyards, splashing fountains, a world that ordinary people never saw.
fragments of the true cross, set in gold and blood red rubies and great jeweled cups, made for the emperor's own communion.
and at the heart, at the very center of this magic palace,
byzantium's throne room, the throne room of the emperor of christendom.
as you approached the imperial throne of byzantium, you'd have felt as naked as a man on judgment day, utterly defenseless.
some byzantines believed that the end of world history would come when that man on that throne took his crown off and laid it on the rock of calvary.
it's probably the most total form of government the world has ever seen.
here, high up in the gallery of saint sofia, was the chapel of the emperors and the court.
below the balcony, in the incense and darkness of the ancient church, pilgrims from asia, africa, and europe visited and kissed a thousand holy relics... a little holy land of marble, gold and bronze.
in this smaller, private space above, the emperors held courtly services and were enrobed for the vast ceremonials that took place each week in the church below.
and, here they are still, the dynasties of old byzantium, still walking in the grand procession from a thousand years ago.
john desperately wanted him to succeed to the throne, but, he died young.
that person there is the most celebrated, most married monarch of the macedonian dynasty, the empress zoe.
i bet there were portraits of her other two husbands underneath.
now the funny thing about this mosaic is that zoe's portrait's been changed along with her husband, too.
you know, some historians have said that she was very vain.
it's certain she was beloved of the people of constantinople who thought her very beautiful.
they could only say that god dwelt here within it, and they were all baptized.
just as it intended, byzantium had dominated its neighbors with pious splendor and magnificence.
rather than dispatch grand armies to subdue them, the byzantines employed images of god and government.
they built churches in central europe the like of which the northerners had never seen.
when you met some villagers you might give them some silk brocade, or pepper, or leather.
but, always out there as shadows hiding in the woods, the epechenade.
these were ancient tribesmen who really prided themselves on killing travelers who drank from their gold bound skulls that hung on the walls of their tents, so it was said.
after months of travel, you'd arrive at the side of the frozen river nepa, and look up at the great fortress of the ruler of kiev, the prince of the
you know, it's at times like this archaeology really comes alive.
you know, this isn't just a little bit of old brick or mortar or something.
these could be the walls of an imperial church in ancient constantinople.
inside, memories of the palace of all palaces, and the church of all churches, the original saint sofia of constantinople.
and gleaming mosaics, too, made by byzantine craftsmen sent here to work for vladimir's son, prince yeroslav.
carefully preserved images of jesus, mary and the saints, images of government and holiness to pacify the north.
the heavenly court of old byzantium, floating high above the prince of kiev.
the heavenly court, now entirely mirrored in yeroslav's new court on earth, aided and abetted by a byzantine bishop who wants him to punish sinners, to feed the poor, and to fight the enemies of byzantium.
just as the dangerous northern tribes passed under byzantium golden spell, so did it's southern european neighbors, greece and italy, and the islands of the mediterranean.
venice, that ancient little town set on the mud banks of the north italian salt marsh, was the owner of a powerful fleet of warships, as much a menace to constantinople as were the tribesmen of the north.
beneath the stones of venice, the bricks and columns, the technology and arts of old byzantium.
just like kiev, venice's first churches and its most powerful images of god and government all came here from byzantium.
if you were a useful ally for byzantium, and you sent off thirty of forty pounds of gold to constantinople with a humble letter, the emperor might just honor you with some of these panels... pictures of god and your local saints and portraits, too,
of you amongst the golden prophets and the angels of byzantium.
this was the power of byzantium abroad, its prestige, its foreign policy.
this little chap here is oldelafo fallia, the ruler, the doge of venice.
he's the man who commissioned the greater part of the pallidoro.
now, this is where you can start to see something of that provincial envy of
so, he's sort of really bumped up in the holy heirarchy here.
but, there's one thing the venetians missed, and this is quite funny, because, rulers in the celestial universe wear red socks.
also, that this same god held the power of eternal life and death.
by the middle ages, byzantium's most powerful images of god and government had crossed the mediterranean and penetrated central europe, too.
goods from byzantium's bazaars are found today in excavations in sweden, in afghanistan, in england, and in russia.
and, like coke cans in the gobi desert, they give out a very special buzz.
in the west, they just had little bits of byzantine silk and they used it to wrap the bones of saints and to put upon the high altars of cathedrals.
so, you can imagine that when a western diplomat came here, about 950 ad, and actually bought two whole rolls of silk for his own clothes that he was very pleased with himself.
but, when the bishop got to the borders, the customs, the byzantine customs took the cloth away from him.
they said that even great bishop louit prand of cremona, the embassy of the king of germany, wasn't grand enough to wear this fine fabric.
you know, the byzantines had a knack of making great kings feel like little lads from the country.
the old bazaars had ancient wisdom up for sale, as well.
in byzantium's book market, the best part of the learning of the ancient world was copied out by publishers and merchants.
and here it is still today, the oldest book store in the world.
there would have been more people here then, lots of scribes actually writing them.
and, a byzantine magistrate who's walking through the square recognized him.
books like the alchemist gave algebra and chemistry to western europe.
to westerners, it must have seemed that all the wealth and wisdom of the world was held inside constantinople and in the houses of the lucky people of byzantium.
they were incredibly superstitious, always looking for signs as they looked at each other, things that might change the meaning of their relationships with one another.
the angle of a man's shoulders could tell you if he was having an affair.
if you had a dream that you've put on a pair of shoes and weren't going anywhere, could mean you might be getting married.
you could nod at a woman and it meant that you would be having an affair with her very shortly.
poor old bishop louit prand of cremona had come to constantinople for silks and for a byzantine princess for his prince, hadn't got either of them.
the byzantines lectured him upon the gross behavior of his prince and sniffed at the very idea of sending an imperial princess to such a barbarous and distant kingdom.
you wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night, bishop louit prand reports to his prince.
he's a monstrosity in a smelly old robe, a dwarf with the eyes of a mole, disfigured, disgraced, pig like, an ethiopian.
they might just as well say, "come on you burned out old crow, old woman, clod hopping barbarian!"
as western diplomats, like louit prand, reported on the weakness of the emperors and on the thousand years of treasure in their city, so western europe's princes grew ever stronger, ever more powerful, and ever
promising them the plunder of byzantium, they provided lists of the treasures and the holy relics inside constantinople.
on the thirteenth of april, venetian war galleys sailed up to the city walls and the knights of france and germany, of italy and england, jumped from the boats onto the battlements.
the campaign that followed was a nasty mix of treachery and chaos.
but the ending, the city's walls were breached and the imperial throne was overturned.
more booty, it's said, was taken from this town than from all the cities since creation.
over the next fifty years half of constantinople was boxed up, crated, and shipped out of the city to venice and the west.
and, in the 1790's, when napoleon and his armies turned up in italy, he was able to take half a ton of gold from this room and melt it down just to pay his troops.
but, despite all of that, despite all the losses, this is still the single place in all the world where you can get a glimmer, just a flash, of the treasure that once filled byzantium.
a golden icon of saint michael, studded with indian emeralds... the byzantines used its glowing colors to foretell the future.
this, too, came from the palace, probably from the chambers of the queen.
inside saint marks, as well, the altar's filled with the holy relics looted from constantinople.
this superb madonna, venice's most holy icon, had been carried into battle by the emperor alexis mozouflos.
shiploads of columns from constantinople now decorate the doorways of the church.
these beautiful square pillars from an ancient church that had stood on the main highway of constantinople were used as gallows.
you see, when the venetians first took the sculpture from the boat, they found that one of the feet had been broken off.
so, they made a new foot out of a lighter, whiter stone.
all the courts of western europe now held the plunder of constantinople, objects whose hypnotic sparkle crackled through western europe.
in modern germany, the little town of limburg still holds one of these most alien objects, a piece of the cross on which christ was crucified, transformed by a byzantine into one of the world's great jewels,
and then carried off to germany by heinrich von ullman, the crusading knight.
in 1235, when this church was just being finished and the crusaders were still ruling in constantinople, that doorway would have been surrounded by the ill, the mad, and the crippled and the bored.
inside this church, inside all churches in western europe where there was a relic of a saint, there was a special power.
this power came, actually, from heaven, and in lieu of hospitals, that was the best thing these people could hope for was a cure.
so, their little fragments of bone and flesh were very important.
when people went up to their shrines and touched them, they were in touch, you might say, with a little bit of heaven, as if there was a hole in the holy ozone.
these holy things were held in the imperial churches and in the palaces of byzantium.
in that extraordinary world, halfway between earth and heaven they confirmed the divine role of the emperor on earth.
by stealing these powerful objects from constantinople the pious kings of western europe had gained a confidence they'd never had before.
this then, that taking of the relics, was the taking of the holiness of the divine right of kings, the beginning of western europe, of eurocentricity, and almost, you might say, of the modern world.
safe inside, he addressed the adoring people of the city who had labored under foreign rule for fifty years, and now celebrated the return of christ's true emperor to the very center of the earth.
a while ago, god was angry with us and made the west into a great wind that blew us from our city, and we lived like the birds beneath the branches of a tree.
as michael said, they thought that god had restored the cosmic balance, that the golden dream was up and running as before.
in the imperial chapel, in the gallery of saint sofia, their artists made a celebratory mosaic for the emperor's return,
his bones, they said, were thrown out the window into the street, and even the dogs wouldn't eat them.
the great mosaic though, humane, transcendent, optimistic, is the finest single work of all byzantium's mosaic masters.

like have families and work and go out with their buddies.

i wouldn't say i was nutty, but you gotta be a little bit crazy to do my work.
so we at the institute anana...ananalysed this mosquito and we realalised... ..that "jurassic park" might not simply be a fairy tale.
now, through genetic coding, we've been able to create and breed creatures that haven't walked this earth for over 65 million years.
okay, keep your eyes peeled for whatever chett did to alter history.

you did tell them there was a slave revolt meeting today.
yes, bodacious, but most of our followers were out partying with chettus maximus all night.
i have a plan to reignite the fury of the masses.
chettus maximus is the most popular man in the whole of rome, correct?
but... what if he were to die at emperor timidius's hand?
then the people would have a reason to hate the emperor again.
good thing chett's jeep battery had enough juice to zap us back.
i just hope we managed to get history back on track.

a mailman you know, maybe even trust, will offer to give you a lift.
well, it's my job and i'm pretty damn serious about it.
in addition to being a postmaster i'm a general and we both know it's the job of a general to, by god, get things done.
somebody wanna tell me what the fuck happened to dino ortolani?
well, he suffocated an al ds patient, emilio sanchez, and i put him in the hole.
the first time alone, let her get a sense of the place.
make a romantic evening of it, just the two of you.
you know, the whole point of a conjugal is not just sex.
but it's, your wife comes in, she brings food, she can cook for you, you talk to each other.
holly made a painting for you but i left it in my purse.
the guard asked me about explosives and i completely forgot about the painting.
i don't know where it comes from, but you make a man your prag, he's your prag for life.
it's like the old days when people didn't get divorced, the only way out of marriage is death.
therefore, i am introducing to the legislature a measure which would save this state an estimated $3 million a year.
this law would eliminate all conjugal visits between inmates and their wives.
i have counted all the pencils and i want them back.
so if you use any of them as a weapon or if any one of them is missing, none of you will get a visit.
if i find out you had anything to do with this,
i'm gonna bury you so deep in gen pop, she'll never see your black ass again.
it might also be perceived as a reward for jefferson keane who, as far as i can tell, has done nothing to deserve a reward.
he's not a model prisoner, no, but this could help turn him around.
it's a holy ritual, a sacred bond between a man, a woman and god.
marriage is when a husband and wife live together, in the same house, sleep in the same bed.
but, you know, your desire to marry her, that can't come out of your ego.
it can't come out of a jealousy, it can't come out of a fear that because you are in here and you can't have her, no man should.
i come to you on keane's behalf, you blow me off in a cloud of platitudes.
now, kareem said says god knows what to you, the clouds have parted, the sun is shining.
so, what you're telling me is that you were being a good father to eduardo when you carved up the haitian.
well, if somebody hurts your grandson you won't be able to do anything about it, will you?
so you tell me what a st. pauli girl does after she takes off her apron.
and i always thought the little bitch was smiling just for me.
what has me fucked up is, who arranged for the guy who did the deed to get in the hole?
i mean, that would have to be a pretty well-connected son of a bitch.
eventually, i'm gonna get the little fuck who killed ortolani and he's gonna start singing.
and the only name that fucking nigger is gonna rap is the skinny-ass white boy's.
in a related story, state legislators have overwhelmingly passed a bill banning conjugal visits between the inmates and their wives.
governor james devlin has hailed the vote as a victory for law-abiding citizens.
somebody wanna tell me what the fuck happened to dino ortolani?
well, he suffocated an aids patient, emilio sanchez, and i put him in the hole.
holly and gary are standing out front and i'm holding the baby.
she drew the dog about twice as big as anybody else.
i don't know where it comes from, but you make a man your prag, he's your prag for life.
it's like the old days when people didn't get divorced, the only way out of marriage is death.
therefore i am introducing to the legislature a measure which would save this state an estimated $3 million a year.
this law would eliminate all conjugal visits between inmates and their wives...
i have counted all the pencils and i want them back.
so if you use any of them as a weapon or any of them is missing, none of you will get a visit.
it might also be perceived as a reward for jefferson keane who, as far as i can tell, has done nothing to deserve a reward.
he's not a model prisoner, no, but this could help turn him around.
it's a holy ritual, a sacred bond between a man, a woman, and god.
marriage is when a husband and wife live together, in the same house, sleep in the same bed.
it can't come out of the jealousy, can't come out of the fear that because you are in here and you can't have her, no man should.
if you love her, you must be careful that you do not deprive her of the fullness of life.
i come to you on keane's behalf and you blow me off in a cloud of platitudes.
now kareem said says god knows what to you, now the clouds have parted and the sun is shining.
the same way that i'm responsible for you, for your soul.
so get ready, miguel alvarez, because i'm gonna be over your shoulder.
next time i saw him he was 18 and wearing the same prison uniform i was.
then my son started mouthing off to everybody here, making fun of people, making threats.
so what you're telling me is you were being a good father to eduardo when you carved up the haitian.
well, if somebody hurts your grandson you won't be able to do anything about it, will you?
a wad of jizz hits an egg and bing bam you're connected to all these people.
these strangers, who maybe got the same eyes as you or the same sort of nose.
so you tell me what a st. paul girl does after she takes up her apron.
and i always thought the little bitch was smiling just for me.
i'm gonna get the little fuck who killed ortolani and he's gonna start singing.
and the only name that fucking nigger is gonna rap is the skinny ass white boy's.
another inmate at oswald state penitentiary was murdered yesterday, the second such incident in as many weeks.
john post, a drug dealer serving life, was found in a utility closet at the prison mutilated, his fingers missing and several stab wounds to his heart.
leave this to me, mate, i'll stop 'em in their tracks.
might as well try to stop a tank with a popgun.
"i am not in my dotage," and "i am not a spent force."
it's hardly likely that a suitor would accuse her of being those, is it?
here's our first shot of the first couple of the interstellar alliance president john sheridan and delenn, live on isn.
their triumphant return to babylon 5 after the liberation of earth has generated good...
select a time period or select auto play for a chronological display of records.
loading records for period covering one year through 1000 years from events shown.
greatness is a quality that is often sought by those who want it most but are the least worthy.
correspondingly, greatness is sometimes thrust upon those who want it least but are the most deserving.
these words seem to best describe captain john j. sheridan in the way he came into the world and as the position that he currently occupies as that of the president of the new interstellar alliance.
the only son of a career diplomat sheridan was an average but enthusiastic student.
he drifted in and out of various hobbies, including a brief but obsessive interest in works of the dalai lama before entering earthforce shortly after the dilgar war.
he served with distinction during the minbari war and the food riots on mars.
what amazes me is the way that everyone has tried to turn sheridan into some kind of hero.
this is the man who resigned his commission in earthforce under dubious circumstances.
the president cleared him and his crew, henry and she called him the hero of the hour.
yes, she did, and she's gonna have to answer for that in the next election but that's besides the point.
now, there was obviously some sort of deal made there which is how he got out of there with his hide in one piece.
call me old-fashioned but that doesn't sound like the best qualification to run a major alliance.
to write him off before he's even started well, that's irrational, even for you, henry.
he fires on his own ships and you're calling me irrational?
i don't know if it will work i'm just saying that he deserves a chance to try and make it work.
what i think is missing and being lost in this whole discussion is that this is an election year and that mr. ellis was working as a speechwriter in the clark administration.
i hate to interrupt you at this point, but we're coming up on a break.
so why don't each of you give me your calls for the next couple of years on the following.
on top of that he has supply problems, telepath problems, raiding parties not to mention distrust among elements of his own government here at home.
this man has his work cut out for him, but i know that he can handle it.
the first thing you have to do is separate fantasy from reality.
the alliance publicity machine would have you believe that all this came about because of what a few people did.
but large political movements are rarely the work of any one person.
the individual at the center gives permission for others to act and inspires but the individual really cannot effect change as an act of will.
he said later it was the worst mistake of his career.
he thought they could control the telepaths, when any fool knows that's impossible.
it is not the policy of the interstellar alliance or this station to bargain with terrorists for the lives of hostages.
if we open that door even once we will never be able to close it again.
the cover story they put out was clearly designed to perpetuate the myth of his character.
and i guess it worked, because a lot of people still believe it 80 years later.
so where do the two of you fall on the delenn question?
well, everyone knows minbari live a long time, but not that long.
the idea that delenn is still around after this long and living in seclusion so, of course, no one can see her, it's very convenient.
the alliance is continuing the illusion that delenn is alive for their own purposes.
it's clear the motives of those at the birth of the alliance were not as pure as their biographers and allies would suggest.
the force of history is what moves us forward, our common shared destiny.
virtual environment functioning, identical to babylon 5 system records from 2262.
data transfer of records is complete successful in spite of extreme age of original files and destruction of original babylon 5 station 480 years ago.
to recap for politdivision central the purpose of this simulation is to provide reverse-correct infospeak as support for current changes in earth policy.
it is the new policy that the interstellar alliance is restrictive and against the best interests of earth.
to determine if the psychohistorical research has been thorough phase two will begin with the control holograms working with the actual psychological makeups of the subjects in question.
the holograms will thus perform in a fashion consistent with realfact.
the next step is to determine how well the system can be modified.
computer, update system files for holographic figures filling in period from 2262 through 2762.
the interstellar alliance is not here to be merciful to the weak.
in all the universe, there are only two kinds the conquerors and the conquered.
through your blood and the blood of your children we will blaze a path across the galaxy!
what we cannot take by force, we will win by subversion.
we will now continue with the use of alien organs in human bodies in an attempt to create a genetic crossbreed...
later today we will begin again with our experiments on children.
the problem with the vivisection is the younger children can only survive the initial removal of organs for a short time.
now, we hope that by increased use of drugs we may find a way to prolong their lives while we work.
see, the thing is, me and sheridan were close but i was the one who did most of the strategic planning during the war.
now, a resource like that, you might not want to wipe it out just yet.
your boys are planning a first strike against the enemy, aren't they?
that's why you're rushing ahead like this, because you're under the gun.
and i happen to have a knack for breaking system codes.
while you downloaded the new world order into me i watched the system work.
and so it came to pass that in the 500th year of the alliance the children of earth did war, one upon another with missiles and terrible weapons.
and they burned the earth and the air and the cities and the sea!
and we have waited so, so long, brother alwyn and they have never come.
if that's a myth, then everything else could be a myth.
and the whole of my life could just be a lie.
and if they do not come today, but they come tomorrow is your life a lie then?
faith sustains us in the hour when reason tells us that we cannot continue that the whole of our lives is without meaning.
then why were we born able to reason if reason's useless?
if you must have reason for an answer, then consider this.
if today the rangers came back to earth from their place in the heavens you would not know about it.
if the truth really is in the stars, brother alwyn then just once, once before i die i really wish that i could walk amongst those stars.
if there is a way, brother michael i pray that your wish comes true.

if the truth really is in the stars, brother alwyn then just once, once before i die i really wish that i could walk amongst those stars.
if there is a way, brother michael i pray that your wish comes true.
correspondingly, greatness is sometimes thrust upon those who want it least... but are the most deserving.
these words seem to best describe captain john j. sheridan... both in the way he came into the world and as the position that he currently occupies... as that of the president of the new interstellar alliance.
he drifted in and out of various hobbies, including a brief but obsessive interest... in works of the dalai lama... before entering earthforce shortly after the dilgar war.
he served with distinction during the minbari war and the food riots on mars.
what amazes me... is the way that everyone has tried to turn sheridan into some kind of hero.
this is the man who resigned his commission in earthforce... under dubious circumstances.
the president cleared him and his crew, henry... and she called him the hero of the hour.
yes, she did, and she's gonna have to answer for that in the next election... but that's besides the point.
now, there was obviously some sort of deal made there... which is how he got out of there with his hide in one piece.
call me old-fashioned... but that doesn't sound like the best qualification to run a major alliance.
to write him off before he's even started... well, that's irrational, even for you, henry.
he fires on his own ships and you're calling me irrational?
what i think is missing and being lost in this whole discussion... is that this is an election year... and that mr. ellis was working as a speechwriter in the clark administration.
and i think that he and others of his party consider sheridan a real threat... to their hopes for a majority in the senate... so they're doing all they can to discredit him in advance.
so why don't each of you give me your calls for the next couple of years... on the following.
can sheridan and his people make a go of this new alliance?
the senate has been debating what to do about mars for years and did nothing.
it took sheridan to push them into recognizing... our sovereign rights of independence.
obviously, there's a degree of uncertainty in any new political situation.
this next year will prove critical for sheridan and the rest of his people.
with another in our series of educational stellarcasts... on the 100th anniversary of the interstellar alliance.
taking part in today's discussion from earth dome... historian dr. jim latimere from the university of york... political scientist dr. barbara tashaki, university of japan at tokyo... and psychologist dr. william exeter from nyu.
the publicity machine from the alliance would have you believe... that all this came about because of what a few people did.
but large political movements are rarely the work of any one person.
if you look at the social dynamic around them, they actually didn't do anything.
they were the open vessels in which people poured their hopes and their dreams... that sets up sort of a gestalt where events take on a life of their own.
well, i don't want to get off the track and into associated biography... so let's move on to the next question.
if your assumption is correct... where did sheridan and delenn and those involved go wrong?
he as much as said later it was the worst mistake of his career.
he thought they could control the telepaths, when any fool knows that's impossible.
i have consulted with captain lochley... and we've reached a decision regarding the current situation.
it is not the policy of the interstellar alliance or this station... to bargain with terrorists for the lives of hostages.
and i guess it worked, because a lot of people still believe it 80 years later.
so where do the two of you fall on the delenn question?
this is what dr. tashaki mentioned earlier, this constant perpetuation of fantasy.
the idea that delenn is still around after this long and living in seclusion... so, of course, no one can see her, it's very convenient.
apparently they feel they have to maintain this fiction... in order to keep their people in line.
but if the alliance and the rangers are as strong as they say... they don't need this security blanket of lies and myth.
data transfer of records is complete... successful in spite of extreme age of original files... and destruction of original babylon 5 station 480 years ago.
to recap for politdivision central... the purpose of this simulation is to provide reverse-correct infospeak... as support for current changes in earth policy.
it is the new policy that the interstellar alliance is restrictive... and against the best interests of earth.
intent is to deconstruct historical figures revered by prole sector... thereby legitimizing current government policies.
the system is updating the holographic representations... with our current political situation and the developments leading up to them.
this will demonstrate system flexibility... and capacity to spontaneously emote to changes in programming.
we have reconstructed your thought patterns... and your forms for purposes of a series of vids designed to help...
designed as propaganda to justify your break from the interstellar alliance.
i understand that you surrendered to our forces in the hopes of finding mercy.
the interstellar alliance is not here to be merciful to the weak.
in all the universe, there are only two kinds... the conquerors... and the conquered.
through your blood and the blood of your children... we will blaze a path across the galaxy!
your lives are not the first and they will not be the last.
if a billion must die to ensure the continuance of our empire... then so be it!
we have secured several test subjects for the next series of experiments.
we will now continue with the use of alien organs in human bodies... in an attempt to create a genetic crossbreed... that will be compliant to the needs of the alliance.
later today we will begin again with our experiments on children.
the problem with the vivisection is the younger children... can only survive the initial removal of organs for a short time.
no point in having a conversation with someone that doesn't really exist.
you know, i was just thinking, when you've got your pieces in place, you're probably gonna launch a preemptive strike against the enemy, right?
see, the thing is, me and sheridan were close... but i was the one who did most of the strategic planning during the war.
now, a resource like that, you might not want to wipe it out just yet.
your boys are planning a first strike against the enemy, aren't they?
that's why you're rushing ahead like this, because you're under the gun.
and i happen to have a knack for breaking system codes.
so, while you were downloading the new world order into me...
so as of right now, the enemy knows what you have in mind, danny.
now, from your records, they're actually a lot more humanitarian than you are.
a fable, specifically created to match scripture, that's what the others say.
and there is not one shred of evidence that he even existed.
to those flying machines that the books talk about, or to the stars.
and if the truth really does lie in the stars... then how will we ever know the truth?
and we have waited so, so long, brother alwyn... and they have never come.
if that's a myth, then everything else could be a myth.
and the whole of my life could just be a lie.
and if they do not come today, but they come tomorrow... is your life a lie then?
faith sustains us... in the hour when reason tells us that we cannot continue... that the whole of our lives is without meaning.
then why were we born able to reason if reason's useless?
if you must have reason for an answer, then consider this.
if today the rangers came back to earth from their place in the heavens... you would not know about it.

and they burned the earth and the air and the cities and the sea!
and we have waited so, so long, brother alwyn and they have never come.
if that's a myth, then everything else could be a myth.
and the whole of my life could just be a lie.
and if they do not come today, but they come tomorrow is your life a lie then?
faith sustains us in the hour when reason tells us that we cannot continue that the whole of our lives is without meaning.
then why were we born able to reason if reason's useless?
if you must have reason for an answer, then consider this.
if today the rangers came back to earth from their place in the heavens you would not know about it.
if the truth really is in the stars, brother alwyn then just once, once before i die i really wish that i could walk amongst those stars.
if there is a way, brother michael i pray that your wish comes true.
here's our first shot of the first couple of the interstellar alliance president john sheridan and delenn, live on isn.
their triumphant return to babylon 5 after the liberation of earth has generated good...
select a time period or select auto play for a chronological display of records.
loading records for period covering one year through 1000 years from events shown.
greatness is a quality that is often sought by those who want it most but are the least worthy.
correspondingly, greatness is sometimes thrust upon those who want it least but are the most deserving.
these words seem to best describe captain john j. sheridan in the way he came into the world and as the position that he currently occupies as that of the president of the new interstellar alliance.
the only son of a career diplomat sheridan was an average but enthusiastic student.
he drifted in and out of various hobbies, including a brief but obsessive interest in works of the dalai lama before entering earthforce shortly after the dilgar war.
he served with distinction during the minbari war and the food riots on mars.
what amazes me is the way that everyone has tried to turn sheridan into some kind of hero.
this is the man who resigned his commission in earthforce under dubious circumstances.
the president cleared him and his crew, henry and she called him the hero of the hour.
yes, she did, and she's gonna have to answer for that in the next election but that's besides the point.
now, there was obviously some sort of deal made there which is how he got out of there with his hide in one piece.
call me old-fashioned but that doesn't sound like the best qualification to run a major alliance.
to write him off before he's even started well, that's irrational, even for you, henry.
he fires on his own ships and you're calling me irrational?
i don't know if it will work i'm just saying that he deserves a chance to try and make it work.
what i think is missing and being lost in this whole discussion is that this is an election year and that mr. ellis was working as a speechwriter in the clark administration.
i hate to interrupt you at this point, but we're coming up on a break.
so why don't each of you give me your calls for the next couple of years on the following.
on top of that he has supply problems, telepath problems, raiding parties not to mention distrust among elements of his own government here at home.
this man has his work cut out for him, but i know that he can handle it.
the first thing you have to do is separate fantasy from reality.
the alliance publicity machine would have you believe that all this came about because of what a few people did.
but large political movements are rarely the work of any one person.
the individual at the center gives permission for others to act and inspires but the individual really cannot effect change as an act of will.
he said later it was the worst mistake of his career.
he thought they could control the telepaths, when any fool knows that's impossible.
it is not the policy of the interstellar alliance or this station to bargain with terrorists for the lives of hostages.
if we open that door even once we will never be able to close it again.
the cover story they put out was clearly designed to perpetuate the myth of his character.
and i guess it worked, because a lot of people still believe it 80 years later.
so where do the two of you fall on the delenn question?
well, everyone knows minbari live a long time, but not that long.
the idea that delenn is still around after this long and living in seclusion so, of course, no one can see her, it's very convenient.
the alliance is continuing the illusion that delenn is alive for their own purposes.
it's clear the motives of those at the birth of the alliance were not as pure as their biographers and allies would suggest.
the force of history is what moves us forward, our common shared destiny.
virtual environment functioning, identical to babylon 5 system records from 2262.
data transfer of records is complete successful in spite of extreme age of original files and destruction of original babylon 5 station 480 years ago.
to recap for politdivision central the purpose of this simulation is to provide reverse-correct infospeak as support for current changes in earth policy.
it is the new policy that the interstellar alliance is restrictive and against the best interests of earth.
to determine if the psychohistorical research has been thorough phase two will begin with the control holograms working with the actual psychological makeups of the subjects in question.
the holograms will thus perform in a fashion consistent with realfact.
the next step is to determine how well the system can be modified.
computer, update system files for holographic figures filling in period from 2262 through 2762.
the interstellar alliance is not here to be merciful to the weak.
in all the universe, there are only two kinds the conquerors and the conquered.
through your blood and the blood of your children we will blaze a path across the galaxy!
what we cannot take by force, we will win by subversion.
we will now continue with the use of alien organs in human bodies in an attempt to create a genetic crossbreed...
later today we will begin again with our experiments on children.
the problem with the vivisection is the younger children can only survive the initial removal of organs for a short time.
now, we hope that by increased use of drugs we may find a way to prolong their lives while we work.
see, the thing is, me and sheridan were close but i was the one who did most of the strategic planning during the war.
now, a resource like that, you might not want to wipe it out just yet.
your boys are planning a first strike against the enemy, aren't they?
that's why you're rushing ahead like this, because you're under the gun.
and i happen to have a knack for breaking system codes.
while you downloaded the new world order into me i watched the system work.
and so it came to pass that in the 500th year of the alliance the children of earth did war, one upon another with missiles and terrible weapons.
and they burned the earth and the air and the cities and the sea!
and we have waited so, so long, brother alwyn and they have never come.
if that's a myth, then everything else could be a myth.
and the whole of my life could just be a lie.
and if they do not come today, but they come tomorrow is your life a lie then?
faith sustains us in the hour when reason tells us that we cannot continue that the whole of our lives is without meaning.
then why were we born able to reason if reason's useless?
if you must have reason for an answer, then consider this.
if today the rangers came back to earth from their place in the heavens you would not know about it.
if the truth really is in the stars, brother alwyn then just once, once before i die i really wish that i could walk amongst those stars.
if there is a way, brother michael i pray that your wish comes true.
i was tired of everything i just wanted to run away.
of course i didn't think much would change by transferring from the beginning...
whan was the kind of guy who bragged about the fact... that he started sniffing glue in 5th grade.
i don't give a shit about where you hung out, asshole.
those lg cheerleaders... had these thin hard bodies, and could really move.
bottom of the 9th with 2 out, lg took out the 4th hitter and sent in a pinch hitter.

the only thing that picks up slower is rimmer in a disco.
maybe if i adjust the impulse valve, it might make it a little more sensitive.
- when you have a mechanical failure, it fixes itself, doesn't it?
the kryten back in my dimension had these tiny little robots.
so what if we transferred some of your nanobots into dave?
could they build him a new arm from excess body tissue?
you look shakier than a silicon implant ward during an earthquake.
well, according to all our scanners, that planetoid out there is...
i mean, if you were a female pit bull terrier, how would you feel about a three-legged...?
does it make any difference to - plucking any old relationship out of the air - us?
dumped on a planet in the middle of an electro-storm and left to rot for hundreds of years, and the guy's lost nothing.
so, while we were on the esperanto, your nanobots mutinied and took over red dwarf?

i figure that because- because i'm a good figurer, that's how.
well, let me give you a bit of advice from someone who knows absolutely nothing- always watch out for your own life.
last night i listened to a woman tell me about her father, who she made out to be one of the most important men in the world.
the only thing is, she thinks that her father's been dead for 15 years, but he isn't.
well, uh... the reason i'm substituting is the guy who usually plays got very sick and he puked all inside the case, and that's where the ticket is, too.
but if you want me to get it, i can show...
in moscow, if one wanted to research old records, uh, locate reports, uh... from local deaths, traffic accidents...
why on earth would you think of such a depressing thing?
even though playing solo is okay, it always helps to have someone backing you up.
as for falling in lust with a beautiful russian virtuosas, well, that can be complicated.
sometimes, when i'm playing that violin-- the one that my father gave me-- the strangest thing happens.
i can be on stage in front of a thousand people, and just for a moment, it's as if i'm all alone, and he is standing right beside me.
the only thing is, she thinks that her father's been dead for 15 years, but he isn't.
now, you tell me, yuri, or i'm gonna call the cops.
i had no time, so i did what i thought was best.
if i died, her life might be spared, so that night i ceased to exist.
just this once, i'm going to do this for you 'cause i think you're cute.
yeah, thanks a lot, but i don't need to know about pigs with melanoma or spam.
in moscow, if one wanted to research old records, uh, locate reports, uh... from local deaths, traffic accidents...
why on earth would you think of such a depressing thing?
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
- uh, i got my start at the comedy cave in hellespont.
i know, it's a dive, but, uh, you gotta start somewhere, right?
he barely had the strength to break it up between you two.
you go tell zeus, if i'm gonna help him, he's gotta help me find iolaus.
all of olympus is helpless as long as xena keeps him supplied with hind's blood.
now, if you could keep close tabs, maybe find out where she's hiding it--
look, if the hercules here is the same as the hercules back there, then he can't be all bad.
i'll just have to appeal to that part of him that's hidden deep inside.
i know what they are-- genocide, the end of the world as we know it-- both our worlds.
and it's not as if i haven't taken a life before.
it is my sad duty to join this man and this woman... in unholy matrimony.
if anyone present objects to this union, speak now or forever hold your peace.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
then i'll get to work slaughtering every last puny mortal who opposes me..., ...and leave the world to my worshippers.
while we... reign as king and queen of olympus for eternity.
there's a world of scheming going on behind those baby blues.
if you mean where would your plan be without my secret stash of hind blood, then i guess you do kinda need me.
all of olympus is helpless as long as xena keeps him supplied with hind's blood.
now, if you could keep close tabs..., ...maybe find out where she's hiding it...
it'd really help if you stood up to the sovereign yourself sometime.
it is times like this i regret the fact that i'm a lover, not a fighter.
i'm gonna enjoy tearing the sovereign's bootlicker apart limb by limb.
when you're ready to apologize to the sovereign, give a yell.
maybe if i got a second chance, i could be more like your friend, more man than mouse.
whatever destiny you were fated for..., ...it looks like iolaus has stepped into your shoes.
genocide, the end of the world as we know it..., ...both our worlds.
and it's not as if i haven't taken a life before.
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
undersecretary of state lawrence culbertson was rescued last night from hamas terrorists.
a lt. curtis rivers, platoon commander from seal team 7, got culbertson out single-handedly.
culbertson's the president's point man in the middle east peace talks.
rivers saved him without regard for his own personal safety and accounted for eight enemy casualties.
and a letter of instruction for disrespect toward a superior commissioned officer.
nominated for the navy cross for bravery in capturing an iraqi oil platform in the gulf during desert storm.
denied the cross and issued a warning for violating an order on the same mission.
if a brother improvises, especially a brother who's a mustang, he gets written up.
mr. barrow, you are not suggesting we make up for past discrimination by awarding the medal to someone who hasn't earned it, are you?
commander, the president believes that awarding the medal to a minority would promote national healing.
i'd like to dedicate this to the most important woman in my life.
i saw the light on the night that i passed by her window
well, if they could roll a bottle of jack in a tobacco leaf, it would be a different story.
you know, my mother used to say that stars were holes poked in the black curtain of night.
one of your men has accused you of endangering the team and the hostage the night of the rescue.
he claims you were out of control and acted without discretion.
there seems to be some concern about lt. rivers' behaviour in the field.
it's extremely rare for a seal team to publicly question one of their own, especially their superior.
what do you remember about what went on after the firefight?
well, after the lieutenant brought me out of the building, he hid me behind some rocks, and then, when he came back, he...
you're a hard-assed mustang with a chip on your shoulder, using your father as an excuse.
i can do anything i want because seaman edgar rivers was persecuted.
i don't have to defend myself to you, to them or to anyone.
the mission i took was to save the undersecretary of state.
together on this day, we say thank you to those who step forward to safeguard our security and our ideals.
what better way to express our gratitude than by presenting this country's highest military decoration for valour?
for his conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty,
lt. curtis rivers, united states navy, an american hero, is hereby awarded the medal of honour.
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
undersecretary of state lawrence culbertson was rescued last night from hamas terrorists.

culbertson's the president's point man in the middle east peace talks.
rivers saved him without regard for his own personal safety and accounted for eight enemy casualties.
i spoke with the secretary of the navy personally about lt. rivers.
so why is the judge advocate general corps involved in this?
freeing a cia operative in a daring raid on the carcel modelo prison.
and a letter of instruction for disrespect toward a superior commissioned officer.
nominated for the navy cross for bravery in capturing an iraqi oil platform in the gulf during desert storm.
denied the cross and issued a warning for violating an order on the same mission.
if a brother improvises, especially a brother who's a mustang, he gets written up.
if a white boy from the academy does the exact same thing, he's showing individual initiative.
when that c-4 went off, the iraqis thought we were doing an amphibious landing.
and then stormin' norman took the troops and the armour right over ground.
i'm gonna have to wear a bag and eat cream of wheat for the rest of my life.
petty officer douglas, we are looking for confirmation of lt. rivers' actions during the rescue.
do you have an opinion about whether he deserves the medal of honour?
well, as far as i'm concerned, there were no heroes that night.
well, i would venture a guess, lieutenant, that you have never been married.
if the navy wanted me to have a wife, they would have issued me one with my dog tags and my seabag.
you know, my mother used to say that stars were holes poked in the black curtain of night.
it was god's way of letting us know he was watching us from the other side.
he claims you were out of control and acted without discretion.
you must think you've got me drunk enough to answer your questions.
i'd cancel medal considerations and proceed with an investigation into misconduct in the field.
look, commander, the secnav is getting pressure from the white house.
then maybe if you get tired enough, you'll just go away.
after what happened to your father, we understand how you feel about lawyers.
together on this day, we offer a prayer for peace and a tribute to those who defend it.
together on this day, we say thank you to those who step forward to safeguard our security and our ideals.
a man of your military background and experience... and the fact you have... no affiliation with the government... makes you an ideal candidate.
i can appreciate your concern for the kind of work we do.
when the motorcade arrives... the first lady will exit first, followed by bickhart.
travel time from l.a.x. to veterans hospital... will be approximately 25 minutes.
omega, you will take positions on the rooftop of building b.
our operatives in the secret service... will provide you the necessary access.
it's another gorgeous southern california day... for the dedication of the bickhart wing... a newly constructed 100-million-dollar facility... funded by pharmaceutical giant donald bickhart.
this facility will serve as permanent residence... for some 1,000 disabled war veterans.
i want blue team to make its way to the seventh floor... set up on the door, and make entry.
red team will back up blue team... and secure the rest of the floor.
it appears no one except the first lady has been wounded.
with me is victoria constantini... a doctor at veterans hospital and an eyewitness.
i turned around, and i thought i saw a man on that roof... but everyone was staring at the other roof.
in all the confusion, i might have made a mistake... but i'm pretty sure i saw a man on that roof.
i have a brief statement... which will hopefully answer your questions.
we are asking shopkeepers... in the immediate vicinity of the shooting... to examine their surveillance cameras... for sightings of the suspect prior to the shooting.
we are also asking citizens who may have taped the event... to allow us to examine those tapes.
simply call your fbi main number... and someone will retrieve the materials.
we shared many charitable causes... none more worthy than caring for the veterans of this country.
i was with the first lady at the time of the shooting.
i feel an obligation to do everything i can... to bring her killer to justice.
i am offering $10 million to any citizen... who captures or provides information... leading to the capture of james dunn.
that was birthday candles on a cake... compared to what will happen if what you have comes to light.
since i know all your dark secrets as well... maybe we can do a little horse-trading.
what can i do to put a smile on your face?
i understand there's a reward for the capture of mr. dunn... ten million.
congressional hearings open today... in the case of bickhart pharmaceuticals... and its secret human test of the vaccine c.r.c. -13.
the case was pushed into public view... by dr. victoria constantini, whose testimony is crucial... because of her early treatment... of the veterans involved in the illegal research.
donald bickhart committed suicide... after he was linked with assassin alan braddock... in the plot to kill the first lady.
in an ironic twist, escaped convict james dunn... the apparent fall guy of the conspirators... was returned to military prison last month.
suddenly i had this weird feeling ... " i'm going to die !".
so here i'am, laying flat out in the road with my life flashing before my eyes.
if she's asked to talk about it, it's like asking her to relive it.
i don't have to tell you that this guy is out there somewhere.
i'm asking, please don't let the department make a mistake trying to leapfrog this.
it's already something she has to live with for the rest of her life.
if he's not john allworth, mybe it's somebody he knows or who knows him.
the man we're looking for is a risk taker, but a deliberate man, as james said.
there are over 30 houses he didn't choose for one reason or another.
find those reasons, find a pattern, and you move closer to the killer.
and when i told her about you, she asked me if your hair was pretty, and i told her it was long and straight and beautiful.
and she was so jealous because she has curly hair and she wants it to be straight.
whatever you can do not to give him what he wants, the better chance you have of drawing him into the open.
you and me... we keep beating around the bush about this little girl.
so why don't you two take your time and walk around, see the house.
if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask, okay?
if she's asked to talk about it, it's like asking her to relive it.
i don't have to tell you that this guy is out there somewhere.
she's got to do this in her own time... if at all.
we've already got a department shrink on call to work this.
i'm asking you-- please don't let the department make a mistake... trying to leapfrog this.
it's already something that this little girl's gonna have to live with for the rest of her life.
there were 4,900 open houses in king county over the last six months.
graphological analysis matches the perpetrator's signature... to at least 37 sign-in registers... using the namejohn allworth, travis bickle and rudyard holmbast.
there are over 30 houses he didn't choose for one reason or another.
find those reasons, find a pattern... and you move closer to the killer, to what is going on in his head.
it's from a girl who's almost the same age as you.
her name's jordan, and when i told her about you... she asked me if your hair was pretty.
and i told her it was long and straight and beautiful.
and she was so jealous, because... she has curly hair, and she wants it to be straight.
and whatever you can do not to give him what he wants... the better chance you have of drawing him into the open, catching him.
you and me, uh... we keep beating around the bush about this little girl.
he takes chances, but everything's considered, as if scripted, planned-- what to leave, what to take, what he wants us to see... what he wants others to see.
he's leaving a record of the events-- videos, 911 calls, witnesses.
we put his picture in the paper, this guy won't be able... to cross the street without startin' a parade.
you make him too famous and he's gonna disappear on us altogether.
he's teaching us a lesson, about our pretensions to safety... about how vulnerable we are.
and the guy's working as a crossing guard, for god's sake.
if she's asked to talk about it, it's like asking her to relive it.
i don't have to tell you that this guy is out there somewhere.
i'm asking, please don't let the department make a mistake trying to leapfrog this.
it's already something she has to live with for the rest of her life.
if he's not john allworth, maybe it's somebody he knows or who knows him.

well, rebecca says you don't always let the law get in the way of your arguments.
i meant that when the law seems unjust, you can find a way around it.
- but nevertheless, a fetus which enjoys no constitutional protection until birth.
the law says she has no right to abort in the third trimester.
your honor, the courts draw a big distinction between prohibiting abortion and forcing a c-section on the mother.
i'd just like you to hear from the doctor, hear from the parents, then decide...
can't we just take the time to give it a thought?
well, we can think about it all we want, but the law is not exactly muddy here.
i believe in god and i believe he gives us free will.
he gives you the choice to do what you have to do to save your child.
i just don't like a court telling her to do it.
the oxygen supply to the placenta is insufficient and it's getting worse every day.
what did you see to think there was a transaction in progress?
as i said, we saw two people with drug histories conversing.
but i'm at a loss as to how a person would be willing to lose a child acting out of any faith.
accuse me of whatever you want, but don't accuse me of not wanting my baby.
there is nothing more sacred to individual liberty than the individual's right to possession and control over his or her own person.
even so, it is the unanimous wish of this court, mrs. randall that you save your child.
however, for us to order you to do so would be repugnant to our constitution and to your freedom.
a competent woman's choice to refuse medical treatment must be honored.
let's face it, i think we both work hard, we both get lost in our cases.
i thought we needed something other than our jobs to talk about.
i wanted that baby to be safe just as much as you!
but you took a knife and you put it into her!
i saw a client who's, you know, a lady of the evening.
i drove her home, i gave her money because she was broke she started rubbing me and the police suddenly showed up.
i meant that when the law seems unjust, you can find a way around it.
well, when it comes to a pregnant mother and what she wants to do the law doesn't give the father much legal say.
i can't force medical treatment on a person against her will.
if she doesn't have this procedure very soon, the baby will die.
the law says she has no right to abort in the third trimester.
that means the courts have recognized that a viable in utero baby has some rights.
well, we can think about it all we want, but the law is not exactly muddy here.
he has no paternal rights before birth, and she cannot be forced to have a c-section.
god brought my other babies through, and i know he'll be with me here.
i believe in god and i believe he gives us free will.
i think, since the baby is viable, she has to have the operation.
i just don't like a court telling her to do it.
i don't mean to keep sounding off alarm bells, but we're out of time.
we got a day, maybe two, before oxygen stops getting to the brain.
third-trimester abortions are illegal, so at some point the government does legislate dominion over a woman's body.
- a difference between prohibiting abortion and ordering intrusive major surgery.
- your honor the police saw what they thought to be criminal activity.
they had a reasonable suspicion that the suspect might be armed.
even so, it is the unanimous wish of this court, mrs. randall that you save your child.
however, for us to order you to do so would be repugnant to our constitution and to your freedom.
i guess i'm just too emotional for this kind of work.
now, rebecca, for michael's protection i want you to know that he doesn't know what's going on here.

you see, then i will celebrate by taking 5 or 6 lakhs from it .

even they fail lf it is so, how will you ?
do you want to go home alive or want to be 2 pieces of parcel chakochi is sure enough to leave here without any harm, do you want to see ?
but now i should speak something to you don't poke nose when i talk serious matters when he said his pregnant sister would commit suicide.... you scoffed him, dowery...sister...
when you escaped to high range after the murder of your sister's lover
then you were sheltered by an old bootlegger do you remember ?
my son when you got malaria he protected you safely i have shed tears when my father said this story you should cherish memories why did you not tell me first that you are the son of aanakkattil eeppachi why did'nt you reveal that you are chakochi the one who is very brave
his father is like god for me he only saved my life.
i come after a long drive about 300 km then you behave like this... i asked you to get me the key
i am too hungry, but you tell me that you don't want to see me or hear me stop there you mischievous fellow
tea buds are getting over ripened there are no labours to collecet
your father shows storng obstinacy labours are also showing much obstinacy
it is to punish for quarreling with the thevar come on, show hands
you still use your old brand what is its name ?
did your chiefjoined there as seminarian after meeting the pope or come back ?
eappachan, organization opposes only the local gods its ok, now what for this collection of money ?
all braveness of this double hearted chakochi was fully lost then did you hear it ?
kochu thresa koche, why do you look perplexed ls this deal with your permission father...mother has not even heard of it untill this moment...is'nt it mother ?
thrissur sub collector at present yes its an old affair, isn't it ?
when lchayan was doing his pre-degree she was doing her ba

no.l don't drink, not only infront of the bishops but also on the other occassions too.
this is like a... did you hear what i was saying ..
eappachan, i just thought to avoid hatred between two prominent fellows in the community but, you terribly insulted me
to know the value of this cassak its not enough to feed the poor with the money you earn through illicit liquour trade should own a hereditary like them
should have a genuine genus must have a dignified family status
at least, should be literate you are but too irreverant and outspoken.
my father was a wood cutter i was 9 years old, when my father was taken to jail for killing a ranger officer for molesting my mother
it was on my 10th birthday i received my father's body from the scaffold when i brought my father on the third day infront of this church
still i can see worms,that had in father's nose and mouth
that day bishops, wore like this attaire asked to take his body to rascal's graveyard.
that day i lost respect for this white dress of those who feed on other's sweat and travel in benz contessa
now to that my attitude is that you explained in english what is it ?
you noded your head when it was said lrre...reva ..irre irrevarance
irrevarance its true.. then feeding beggars on liquour trade ...that is also a story... after burrying mother in the left side of my father at the age of 11 when i reached in the forest crossing meenalichar to begin boot legginh

uniform have you studied it in the first standard mother, father, teacher, god- yes like that these abkaris are really gods for the police
we should fear them, respect them and piss urine when heartheir names .understand.-.sir.
most probably,minister ck will reach here a final round discussion after that we shall decide whether to kill or die.
don't be afraid, the intelligent abkari king still trust you, don't loose it.
there was a time for comrade balakrishan when you were in opposition
that time we supported your son,daughter son-in-law and others in abkari field,don't forget it..
i haven't forgotten anything whether you forget or not..today,from eranakulam to manjeshram you are no.1
eappan in south, finally we, who helped you lame as there is nowhere to place a foot.
either enforcement, or revenue intelligent or vigilance who ever may be we get eappachan's house raided on the eve of auction.
all amount collected for auction must be seized bank accounts must be freezed if possible we get eappan himself under custody.
i will give you 3 days more to get me back all that you have deceived from me
otherwise, there no men will be left in kunnel and kadayadi to stand like this.
forest guards will arrest them for shooting deers in reserved forests.
that...in news paper.... it will be in news paper,if does't report, we will report it with original photos.
our lady, let everything should be done properly didn't you go ?
no, annamma phonned to know whether i would reach there let me..then
simply, we need children near always as we grow older..isn't it ?

she is really a nuisance madam, always come for her flood relief.
they applied only after a week of the last date we fixed for application.
don't say so, we were in the hospital as my little son was hospitalised ...that's why...
do each one this office obey all rules of the government accurately i mean for each and every working day
how many of you reach at your table exactly at 10 am.
mr. k.p.prahaladan how much amount have you collecetd from her so far ?
come on you can say last week i sold quarter soverign ear ring of my daughter's daughter...for this sir, his favourite brand rum full bottle was bought for him
after finishing my work i could come only in the morning from thrissur so i directly came to the office i will comethat way
no i will come there so, you made big performance in the first day itself...isn't it ?
father would have liked you very much now if he had here now for your breath taking performance,
he was so lenian towards set up right he had asked about you on the day before he died
god promise it is'nt that... then what is it leader ?
3 ration cards, 2 kerosene permit another one is...revenue recovery of cattle loan please stay it for cow is dead but party will pay
there are hundreds of employees who lived for eappachyan in the bars and other liquour outlets.
then their families who stood with him in his misery their welfare..benefits you know ,company directly provides umbrella,bag, books,slate every thing to their school going children
the hospital founded by father for free medical aid and other charities...
he felt as if his family members were expelled when some one asked him to close all these charities.
pappichan, that scoundral chakochi doesn't doubt any of them,did't you hear his statement yesterday.
yes we are going to play a new game with that i told you about trap....trap.
this scoundral put fire to my house and got me tortured with exicise last month for selling some illicit liquour.
finally i had to eat six mangooses to stand like this.
i am not thankful to even my mother who gave me birth.
enough.. you aren't thankful you were revengeful for geting you in jail and puting fire on home.
you also should have remembrance this is under section 302 you should get me the agreed amount and acquittal from the case.
otherwise when i enter in the witness box.... stop it,you will be given your money when you come out on bail i will get it from you if you don't give it.
dysp, the police who went for search returned without any information.
give it to me, i have something to say hello, he hung up call the pappy again.
he didn't say which bastard among you stabbed my father from behind
beware this gun will be back to baby then your double heart won't enough to meet it
chakochi isn't going to come to any court to give evidence,statement or any case and game for another game.
whoever may be the persons who played with the blood with aanakattil eappachan
i will come after making a little recommendation come walk you swine..
i remembered it when you called me swine my cattle loan..revenue recovery..
although i accompined him i don't know for what he went there
but that day eappachyan came out as if he comes after a quarrel why didn't you inform us this earlier ?
but i can definitly say from what i could hear one, there was a conspiracy aganist eappachan under the leadership of minister balakrishan two,kadayadi's still have some financial liabilities towards eappachan
eappachan slapped ragavan and gave a final warning to them before he left
i need a little help when minister balakrishan makes secret visit to kadayadi's palace please inform me we are not in good terms now we belong to different groups in party ?
still if i get an indication i will inform him, he is our old cadre lsn't it boy ?
baby, remember what i said chakochi shouldn't know of my presence behind it, forever
even the number is correct where does lchayan get this news from ?
blood of both got evaporated, when the gun was just touched on the body.
i wasjust checking, whether had they enough boldness to stab father, although from back
you will do anything for kadayadis you will create false accused..right ?
you will do nasty things in my godown you will pimp your mother and sister if kadayadis ask for it, isn't it ?
so its a drama with the knowledge of lchayan and you..isn't it madam ?
look madam, i will mention in my report that you leaked the information of raid to him and the raid was made fruitless because of the r.d.o's action
get lost you... cassette i will get you beaten no..no... sir,
here is your cap, take this too otherwise you will have to beg before some one for matches.
you didn't say so far what you heard so princess is reluctant to understand things which directly explained.
speak it out sir,without beating around the bush, i will under stand.
but you may not understand even if you hear the time,when i had no money to pay college fee not even a garment to change the wearing one.
under a roof which was decayd by poverty and pride the time i decided to suicide with my father and sister.
but even if i try to help him with my official desigination as you did now, he will not accept it sir
he stands very high that even beyond your imagination i told you to stop and get out.
i have respect for you comrade what a heavy class analysis.
if a farmer who became bankrupt of rice, plants a cocunut in his field he becomes bourgeiose,land lord, orthodoxic..isn't it comrade ?
thought to insult me in my office infront of my party members
bloody rascal lf you think to fear me by saying your deceased father if you come here again for it you will get decayed in the coffine.
your greediness, that make you to lick the palm you put not only in jaggary pot but also in septic tank.
and if you again join with kadayadis chakochi will tear out publicly your pseudo socialistic,pseudo prolitarian ,pseudo philanthropic bamboosil your mask of a pseudo communist.
arears as kollem,and pathanamthitta were given to kk group i talked to the advocate, although there is no document except verbatim we can move aganist them no need.
however its an encumberance left by father so, it's a debt left on us father won't get peaceful rest in cemetary if we don't pay it.
father had earned much for us can't we be satisfied with it ?
let's stop..and let's also forget what they had done to our father lsn't it ?
chakochi i don't know, i don't know to forget like that.
chakochi too has a mind of aanakkattil eappachan, who has nevr forgiven to the destroyers chakochi too posseses the same mind of grand father whose hands never shook, while cuting one's neck
both of them will be there at the head of the company.
then as guide,well wisher,and chief strategist you will be there to weave strategies as the head...
there are some still in party leadership lovers of labours...honest fellows !
they will declare prize for my head if they come to know of it.
you can see, my chair will be taken away comrade, who is going to know that you joined in our partnership.
all these are leaked now, this too will be like that, its my experience.
no,we should fix that proposal for ammani which came from bharanaganam
marriage shall be held after father's death anniversery then, mother and kunjumol they will come with me to estate.
one day in the veranda of a shop when i got up startled
my mother was crushing me like this because of fix i slept silently closing eyes hardly.
in the morning i felt my mother's frozen hands, stiff like this... i was alone..when someone took away the dead body of my mother.
i knew only one way that time, the way to this big house where sufficient food is served at any time
say sunny, what is in chakochi's mind when he comes for auction tomorrow
to know it we should ask chakochi himself or to one,who knows his mind
aslam alekum va alekum uslam why are you here unusally ?
as you know,hussian needs to sit here when i am very happy or very sad of thinking past then only...
i will continue to do so until the advertising office becomes mine.
someone has rightly said, first acquire a status, then a wife.
i told you, he's making elaborate arrangements for the beauty show.
sir, you know, a lot of meetings are held for the preparations.
first, a meeting with the sponsors, then with the photographers, then, the models, and with the photographers again to talk of the models' meeting, and then with the sponsors to talk of the photographers' meeting!
and it's my boss who's doing the job with love and sincerity.
if a man keeps a daily account, then a lot of money can be saved.
popcorn for rs. 100, rs. 400 for petrol, rs. 200 for flowers...
rs. 10 for holding her hand and rs. 100 for flattering her beauty.
and if the bill for all this mounts to rs.500, then she gets a kiss free.
you are making such a big ad film and spending so extravagantly.
i say, why don't you take her for an outdoor shooting?
a film which a layman will watch and then buy my mangoes, thereby resulting in my income being more than the common man!
i can understand everything you say but right now, i have to meet somebody else.
it may be because i have never got a mother's love.
you are the only person whom i can call my friend.
rahul has got the office, and seema and i have got each other.
if seema and i are together today, then it's only because of you.
so, both of us have decided to give you this office.
i am sure that you will be very pleased to receive the keys of your new office from seema's hands.
the one who took the keys in a jiffy and didn't even think about you!
if he loved you even a little, he would have never accepted the office!
sir, you know, a lot of meetings are held for the preparations.
first, a meeting with the sponsors, then with the photographers, then, the models, and with the photographers again to talk of the models' meeting, and then with the sponsors to talk of the photographers' meeting!
and who else but me can fulfil this dream of hers?
i am leaving. i have a meeting with her in half an hour's time.
rs. 200 for flowers rs. 100 for roaming with the girl for half an hour.
rs. 10 for holding her hand and rs. 100 for flattering her beauty.
and if the bill for all this mounts to rs.500, then she gets a kiss free.
should i give it to you now or should i wrap it?
this business will come to an end, and so will this life, right?
the luxuries will cease to exist and this office will be finished, right?
in this world, if you speak the truth softly, then none will heed you.
and if you scream and shout a lie, then everybody listens!
this is the first time that a girl is not coming into my clutches.
you are making such a big ad film and spending so extravagantly.
i say, why don't you take her for an outdoor shooting?
she will be in front of your eyes for 24 hours.
if seema and i are together today, then it's only because of you.
so, both of us have decided to give you this office.
i am sure that you will be very pleased to receive the keys of your new office from seema's hands.
but seema will be more pleased to give them to you.
the fault lies with people like him who should be punished.
being a woman and a mother, i accept you as my daughter-in-law.
no. i only remember your scooter, the diary and the flowers worth rs.200.
but watch, someday, i will bring you a mercedes like this.
i want to share with you a line from one of my unproduced plays.
""the amazing thing about a parent"s love is that something so large...
i"li tell you all about it when i see you, but....
what we"re going to do is we"re going to bring him back to the hotel in san francisco tonight.
i should"ve been the one to go after him at the first place.
i wanted to give him a chance to come home on his own.
and lighten up and take that pickle out of your butt.
listen, it"s not enough to love him you must show him you love him.
he lied to me because he wanted me to feel good, and i did.
just the idea of being somebody"s father made me feel wonderful.
all i'm saying is, are you gonna be ok with him if i leave you?
well, i'm a lot more capable than you think i am.
that would be the fire and the enormous gasoline explosion, both occurring in the middle of the night?
the fact that they occurred in the middle of the night, that's, uh, coincidence.
on the way downtown, we drop my dog off at the vet.
so, we go to the circus and we have a great time.
i am so upset because i want to have kids with you someday, and what if this was our son?
would you give up on him because he was so annoying?
i should have been the one to go after him in the first place.
no, i just--i wanted to give him a chance to come home on his own, and he didn't.
that way he'll be sprawled out on the floor when you come back.
all i'm saying is, are you gonna be ok with him if i leave you?
that would be the fire and the enormous gasoline explosion, both occurring in the middle of the night?
the fact that they occurred in the middle of the night, that's, uh, coincidence.

so, we go to the circus and we have a great time.
i am so upset because i want to have kids with you someday, and what if this was our son?
would you give up on him because he was so annoying?
it wouldn't have mattered if he was as sober as me in those conditions.
listen, andy, if anybody should feel bad, it should be me.
doesn't look like a girl who'd cause too much of a problem.
might even be able to turn it to my own advantage.
he'd the sense to get out and make a go of it in civvy street.
doesn't take much sense when it's that or a court martial.
hey, how come the likes of you get invited to one of lord snooty's weekends?
everybody wants a bookmaker for a friend, you should know that.
i wouldn't interfere in any case you didn't want me to.
thought i'd pop in now and then to make sure you're ok.
our lads may not be very hot on spit and polish, but we're very sharp on deep-down dirt.
you left your mark on the bathroom mat and the bathroom mat left its mark on you.
piece of piss, as long as you had money to jangle.
we went on a 24-hour bender - and i mean bender - all over the shop, booze and bonk all the way.
she'd seen her boyfriend "get a wad from this old fart".
she knew he kept a spare key in his shed and we waited there.
that was to be our link to the whole drug chain.
we need the big boys who get it on to the street.
but don't worry about the spelling, son, or it'll take all night.
.. can you manage without me until the dawn's fair light?
it wouldn't have mattered if he was as sober as me in those conditions.
listen, andy, if anybody should feel bad, it should be me.
doesn't look like a girl who'd cause too much of a problem.
might even be able to turn it to my own advantage.
hey, how come the likes of you get invited to one of lord snooty's weekends?
everybody wants a bookmaker for a friend, you should know that.
i wouldn't interfere in any case you didn't want me to.
thought i'd pop in now and then to make sure you're ok.
that he was a soldier is all i can be sure of.
he may not have been ready for inspection but he was in uniform.
but that's all it is with you, lance corporal - surface bull.
our lads may not be very hot on spit and polish, but we're very sharp on deep-down dirt.
and all smudged mascara, but eyes on the look-out for a better mark.
piece of piss, as long as you had money to jangle.
that was to be our link to the whole drug chain.
we need the big boys who get it on to the street.
students had access to the building, maybe one of 'em did it.
i'd like to go with the nearest and dearest, her brother matthew.
i wanna talk to all the people at her house last night.
here we go with that "l" business again, "i want this, i want that."
you know what i mean, like... it was all for a purpose...
the months of desk work and ordering pizzas and answering phones, waiting for the gun test, waiting to get my badge back.
she was trying to tell me what's art and what's not.
she's your teacher, maybe she was just trying to school your young ass?
look, i don't need some rich white lady telling me what to paint.
cos she's got lots of art in her house means she knows more than me?
my father had this ring made at bromwell brown in 1961.
three diamonds, one from each of my grandmother's engagement rings plus my mother's diamonds set in 18-carat gold.
we're assessing your sister's state of mind, it might lead somewhere.
we know that you and your sister disagreed about the inheritance from your mother.
how can you be sure the ring was still on her?
if some tough kid knocked her off, don't you think he'd have taken her ring?
if we find the ring in his possession, we got him.
munch is still at evidence control and so far nothing's come up.
course not, bridgewell's just putting on a show, he's always had it.
you think one of the richest men in baltimore's gonna kill his sister over a lousy diamond ring?
even if we go to trial, you'll never get a conviction.
so, if you'll excuse us, my client and i are leaving.
but not jewellery, that's evidence, a cop won't mess with evidence.
in a case last month, the parents were looking for the daughter's bracelet.
i don't know, same reporting officer, someone from the me's lab?
so what makes you so sure it's one of my crew?
jeff mcginn will testify that he took the ring off the dead woman's hand.
plus the dna evidence of the scratches, we'll take it to trial, see where it goes.
matthew bridgewell's fate is in the hands of the maryland state judicial system.
we've taken care of the order, the law is up to danvers.
no, no, no, no, they just won't let you do anything that's worth doing!
no, no, they are afraid that people like us are going to take over!
oh, no, no, i knew you were going to do that.
i knew that you were going to trot out the eugenics war.
that's what dr. loews thought when she first came to the institute.
she got permission to separate them from the other residents so that she could work with them.
if people like them are allowed to compete freely then parents would feel pressured to have their children enhanced so they could keep up.
that's precisely what prompted the ban on dna resequencing in the first place.
besides, it's not as if we're trying to exclude them from anything.
we're just... talking about... you know, limiting what they're allowed to do.
miles... i wonder if you could find out what's making that noise.
i know you can't hear it, but it's there-- probably a sympathetic vibration in the power coupling or something.
starfleet has decided to listen to what damar has to say.
he and weyoun will be arriving in the morning and i am the lucky one who gets the chance to sit across the table from them.
i wouldn't be surprised if they were just stalling for time in order to regroup.
sir, is there any chance i can get a transcript of the negotiations?
nothing on the first planet but some simple protozoids and tri-nucleic fungi.
the second planet has some cormaline deposits but they're common enough.
that's why the dominion wants the kabrel system so that they can manufacture the drug right here in the alpha quadrant.
according to our calculations they'll be able to manufacture enough to supply the jem'hadar indefinitely.
according to our analysis-- there it is-- they'll vote to abandon their nonaggression pact with the dominion at next year's plenary session.
by which time, internal pressures between the cardassians and the dominion will have erupted and after three years six months and 27 days, we predict that, uh...
two days ago, you said these people were impossible to deal with.
now they're turning out projections that it would take starfleet intelligence months to come up with.
we're not exactly qualified for this kind of work and it could be said that, uh...
it is beyond the limits of what people like us should be allowed to do.
even if something unlikely were to happen tilting the scales in our favor-- such as an anti-dominion coup on cardassia-- we'll still lose this war.
but that doesn't mean we just give up and roll over.
the alpha quadrant will unite and a new, stronger federation will rule for thousands of years.
but since we can't win this war why don't we save as many lives as we can?
if you want me to take you through the equations i will.
even if i knew with a hundred percent certainty what was going to happen i wouldn't ask an entire generation of people to voluntarily give up their freedom.
all i'm saying is that you have to look at the bigger picture.
well, i'm trying, but maybe i'm too uncomplicated to see it properly.
do you know what the dominion could do with this information?
they could take the alpha quadrant in a matter of weeks.
it's one thing for us to try and avert a war but it's quite another for us to take it on ourselves to trigger an invasion that's going to get a lot of people killed.
it's not our place to decide who lives and who dies.
it should be clear to you by now that no one is irreplaceable.
now... i just received a very interesting message from an unidentified party claiming to have some information that could be very beneficial to us.
i've seen the way you look at him when you think no one's watching.
i know how much you care but if you don't help me stop them you know what's going to happen?
believe me i wouldn't mind if our predictions turned out to be wrong.
jack's still furious, but... i didn't want to leave without saying good-bye.
what kind of enhancements did your parents have done to you?
mental abilities, mostly, but they had my hand-eye coordination, reflexes and vision improved as well.
she also hoped one day they could live on their own and be productive.
if they are too productive they'll make the rest of us look bad.
mizainite deposits on holna iv could keep their shipyards running for years.
typical dominion strategy - give up something valuable to get something even more valuable in the long term.
they want the kabrel system to make it here in the alpha quadrant.
we calculate that they'll be able to supply the jem'hadar indefinitely.
according to our analyses they'll abandon their non-aggression pact with the dominion.
internal pressures between cardassia and the dominion will have erupted, and after three years, six months and 27 days, we predict...
i know we're not qualified for this work, and it could be said that it is beyond the limits of what people like us should be allowed to do.
but i think if you allow me to walk you through our analyses, you'll be impressed.
the way our statistical analysis works, the further into the future, the more accurate it is.
it's based on non-linear dynamics - small fluctuations factor out in time.
starfleet command might do all right to take them on as a team of advisers.
i can't imagine them with a bunch of admirals, except to dance with them.
but that doesn't mean we just give up and roll over.
but if we fight there will be over 900 billion casualties.
all i'm saying is, you have to look at the bigger picture.
i'm trying, but maybe i'm too uncomplicated to see it properly.
i've seen the way you look at him when you think no one's watching.
i know how much you care, but if you don't help me stop them you know what's going to happen?
they want to find out what makes our genetically engineered brains tick.
they're going to cut our heads open and see what comes out!
dr. bashir is going to work with you for a while, that's all.
just think of it as a little vacation from the institute.
that's what dr. loews thought when she first came to the institute.
she got permission to separate them from the other residents so that she could work with them.
if people like them are allowed to compete freely then parents would feel pressured to have their children enhanced so they could keep up.
that's precisely what prompted the ban on dna resequencing in the first place.
besides, it's not as if we're trying to exclude them from anything.
we're just... talking about... you know, limiting what they're allowed to do.
damar is the pretender to the throne, and ziyal is the innocent princess he murdered.
and now the pretender is wracked with guilt over what he's done.
i don't know, but they're willing to give up a lot to get it.
the mizainite deposits on holna iv alone are enough to keep their shipyards running for years.
it shows how you can break down tri-nucleic fungus to make yridium bicantizine one of the active ingredients in ketracel-white.
that's why the dominion wants the kabrel system so that they can manufacture the drug right here in the alpha quadrant.
according to our calculations they'll be able to manufacture enough to supply the jem'hadar indefinitely.
i was going to recommend that the federation accept the proposed border.
it is beyond the limits of what people like us should be allowed to do.
but i think if you allow me to walk you through our analyses you'll be impressed.
the way our statistical analysis works the further into the future you go the more accurate the projection.
it's based on a kind of nonlinear dynamics whereby small fluctuations tend to factor out over time.
even if something unlikely were to happen tilting the scales in our favor-- such as an anti-dominion coup on cardassia-- we'll still lose this war.
but that doesn't mean we just give up and roll over.
the alpha quadrant will unite and a new, stronger federation will rule for thousands of years.

even if i knew with a hundred percent certainty what was going to happen

kayson made it sound like she wasn't excluded for medical reasons.
we do the operation, and assuming she doesn't die for lack of care she's in a state home in two years.
and her mother's adamant she not end up in a home.
those are logical reasons we give ourselves so we can sleep at night.
louise can make people smile, she can laugh and cry and hold someone.

the diffuse abdominal pain is probably due to congestion in the liver.
dr. kayson tells me that she was denied access to the unos list.
kayson wanted to, so it doesn't look like she was excluded for medical reasons.
how will she adhere to the rigors of the post-transplant regime?
her mother will give her her meds, get her where she needs to go.
and her mother's adamant she not end up in a home.
those are all bureaucratic, perfectly logical reasons we give ourselves so that we can sleep at night.
if she never grew a day older i would still cherish every moment we've spent together.
it's not our place to decide whether louise lives or dies.

you can do what you want, say what you want, be what you want.
if you marry, everything you own will become the property of your husband.

a man can get his hopes up pretty high pretty quick
it's of the utmost importance that we're not seen together in public... over these next few days.
i have a reputation to protect, not just for myself, but for others.
you'll have to excuse me, mrs.hurst. i'm afraid i don't know the steps.
none of us know the steps, mr.godwin. that's the fun of it.
if you harm so much as one hair on her head...
do you think i, of all people, would ever hurt her?
guess i'll be doing something like this again one of these days.
is it anything i can fix... like my dress or how i talk?
you will obey me because, poor as i am, i am placed in authority over you.
you will not speak disrespectfully to me or raise your voice to me.

i think that a large part of marriage is simply accepting each other.
i think a lot of it just boils down to sticking it out, going through it together.
maybe it's a bit outside the range of your personal experience.
how much do you know about the range of my personal experience?
this dr burman, does he really know what he's talking about?
you know, his t-cell count is so low that no dr burman or anybody else can really save him.
i know you see me as an old prude, but it's part of a mother's job to come across that way.
though i do admit maybe i went a bit too far.
i question their motives because personally i don't think sex can be portrayed.
i think the real sensations, the real emotions, go way beyond what can be put on film.
you can have them three times a day for the next month.

sweetie, if, in the past, i felt that danny needed a little more attention than you or your father, there were reasons.
when it comes down to it, i think i just like an old romantic comedy.
me, too i just love romance you know, like the old mgm musicals
i think the real sensations, the real emotions, go way beyond what can be put on film.

look, the king and his daughter are only here for 72 hours.
there's a dinner party at senator franklin's house tonight, a tour of washington tomorrow, and on saturday, the nato ball, where her father hopefully will announce that he wants his country to join nato.
the secret service limo will pick you up at 1700 sharp.
i thought maybe you could, you know, give me a few tips.
see if you could keep me from falling all over myself.
no, i didn't mean to imply that you can't get a date,
i just figured that you don't go out much because you're really, really choosy.
it's just, i was so worried about saying the wrong thing that i couldn't find the words.
correct me if i'm wrong, but the last time you saw ensign sims, she kissed you.
actually, vartan has been spending his time helping my daughter make what has proven to be a rather difficult transition.
well, it's hard to be regal when people are shooting at you, father.
she's already been thrown out of three swiss boarding schools, and last spring, she even tried to elope with her bodyguard.
some people feel that i've failed in my duties as a father.
i could take pictures of my place and use it for yours.
i'd just have to watch the up angles to avoid the rafters.
well, i suppose i don't have to yet, and i hope i never do.
but reality says that one day, when my father is gone, i'll be queen.
well, it's not so much what i did, but what i heard.
minister kepish told father that he believes someone on the royal staff is with the hardliners.
well, not exactly, but i'm really not safe at the residence.
oh, but you're safe crossing half of washington in the middle of the night?
i just took the heloise gig to get onto the post.
press passes to the nato ball are scarcer than cuban cigars.
you can't ask me out on purpose, but you can ask her out by accident?
you were mad at me and she laughed at one of my jokes.
when i saw you at jag, it was like eating mexican food.
you know how your heart gets all tingly and you can't catch your breath because your whole body feels like it's on fire?
ladies and gentlemen, we are most grateful for the warm-hearted welcome that you have extended to us, and we would like to express our gratitude to the united states for the great honour that it has bestowed upon our country.

there, with fellow jag lawyer, major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
well, it's hard to be regal when people are shooting at you, father.
hopefully, now that we are guests of the united states, such a tragedy will not be repeated.
some people feel that i've failed in my duties as a father.
oh, i'm sure you did the best job you could, your majesty.
you know, clay, she may be a spoiled kid, but she's not stupid.
i mean, she's probably fine, and she'll be back before you know it.
alexi told me earlier that minister kepish suspected one of the hard-liners on their staff.
kepish is trying to talk the king into skipping the ball and going home.
i just took the heloise gig to get on to the post.

it took 56 hours, but the assassin in brussels finally named names.
and at the top of the list were novac and minister kepish.
it has taken 50 years for romania to move out from under the shadow of domination into the sunlight of free nations.
to accomplish this, we welcome the help of freedom-loving nations everywhere.
you'll have to forgive me if i'm nervous, but i'm still new at speaking in public.
it is a skill that i intend to master, starting now.
you know, a cousin that all the boys like best because she's such fun.
boys like jimmy miller, who showed mandy his baseball cards and played keep away with little marcy's undershirt.
well, actually, it was a home-run ball, but, you know, no big deal.
he's been trying to catch one of those his whole life.
because when i see marcy in her pyjamas, i'll have a seizure.
on my way to the hospital, between the blaring of the sirens and the paramedics yelling "clear," maybe then i can get some sleep.
you are never gonna get that big, stupid thing in here.
that's what i said when i carried you over the threshold.
- carried you back to her cabin and gave you a massage.
and before you knew it you were a love slave in an all-girl sex cult.
well, for starters, she never blew her nose in my pyjama top.
i know i'm not perfect, but i do have some good qualities.
i would wait for a burglar but, well, criminals, they can't be trusted, can they?
so you want me to come round to your house and steal it?
no, no, we will steal it together, and it's got to be from here because we are not insured at home at the moment, not after the second explosion.
it's got to be taken from a locked cupboard in order to get the insurance money...
you've got to tell mr brittas if you don't want to jump.
no, because he'll tell gavin, and gavin is so tough he'll just have complete contempt for me, he'll never talk to me again!
i tell a lie, 7, one fell off watching a mad woman in her nightie.
i suspect you're at the bottom of all this, get on the phone to this awful company and tell them...
entirely due to this centre, we have had to set the highest council rate in the country, twice liverpool's!
i give you permission to seek your own sponsorship, you come up with your own ideas and what hap...
then, i follow the trail of manure to this very building and i find you here, helen.
now look, i know you're a troubled woman, but writing rude messages on walls with manure is not the answer.
i was reading in the paper, they don't use forceps anymore, they use suction on the baby's head.
i thought we might have a go with one of these.
that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me since the last nicest thing anyone's ever said to me.
i'm honoured julie, but the credit has to go to carole, she asserted herself.
i know i did, but i don't know how mr brittas, because it's all gone, my assertiveness.
i think it was the baby coming, you've wasted all your money on that training,
you know, i really hope this thing works out with my brother.
although it's been years since i've seen him and i don't even know if we're anything alike.
i mean, i haven't even begun to scratch the surface on this whole apartment thing.
i mean, you got eric who hasn't been on his own at all, and then you got two brothers who haven't seen each other in years, all sharing a single bathroom.
although the apartment doesn't have the charm of the place i used to live in.
i do like the idea of being able to take a shower without worrying about whether a twister is going to suck me naked through the roof.
but, you know, cory's my best friend, and i trust that he's not going to make me look bad.
my vision is to show people a side of shawn hunter that they have never seen before.
and now that i've found something that i'm good at, it's like the pressure's off.
cory, why can't you just put down your camera and realize that your friend is in trouble?
see, she doesn't understand that the guy behind the camera has to stay behind the camera and not get emotionally involved.
even though this means that shawn and his new brother may not be getting along.
because i know you to be a sensitive and caring young person.
and i'll be very interested in seeing how your story turns out.
when i was 12, cory and i went to a phillies game.
my father gave me just enough money for two hot dogs, so, you know, i went and i bought two hot dogs.
but i kept writing to him because he was my brother.
and i must have sent him, like, 15 letters, and i never got a single thing back.
i do not want my son brought up by some 1 8-year-old bimbo who can't get a proper job.
everybody we know's got a nanny and they're quite happy with them.
look, there isn't really any damage, but maybe we should swap phone numbers.
you know, just in case you want to get in touch with your insurance.
(mimics) i shall be on the next plane home to denmark.
bruce, what's the difference between an au pair and a nanny?
that's what's so great about rachel, i'm doing stuff i've never tried before.
oh, god, he's going to tell us about his sex life.
♪ aii this will be finished by the time i do
♪ just the thought of you makes me stop just before i begin
you're happy, are you, if josh grows up thinking of someone else as his mummy?
he'll know who his mummy is, though you're so rarely there he could be forgiven for thinking it's a one-parent family.
i went to his salon to have hair cut, so i gave him a ride.
do you want me to do the hair for the girl?
i know, do you want me to eat with your concubine?
no, i want you to meet her at six at stanley police station.
wai asked me to have a cup of coffee i left it there accidentally.
then you massaged her and asked her to go to bed with you, right?
we thought we'd keep you awake for a while, bring a doctor in
and have him explain to the press that you just need a nap.
i just wanted to pick up some t.p. for la casa.
i didn't know we were allowed to take toilet paper home.
if you have to cheat on her it won't be with me.
what a pity really, what a pity we could've had some beautiful moment, really intense.
if you didn't love me we wouldn't see each other 3 times a week you wouldn't look at me like you do you wouldn't be so available.
you think you're decent becaue you won't make love to me.
for me it'd be logical that you were you might be in the arms of another man.
i'm afraid that you fall in love with him, that you leave me.
-no and he left me alone... came back at 10 o clock...
he started lying, saying his dad had ask him to help him move i asked him if she liked the present i left him breathless...
when we make love a part of me thinks about her.
what i'm stealing for her i will have to take it back.
unfortunately, i have a life, a wife and a kid and it's impossible for me to throw it all away.
then i say, let's start on new rules something new, something concrete.
i wish you come to the phone every time it rings.
i called you several times, but i didn't leave a message.
'there's no one that wants to catch malia's killer more than we do.
'we're doing all we can to ensure the murderer is brought to justice.'
'we've set up a hotline for information on the murder of malia brierre...
we'll be bombarded with calls from every fool from here to port-au-prince.
if the guilt of this murder lies within your family, and you went to lawyers, and they told you do nothing, say nothing, then your lawyers were right.
but if fear of scandal and exposure sent you to the lawyers, then i have to tell you, you made the worst move possible.
i was hurt, of course, and then angry, and then incredibly sorry for myself.
but my first instinct when he told me was to call our lawyers.
you and i both know how the system treats black men.
i will not have him made to look like he's guilty of murder for lack of a better suspect.
¶ his hand is on my knee, his hand is on my thigh
¶ his hand is on my arm, his hands are covering my eyes ¶
"but malia, when i see you when we pass in the hall,
"when we're alone in a room, i can't say these things.
then later that night, at the benefit, malia showed up at the hotel?
er... on my way to the bathroom, i saw her get off the elevator, hysterical.
you asked me to meet you at the old courtyard, and if that's not nostalgic, i don't know what is.
well, that kid was ready to throw a rock through your mother's window.
i would like you to shut up for a second and look at me.
you know, not past me or through me, but at me.
usac intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around neptune.
the source of this transmission has been identified as the event horizon.
so if justin was sucked through, he's been wherever the event horizon's been.
theoretically, yes, but i told you, the gateway can't just open.
peters, we've got to find out what happened to the other crew before it happens to us.
i can work on the bridge, but i won't go back to medical.
she tore a hole in our universe... a gateway to another dimension... a dimension of pure chaos... pure evil.
when she crossed over, she was just a ship, but when she came back... she was alive.
doctor, if you'll just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tanks, we're almost underway.
that bunk better be squared away, mr cooper, or you'll find yourself walking to neptune.
everything i'm about to tell you is considered code black by the nsa.
u.s.a.c. intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around neptune.
right, well, using layman's terms, we use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons.
these in turn fold space-time, consistent with weyl tensor dynamics, until the space-time curvature becomes infinitely large and you produce a singularity.
so that point "a" and point "b" co-exist in the same space and time.
when the spacecraft passes through the gateway, space returns to normal.
i'm saying that this ship is reacting to us and the reactions are getting stronger.
it's as if the ship brought back something with it, a life force of some kind.
you wanted an answer, and it's the only one i've got.
no, what i want, lieutenant, is to survive the next 10 hours.

there's considerable sympathy for babylon 5... among the alien governments and here at home.
so those are the areas being targeted in the new program.
i should tell you, the centaurum met this morning... to discuss choosing a new emperor.
with all the recent problems, they voted to postpone any decisions for a while... so they could choose more wisely this time.
i just wanted to tell you because you got a right to know.
we all went through hell together, and whether you realize it or not... we're all damn lucky to be alive.
the war was about finding our own way and making our own choices.
if you won't let me do that... if i can't carve out just a little bit of happiness for myself... then i have to ask:
now, check this display as soon as you come on duty.
this way you'll get your updates on who to hold and who to let through.
well, didn't think we'd be seeing you again anytime soon, ambassador.
yes, i gathered that from the look of unvarnished joy on your face when you saw me.
after that, i want you to find lyta alexander and escort her to the conference room.
we're meeting with bester in about an hour, and i wanna be sure we're not scanned.
any ship found violating these rules will be seized... with both crews and passengers subject to arrest.
the president took this action in response to reports... from the ministries of peace and security... detailing possible terrorist threats emanating from babylon 5.
the president will release information regarding these threats at a later date.
once again, all travel between earth and babylon 5... is now forbidden by law.
look, lyta, you gotta understand... you were close to the vorlons, and they're not exactly popular right now.
and then, there's a rumor going around that before they left, they changed you... made some modifications.
now that he's lost his allies among the shadows... the president is worried about what you might do next.
he knows you'll come after him sooner or later... so he's making a preemptive strike.
we're gonna have to have more information before we try this.
information or not, i don't think you should go back there again.
president clark has ordered the earthforce base in sector 49... to keep a squadron of starfuries on patrol beside the local jumpgate.
sector 49 is the last stopover point... for ships traveling from earth to babylon 5.
they've been told to challenge any ship coming through the gate.
what they don't know is that a black omega squadron... an elite attack force attached to psi corps... and answerable only to president clark... has been dispatched in heavily armed transports.
their mission is to jump out and destroy the security patrol before they can react... then leave behind evidence indicating that babylon 5... was responsible for the attack.
blaming you for the unprovoked murder of our pilots... will help get the military and public opinion back on clark's side.
save the earthforce patrol, and continue the blockade of babylon 5.
let them be destroyed, and you'll be framed for murder... and lose sympathy back home.
when i gave them the orders, i looked in their eyes and...
it's... a hard thing... to send people in to die... when you're the one pulling the trigger.
- you know, i was just thinking about... the timing of that evacuation at z'ha'dum.
and then i remembered what ivanova told me... that when the three of you went to z'ha'dum to find me... the shadows picked up on your telepathic signal.
now, those sensors were probably left behind when the shadows went away.
if someone who knew they were there... began sending a telepathic probe the moment we hit hyperspace... it might just be enough to set off the destruct sequence.
maybe because there's leftover commands from the vorlons i haven't recognized yet.
maybe because what's left on z'ha'dum can't fall into anyone's hands... for any reason.
he has sent away so many loved ones, he deserves to find out how it feels... to lose someone he cares about.
and i wouldn't have been told because he could scan me.
because as much as i may agree with your reasons... might even have supported the decision if this were to happen again... if a command-level decision were made without consulting me...
i would turn you over to the psi corps and let them turn you inside out.
if clark wants to shut down babylon 5 why not just send in the troops?
they tried that last year when they turned back our ships.
so those are the areas being targeted in the new program.
the goal is to knock the pins out from under them then move in when they're vulnerable.
i should tell you, the centaurum met this morning to discuss choosing a new emperor.
with all the recent problems, they voted to postpone any decisions for a while so they could choose more wisely this time.
this isn't easy for me, and i imagine it'll be a pain for everybody else, but...
there's no easy way to get to it, so i'll say it.
it's time for me to try and find a life for myself.
the war was about finding our own way and making our own choices.
and if we don't rotate our people regularly, they'll get burned out.
now, check this display as soon as you come on duty.
and would i fall under the category of unusual, mr. allan?
well, didn't think we'd be seeing you again anytime soon, ambassador.
yes, i gathered that from the look of unvarnished joy on your face.
perhaps you'd like to sit down before you are overcome by ecstasy.
mr. allan said i would only be allowed back onto babylon 5 over his dead body." with my very busy schedule i can only accommodate so many requests.
i know it is a burden, but you will simply have to wait your turn.
after that, find lyta alexander and escort her to the conference room.

he knows you'll come after him sooner or later so he's making a preemptive strike.
he wants to destroy your credibility undermine your position back home and among the alien governments.
the organic technology used in the wetware is beyond anything we've ever come across.
i've put them back into cryogenic suspension until we can figure it out.

if you won't let me do that if i can't carve out just a little bit of happiness for myself then i have to ask:
now, check this display as soon as you come on duty.
you'll get your updates on who to hold and who to let through.
well, didn't think we'd be seeing you again anytime soon, ambassador.
yes, i gathered that from the look of unvarnished joy on your face.
i know it is a burden, but you will simply have to wait your turn.
the only reason that guy is still alive is that half the time i don't know what he's talking about.
through your friendship, you became the one thing outside my own people that i could care enough about to risk being captured and in so doing, helped me serve my people more than i had dreamed possible.
you have a very weird way of looking at the universe, g'kar but i kind of like it.

the president's action was in response to reports from the ministries of peace and security detailing possible terrorist threats emanating from babylon 5.
the president will release information regarding these threats at a later date.
while i was at the academy i interned with the psi cops as a field assistant.
they're trained to make others nervous, but bester makes even other psi cops nervous.
look, lyta, you gotta understand you were close to the vorlons, and they're not exactly popular right now.
and there's a rumor going around that before they left, they changed you made some modifications.
now that he's lost his allies among the shadows the president is worried about what you might do.
he knows you'll come after him sooner or later so he's making a preemptive strike.
even though z'ha'dum's been abandoned we don't know what they left behind.
we're gonna have to have more information before we try this.
sector 49 is the last stopover point for ships traveling from earth to babylon 5.
they've been told to challenge any ship coming through the gate.
what they don't know is that a black omega squadron an elite attack force attached to psi corps and answerable only to president clark has been dispatched in heavily armed transports.
their mission is to jump out and destroy the security patrol before they can react then leave behind evidence indicating that babylon 5 was responsible for the attack.
blaming you for the unprovoked murder of our pilots will help get the military and public opinion back on clark's side.
you'll have to send a team to intercept the squadron immediately or it'll be too late.
when i got the emergency codes to lock down the station i made sure to put them someplace safe.
why is it that someplace safe is always the one place you can never remember later?
you're one of these people who will pick up a rope that's tangled up and spend an entire day untangling it because it's a challenge, because it defies your sense of order in the universe and because you can.
sometimes i try to picture you sitting on a beach with absolutely nothing to do.
i thought you were supposed to be the bad guys here.
well, let's just say that reports of our disloyalty have been greatly exaggerated.
just a confused, frightened child who's run away and needs to be reminded where home is.
lyta remember, i know things about you you wouldn't want anyone else to know.
when i gave them the orders, i looked in their eyes and...
it's a hard thing to send people in to die when you're the one pulling the trigger.
- you know, i was just thinking about the timing of that evacuation at z'ha'dum.
and then i remembered what lvanova told me that when the three of you went to z'ha'dum to find me the shadows picked up on your telepathic signal.
now, those sensors were probably left behind when the shadows went away.
if someone who knew they were there began sending a telepathic probe the moment we hit hyperspace it might just be enough to set off the destruct sequence.
maybe because there's leftover commands from the vorlons i haven't recognized yet.
maybe because what's left on z'ha'dum can't fall into anyone's hands for any reason.
he has sent away so many loved ones, he deserves to find out how it feels to lose someone he cares about.
and i wouldn't have been told because he could scan me.
if clark wants to shut down babylon 5 why not just send in the troops?
they tried that last year when they turned back our ships.
so those are the areas being targeted in the new program.
the goal is to knock the pins out from under them then move in when they're vulnerable.
i should tell you, the centaurum met this morning to discuss choosing a new emperor.
with all the recent problems, they voted to postpone any decisions for a while so they could choose more wisely this time.
i just wanted to tell you because you got a right to know.

this isn't easy for me, and i imagine it'll be a pain for everybody else, but...
there's no easy way to get to it, so i'll say it.
it's time for me to try and find a life for myself.
the war was about finding our own way and making our own choices.
and if we don't rotate our people regularly, they'll get burned out.
now, check this display as soon as you come on duty.
and would i fall under the category of unusual, mr. allan?
well, didn't think we'd be seeing you again anytime soon, ambassador.
yes, i gathered that from the look of unvarnished joy on your face.
perhaps you'd like to sit down before you are overcome by ecstasy.
mr. allan said i would only be allowed back onto babylon 5 over his dead body." with my very busy schedule i can only accommodate so many requests.
i know it is a burden, but you will simply have to wait your turn.
after that, find lyta alexander and escort her to the conference room.
we're meeting with bester in an hour, and i wanna be sure we're not scanned.
any ship found violating these rules will be seized with both crews and passengers subject to arrest.

once again, all travel between earth and babylon 5 is now forbidden by law.
and i could nail your head to the table, set fire to it and feed your charred remains to the pak'ma'ra.
but it's an imperfect world, and we never get exactly what we want.
he knows you'll come after him sooner or later so he's making a preemptive strike.
he wants to destroy your credibility undermine your position back home and among the alien governments.
the organic technology used in the wetware is beyond anything we've ever come across.
i've put them back into cryogenic suspension until we can figure it out.
we're gonna have to have more information before we try this.
information or not, i don't think you should go back there again.
president clark has ordered the earthforce base in sector 49 to keep a squadron of starfuries on patrol beside the local jumpgate.
sector 49 is the last stopover point for ships traveling from earth to babylon 5.
they've been told to challenge any ship coming through the gate.
what they don't know is that a black omega squadron an elite attack force attached to psi corps and answerable only to president clark has been dispatched in heavily armed transports.
their mission is to jump out and destroy the security patrol before they can react then leave behind evidence indicating that babylon 5 was responsible for the attack.
blaming you for the unprovoked murder of our pilots will help get the military and public opinion back on clark's side.
save the earthforce patrol, and continue the blockade of babylon 5.
let them be destroyed, and you'll be framed for murder and lose sympathy back home.
and then i remembered what lvanova told me that when the three of you went to z'ha'dum to find me the shadows picked up on your telepathic signal.
now, those sensors were probably left behind when the shadows went away.
if someone who knew they were there began sending a telepathic probe the moment we hit hyperspace it might just be enough to set off the destruct sequence.
of course, it would take a very powerful telepath to send a signal that far ahead.
maybe because he hurt so many of my people, he deserves to be hurt in response.
he has sent away so many loved ones, he deserves to find out how it feels to lose someone he cares about.
larry, have you ever had a woman... you know, any woman...
that had such a... strange power over you that, uh, she scrambled your brains to make you so hot that all you can do is think with your dick?
i don't know if we've ever talked about this, but, um,
i knew television was in deep, deep trouble the day they took c.p.o. sharkey off the air.
why don't we... why don't we have dinner on the terrace and watch the boats?
well, uh, please not tonight, unless they're planning to open fire on each other.
you're fine the first couple of days, and then everything seems to go wrong.
and it happens every time we're together more than 3 or 4 days.
i've decided to leave for the city, form a new circus.
if i have my revenge, i'll lose veronika and my grandson.
the inn's sitting there snug as an arse on a nightpot.
it sank a bit, but we can still live in it.
dad says a man shot by the guards is a hero.
may you be remembered, matous... ln the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost.
the inn's sitting there snug as an arse on a nightpot.
it sank a bit, but we can still live in it.
we thank you that this flat earth will soon link up with the sea into one globe and the thousand years of peace will begin for the six of us living here.
in spring we'll have to sow on your land too, now that there'll be three of us.
you don't want to marry goran, nor make love with me!
if you were to carry my child, there would be no wedding.
blessed mary, now i'm alone by your will, at least bless veronika.
i took charge of you as an orphan, and i shall do so again.
a man is like a child, a woman must handle him right.
some fall for tears, some for sighs, sometimes a smile will do it.
i've decided to leave for the city, form a new circus.
if i have my revenge, i'll lose veronika and my grandson.
yeah, but, topanga, this is the woman of his dreams, okay?
the woman he could spend the rest of his life with.
hey, i know you guys are busy, so i'm going to get right to this.
thanksgiving is the most important day of the year to me.
i was in the sandbox with topanga, and then she started going after joey hutchinson.
i don't have to tell you how that made me feel.
shawn, you said you want to be like me and topanga.
well, me and topanga go to barelli's because barelli's is the place where dreams come true.
after four months of winter darkness... light returns to the high arctic once more... and reveals a world frozen and still.
the arctic is an ocean... sealed by ice and bordered by land.
but this is not a world of permanent winter... and each season brings great changes... to which polar bears must adapt.
high on the slopes of the arctic mountains... life begins to stir.
born in december, and now about four months old... her cubs are ready to face the outside world.
their woolly fur helps to insulate them from the bitter cold.
the temperature here regularly drops... to a nippy minus thirty five.
throughout the winter, other bears have remained out... on the frozen sea ice, hunting.
but winter is a long, lean time for them... as seals can be hard to find.
in peak condition, a male bear can weigh as much as ten men.
but this bear has just endured a winter and its weight is very low.
ringed seals, the smallest of the arctic seals... are they favoured prey.
but adult seals are experienced and very wary... at the slightest sign of danger, they disappear into another world.
more at home in the water than on the ice... they have access to a number of well spaced breathing holes... and so can easily outmanoeuvre a hunting bear.
but what bears are really after in spring... are this year's seal pups.
never having encountered a polar bear before... they seem unaware of the danger.
having been confined to their den since birth... it's important for cubs to exercise and gain strength.
for once they leave the safety of their den... they will find little relief from the trials of life ahead of them.
this female has had nothing to eat for five months... and her body weight has dropped by half.
but she still has a difficult time ahead... because she can't go down to the sea ice to hunt... until her cubs are stronger and more co-ordinated.
it takes time for the cubs to acclimatise to the temperatures... outside their den.
and although they have thick fur... they have little insulation from fat at this age... and so depend on the richness and energy of their mother's milk... to keep them warm.
females without cubs have spent the winter out on the sea ice.
free from the responsibilities of maternal care... they have meet other demands:
the scars on his head and neck are evidence of fights with former rivals.
when the cubs are strong enough, and driven by her need for food... this mother leads her cubs away from the den for the last time.
they are about to enter a much more dangerous world... down on the sea ice.
because ice conditions vary from year to year... seal distribution is unpredictable... so bears may have to range over thousands of kilometres... in search of the best hunting grounds.
they hunt along pressure ridges... which form as ice sheets collide with each other.
it is under the snow drifts in the lee of these ridges... that ringed seals give birth to their pups.
there may be a number of chambers to the lair... but there is usually only one access to the sea beneath.
under the snow, the pup is protected from bad weather... and is out of sight.
but bears have an astonishingly acute sense of smell... and can detect the presence of a seal, deep within the snow... at a distance of a kilometre or more.
even so, the bear must pinpoint the exact position... of the seal beneath him.
it's hard enough for a lone bear... but a female encumbered by cubs, will be even less successful.
if she doesn't manage to catch enough seals... she stops producing milk and her cubs soon starve.
their mother would then become sexually receptive again... so he could mate with her and ensure... the next generation carries his genes.
she's very protective and the cubs aren't allowed to stray far from her.
these cubs are a year and a half old... and now rely largely on meat.
their increasing size puts more and more pressure on their mother... to provide enough food for the three of them.
bears tend to wolf down a fresh kill... because it's very likely to be stolen from them by larger bears... even their own mother.
cubs have a great deal to learn... before they can survive alone in the arctic.
if there's food, a mother will stay with them for 2 and a half years.
like most animals, adult polar bears... do not waste hard-earned energy... but for the cubs play continues to be... a vital part of their training.
it's only by continuing to be inquisitive... that they learn how to adapt to new situations.
but they still don't have the skills to hunt successfully for themselves.
the only other mammal to be found on the sea ice... is the arctic fox.
in some places its life is intricately bound to that of the polar bear.
abandoned carcasses will have been stripped of their energy-rich fat... as all bears eat this first... in case an intruder arrives early and steals the kill.
but there is still a lot of meat on the bones... invaluable food for younger bears... who are not yet proficient hunters... or for a family whose cubs are still growing... and in need of protein.
this seal was killed by a large male bear... who once threatened these cubs.
now he has unwittingly provided them with food... and increased their chances of survival.
they learn the essentials of hunting from their mother... but then each develops its own solution... to the problems of survival... based on its own, unique experiences.
this young bear, now hunting on its own... uses melt channels and the cover offered by ice... to sneak up on its intended victim.
but for others the release of water offers new opportunities... a developing bloom of planktonic life attracts millions of birds.
here, over the short summer, they feed and raise their chicks.
for most animals and birds... summer is a time of plenty... but bears now enter the most difficult period of the year.
there is little left of the ice... and so stalking seals is virtually impossible.
their fur is ideal, not only to keep them warm in winter... but now in summer, to shed water.
as ice floes melt away... bears are forced to head for land.
they can spend many hours in this freezing ocean... and have been known to swim a 100 miles or more to reach shore.
the polar bear, as these unique pictures reveal... might just as appropriately be called the 'sea-bear'.
it is a superbly competent swimmer and has partially webbed feet... for efficient paddling.
in more southern areas, the ice disappears altogether... and bears spend the next five months on land.
this is how they could cope with their intermittent success at hunting seals.
and how they will cope with little food in the months to come.
akpatok, a remote canadian island... whose towering cliffs offer ideal nesting ledges... for hundreds of thousands of guillemots.
by nesting on cliffs... these birds gain some protection from likely predators... foxes and bears, who also use the island as a summer retreat.
the only food accessible to bears... are the rotting carcasses at the bottom of the cliff.
the sight and smell of food so close is a strong lure.
unable to reach the birds, this bear opts for vegetation... which flourishes here because of the rich guano.
polar bears are closely related to brown bears... and, like them, are able to digest plants.
such meagre meals are probably not about energy intake... it's more likely that vegetation provides vitamins and minerals... absent from their seal diet.
it's september, and all around the arctic the ice has retreated.
here on wrangel island, north of siberia... walruses can be found hauled out on the beach in late summer.
one year in ten, the ice melts so far north... that walruses become stranded on this sandy spit.
a mature walrus is so big and has such thick skin... that a bear is seldom able to take one.
but a young animal is easier prey... once it has been separated from the group.
wrangel island bears are lucky to have... such rich pickings in this otherwise lean period.
though solitary for most of the year... at this time these bears tolerate company.
it's extremely rare to see so many bears of all ages... and both sexes together.
but, on a full stomach and with so much more food close to hand... there is little to be gained by being aggressive.
churchill, on the shores of hudson bay, in canada... it's on the same latitude as scotland... and it's home to the most southerly population of polar bears.
here bears undergo one of the most extreme fasts... known for any mammal.
so it seems that though bears may wander over vast areas... when out on the sea ice... their navigation is good... and they stay within a familiar home range.
respite from the gruelling heat... comes with the first storms of winter.
and why not, at this time there is nothing to compete over... no food and no females.
when it's cooler and overheating is no longer a risk... male bears sometimes engage in play fighting.
females and cubs have spent the summer further inland... avoiding the danger of hungry males.
now, with the approach of winter... they move back to the coast in anticipation of the sea freezing over.
it's one way to establish who is who in the pecking order... and to assess your future opponents.
for come spring... when competition for females is high... the fights are for real and are extremely aggressive.
it's better to find out in rehearsal... that you don't have a hope of beating a particular rival... than to suffer serious injury later on.
it's now early november... and the long awaited freeze up is slowly happening.
but until the ice can support the bears... they continue to bide their time on land.
by mid november day length is short... and the sea ice is now strong enough to support the bears.
high among the mountains... pregnant females dig shallow dens... and wait for the snow to cover them.
up here they are safe from other bears... who would kill them to satisfy their hunger.
the northern lights play in the winter sky... whilst below in the mountains... and by now well covered by a deep layer of snow... this pregnant female settles down for the next four months.
her cub is born, helpless and blind... after only sixty days in the womb.
deep under the protective covering of snow... and tucked into its mother's thick fur... the cub stays warm, despite the appalling conditions outside... where temperatures drop to below minus 50 degrees.
it's only by having such tiny and immature cubs... that a female's body can cope with the continuing lack of food.
so, unlike most mammals... much of the infant's growth goes on outside... rather than inside, the mother's body.
in a few months, this cub will emerge... to face an unfamiliar world outside.
in time it will learn the skills... necessary to hunt and survive in a place... which is forever changing with the seasons.
only by adapting to the challenges ahead... will it survive to continue its own line.
at the time of its biggest popularity the troupe had six members.
when cimrman wrote his own play, he counted with the fact his staff is limited.
his theatre company became famous for the resourceful way of dealing with such a challenging task.
after losing the litigation with a playwright ladislav stroupežnický, whose 'our dandies' cimrman performed with only three actors,
and ever since, he focused on the playwrights who had been abroad or – safely – deceased.
for instance in chekhov's play, he boldly cut the number of sisters to only one,
in some more complicated cases he was forced to make more drastical modifications.
his most daring feat – long time discussed in theatrical circles – was his staging of shakespeare's hamlet without hamlet.
good hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off, and let thine eye look like a friend on denmark.
do not for ever with thy vailed lids seek for thy noble father in the dust.
you may be wondering how cimrman's hamlet was received by the audience.
a conscientious-written chronicle of the town of kopidlno gives us an account of his travelling troupe lipany appearance in the local town hall on 15th october 1906.
until the break, the performance itself was watched with anticipation whether hamlet, to whom everybody was looking forward, would finally makes his appearance onstage.
but since he kept hiding away in the second half of the play as well, the pharmacist hoffman arranged a group of volunteers who offered to find the prince.
the gamekeeper sodomka brought his dog from a pub nearby, asking for any prince's garment for the hound to catch the scent.
however, the actors were opposing the search for unfathomable reasons, even though they had been constantly complaining that they hadn't been able to find hamlet.
after the fruitless audience-stage discussion, the pharmacist arranged another group to demand a refund of the ticket price.
the director of the travelling troupe tried to calm down the rising uproar, but nobody could hear him for the whole castle of elsinor was taken by a certain mountain gale, which, the pharmacist swore, was not in the national theatre at all.
"and you shall see what drops i have in store for you!"
that's the end of citation from chronicle of kopidlno and also of my presentation.
but fairly often it happened that in the middle of a performance the current went dead and the whole theater fell into darkness.
after the fire of the national theatre all candles or kerosene lamps were strictly forbidden.
cimrman wrote a humorous sketch which all took place in the dark.
when we discovered it among the remains of the actor ota plk, we realized that, long before the invention of the radio,
due to the power cut we will perform for you a jolly sketch called "the pitchest black".
wife, don't you mind me going away from home and leaving you alone here in our flat which is at the same time a tailor's workshop?
you see, daughter–in–law, our neighbor is younger and she can only hold onto one.
now i'm glad that i didn't go to see my customers and that i only pretended to.
and now excuse me, i'm going to start up the generator.
you have seen, or rather heard, how cimrman took advantage of blackouts to entertain the audience.
his company performed the sketch "the pitchest black" for several years with the same reception as you have witnessed today, until the year 1913 when františek križík attended the performance with his spouse.
križík himself would have glossed the whole matter over, but his wife insisted that the sketch had to be taken from the repertoire and the blackouts needed to stop.
to live to see his own stage play on the boards of the national theatre.
we can find an example of how much passionate this desire was in his correspondence with the leading dramatist of the main stage-
through the generosity of the theatrical department of the national museum we can today look at the passionate letters these two great spirits of the czech theater exchanged in the 1890.
this correspondence is also valuable for us because it gives firsthand evidence about cimrman's lost mythological play
the way not just the forefather of the czechs came to that hallowed mountain, but even the forefather of the germans and the forefather of the jews.
when at the end of your play the czechs learn that even the forefather gypsy is heading for the mountain from roudnice,
in the czech basin, if you haven't noticed, there live others besides czechs.
the descendants of other forefathers have to dwell here in our society.
they are welcome in my theater too and i wish you could see how joyfully they accept my interpretation of history.
i am very grateful to you for the observation about roudnice.
for the simple reason that the heap of rejected manuscripts from similar authors is gigantic and the theatre servant who could search it out for you was suffering from shingles,
i am sending it back and notifying you that i am ending our correspondence for good.
i am also ending my correspondence, for example, with mr. adalbert kolinský and mrs. eliška kutnohorská.
you three alone as i calculated have robbed me of 560 hours which is a full 70 working days by which you have overtaken messieurs zeyer and vrchlický.
i read in lumír journal that you attended a school in the town of písek for two years.
i studied there for a while too, so that makes us schoolmates.
they've been suffering a shortage of field hands here for collecting the sugarbeet crop and the entire sugarbeet campaign.
on the advice of the director of the sugar refinery in dymokury, mr. hlušina,
is repeated in chorus has stirred the audience so greatly that the sugar refinery is going at full speed like never before.
and thanks to my theater they've even signed up five germans, two gypsies, and one jew for a trial.
who wrote the play, what is play about, when the end will come...
a remarkable phenomenon of the troupe was his protagonist, an all-rounder, ota plk.
while other actors merely stepped out of their characters by unmasking themselves,
ota plk remained in his roles long after the curtain fell.
as a matter of fact, this actor did not live his own life at all.
he literally lived the part he played that day until a new role allowed him to move into another character.
spectators applauded this total acting, but the operation of the theater was often disrupted by it.
for instance, after a performance of gogol's inspector in the town of choceò,
however, the earnestness of plk's portrayal of poor marysha had such an effect that after the play nobody wanted to have a coffee with him.
everyone breathed a sigh of relief when marysha disappeared from the repertoire.
ota plk moved into truffaldino and thus ceased to be a danger to his surroundings.
apart from this, even his every-month periodically repeated days of nervousness and hysteria stopped.
beginner would better act out the emotional affections with his back towards the audience.
both laughter and weep are expressed best by jerking your shoulders.
and now, dear friends, on the wings of cimrman's play we will transport you in time and space:
to the stage of a theater where the travelling troupe, sometime around the year 1910, guest in an unnamed czech town.
cimrman wrote just for you don't regret the money spent it does have a happy-end don't regret the money spent it does have a happy-end
spread the word in neighbourhood that the ticket price is good and this new piece – by the way - we also play on saturday and this new piece – by the way - we also play on saturday and sunday too
yes, karel, it means that you will fulfill your dream of performing with prácheòský for nothing.
to tell the truth, i'd rather perform with someone else for money.
like here in the middle in the first row it's the local notables, that's obvious.
but here on the left, and that's interesting all right, here's where the idiots always sit.
well, i hear it practically the same from both sides, so you can throw me lines from this side and here, please step aside, and this will be my place, right?
nobody get in here, because i'll be here most of the time.
with me pinch-hitting as a headliner practically off-hand, you can't want me to do any risky wandering around the stage.
a different thing is when i feel safe, then i dare to walk even... not there of course,
we practice this time-proven trick – the role of the curious invalid.
in case the play starts to, god forbid, fall into pieces, or if it goes completely off the rails, i'll come in and put it back on track.
our theatre troupe has been given a great honour to guest in your town on the very same day when the mayor here celebrates his jubilee.
let the piece you are about to see tonight be a bouquet given by the czech actors to a czech mayor of a czech town.
i do not bequeath my entire property to my second husband vavroch, but on the contrary
i bequeath residential and farming structures, the livestock, forest, grounds, pond and the brickyard
the deceased here – well, she is still a little alive – changed her will.
vlasta is now the heiress to the entire estate and she has to take care of it.
bárta, if it should save you from the army, then out with it.
fine, if it has to come out, it has to come out.
now we just can't decide where we're going to live after the wedding.
what would you say if vlasta and i settled down in èeské budìjovice?
i do not bequeath my entire property to my second husband vavroch, but on the contrary
i bequeath all to my only daughter by the name of vlasta and to her father.
i see it in january, so there's enough time for preparations.
a different thing would be if the bride were pregnant, then we'd have to hurry up.
the more of us are here, the better our conversation is.
however, when there are too many people, you can't have a good conversation.
it's enough to change one little word in it and vlasta inherits everything as a man.
the gammer only has to correct it by her own hand.
i rode to this manor more often than my medical duty commanded me.
the gammer, we called her stázièka, used to be a real beauty.
in life that's not always the way – good stumbles and sin carries the day.
but if we work hard, the world will all mend, when i see you from here, i hope for good end.
every time you try to get them to do something for their own good they figure you've got some sort of hidden agenda.
and getting legal authority from each of them to make arrests?
if we try to talk the other races into letting our ships operate along their borders it'll be nothing but grief.
it took months to pull them together last time and that was with the shadows on them.
if this is the way he is after delenn's been gone for three days i don't even wanna know what he's gonna be like after another week.
lennier, have you been able to get through to home yet?
and i wonder did i do this when i broke the grey council?
valen always said the council would be broken in the great shadow war.
i had assumed that things would continue on like some great clockwork mechanism.
as long as the war was won we would be all right.
well, captain, you will forgive me if i appear a bit slow.
i have studied your race quite a bit, and there are still aspects of your psychology i don't understand.
i apparently mistook you for a human with some taste and sensibility.
after their last broadcast, everywhere i went on the station someone was going:
my point, if you will allow me to make it is that there's much about the human mind that i don't understand.
so perhaps you will explain to me how allowing your ships to patrol the border of centauri space will inspire the rest of the league to do the same if i can't even tell them that we are doing it?
i am, however, very disappointed in the welcome i received from your fellow religious caste.
for a moment, i thought they might actually fire on our ship.
you know as well as i that if either side achieves dominance the delicate balance of our civilization will be destroyed.
you should have thought of that before you broke the grey council.
yes, we've disagreed, even fought, but i would rather have someone who opposed me out of an honest belief in the rightness of his cause than someone who was always on my side because it was expected, required.
i've questioned your judgment, your wisdom, your temperament but never your loyalty.
ambassador, there are so many things in the universe that are and so many things that aren't.
if i were to take the time to deny all the things that aren't we'd be here for centuries, wouldn't we?
why else would she return to minbar with a warrior at her side?
you saw how she deferred to him, spoke gently to him.
so many of our caste have suffered at the hands of the warrior caste.
why else would she behave this way unless she intended for us to surrender?
ever since the war, the warrior caste have had nothing but disdain for us.
"if you need to surrender something, ask the religious caste to do it for you.
after we are no more the ship will continue to drift further into hyperspace until we cannot be found.
the ship will become a monument to our caste and to our willingness to do all that we can to protect our people.
this is commander susan ivanova of babylon 5 bringing you the voice of the resistance.
in the next 20 minutes, we'll have updates about president clark's continued illegal attacks against civilian targets on mars and more information about the struggle for proxima 3.
our best wishes to our brothers and sisters who are fighting for their freedom against overwhelming odds.
we'll also have news about the mass resignations of cabinet-level advisers and the joint chiefs over his campaign of terror.
our regards to those onboard earth alliance starships who risk being arrested and court-martialed for watching these telecasts.
your loyalty to earth and to freedom is appreciated and we hope to have some news for you soon.
but we have a right to the same protection as the centauri.
we cannot tolerate this kind of discrimination in the face of grave danger.
he's been a light for my footsteps never asking, only giving.
without him i would stumble and fall and never get up again.
but it was the least i could do in return for your gracious hospitality.
i know the others are not happy with my presence here.
in the time that we have known each other, i have not always spoken well of you.
i assumed your behavior was prompted by a sense of your own superiority, your ego.
the usual fanaticism we have come to expect from the religious caste.
in the last year, i've begun to realize that i was wrong.
by showing them what we know we may put ourselves at a disadvantage.
if we reveal our sources of information, he may shut them down.
i can't put them on your borders without the proper authorization to intercept raiders and other ships entering or leaving the area.
and since you're not likely to give me the authorization that, as they say, gentlemen, is that.
you will bring the white star fleet into the league of non-aligned worlds.
in return, the league will support any action taken by the fleet.
i was passing a maintenance tube on my way to see you when i smelled a discharge from the fuel system.
there was no time to call for help so i crawled into the tube and i shut the valve.
if i had told her the whole truth it would have destroyed her belief in the strength and the wisdom of our caste.
delenn does not walk in the same world that you and i walk in.
this is commander susan ivanova of babylon 5 bringing you the voice of the resistance.
in a show of solidarity, the league of non-aligned worlds announced the formation of an authorized patrol force to curb the activities of raiders and others who have preyed on civilian transports.
later, we'll have news from the resistance at proxima 3 and other safe havens.
rumors have reached us concerning fighting going on in the capital of minbar.
we ask that anyone with news of events going on there please contact us with that information.
on the chance that anyone on minbar might be monitoring this stellarcast we send them our best wishes and hope they come through this safely.
yeah, i know, every time you try to get them to do something for their own good... they figure you've got some sort of hidden agenda.
and getting legal authority from each of them to make arrests?
i mean, getting them all onboard is gonna be a hard sell.
for most of them, the raiders and the drakh are just potential problems.
if we try to talk the other races... into letting our ships operate along their borders... it's gonna be nothing but grief.
it took months to pull them together last time... and that was with the shadows breathing down their necks.
i don't even wanna know what he's gonna be like after another week.
lennier, have you been able to get through to home yet?
if the fighting spreads beyond the capital... 1000 years of peace will become 1000 years of war.
i came here to tell you the takari has received our signal.
it will have to burn itself out... before the two sides will listen to reason.
and how many cities will be burned to the ground by then?
i have neither the desire nor the inclination to explain them to you.
now if you're incapable of carrying them out, let me know.
must be terrible trying to fly at night without running into entire planets.
are you saying the centauri do not know what ships are patrolling their borders?
my life is already so full of joy as it is.
then you flatly deny that you asked sheridan to use the white star fleet... to support your government and protect centauri space?
yes, i can see that, but this won't take but a moment.
i was wondering if your governments can send us some additional blood supplies... for each of your races.
why else would she return to minbar with a warrior at her side?

our best wishes to our brothers and sisters there who are fighting... for their freedom against overwhelming odds.
we'll also have stunning news about the mass resignations of cabinet-level advisers... and the joint chiefs over his campaign of terror.
our regards to those onboard earth alliance starships who risk... being arrested and court-martialed for watching these telecasts.
your loyalty to earth and to freedom is appreciated... and we hope to have some news for you soon.
i need you to keep an eye on the other warriors that are aboard.
neroon was attacked because some of them believe... that the warrior caste is going to surrender to us.
i fear we may be healing him... only to see him and the rest of us killed before we are finished.
but it was the least i could do in return for your gracious hospitality.
i assumed your behavior was prompted by a sense of your own superiority, your ego.
the usual fanaticism we have come to expect from the religious caste.
let sheridan think we do not know about this invisible enemy.
let him continue to underestimate us as long as we get what we want.
i've been wondering if some of the warrior caste might have been involved.
no, i think we can be fairly certain the warrior caste was not involved.
delenn does not walk in the same world that you and i walk in.
she does not see the same world that you and i see.
we'll be home soon, and i'll need all my strength to deal with the new problems... without dwelling on the old ones.

my life is already so full of joy as it is.
then you flatly deny that you asked sheridan to use the white star fleet to support your government and protect centauri space?
i will send your governments a formal request later on today.
i just wanted to let you know that it was coming.
why else would delenn come this far and want neroon to be here?
why else would she return to minbar with a warrior at her side?
you saw how she deferred to him, spoke gently to him.
so many of our caste have suffered at the hands of the warrior caste.
once released into the air-processing system it will poison the atmosphere within minutes.
after we are no more the ship will continue to drift further into hyperspace until we cannot be found.
to think that one of our own should turn against us.
i think i will welcome the great sleep that i might never again have such thoughts.
captain, with all due respect, we just can't start planting stories now.
we've made a big deal out of the fact that, unlike isn, we put out the truth.

granny said it's genetics, but with the pills it's getting better.
i have to remember to take the medicine, then i can run really fast later on.
i must do something for him, we must have a new start.
even if you kill all of us, he can't move around with my id.
to me that story was, and always will be, not abraham's story, but isaac's.
this boy must grow with the image of his own father poised above him... without it ever explained why he's a victim.
but we can't figure out where all this blood comes from.
if this person is still alive, maybe we can help them.
ainsley... things are going so good, with the job and everything.
going to church is the only time i can leave here, except for work.
i was going to open my own restaurant... where the oilmen could come for steak and potatoes.
i was going to marry one of them, have big strong boys.
anyway, i want to reassure everybody that i am not planning on making any wholesale changes here.
last thing i want to do is ruin a first-class operation.
who i am is not nearly as relevant as who you are.
and who you are is someone who betrayed the master and took full advantage of his downfall.
a takeover which the master will orchestrate in his quest to rebuild what was once metropolis' greatest financial empire.
an empire so powerful and so brilliantly pieced together that no one dared to challenge it until...
lois asked me to get her an atm tape for her investigation.
problem is, more often than not, the fbi stands for "forget about it."
public pressure on community leaders is intensifying after last night when vixen used lethal force in stopping the perpetrators from fleeing the scene.
witnesses described her actions as grossly excessive which has only added to the fear that she's either a crusading vigilante or an out-of-control superhero.
but the bottom line is, lois i'm going to need yours and clark's help to pull it off.
now i realize this is an imposition but i'd consider it a personal favor if the both of you would just hear me out.
the only hitch, of course is whether or not superman will be able to keep up with her.
well, we could get dr. klein to rig up a transmitter to track leslie.
of course, if he can't, well then we're all in a lot of trouble, aren't we?
mr. luckaby, you realize of course that if vixen snatches you up at superspeed that you may not survive?
he's the one who saved metropolis from vixen's wrath with a big assist from lois lane and clark kent, i might add.
look for their exclusive in tomorrow's edition of the daily planet.
let me get my calendar and see if i can clear the next decade.
to truly learn how men think you have to be accepted by men.
she can do better than some slob in a pair of chaps that haven't fit since watergate.
hey, aren't you supposed to be home watching some musical on pbs?
and shouldn't you be using your unemployment cheque to buy raising jack?
i am not going anywhere until you find hilda and let her decide.
that's great, because, you know, i know a lot of times on first dates
i make the mistake of talking too much or acting really desperate or putting myself down.
senior i'm dating got grounded, so you get the privilege of escorting me into the slicery.
just chew with your mouth closed and don't let my diet coke go empty.
there was one time when a guy who works for my dad...
i wish you would learn that it's never a good idea to turn yourself into a boy.
yeah, never's a really long time to go without a date.
listen, there's something kind of personal i need to talk to you about.
many serbian refugees from krajina are blocked on banija between the croatian troops in the north and muslim troops in the south.
i'm doing the whole summer program for free and still i've never been late.
endless lines of serbian refugees are passing northern bosnia today on their way to serbia.
there is a traffic jam on the road from petrovac to banjaluka, since some vehicles are running out of fuel.
un refugee committee forwarded 90.000 liters of fuel to this area to help the refugees reach their destinations.
the estimations of the un refugee committee are that on the territory of krajina, bosnia and serbia there are 150.000 serbian refugees from the republic of serbian krajina.
if you were honest, you would be there and not here.
listen, old man, if you don't want a parasol, get away from my stand.
they'll have to pay like the rest of them do, honey.
if sonja makes a fuss about it, send her to me.
by the way, if you read as much as you say you did, you wouldn't be renting parasols to belgrade grannies.
i would've read more if they didn't make me read those stupidities in school.
as soon as i make some money, i'll give you and mother cash, and marry your sister.
how did you end up being so ugly with such a beautiful sister?
the united nations refugee committee expects that theis serbian exodus will include 200.000 people.
many serbian refugees from krajina are blocked on banija between thee croatian troops in thee northe and muslim troops in the south.
there is a traffic jam on the road from petrovac to banjaluka, since some vehicles are running out of fuel.
un refugee committee forwarded 90.000 liters of fuel to theis area to heelp the refugees reache theeir destinations.
they´ll have to pay like thee rest of them do, honey.
if sonja makes a fuss about it, send her to me.
whenever i´m getting ready for bed, i drink a lot of water and theen i feel like pissing all nighet.
when i get up and heead to the toilet, i theink, why don´t l drink another glass, just so i wouldn´t wake up any more.
please, let´s not argue. lf you wanna read, read during thee day.
by the way, if you read as muche as you say you did, you wouldn´t be renting parasols to belgrade grannies.
raca, vodolinci, sepak and batrovac, 15.600 people entered the federal republic of yugoslavia.
our boy is making excellent moves. -ln thee last 9 days, over the drina bridge by loznica, almost 27.000
it must be hard for them to manage in the other realm without the magic book.
why, it would be like an american teenager without a car.
no, i meant it's hard for me because i'm in school.
oh, so now you're throwing your education up in our face.
don't expect me to be in a good mood, because i hate the bus.
try being on the back of a burro with the rest of your husband's possessions.
from these straits, the pacific 0cean stretches southwards to cover one third of the earth's surface.
0ur journey will take us all the way round this vast ocean.
a late august sun shines for our departure, making light of the harsh life in this village, battered by the elements for nine months a year.
the 180 inhabitants of this windswept rock live by fishing, and always have done.
they've seen travellers trying to cross the ice bridge between russia and america or on their way to the arctic.
this is just one more crazy departure for a people who wouldn't exchange diomede for anywhere else on earth.
in nome, real men drive pickup trucks and never wash them.
90 years ago, these bleak beaches were called the "golden sands of nome".
30,000 prospectors camped here in search of a fortune... and they still come.
excuse me dropping in, but i was told i must see the golden sands of nome.
these workhorses - this one is 33 years old - are the equivalent of cars on a rugged island like kodiak.
the weather is good as we land 60 miles away on karluk lake, so we set off straight away with scott the ranger,
it's now 24 hours since we should have been airlifted from karluk lake back to kodiak and off to attu, but we're still here.
i can see the mountains over which the plane should come, but there's no sign of it.
scott's proud of the fact that there's no phone on the island.
in some desperation, i ask him if there is any other way out.
unfortunately it's not for me at all, although some of the press half recognise a star when they see one.
the real celebrities are an alaskan delegation from homer, led by the mayor.
greetings over, the alaskan delegation is swept away in the official limousine.
but the offerings from the people of petropavlovsk don't go unappreciated.
kretchet - the name on the aircraft - is one of the myriad private companies running these old military helicopters.
the word means "falcon", but this mighty beast feels more like an elephant.
those that brave the weather and the rough terrain are mostly nomads.
we're looking for a tribe called the evenks, who live off great herds of reindeer.
then the weather clears, the landscape changes, and we're over some of the most spectacular scenery in the world.
tourism is not yet established here and it's doubtful it ever will be.
it is just the size of the place - not only what you see on the surface, like the volcanoes, but what is underneath.
i've never anywhere else felt the sense of the earth bubbling and pulsing beneath me, energy just pouring out.
it was the administration centre for the mineral mines of the kolyma region.
most of the inhabitants of this bleak city are the sons, daughters and grandchildren of prisoners and prison officials.
it, too, was built on slave labour, laid over the bodies of those who perished.
we're taking one of the survivors back to the gulag camps where he once worked.
these are the old uranium mines where men worked in isolation to extract the vital ingredients for russia's first atomic bomb.
it was always officially denied that forced labour camps existed, but ivan yakovlev shows us the remains of a cemetery 200 miles north of magadan.
there is evidence to prove that someone knew who was buried in these communal graves.
each one is marked with an identification disc made from an old tin lid.
it's estimated that from 1933 until their closure in 1953, three million russians were sent to their deaths in camps like these.
i asked tatiana, the interpreter, what ivan yakovlev's feelings are on returning here.
there is still one russian city left in which i can buy a plug.
1,400 miles due south is vladivostock - the capital of the russian far east - where the only railway line across russia meets the pacific.
the 6,000-mile journey from moscow takes six days and crosses seven time zones before the train reaches the glorious extravaganza of vladivostock station - built in 1912 in the bavarian gothic style and freshly painted by an italian film company.
vladivostock is full of japanese cars and the midday bustle has an almost european feel.
it's hard to believe the city was closed to foreigners as recently as 1992.
it was closed because it was home to the mighty russian pacific fleet.
the fleet now goes on joint manoeuvres with its old enemies america and china and is no longer mighty.
my hotel in the leafy suburbs is called the vlad motor inn.
now it's where the kodos work and train, and they've invited me to join them for a day.
they're putting me up in a ryokan - a traditional inn - called the house of the red pear.
the ryokan is immaculate - like a newly finished dolls' house.
everything has its place - even mamasan's goldfish, which are fed every afternoon at five.
every morning at five, the kodo apprentices begin the day with a ten-kilometre run.
i've asked if i can train with them and my bluff has been called.
then they make a lot of noise which welcomes the sun and keeps down local property values.
this is where it all started - the old schoolhouse which kodo bought in 1981.
here, a few carefully chosen apprentices spend a year in frugal, almost monastic conditions.
they cook and clean for themselves, may not drink or smoke and have one shower and one stove between them.
the teaching emphasises the need to play with the innocence and energy of a child.
they drum for 90 minutes each morning and afternoon, six days a week.
yoshi kazu is one of the only two members of kodo strong enough to play the hugely demanding big drum - 0-daiko.
at their new headquarters, the other virtuoso, eichi saito, is auditioning for a successor.
with the shellfish and the seaweed, there is bream and squid and scallops, sea snails, abalone in soy sauce and teriyaki of tuna stomach.
scarcely a denizen of the deep is unrepresented at mamasan's table.
i'm going to have a little bit of this very succulent fish.
my crash course in japanese cuisine is just a golden memory next morning.
even in the country, a spotless train arrives at a spotless platform spot on time.
we're on our way south across honshu - the largest of japan's three main islands.
from the rice plains of the coast to the rice terraces in the mountain valleys.
the journey to tokyo surprises me - two thirds of this crowded country still consists of woodland and forest.
it's the first mega-city on our route and it's especially confusing if you're not japanese.
there is someone i know here who might help me make sense of it.
the loach is a freshwater fish with two attractions for the japanese - it aids both digestion and virility.
0nce selected, the lucky or unlucky loach are tipped into wooden tubs and served copious amounts of sake - the japanese rice wine.
the tottering loach are then upended into a soup of secret ingredients.
to complete the dining experience, each table is supplied with its own blast furnace.
we will be stopping at shin-yokohama, nagoya, kyoto... (michael) it's time to leave tokyo and mayumi, and head south on the bullet train, accelerating fast until we're lapping the tokyo suburbs at 2.5 miles a minute.
the train will take us down to the island of kyushu from which there's a ferry for korea.
but we're almost 200 miles out of tokyo before the urban sprawl gives way to something like open countryside.
we break the journey to look at a way of life which modern japan has hardly touched.
the immaculate grounds reflect the love of precision, order and formality which lie at the heart of japanese culture.
seeing these spartan surroundings makes me aware of how much clutter i carry.
by the time i've climbed yet more stairs, i'm ready to renounce all worldly goods - beginning with my suitcase.
later that afternoon i'm summoned to meet the abbot - the roshi.
i know i'm only here for a very short time, but i hope i'll learn something.
is it possible to say in a few words what the difference is between the zen buddhism that you practise here and more traditional buddhism?
not only by learning from books, but also practising with our whole body - with body and mind.
(s0kun) and with the unity of body and mind, we can attain our true nature.
and from the morning till night - for 24 hours - each moment is the practice.
(michael) the most important part is meditation - to which i have been invited.
then, as calm is descending for a second time, something finally happens.
just as i'm wondering what it must be like, i'm offered the chance to find out.
i learn afterwards that this is the keisaku - the warning stick.
a means of ensuring that meditation does not become an excuse for a quick nap.
(s0kun) you know, the monks should sit for over 15 hours a day when we practise the big session.
as i am only here for one night, what will i be able to learn in that time, do you think?
most historic dutch buildings, including the royal palace, are faithfully reproduced.
but thanks to japanese technology, the canals are self-cleaning and the merchants' houses are earthquake-proof.
this theme park with clogs on has become japan's favourite honeymoon destination.
this celebration of historic links with the foreigner seems to me to be the fantasy of a country ill at ease with the rest of the world.
99% of all japanese were born and still live in japan - a country with no minorities of any size.
the village is a success because it enables the japanese to be part of the wider world without ever having to leave home.
at 11 o'clock on a wednesday morning, the equivalent of 22,000 tons of tnt exploded above this spot.
more people were killed in this one blast than were killed in all the bombing raids on britain in the second world war.
more than 50 years later, the japanese make a point of not forgetting.
school parties lay streamers made up of paper birds - a token of respect for the dead.
the bomb that wiped out a third of nagasaki was intended for the mitsubishi shipyard.
mitsubishi survived and, with american aid, became the world's number one.
but as the japanese learnt from others, so others learnt from them.
across the water lies my next destination - the country whose shipbuilders beat the japanese at their own game.
we're just about to leave hakata port in japan for the ferry trip to korea - another country.
i feel all those things you feel about travel - a bit harassed with getting bags on and off and tickets, but also curiosity about the country we're going to see.
the capital, seoul, 300 miles north - a new city ballooning out over the countryside from which it has sucked in 11 million inhabitants.
these office blocks belong to the family conglomerates, which have guided korea through one of the world's fastest industrial revolutions.
this anti-japanese feeling is a surprise until you read the history.
early this century, the japanese occupied korea for 36 years - pretty ruthlessly.
hanging here are photos of the victims of a massacre of 200 students in 1981, which has since traumatised korean politics.
there is outrage that the generals responsible for it have been granted immunity from prosecution.
in the south seoul marriage hall, every wedding-day worry is taken out of your hands by an expert staff.
everything is for hire, except the guests and the person you marry.
brides can be dressed, decorated and delivered to the altar in rented loveliness within the hour.
shin tells me that one in four koreans is a practising christian.
this family has opted for the simple piano, knowing that the money saved can be spent on something more spectacular.
everyone is a bit misty-eyed by now and the in-house video is there to record it.
this is all that's left of the way they used to get married.
the happy couple are immortalised by sophisticated camera equipment in front of korea's rented past.
this is the real thing - the pulguksa temple, known officially as "historic site and scenic beauty number one".
in a place like this, you begin to get a clearer sense of what defines the koreans.
despite constant invasions, they've kept their own language, alphabet and architecture.
pulguksa stood for a thousand years before being destroyed by japanese invaders in the 17th century.
it's now restored, and after days among the concrete canyons of seoul, its colour and craftsmanship is like a breath of fresh air.
today, we shall encounter our first serious obstacle to progress around the pacific rim.
this is the start of a tour into one of the most militarised borders on earth, so special restrictions do prevail.
first, i have to sign a visitor's declaration which says, "the visit will entail entry into a hostile area
so i just have to sign this, let them off the hook, and we can go on with the tour.
"in front of them all" is the motto of the 506th infantry - some of the 37,000 american troops still stationed in korea.
momentarily, we'll be going in the vicinity of the mac building.
from the way they talk, you'd think the korean war had ended yesterday.
mac - the military armistice commission - has been trying to turn a ceasefire into a peace for 43 years.
welcome to the mac building where the meetings essential to the supervision of the ceasefire are held.
beneath all the military-speak, the fact remains that these are the world's least successful peace talks.
most of the time seems to have been spent discussing the placing of microphones.
we can't go any further into korea without the risk of being shot or arrested.
it comes as a bit of a shock to find such a heavily fortified, potentially lethal border in the middle of the open pacific rim area, but i suppose the immeasurable sadness of a place like this is that it's not a border between two rival countries.
but we've got to try and understand it because if forecasts are right, within the next 25 years, china is going to have the most powerful economy in the world.
yet i still have that feeling - partly because of its recent history - of apprehension about travelling in china, a vague whiff of difficulty.
but i'm also deeply fascinated and looking forward to getting there.
slipping into china through qingdao is like coming in through the back door.
the second surprise is the welcome guest house, which turns out to be a bavarian castle.
it was built for the governor 90 years ago when qingdao was a german colony.
the spirit of wagner lingers in the woodwork and the chinese seem to rather like it.
communist leaders were especially keen, if the wall plaques are anything to go by.
modern china has been grafted onto germany without anybody really noticing.
as soon as i've unpacked, i take a walk to get my first feel of life on chinese streets.
being photographed seems to be a passion and one that an old ham like myself can hardly resist.
it gives me a sense of belonging, as if i've become an honorary chinese on my first day.
it was started 12 years ago by a pioneering englishman who went bust and died at the age of 43.
parry's grave overlooks slopes where supply can now barely keep pace with demand.
it's considered to your spiritual advantage to climb it, which i intend to do.
thoughtfully they've put some steps up the mountain - 6,293 of them.
i'm invited to eat with a businessman who honed his skills in canada and is now one of shanghai's many new entrepreneurs.
i was here eight years ago and it seems to be changing a lot.
we're sucked into shanghai by mile after mile of new apartment blocks.
they're being built for the millions of chinese who chairman mao once exhorted to work the countryside.
they're now urged by his successors to seek their fortune in the city.
0utside the station, i step into a great stew of cars, crowds and commerce.
i make a quick exit and follow his directions to the huangpu river.
this area behind me is the bund, which is the old 1920s and '30s financial and economic heart of shanghai.
it may be capitalism without democracy, but there is surely no going back to the stern certainties of old-style communism.
this is the gaudy face of a country that has seen 10% growth every year for the last ten years, and wants more.
it's the third longest river in the world - a fraction shorter than the amazon and the nile.
upstream from the city of yichang, it enters a series of gorges which cut through mountains so impassable that the river is still the only way through.
this massive lock we're ascending actually raises the water level about 100 feet.
and it's here because the yangtze's already been dammed at this point.
this is currently the most important and probably the most controversial point on the yangtze river.
you can see the workings for the three gorges dam which will extend to the other side of the river here.
so everything from here on that we're going to see will in 16 or 17 years' time be totally underwater.
the homes of over a million people will disappear beneath a lake 370 miles long.
why change anything when, in a few years, all this will be engulfed?
coal is flung down the mountainside - some of it sliding into barges, the rest settling over the city like a great black shroud.
this is old china, where machines are few and human effort plentiful and cheap.
men and women form a conveyor belt to the coal barges.
and a couple of years after that - about ten years from now - it'll be underwater.
every porter in town has turned out to help us leave.
for many, the yangtze is not only the lifeblood, but the great highway.
the hard-worked river boats sustain a whole range of ancillary services.
those of us not enjoying a chinese throwaway eat in the more sophisticated surroundings of the first-class dining room.
we're deep inside china now and i'm aware, not uncomfortably, that we're the only non-chinese on the boat.
it's about 1,500 miles from the mouth of the yangtze in shanghai and here the yangtze river meanders off for another 2,500 miles to the tibetan border.
we have to try and head south towards the vietnamese border and try and get a train across to hanoi.
waiting for me at the meat market is miss liu - a 23-year-old graduate from chongqing university.
she's one of a new generation of chinese who can barely remember hard-line communism and the cultural revolution.
we've come into china through korea and we spent some time in shanghai.
does it worry you that as people get richer, they get more selfish?
an hour out of chongqing, as we part company with the yangtze,
i asked the driver what he thinks of the spice girls.
we're travelling south, away from the mists of the gorges into a world of green paddy fields and a rich, reviving, subtropical sunshine.
the railway slices across a high limestone plateau and into guizhou province.
its construction 30 years ago was vital in opening up this remote region.
but even so, guizhou remained closed to foreigners until the 1980s.
these days the miao are encouraged to celebrate their own culture.
the chinese have set up a minorities ministry to make sure they do.
a get-together could lead to a knees-up which could lead to a get-together and a whole new generation of musicians.
driven out of the rich plains by the chinese, the miao have had to make a living from a magnificent landscape but very poor soil.
it's a chance to find out more about the policy of "doi-moi" - new thinking.
but old thinking reasserts itself as our cameras are ordered off.
banners proclaim the message of socialism, but shops proclaim the message of the market.
in the vietnam war, this prison - where americans were interrogated - was known mockingly as the hanoi hilton.
now it's part of a property development on which a real hanoi hilton may one day rise.
where americans were once tortured, they will one day come to be pampered.
there are prawn fritters and raw vegetables and something in a bucket.
we're crossing the ben hai river - the border of the old demilitarised zone.
400 miles south of hanoi we pull into the city of hue.
tourists are welcome in vietnam, but fare dodgers are definitely not.
today it's busy all day long, as is every other thoroughfare in this crowded land.
if you want some peace, try the forbidden purple city - seat of the emperors.
but as we move through to the heart of the temple, i'm in for a shock.
now we are at the centre of the forbidden purple city.
my destination is the thien mu pagoda that has stood here for 400 years.
but in the buddhist monastery next door, i discover something newer and infinitely more macabre.
this is probably the most famous austin car in the world today because it was in this car that a monk from this monastery was driven to saigon in 1963, and he set alight to himself in protest at the way buddhists were treated at the time.
a world-famous photograph was taken of the monk and in the back of the photograph there is a picture of this very car.
it's weird to see it here, a photo that one knows so well.
it's strange because my father had a car exactly like this - same colour, same make.
80 days away from the arctic circle, we're in monsoon country.
today we continue our journey on the next reunification express southbound.
when the french were booted out in 1954, they didn't leave much behind, but they did leave a railway, and their word for railway station - "gare" - has survived.
the train slows as it toils up from the narrow plain to hai van - the pass of the 0cean clouds.
now there's only the roar of the ocean for company... or so i thought.
american forces may have gone, but a lone westerner without a seashell or a slice of mango is too much for the local children to bear.
after its 2,500 mile journey, the mekong forms a huge delta here.
the river deposits enough mud on vietnam to increase its size by 200 feet a year.
(northern accent) so where there's mud, there's brass - as they say in southern vietnam, not in that sort of accent but you know what i mean.
this being vietnam, a bit of water doesn't stop people buying and selling.
from this little delta town dominated by a catholic church, it's a short hop to tay ninh province, home of one of the world's newest religions.
it's called cao dai and it was invented by a civil servant in 1926.
this splendidly designed religion is a spiritual curry, containing a little bit of everyone else's religion.
the writer graham greene was so taken with it, he considered becoming a convert.
these are the cu-chi tunnels - a 100-mile underground network, built for guerrilla armies fighting the french and americans.
despite being blasted with bombs and raked with defoliant, they were never destroyed in 35 years of warfare.
how many people could be hidden underneath the earth at any one time?
probably about 5,000 guerrilla forces can stay inside the tunnel at one time.
bequeathed by the french, last used against the vietnamese in 1960.
if i ever made a series of great post offices of the world, this one would be included.
a country where there's no point in shouting stop - no one'll hear you.
a thousand miles from the heaving crowds of mainland asia are the heaving crowds of the philippines, whose capital, manila, with a population of 12 million, is one of the asian pacific mega-cities.
if things are bad, these people club together to pay an agency fee so that one of them can go abroad to earn money and support the family back home.
i'm outside the headquarters of the friends of filipino migrant workers.
i just want to earn money and i just want to support my family and my parents also.
i want to work in taiwan, sir, because i want to support my family - my father, mother, my brother and sister.
i do so in style on a quiet sunday morning, high above where the traffic jams would have been any other day of the week.
luzon is the largest of the 7,000 islands of the philippines.
its northern end is composed of mountains where we hope to find the eighth wonder of the world - the rice terraces of banaue.
but the highland weather is turning bad and luis, my pilot, is not a happy man.
the cloud base is too low for him to land near the rice terraces, so he puts down on a village football pitch... during a game.
leaving the teams to take half-time early, luis organises alternative transport.
but, unfortunately, as you know, there were problems with visibility, so...
well, just close your eyes and imagine some rice terraces and...
we're heading for 114 lourdes grotto road to witness surgery performed with bare hands, without anaesthetic and without instruments.
"psychic surgery" has its roots among the forest peoples of the north.
0nce you realise that your role model is a fish, a whole new world opens up.
i'm enjoying it so much, i decide to join some fellow divers for lunch.
they can remember faces - who bet and who bet against, so nothing much is recorded.
it's an ugly sport to watch, but there's huge local enthusiasm.
and then they are given back to the owners for breeding purposes.
as others wait to fight, the vet patches up those who already have.
zamboanga, on the southern tip of the philippines, is difficult to leave.
this is partly because it has charm and partly because the sailing schedules are completely unreliable.
after several days of delay, we are booked aboard the danica joy, bound for borneo.
her bigger sister ship should do this run, but she's laid up after a fire in the engine room.
i'm sorry to be leaving zamboanga - not just because it's a very friendly, hospitable city, but because i'm leaving it via the sulu sea, which has a fearsome reputation.
the sulu sea is a frontier not just between the philippines and malaysia, but between christians and muslims.
they've been fighting over this area for 400 years and it's still going on.
in the paper yesterday, there were three incidents provoked by muslim-christian tension.
most of my human fellow passengers are filipinos going abroad to look for jobs not available in the country they're leaving.
0n the horizon, i can make out the islands that travellers are warned to steer clear of.
the skyline of sandakan exudes an air of prosperity we never saw in zamboanga.
we take a bus south across the island, but it's the monsoon season and progress is slow.
snakes, because normally the ground-dwellers, like snakes, scorpions and so on, they would all be floating up.
keep your fingers crossed that we don't come across any of them.
this is the pathway to one of the world's very few orang-utan rehabilitation centres.
when the rainforest was plundered for timber, many of these orang-utan were taken out of the forest and sold as domestic pets.
it wasn't the british government which created all this, but a family called brooke from bath.
in 1841, they bought sarawak off a local sultan and ran it until the japanese invaded 100 years later.
stephen yong, a former minister, shows me round the istana, official residence of the family who built somerset on the sarawak river and called themselves the white rajahs.
from here charles brooke, the second rajah, ruled for 50 years.
head-hunting is one of the crimes which the rajah introduced, much against the tradition of the ibans.
an iban was taught that head-hunting was one of their... ways of life.
and perhaps, most poignantly, in the single surviving public likeness of rajah brooke, dressed in the style of the people he ruled for so long.
it's quite difficult to get round borneo by road, largely because they tend not to exist.
the pattern of life here still revolves around the rivers which run from the interior down to the ports.
i'm doing it the other way round - going from kuching upriver towards the mountains, to spend a few days with the iban people at one of their longhouses, which certainly, for me, is a journey into the unknown.
it'll take the best part of a day to make our way upriver almost as far as the indonesian border.
as the rainforest closes in to become jungle, the rivers grow narrower and shallower.
we're on the edge of the great, inhospitable heart of borneo, one of the secret places of the world.
without the help of the local people, it would be hard to find our way in or out of here.
hope i live to be as old as you and look as well.
i asked the headman and another elder, both in their 80s, about the issue of head-hunting.
he's the first iban ever to hold such a high office.
some politicians have to kiss babies, but if you want to win votes in sarawak, a passing knowledge of butchery is more useful.
to be honest, the drinking has already started - around breakfast time.
the iban love contests - like this hard, fast drumming round in which the first one to lose the beat is out.
i hope to find a sailing ship to take me through them and on to australia.
i'm driving across java in the company of eko binarso, a trekking and mountain guide.
it's the start of ramadan, the muslim month of fasting and self-restraint.
jakarta, largest city in the southern hemisphere, is hot, wet and quiet.
0ur plan is to drive the length of the island to the port of surabaya.
the road soon winds up into foothills and as cool and moderate a climate as back home.
# i love java, sweet and hot # 0ops, mr moto, i'm a coffee pot
# shoot me the pot and i'll pour me a shot
110 million people live in an area the size of england.
increasing affluence is bringing increasing traffic to roads never much wider than this.
as the road system is largely free from motorways, so much of the countryside is free from huge farms and agri-business.
this warm, wet land is still farmed by local people with incredible delicacy and precision.
it's tempting to stop in every valley and village, but we have a tight schedule.
i insist we only stop if eko sees something i really mustn't miss.
it's a bit of several cultures - dutch colonial buildings and a street named after the british duke of marlborough.
we've been asked to a private home to hear some gamelan music and watch the puppet show that goes with it.
wayang kulit, as they call the puppet show, is not for the faint-hearted.
loosely based on the great indian epics, a full-length performance lasts eight hours.
with its in-jokes and subversive references, many javanese regard wayang kulit as essential viewing and children still grow up wanting to be puppet masters.
a little way off the road out of yogyakarta is one of the world's great monuments.
it's enormous, yet easy to miss, squatting amongst fields and coconut groves like a half-finished mountain.
this is the buddhist temple of borobudur, built in 800ad and rediscovered 1,000 years later half submerged in volcanic ash.
they all look rather sort of... slightly racy things going on.
the terraces form a path to enlightenment that runs around the monument for a distance of almost two miles.
as i've already found on other sacred mountains of asia, enlightenment requires effort.
it's only when you get to the top that you're aware of the location of this place, the plain with a circle of volcanoes all around.
farming is precarious here - in every sense of the word.
the locals are descended from hindus who were pushed to this far end of the island by the islamic conquest.
surprisingly for the tropics, they can grow crops like cabbages, onions and leeks.
to my great relief, another long day on the road ends, successfully, at the door of mount bromo's only hotel.
we're in trouble here because none of them will take us.
none of them will take us east towards lombok and timor, the direction we want to go towards darwin.
so... we have found one which will take us tomorrow morning towards the end of the island of java.
we'll just have to try and get somewhere on through the islands from there.
we leave surabaya not quite sure where we're going and how we'll get there.
for a while, it all seems to be going so well.
with sails hoisted and a fair wind, we make our way majestically southwards.
the inescapable reality is that our ship cannot risk the open sea with monsoon winds about.
but if we stay inshore, the wind gets weaker and the sea gets shallower.
after less than a day's sailing, our captain has no choice but to arrange for local fishermen to take us off the boat and ashore.
we're 200 miles south of darwin and about to witness a unique phenomenon - the only set of traffic lights for 1,000 miles.
my driver scotty drops me off in the town of katherine.
i'll be seeing him later, but first there's business to do.
katherine is a small, bustling oasis in the middle of a vast empty land.
i think they come 'cause they want to get away from the law!
either that or they want to get away from their wife or some broken business or... 0ur first stop is coolibah airstrip.
you could be looking at next year's gucci or cardin handbags.
he also risks life and limb to collect crocodile eggs from outlying swamps.
bluey's been kind enough to let me feed him some brumby - that is wild-horse meat.
will he know where the horse meat ends and my arm begins?
in the last 20 years, land-rights acts have given them potentially rich areas of influence.
next on peter's rounds is a 300-mile hop to the aboriginal settlement of manyallaluk.
when real trains came along, they were released into the wild.
now they're trying to find them again for zoos, game parks and breeding.
tonight, like any other swagman, i'll camp out by the fire.
are there any dangers about sleeping out here under the stars?
i'm in a world which nothing i've ever experienced has prepared me for.
i'm also clinging for dear life onto the back of lan's four-wheel drive with a dane called gunnar.
ironically, their memory is kept alive by one of the railway trains that made them redundant.
it's called the ghan, after the afghan camels and their drivers who helped build the first railway line across the desert.
it's just what i need - a quiet day or two in a good hotel.
a book, a drink, a chance to recover from too many nights in the bush.
breathe your last is coming up... (michael) udderley yours does everything i ask of her, except move.
(tann0y) we've got reliable right alongside the commentary stand... (michael) the udderley yours team decides on a more long-term strategy, mainly involving staying on the cow.
(michael) 0ur next master stroke is to develop a special racing diet.
(tann0y) there goes dun fling, thinking, "what a bunch of mugs these people are."
now we've crossed australia from north to south, it'll take us on a 24-hour ride east to sydney and back on course to the pacific.
a few miles up the pacific coast is one of australia's booming exports - a soap called "home and away".
i may have only been given two lines, but they're pretty tricky.
sorry, i was going to head in for a bit of a dip...
i hope they get to my lines before the tide comes in.
sorry, i was about to head in for a bit of...
(man) everybody in the boat, come on, i wanna hear you say, "boat!"
everybody in the boat, come on, i wanna hear you say, "boat!
by the time we reach the town of kaikoura, they've worn themselves out.
to be honest, it's positively refreshing to be amongst shy, retiring new zealanders again.
the maoris arrived in these islands over a thousand years ago.
the challenge is still issued when an outsider is received into the tribe.
every outsider is required to give a speech and sing a song.
my mind goes blank and then spins back to my childhood.
you talk about traditions here and about a feeling of place being very important, a sense of where you belong.
so i thought i would sing you, very briefly, a verse from a song that was written at the founding of the school that i went to in shrewsbury in england.
i was able to go on to the "hongi", the rubbing of noses which marks the acceptance of the stranger.
this may look like a quaint tradition, but the reality is that maoripower and influence has never been stronger.
he's breathing every 15 seconds - getting rid of the carbon dioxide and nitrogen in his body that he's accumulated over that last dive.
now he's re-oxygenating his bloodstream, ready to go down for the next 50 minutes.
it's almost as if someone somewhere knows i've been away from home for too long.
near the southernmost point of our circle, the number of people on the pacific rim is dwindling fast.
the great thing about jet-boating is that if you wet yourself no one will ever know.
if you survive this, and most people do, you can still throw yourself off a bridge and be home for dinner.
i talked to aj hackett, the man who sold bungee jumping to the world at the place where it all began.
one of the things i made a point of doing was making sure anybody could do it.
(hackett) so we encouraged from day one, first of all, women to jump, then anybody who had a physical handicap.
we would encourage them to jump, spend time harnessing them up, so they'd be nice and comfortable.
i need the exercise, so i ask if i can join them.
i feel like the monty python definition of a medieval king - the only one who hasn't got shit all over him.
having had a public-school education, i understand pain and pointless exercise.
second to camel mustering, that's the most uncomfortable hour i've spent!
this is the one place on earth where the atlantic and pacific 0ceans meet.
commander merino and the chilean navy are our hosts and saviours.
normally, every two months, we send a priest from puerto williams when we are changing the people and then they have a service then.
0utside antarctica, this is the southernmost place of worship in the world.
the extraordinary thing about coming to cape horn, besides being a lifetime's dream realised, is that it is the end of the american continent.
those are the last few yards of america over there... or the first few.
before i set out, i can't resist sending a card from cape horn post office.
so this will have the cape horn stamp on it and be sent from cape horn?
we're through the beagle channel and putting ashore at a small bay.
there is a unique record here of the price paid by the first british sailors.
sheep and cattle are squeezed onto trailers that are squeezed onto the cargo decks.
the animals look healthy enough in the fresh sea air and the morning sunshine.
the truth is that for four days and nights they will have nowhere else to go.
the human cargo may have more room to move, but not much more to do.
i try to remember how to play chess and beat myself quite convincingly.
there's excitement as we approach a shallow and dangerous narrows called the kirke pass.
with so few passengers aboard, it's easy to get a grandstand view.
as our captain cuts speed to negotiate the pass, we become a welcome diversion for the local seals and sea lions.
they follow us with the joyful expectancy of those who've been waiting for a ship to run aground for years.
with less than six feet to spare beneath her keel, the puerto eden sails through the kirke pass with aplomb and a blast of self-satisfaction.
we believe that this form of operating secretly is from the days of the spanish conquest.
- it was a kind of a resistance to scare them.
- the cueca is one of the oldest dances of chile.
the man plays the strutting cockerel and the woman the playful hen.
the remains of two million people lie here, lodged in every kind of property from an earth mound to a marble palace.
such is the demand for space that a rental system operates.
this dark, unhappy period of chilean history is remembered by the most powerful memorial of them all.
a wall of marble bears the names of those victims who have been identified.
400 miles due west of valparaiíso is one of chile's most remote possessions, a volcanic speck in the pacific called the juan fernandez islands.
this is the start of the chilean winter and our flight has twice been postponed.
the runway will accommodate a light aeroplane if the wind's in the right direction.
we all breathe a sigh of relief when we're safely down and heading for the terminal.
the main road from the airport starts well on the hard volcanic rock, but peters out at a rocky bay full of basking seals.
from here, with a bit of luck, a local boatman will take us around the coast to the only town.
alexander selkirk was a thoroughly unpleasant character who deserved all he got.
but after spending four minutes in a cave where he spent four years,
it's time to move north again, from the fertile centre of chile to the bare and spectacular landscape of the atacama desert.
trapped between the high andes and the cold, rainless offshore current, there are places in the atacama where no rain has ever fallen.
nothing moves in this petrified landscape day after day after day.
but not far below the surface, there is plenty going on.
at el tatio, in the mountains above the desert, the earth's crust bubbles and boils and geysers belch steam like factory chimneys.
well, contrary to appearances, this great jacuzzi of a landscape is actually set in a very, very cold part of the andes.
which is, i think, the highest i've ever been in my life.
and, fortunately, the earth has provided its own natural warming device, which is just a blowhole.
shovels lift 60 tons at a time and fill dump trucks high as a two-storey house.
each of these tyres that are rolling over our cameraman cost $12,000.
in fact, it's a lot smaller than most of us had expected.
some passengers are local, some have come from countries far away.
we're to cross the andes on a rail bus built for the branch lines of munich 30 years ago.
from the world's tiniest galley, two of our three-man bolivian crew produce the first of several hot dinners.
at one point, it climbs a thousand feet every three miles.
all this land used to belong to bolivia, but chile seized it in 1884.
water is pumped through a plastic pipe which runs the length of the track.
in this shadeless, treeless desert, the nine o'clock from arica has developed a considerable thirst.
three and a half hours after leaving the pacific, we're at 10,000 feet and still climbing.
freight wagons from the mineral mines of the andes are a reminder of how vital this railway is.
in a land of harsh climate and impassable mountains, this is the only lifeline.
it's also my first taste of the altiplano, the high plateau of the andes, where the air is thin and simple things suddenly become difficult.
six and half hours and a few llamas after leaving arica, we've reached the bolivian border.
it's only 130 miles from the pacific, but everything is different.
it's the poorest country in south america - the walls are made of mud and the soldiers' uniforms are a shocking contrast to their crisp counterparts in chile.
maybe it's bolivia or another miraculously produced dinner, but everyone's started talking to each other.
coca-leaf tea is illegal in chile, but up here, two and a half miles high, it's a tried and tested way to soften the effect of altitude.
a few hours later, the lights of la paz twinkle below us.
there's a shrine to the virgin in the cathedral back there.
also you're expected to do a pilgrimage if you come here in honour of the virgin...
past the stations of the cross - this is number three - up to the top of the hill, cerro calvario.
and as i started at just over 12,500 feet, it's a test of faith, i tell you.
before them, the incas believed that the sun god, creator of the world, sprang from the bottomless blue waters of lake titicaca.
the lake straddles the two countries of bolivia and peru, and at san pablo tiquina, its narrowest point, there's a ferry service.
vehicles go on one boat and foot passengers on another, both under the beady eye of don eduardo avaroa, whose likeness on the quayside must qualify as one of the world's least impressive statues.
it's a gesture of defiance rather than glory, for in the war that it commemorates, bolivia lost its entire pacific coastline to chile.
0n the other side of the water lies the nerve centre of the bolivian navy.
undaunted by losing their coastline, they maintain a strong presence on the bolivian half of the lake.
this is the portsmouth of lake titicaca, and some of the fleet, at least, is in.
these patrol boats may only be needed to keep an eye on smugglers, but they're symbols of bolivian hopes that one day their pacific property will be returned and lake titicaca will no longer be their only coastline.
the skills of the indian boat-builders are kept alive by the esteban family.
the head of the family, paulino esteban, helped the norwegian explorer thor heyerdahl construct two reed boats which they sailed across the atlantic.
it doesn't waste fuel, costs nothing to run, and is made from constantly renewable resources, which i suppose explains why they're dying out.
unfortunately, there are no boats to take us across to peru.
a dirt road gives way to a cobbled road, which vibrates us gently through the village of kasani towards our 14th international border.
this may look like a farmyard entrance, but this chain separates bolivia from the world or, in this case, from peru.
in all my travelling, it's the least daunting border i've come across.
but still, chain or no chain, formalities have to be gone through.
because we're the only people crossing out of bolivia, they're delighted to see us and make sure the formalities last as long as possible.
four hours later, there's nothing more they can think of to keep us here.
it was run on dried llama droppings, the only fuel available.
when the crew reached any little port, they had to hurry ashore with their bags and fill them up and fill up the cargo hold.
we are climbing steadily now towards the top of the pass - over 14,000 feet above sea level.
the dry grassland may look unexceptional, but, geographically, this is one of the key points in all of south america.
in the marshland here, just at the watershed of the andes, is where the urubamba river rises which becomes the amazon.
it's the river we'll be following for the next three weeks right through peru and, hopefully, to the borders of colombia where it is the amazon river.
they were the last of a series of civilisations that flourished in these mountains hidden from the world until the first europeans found their way here 450 years ago.
]cuzco - founded by the incas who called it "the navel of the earth".
they made it the centre of their sun worship until the spanish conquerors arrived and stamped their own mark on the city.
we've arrived in the middle of the catholic festival of corpus christi.
the fact remains that fewer than 200 spaniards overthrew the inca empire.
now a largely indian population parades the statues of european saints.
the spanish not only grafted their festivals onto existing ceremonies, but built their churches on top of inca temples.
the inca walls have withstood all the great earthquakes to shake the city and many of cuzco's streets are still built on inca foundations.
watered by the urubamba, fields produce 360 varieties of potatoes and rich crops of maize and barley.
farming here is not high tech - horses are still used for threshing, though sheaves of barley have been successfully fitted with legs.
at the end of the valley, where the river disappears into ravines, the incas built granaries on the side of the mountains where the grain would be kept cool, dry and safe.
they built a temple, too, and a system of terraces from which, in 1536, the army of manco inca gave the spaniards a rare bloody nose.
all this served an empire that lasted little more than a century.
up a side valley, a road laid less than two years ago leads to villages where the purest descendants of the incas still live.
they dress as they have done for hundreds of years and speak the language of the incas.
this must have been how it was before the spaniards came.
the outside world has found them out and for the people here, the future could be different.
the pacific coast of peru is largely barren and thick with cold sea mist at this time of year.
i've been given the address of a pub in cuzco run by an englishman living in peru.
in between pulling pints, barry walker runs a travel outfit, and he's prepared to take us on.
the line runs out of cuzco in a series of zigzags, for the sides of "the navel of the earth" are very steep.
the city itself lies at 11,000 feet and we have to climb another 1,000 feet just to get out of it.
the railway runs alongside the urubamba river, following its twisting course through gorges that grow steeper and steeper.
70 miles from cuzco, there rises above us one of the great cities of the world.
one reason is because the sacred urubamba river down here does almost a complete loop right around the ruins here.
this promontory looks out over this astounding mountain scenery in the cloud forest.
machu picchu has a powerful presence, a sense of mystery that makes the hairs stand up on your neck as you walk amongst living quarters that seem so recently abandoned.
no one knows for sure what happened here, why the city was built and why it was deserted so soon.
the mountains that surround machu picchu are good at keeping secrets.
0nly the cloud on their summits indicates the rainforest that lies beyond.
at the end of a long day, we reach the end of the trail.
the grubby little settlement of kiteni, where the main street is a patch of waste ground and there's a whiff of sewage in the air.
about 50 miles upstream, it passes out of the andes and into the amazon basin, but first we must negotiate rapids that run through a ravine known to the indians as the pongo de manaique.
we've watched the urubamba growing from a muddy bog in a mountain field to a river that will be our way home.
we set out on what are for most of us completely uncharted waters.
just to make me feel more nervous, barry makes me don a life jacket.
if there's too much water, boats can be swept out of control.
if there's too little, rocks and shoals close to the surface can flip us over.
maybe it's understandable - on tributaries higher up the river, there are indian tribes who've only just come into contact with white men.
as we draw closer to the pongo, the clouds build up, the trees grow taller, and barry comes over all ornithological.
not particularly the birds, doing a new river, but the birds are very interesting.
right here, there are more species of bird per square mile than anywhere else on the planet.
peru has about 1,700 species and a lot of them are concentrated in this forest here.
are there any bird species that are "intelligent" in the sense that they interact with man?
ahead of us, the pongo looks more and more like the entrance to a dark, threatening tunnel.
the river turns from glassy smooth to fast and slippery, as the level falls sharply and we begin to slide down the last few miles of the andes.
i expected the pongo to be dangerous, but never to be so beautiful.
rocks, which look as if they've been blasted apart, rise from the river like the buttresses of some half-submerged cathedral.
after the noise and chaos of the rapids, the river has fallen still and quiet.
the only sound is from the water pouring out of the jungle, carving a weird and wonderful architecture on the canyon walls.
in the pongo de manaique, i feel i've come as close as i ever will to a lost world.
the dramatic beauty of the pongo passes in less than half an hour.
river travel, i've decided, is one per cent beauty and 99 per cent practicality.
the need to eat, sleep and dry out plays havoc with your sense of wonder.
there is no other way through the forest and we have nearly a week of river travel ahead of us.
0ur guide, barry walker, can barely take the binoculars from his eyes.
if you're a bird-spotter like barry, then peru, with 2,000 species, is a land of opportunity.
the forest is attracting attention for more than its natural beauty, as i'm soon to find out.
the village is being swept for the feast of st john the baptist.
missionaries must have come through here as well as oil men.
the boots seem rather unevenly distributed, but it makes for some interesting tackles.
in the next match, between the women, there's not a football boot to be seen and the game's a lot more exciting.
children here grow up hoping that one day they'll be as good as their mothers.
half-time refreshment is a bowl of masato, a festive tipple made from the fermented juice of the yucca plant.
at the festive meal, the families gather round, grace is spoken and they tuck into the day's delicacy, tapir meat wrapped in banana leaves.
the presence of plastic bowls, containers and t-shirts show the village is modernising.
but it does have an airstrip and there are no queues at the terminal.
a russian-built cargo plane puts down here every now and then with military and civilian supplies for this jungle outpost.
we fly north over a vast, largely unbroken swathe of forest.
it's a 600-mile journey that would have taken ten days by boat.
it's the dry season and the world's greatest river is low, scarcely reaching the bank on which the city's built.
for a place surrounded by jungle and with no road communication with the rest of peru, lquitos is surprisingly stylish.
it owes most of its faded charm to the rubber boom of the 1880s.
the new houses of the rubber barons showed 0ld world taste.
yes, the city provides electricity, as you can see here, the wiring.
they also have potable water, but there is no sewage system here yet.
the city council wants to move people out, but the locals refuse to go.
they like their shops and their market, and there are things you'd never find in safeway.
ten years ago, frenchman didier lacasse came to the rainforest to research the healing properties of jungle plants.
he stayed, set up a medicinal garden and has become a shaman, a traditional healer.
despite the intensity of the experience, didier has allowed us to film what goes on.
now he's drunk the ayahuasca, i ask him how long he'll feel able to answer my questions.
it's the skill of the shaman to be able to control this flow of energy, of hallucination, that would turn someone else crazy, probably.
so we learn how to control that craziness, if you can say that.
didier's style may be unfamiliar, but the powerful properties of the plants are not in dispute.
the rainforest is alive with drug companies looking for the secrets.
she makes a weekly trip downriver and will take us to the colombian border, now only 300 miles away.
it's hot, it's cramped, but a childhood dream has come true.
deforestation has reduced rainfall here by 120 per cent in a generation.
and if there's oil and gas to be found, more trees will have to go.
the unceasing heat of the days and the hothouse stickiness of the nights saps the energy.
before the river lulls us into total lethargy, it's time to move on.
after three weeks on the peruvian river system, we've now reached a crossroads.
the amazon has brought us to peru on this side, brazil over there and colombia over there.
we board a plane to take us across the equator to bogotá.
we could be said to have swapped one jungle for another.
the united states and europe are blamed for the drug trafficking problem because of demand there.
what the colombian government ignores is the level of substance abuse, drugs and alcohol.
there is money, but those who have it are not prepared to share.
tim, i've been recommended a rather eccentric restaurant called margarita del ocho.
it's owned by the ochoa family who are renowned for their involvement in the medellin cartel, drug traffickers.
i was warned against them when there was an attempt to kill me for another documentary.
i ask if a demonstration of horsemanship is on the cards.
he seems delighted to be asked, though it throws his bodyguards into a spin.
they appear from all sides and rush to help him up, at least two to each limb.
the raising of don fabio is not an elegant sight, but once he's in the saddle, he's a changed man.
there are believed to be a dozen armed guerrilla groups operating there, each seeking to control its own area of influence.
0ne of the bitterest battles was fought for control of this mountain, cosquez.
3,500 people lost their lives in the fighting, but then the stakes were high.
this is the colombian wild west, the largest, richest, most dangerous emerald mine in the world.
cosquez mountain is being slowly and painstakingly ripped apart in the search for emeralds.
they call this "black land", and a lot of hard work goes into finding very little.
at the bottom of the mountain, beyond the company fences, a stream runs out of the mine.
here the guaqueros, the scavengers, can sift through the crumbs from the rich man's table.
in almost intolerable heat and discomfort, men, women and even children scour the black silt for a glimpse of something that might change their lives.
crowds cluster round the head of the stream like rescuers at the scene of a disaster.
at the top of the mountain, the guaqueros have a shanty community, with shops, bars, kitchens, cafes, brothels and banks.
it's up here that the most important part of the process takes place - the buying and selling.
hundreds of emerald dealers in four-wheel drives grind up the mountain each morning.
those who've struck lucky bargain with the hard men from bogotá.
the guerrillas and drug barons don't seem interested in what colombians call the zona cafetera - coffee country.
i hitch a ride in one of the american army jeeps they call willys.
they use them to carry coffee beans from the plantations to the markets, and occasionally to help travellers down from the mountains to the sea.
the coffee country around armenia lies about 3,000 feet above sea level.
it's lower and warmer than bogotá, but positively chilly compared to the thick tropical heat of our next destination, cartagena.
cartagena de indias is one of the best-preserved colonial cities on the continent.
cathedrals and churches were built to thank the almighty for being on spain's side.
with wealth came a desire to run their own affairs, and the first south american state independent of spain was set up here by simón boliívar, the liberator, in 1811.
protected by its great sea walls, the houses of the old town haven't changed much in 300 years.
it's a shock to find that it's like this because of neglect, because the developers could make more money building a new town nearby than by messing about with the old.
grandmothers watch appreciatively as groins are clutched, faces punched, arms wrenched.
their grandchildren can't wait to grow up and get in there too.
0nce it was a dazzling aztec citadel, full of canals and palaces.
then the spanish conquerors built the centre of their american empire here.
for the few lucky ones, there has always been prosperity at the centre of it all.
today huge investment, mostly from the usa, has taken the place of the wealth the spanish left behind.
cathedral bells sound over the zocalo, the square that is the heart of the city and a good place for a quiet start to the day.
but, this being mexico, there's no such thing as a quiet start to the day.
before the spaniards brought over sheep, cows and goats, the staple food seems to have been insects.
delicacies include baby grasshoppers, mosquito eggs, fried beetles and the chef's speciality, gusanos.
with nearly 40,000 miles on the clock, fatigue is creeping in and dreams of home are becoming more frequent.
mexico is split between the hispanics, whose ancestors were european, and the indians, whose predecessors were from asia, and who, many believe, crossed the bering strait when it was still land.
maize is the basis of tortillas, the staple diet of rural mexico.
with ten mouths to feed, guadeloupe must make 80 a day.
from their village north of mexico city, we head across the country to the pacific coast and the american border, 1,000 miles away.
tijuana is always painted as the victim, a town of easy virtue.
very sad, you know, because don't forget, all this used to be mexico.
arturo espinosa shows me the risks that mexicans and others are prepared to take to climb out of poverty and into the land of opportunity.
i think it's a big mistake, you know, but... they do.
is it just young guys, or do women and children go under?
30 million people pass over it in a year and the salesmen are ready for them.
the gauntlet of souvenir stalls, row upon row of international junk, feels like an ominous warning of what is to come as i step from the third world into the first.
aliens attempting to enter with fraudulent documents will be detained for a hearing before an immigration judge.
re-entry after exclusion... (michael) before i go very far into the us, curiosity compels me to look at the border from the other side.
unlike the pollos, we're free to go north, into california, the richest state of the richest country in the world.
for the 32 million people who live here, it's the ultimate realisation of the american dream.
(radl0) new help may be on the way for women with bladder control problems.
(michael) tur makes a living by swooping from the air to snatch the news from his rivals.
he was the first on the scene when 0j simpson was chased down the freeways.
from an office in santa monica airport, his wife marika monitors emergency service frequencies and guides the helicopter to the scene of the next crisis.
he couldn't make it to the airport, so he decided to put it down on the freeway.
the pilot is waving up in the air, ecstatic that he's safe.
you can see the hollywood sign and above it that tower that we can see so brilliantly at night.
they have to repaint it white every so often because people think it's fun to tag it and put graffiti on it.
we have a terrible accident here in sun valley, the 5 freeway southbound.
we have a big rig that pinned a small automobile against the central divider.
the only positive thing i can think about this appalling scene is that there are very few countries that would allow tur the freedom to show that things like this actually go on.
compared to the freeways, the pacific coast highway is as quiet as an english country lane.
by picking strawberries in john steinbeck country they can earn $1.40 a box, a fortune back home.
it is no surprise that over 90 per cent of the fruit crop in california is picked by immigrants.
0nly a short way from the temples of pleasure is the temple of punishment, alcatraz island.
separated from the mainland by just over a mile of fierce currents and icy water, it was regarded as the ultimate in incarceration.
apart from spells in the punishment block, this was their view of the world for 17 and a half hours of every day.
both were glad they didn't have a cell with this view.
(jim) that's about as far from the truth as you can possibly get.
(michael) jim was one of the few who tried to escape from alcatraz.
i don't think... according to the numbers that i am most familiar with,
i would say probably no more than two per cent of the department.
each of these panels represents an individual that has been lost to the aids epidemic.
30 other countries have their own quilt with this group's blessing.
0ur first canadian train is pulled by one of the locomotives that used to haul expresses right across the country 60 years ago.
i'm told that because there are so few people here, you can flag trains down like buses.
after that, thank god, all i have to do is watch as the loggers show us 101 things you can do to a tree.
(tannoy)... get through that wood faster than they normally would go.
the remote grandeur of the rockies, the raw power of the fraser river are no match for my overwhelming desire to get back to diomede and close the circle.
the further north we go, the more limited our transport options become.
there is no regular passenger boat going further north than skagway.
we must use an aircraft to take us on, via anchorage, to the edge of the continent.
we anticipate reduced visibility on the other side of the front.
we expect some warm air to be brought in, which is just going to bring more fog.
i think my family are sort of aware now that it's better to have have a husband or father who's fulfilled rather than frustrated.
and, as i do enjoy the journeys, they accept that i'm away for a certain period of time, that's what i do.
i find that having done the journey, i then have quite a long period at home writing the book or the commentary.
i probably, over a long period, spend more time at home than most people with a nine-to-five job.
so it kind of balances out, but... um i am restless, but i do enjoy the sheer pleasure of sitting at a table staring into the middle distance with a glass of beer and not having to think about anything.
when i started "around the world in 80 days", i took lots of phrase books with me and tried to make sure that i had a few phrases for each country.
then you're in dubai or something like that, and then you're in india.
um... and what i do now is i try to just have a phrase for, "good morning", "hello", "i'm english", "sorry", which are all you really need to say,
rather than attempt to really learn the language or give a full frontal assault on the language.
because that's really quite tricky and you can get very easily tripped up.
i think that puts a barrier between myself, the person i'm interviewing and the viewer.
so that's why we tend to interview people who have a certain amount of english or interview people who i can understand a certain amount of, so i can translate it myself.
one bite of durian and the whole plane just sort of stinks for weeks.
i had to experiment eating that, and it's fine once you eat it.
it's a bit like, i suppose the chinese and certainly the japanese, whose standards of food are absolutely so high that you rarely have anything bad to eat there, but cheese, they don't know about at all.
so i suppose, to them, a slab of stilton would be what durian is to us - something absolutely foul.
they make it for a festival, the festival of st john.
"and very often they cut down almost the entire sugar crop around a village to ferment this,
i don't think i would, but i did, and that's part of the enjoyment of these journeys.
you have to sometimes forget about your inhibitions and throw caution to the winds.
it was wonderful to get this japanese girl sending these beautiful letters with little drawings of the knights of the holy grail and all that.
and so, when we were going to tokyo, the director said, "it's a big city.
it wasn't awkward, as it might be between a fan and the person she idolised, i suppose.
i have to say, since we've done the programme, i haven't heard from her at all.
maybe i was a terrible disappointment but, anyway, if you do see this, mayumi, write and tell me if you enjoyed it or not.
the psychic surgery in the philippines was one of the more bizarre things i've been involved in filming.
basically, there are these healers in a certain part of the philippines, traditional healers, so, presumably, whatever techniques or skills they have have been handed down over generations.
so, you know, they're highly regarded and... people do believe that they can actually um... take out bits of your body without cutting the skin in any way.
nothing very big, but like a sort of bit of tissue and that's then thrown away.
i have to say, the first man we went to, i really didn't believe it.
there was something about him which seemed almost too unlikely that he could do this.
the second man we went to was less of a showman.
one of the things that i suppose you could say made this journey different from the others - or one of the many things - but a particular difference was that there was an emergency for me to deal with at home.
i tend to just go and, you know, i ring home whenever i can and, generally, it's me talking on about, "oh, i've seen a volcano!"
they're not head-hunters now, but they were iban people who were head-hunters before.
we got back to kuching, got back to the hotel, and i was given a message as i checked in...
well, we'd never had to deal with anything like that before in the family, and we'd never...
i'd never had to deal with it at such a distance.
he'd given instructions for me to ring him at any time and he'd tell me what he was going to do.
there was the tiniest risk, but, basically, it was straightforward brain surgery.
still, the words "brain surgery" and "tumour" frightened me a lot and i was stunned by that.
i went downstairs and stephen's call had been because his daughter, who was only a few months old, had fallen from a first-floor window.
and she, it turns out in the end, hadn't been too badly hurt, but she'd been quite, you know, knocked about.
so these two double blows had happened out of the blue like that, and, you know... you feel completely shaken, 'cause your natural instinct is to want to be with your wife or your daughter or whatever,
and yet, obviously, to get home would have been probably two days' travelling.
what helped me was partly 'cause helen said, "look, don't rush back.
um... and the surgeon who operated on helen was absolutely brilliant.
i rang him up, as he'd said, two or three times, usually from completely remote places.
and, one time, we were in a place called yogyakarta in java.
i rang him up and he said what would happen and it was fine and he talked about it.
i've got to go now 'cause we're filming a gamelan orchestra."
i went on to say, "it's a special kind of music." he said, "gamelan?" and i said, "yes."
"i'm one of the few people in england who's part of a gamelan orchestra."
by extraordinary coincidence, the surgeon actually played in a gamelan orchestra in potters bar or somewhere like that, so that sort of made me feel closer to him.
we went back home for about four days, and then flew back out to carry on filming in australia.
unfortunately, as soon as i got back home, as often happens,
um... now, i always find that usually the poorer people are the people who are much more... hospitable and welcoming and more willing to share with you.
the richer the people you encounter, the more guarded they are, the more careful, the more likely to ask you where this will go out and will they be shown up?
so they didn't have much, but they had a great strength.
some of the older villages - like in china - had been unchanged for many years.
put them beside the big cities in china and these places had no money at all, yet they were very strong communities.
they've learnt to live together and help each other out, and that very often happens with the poorest people.
i suppose, in certain areas, i don't know why in colombia and south america, for instance,
i found the poverty there really... hard to deal with because there was no real comeback from people.
the poor were allowed up to this fence to see if they could find any residue.
i can just remember seeing people scrabbling in the dirt there, trying to extract something that would be worth selling, something that might make them as rich as the people up above.
there were people there, you know, who were poor and desperate at the same time.
but i think there is a danger of using words like "the poor" or "poverty"
suddenly we flew from leticia, which is right on the amazon, in the heart of the jungle.
we flew to bogotá and found ourselves in a wonderful hotel.
in many ways, bogotá is a very civilised, modern city with a strong middle class.
they've got bookshops and coffee stalls and all that sort of thing.
so, in one way, i felt fairly comfortable there, but it does have a reputation for gangsterism.
there has been a problem with law and order there for a long time, corruption and all that.
we did deliberately target the really hard drug-taking area - calle cartouche, bullet street - with a journalist from "the guardian" who'd been there a long time.
we'd not seen anywhere like this nor had we been able to find someone to interpret it for us.
he'd lived in colombia a long time, knew and liked the colombians, so he showed us this area.
that was one of the few places where we've had rocks thrown at the car and, at one point, there was a gunshot heard.
there were horses everywhere and waiters would come to your tables.
they wouldn't serve you from a horse, but they'd nearly get knocked over.
so i was suddenly thrust in there and i was given a few phrases in spanish to ask him.
and there he was - the great... this great figure, this man, this extraordinary sort of powerful, notorious character in colombia.
"like me to get on a horse?" "well, stay sitting there." so we said yes.
this had obviously been planned, but he was a big man and he wasn't well and he couldn't get onto the horse unaided, so about 20 of his henchmen rush around and hoist him onto the horse.
here was this great sort of godfather being lifted on, and he goes slightly the other side, and someone steadies him.
i thought, this is just so embarrassing, really, that someone should be reduced to this.
they obviously thought it was a great laugh to have somebody like me around, coming into their programme.
they'd written a part specially for me with the surfboard, and it was indeed transmitted.
forget all the serious arts programmes they should have been watching.
"home and away" was the big cult programme for oxford undergraduates then.
there seems to be something... that goes wrong for us at the end of journeys.
it happened on "around the world in 80 days" when we got back to london feeling triumphant.
and then "pole to pole" - we nearly got to the end.
the great climax was going to be this ship across the southern oceans.
i felt that, as we made our way up the coast of america, and the last programme, everything seemed to be going very smoothly, be very easy.
you were in canada where everything works and the train takes you along, and the last part of the journey seemed to be... as easy as it possibly could be.
we'd be taken on an american coast guard cutter to the island of diomede.
not in a rowing boat, not in a walrus boat like we'd set out on.
this was a... whatever it was - a 12,000-ton, fully equipped american coast guard cutter.
and then the weather came down and... even this ship couldn't get close.
people did say in the bering strait the weather can change very quickly, and it did.
we were marooned for a while on the mainland near a place called wales.
i remembered, really, from the first time we'd been there, how sheer those cliff walls are.
diomede rises like a peak of a mountain out of the middle of the bering strait, so there's not a flat beach or anything like that.
so, in the end, what we experienced on this coast guard cutter prevented us from completing the full circle, but it did show the full anger and wrath of the weather in that part of the world.
this is the skyline of beautiful downtown nome - the first city on our journey.
these were actually built for the new york elevated railway in 1882.
they were going to run through new york, and they end up in alaska, rotting, never used.
this is one of the most haunting and haunted places i've ever visited.
it's butugychag - a gulag that closed in 1953 in the kolyma region of siberia.
i'm here with a survivor who was once imprisoned here, ivan ilych yakovlev.
as soon as we get there, he tosses sweets around as a memorial to all the deceased comrades.
what would you have done to end up somewhere like this?
(translat0r) for the smallest transgression the authorities would put you in here.
could you ask him what time people started work and how long they worked for?
(translat0r) we used to get up at six in the morning.
this was at the end of a long day's filming, which started at five - filming the kodo drummers exercising.
it was nearly nine o'clock when this was being prepared and i could see the crew standing there slavering with hunger.
this rather medical shot shows me at work in the typical japanese bath.
the system here is that you wash yourself thoroughly before getting into the water.
from sado island on the west coast of japan to tokyo.
and here is my guide, mayumi nobetsu, who, believe it or not, is my number one japanese fan.
it's a bit like asking a japanese to appear in the royal tournament the day he arrives.
they've been practising for a long time to get this right.
so i don't quite know what i'm going to do in it.
i'm assured it will be a low-level job, carrying a flag.
the great thing in japan - everything has to be just so and absolutely right.
you can't just get away with a pair of old timberlands.
in fact, they've really never tasted real western food, so they don't know what western food is.
according to my knowledge, they don't like foreign food at all.
the gorge you can see there is called the little gorges of the danning river.
these are some of the most beautiful parts of the yangtze and all will be submerged beneath about 300-400 feet of water when the yangtze dam fills up.
you've got to remember you've got 50 metres of trucks behind you.
at one point, i asked scott whether he ever hit kangaroos.
all sorts of things nothing to do with sheep and that's what i'll show you.
but i thought right at the beginning, these are the sheep.
so we walk on before her and we stand either side of the stage facing each other.
she's gonna walk down, we cross these, and when she comes down, we lift them up, they move through and we hold them up.
after this, i was briefly offered the part of snow white in a christmas panto in invercargill.
extraordinary. 0n the banks of one of the amazon tributaries, the urubamba, some interesting tourist goods on offer.
until we put the fence out 340 feet in the water, it was a big crossing.
this is the "tortilla curtain" - the border wall between mexico on the left and the usa on the right.
here to explain it is ron henley of us border control.
so most of the people that are coming across have their little sacks with them and everything they own is in it.
this is very well patrolled - with helicopters and boats - and the border patrol has a boat patrol.
so if we get an inclination that this is happening, we'll take steps to counter that.
they've got a couple of people they've taken into custody and they're looking for one more.
what they do is just sit them on the ground and fan out until they find the other person.
but we know where all the sensors are, so when the dispatcher calls it out, we'll say that that's a border patrol agent - we have a code for that.
we have two people in custody and we have another one that we're looking for.
i think we took this out because it looked like a commercial break.
i am having a good time on the pacific coast highway in a morgan sports car - not my own.
we've had two million hits and we've only been open three weeks.
it's nice to have been dead so long, but people are still...
i went on the "tonight" show to announce i wasn't mike.
i wore a t-shirt of you and said, "this is mike and this is me." i still get mistaken.
but as time went by... most of the great forests were destroyed.
those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts... who owed their allegiance to the great forest spirit... for those were the days of gods... and of demons.
there is evil at work in the land to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
it's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here for all these years... but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker... with each generation.
they'll wait till we're asleep, and then they'll slit our throats.
what do you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?
so, the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers, but then...
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
it's where the spirit of the forest dwells, and it's a very dangerous place for humans.
- if yakul's not afraid... then we have nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful to you for bringing these men back to us, stranger... but something doesn't smell right.
you got back here almost as fast as we did, and through the forbidden forest.
yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed!
actually, if it's not too much trouble, ladies, i would like to see where you work.
see, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
so then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain... but nago wasn't going to stand for that.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar... rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
i fought with him, and for that i was cursed with this mark on my arm... and soon it will kill me.
this is the latest rifle that i've asked these people to design.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
how much more hatred and pain do you think we need?
yes, i'm the one who shot the boar, and i'm sorry that you suffer.
i'm the one he should have put a curse on, not you.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
you would do that, kill the very heart of the forest?
without that ancient god, the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
- princess of the spirits... of ghouls, beasts and ancient gods.
the wolves stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me.
we've got a letter of pardon from the emperor... forgiving us for cutting off the head of the great forest spirit.
the legends tell us that when day becomes night... the forest spirit turns into the nightwalker... and at sunrise, it changes back.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
my lord okkoto... what i said about nago's death was the truth.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
o mighty lord, is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
i do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies... it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
- well, i've got the emperor... breathing down my neck, and you're busy playing war with lord asano.
and you would have nothing to do with lord asano being here, now, would you?
once the forest spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
will jigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
they didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us.
okkoto's badly wounded, but he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the forest spirit.
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm going to try to return his head before he kills us all.
where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
there is evil at work in the land to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
it's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers.
when i came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village.
but then there must have been a flood or a landslide or a fire.
i'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him.
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
if yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest.
yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.
actually, if it's not too much trouble, ladies, i would like to see where you work.
then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
the problem was, before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest, and that's what made the boar angry.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
i fought with him, and for that i was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
these will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armor.
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
you know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.
all that'll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human.
we've got a letter of pardon from the emperor, forgiving us for cutting off the head of the great forest spirit.
the legends tell us that when day becomes night, the forest spirit turns into the nightwalker, and at sunrise, it changes back.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
my lord okkoto, what i said about nago's death was the truth.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.

o mighty lord, is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
i do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
well, you know, it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around.
remember, my dear lady, we're after a god, not just a beast.
once the forest spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
will jigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
they didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us.
he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the forest spirit.
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all.
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
without fear of our disease she washed our rotting fesh, bandaged us...
it grieves us that a demon has come from our tribe.
lord okkoto... do you know how i may lift the curse?
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
i know this, but i beg you not to kill this lady.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
it is said the blood of the deer god will cure disease.
it could cure these people, and perhaps even lift your curse.
[man narrating] in ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
my prince, are you prepared to learn... what fate the stones have foretold you?
yes, i was prepared the very moment that i let my arrow fly.
some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
now our last prince must cut his hair and leave us, never to return?
but this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman!
however, if it's money you want, i'll pay for the rice and take this nugget off your hands.
what to you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest.
we risked our lives to bring you the rice... you're all eating tonight, so watch your mouth.
and who made the iron that paid for that rice, huh?
see, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
i fought with him, and for that i was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me.
this is the latest rifle that i've asked these people to design.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
how much more hatred and pain do you think we need?
yes, i'm the one who shot the boar, and i'm sorry that you suffer.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
if it would lift the curse, i'd let it tear you apart, but even that wouldn't end the killing now, would it?
without that ancient god the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
when the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out, this desolate place will be the richest land in the world, and princess mononoke will become human.
but it sure beats working a brothel in the city, huh?
here we get to eat as much as we want, and the men don't bother us!
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
this is what it does when it catches hold of you.
it's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me!
you know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.
all that'll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human.
if you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
first it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
i do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
they're much easier to kill than moro and her wolf cubs,
so you can call out that shady bunch you've got hidden under the cliff,jigo.
once the forest spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
willjigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
they didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us.
he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all.
he's here right now, trying to tell us something, that it's time for us both to live.
ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but i can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and made him a monster.
when i tried to stop him, i was left with this scar: a curse unto death.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
without fear of our disease she washed our rotting flesh, bandaged us...
to go on in this manner is to end as game the humans hunt for meat.
to risk all on a final battle is to play into human hands.
a mound will be raised and funeral rites performed on this ground where you have fallen
pass on in peace and bear us no hatred soon all of you will feel my hate and suffer as i have suffered
are you prepared to learn what fate the stones have foretold you?
i was prepared the very moment that i let my arrow fly
i came to give you this so you won't forget your little sister
i can't take this to protect you so you won'tforget you know i could never forget you
i was caught in that battle i saw what you did to those samurai
you fight like a demon where'd you learn to fight like that?
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar
i followed its trail westward through the mountains to where the samurai were attacking those villagers
i'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here and it's a very dangerous place for humans
there's a lovely trail back across the river and your friend's injuries are very bad he doesn't have a chance
are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
that's unfair and untrue but i'm glad he's safe and sound
that's a relief i was starting to think i'd done something wrong by bringing him back home
i've seen cattle that looked better stranger why don't you come over to our place?
you don't want to stay in this stinking old barn woman!
we risked our lives to bring you the rice so watch your mouth huh?
tell me that we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed
lady eboshi goes around buying the contract of every brothel girl she can find that's all old man
it's true everything here has turned upside-down since she showed up that woman
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron if you don't mind my asking?
i believe you'll recognize this rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster and soon it will kill me
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy
these will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armor young man lady eboshi wants to rule the world
i'm sorry to have to push you all so hard that'll be nice
first you steal the boar's forest from him and then transform him into a demon
here i am there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves you little witch!
stop this you know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them something even worse than human
we plant trees humans tear them up the forest does not come back we will save the forest
there he is come and see hurry you idiots it's the nightwalker you know we can't it's a sin to look at it
ha and you call yourself the greatest hunter in the west forgiving us for cutting off the head of the great forest spirit it changes back
one day he attacked our village look at my hand where he touched me
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me but the demon mark remains
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
leave this forest for the next time we meet i will have to kill you
go and spread the word we'll be moving out presently sir
jigo and you're busy playing war with lord asano would you?
they'll fight forest gods or samurai it doesn't matter to them your girls they were wasted in the brothels
impressive for a piece of paper it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around not just a beast come here what is it?
then i would have bitten your head off to silence you
it's a beautiful forest are okkoto and the boars on the move yet?
they threw their baby at my feet as they ran away
i raised her as my own beautiful daughter is neither human nor wolf
okkoto is too stubborn he won't listen none of them will
they may even know it's a trap the boars are a proud race
my orders are no outsiders permitted here but i've just come from irontown
i have a message for lady eboshi tell me where i can find her
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the forest spirit
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side
i'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all hurry!
san that it's time for us both to live but i can't forgive the humans for what they've done and i'll go help them rebuild irontown
i'll always be near yakul and i will come and visit you all right?
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
without fear of our disease she washed our rotting fesh, bandaged us...
it grieves us that a demon has come from our tribe.
lord okkoto... do you know how i may lift the curse?

more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
without fear of our disease she washed our rotting fesh, bandaged us...
it grieves us that a demon has come from our tribe.
lord okkoto... do you know how i may lift the curse?
in ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
there is evil at work in the land to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
it's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers.
when i came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village.
but then there must have been a flood or a landslide or a fire.
i'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him.
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
if yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest.
yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.
actually, if it's not too much trouble, ladies, i would like to see where you work.
then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
the problem was, before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest, and that's what made the boar angry.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
i fought with him, and for that i was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
these will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armor.
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
if you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.

first it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
o mighty lord, is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
leave this forest... for the next time we meet i will have to kill you.
well, i've got the emperor breathing down my neck, and you're busy playing war with lord asano.
and you would have nothing to do with lord asano being here, now, would you?
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
keep after them, but stay out of sight or you'll frighten the forest spirit away.
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all.
more than 500 years have passed... since the emperor drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades... and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and made him a monster.
when i tried to stop him, i was left with this scar, a curse unto death.
i understand your rage and grief... but i beg you not to kill our lady.
she is the only person who ever treated us as human.

in ancient times the land lay covered in forests where from ages long past dwelt the spirits of the gods.
back then men and beast lived in harmony, but this time went by most of the great forests were destroyed those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts who owed their religions to the great forest spirit for those were the days of gods and of demons.
o nameless god of rage and heat i bow before you.
a mound will be raised and funeral rites before on this ground where you have fallen.
he had some kind of a poison inside him driving him mad
a poisonous hatred that consumed his heart and flesh... and turned him into a demon monster
my prince, are you prepared to learn what fate the stones have told you
yes, i was prepared the very moment that i let my arrow fly
you fight like a demon where did you learn to fight like that?
i see you noticed we are being followed this what we get for waving that gold nugget around
they will wait till we sleep and then they'll slaughter our throats.
what do you say we give them a little demonstration of how fast we can run?
but there must have been a flood, a landslide or a fire the only sure thing is that everybody is dead
these days there are angry ghosts all around us ... dead from wars, sickness, starvation and nobody cares
and i'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed it.
there is a place high in the mountains far to the west from here ... it's where the spirit of forests dwells and it is a very dangerous place for humans
my name is ashitaka i travel far from lands to the east
are you ancient gods and have i come at last to the home of the spirit of the forest?
the current is too swift for us to get across and your friend's injuries are very bad
if we don't get him back soon he doesn't even have a chance
hey little fellow are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
please sir i am really pretty sure that they are not trying to help us get home
but something doesn't smell right you got back here almost as fast as we did... and through the forbidden forest.
on top of that you did it with two badly injured men.
that's right she is not even afraid of the gods, that woman.
well, you should have seen the way she dealt with nago am i right !
nothing to do but sitting on our backsides for months dealing with a bunch of angry boars
see the iron in the sand under this town, it all have been dug out.
so then we tried to get the iron under the mountain path nago wasn't to stand up for that
the problem was before we could dig for the iron we had to clear the way through forest
this is the latest rifle that i've asked these people to design
the one we have bought there turned out to be too heavy
and i'm sorry that you suffer, i truly am that brainless pig i'm the one he should've put the curse on, not you.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
she is the only one who's saw us as human beings
we are lepers, the world hates and fears us but she, she took us in and washed our rotting flesh and bandaged us
the legend said the blood of the great forest spirit can heal anything
perhaps it can cure my poor lepers it might even lift your course ashitaka
he is the reason we've been sitting around in these stinking animal skins, you know
but sir we can't it's a sin to look at it
oh and you call yourself the greatest hunter in the west
look, we've got a letter of pardon form the emperor... forgiving us for cutting off the head of the great forest spirit
he told me and he told me about you, about your village, your people and your forest
the forest spirit brought you back to life again he wants you to live
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me
he healed the bullet wound in my side but the demon mark remains
my lord okkoto what i said about nago's death was the truth
i believe you and i thank you for it young one
now i want you get me the head of the forest spirit... then we can come back and destroy lord asano together, ah?
watch out milady there has some horses been coming that end
you know you could always jump boy... to end it all
as soon as your strength returns the mark will spread and destroy you
and i dream of the day... when i will finally crunch that gun woman head in my jaws
moro ... why can't the humans and the forest live together?
-okkoto is badly wounded... but he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit
so they are going to beg him for his help, are they?
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side!
i'm going to try to return his head... before he kills us all
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his fesh and made him a monster.

to go on in this manner is to end as game the humans hunt for meat.

if yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest.
yeah, we're pumping those bellows while you pigs are in bed.
actually, if it's not too much trouble, ladies, i would like to see where you work.
then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
the problem was, before we could dig for the iron, we had to clear away the forest, and that's what made the boar angry.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
it shattered the bones of a giant boar, rotted his flesh and turned him into a monster.
i fought with him, and for that i was cursed with this mark on my arm, and soon it will kill me.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
these will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armor.
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
if you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
first it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
o mighty lord, is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
leave this forest... for the next time we meet i will have to kill you.
well, i've got the emperor breathing down my neck, and you're busy playing war with lord asano.
and you would have nothing to do with lord asano being here, now, would you?
he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the forest spirit.
he's here right now, trying to tell us something, that it's time for us both to live.
ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but i can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
those that remain were guarded by giantic beasts, who owed their allegiances to the great forest spirit.
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
i know this, but i beg you not to kill this lady.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
it is said the blood of the deer god will cure disease.
it could cure these people, and perhaps even lift your curse.
it grieves us that a demon has come from our tribe.
lord okkoto... do you know how i may lift the curse?
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
to go on in this manner is to end up as game the humans hunt for meat.
to risk all on a final battle is to play into human hands.
back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts... who owed their allegiance to the great forest spirit, for those were the days of gods and demons.
my prince, are you prepared to learn... what fate the stones have foretold you?
yes, i was prepared the very moment that i let my arrow fly.
some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
now our last prince must cut his hair and leave us, never to return?
but this is a lump of pure gold, you silly woman!
however, if it's money you want, i'll pay for the rice and take this nugget off your hands.
what to you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.

i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
i do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
they're much easier to kill than moro and her wolf cubs,
so you can call out that shady bunch you've got hidden under the cliff, jigo.
once the forest spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
will jigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
keep after them, but stay out of sight or you'll frighten the forest spirit away.
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.

when i tried to stop him, i was left with this scar: a curse unto death.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.
without fear of our disease she washed our rotting flesh, bandaged us...
to go on in this manner is to end as game the humans hunt for meat.
to risk all on a final battle is to play into human hands.
in ancient times, the land lay covered in forests, where, from ages long past, dwelt the spirits of the gods.
back then, man and beast lived in harmony, but as time went by, most of the great forests were destroyed.
there is evil at work in the land to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
it's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here for all these years, but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker with each generation.
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers.
when i came here last, a few years back, this was a lovely little village.
but then there must have been a flood or a landslide or a fire.
i'm sure it was that little ball of iron that killed him.
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
if yakul's not afraid, then we have nothing to worry about here.

lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm gonna try to return his head before he kills us all.
more than 500 years have passed... since the emperor drove us into this land.
now we hear how his power fades... and the fangs of his shoguns are broken.
soon we will be nothing more than game for the humans to hunt.
if you stake everything on one battle, you'll play into their hands.

we've got a letter of pardon from the emperor, forgiving us for cutting off the head of the great forest spirit.

i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.

i do not ask for the help of the wolf tribe.
even if every one of us dies, it will be a battle the humans will never forget.
well, you know, it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around.
remember, my dear lady, we're after a god, not just a beast.
they're much easier to kill than moro and her wolf cubs,
so you can call out that shady bunch you've got hidden under the cliff,jigo.
once the forest spirit is dead, we don't know what will happen.
willjigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
jigo's troops put us in front as bait to lure the boars in.
they didn't tell us about the land mines under our feet... or the grenades coming in on top of us.
he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!

a mound will be raised and funeral rites performed on this ground where you have fallen.
pass on in peace and bear us no hatred. soon all of you will feel my hate... and suffer as i have suffered.
so the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers.
did i mention that no humans have ever made it through these woods alive?
there's a lovely trail back across the river. and your friend's injuries are very bad.
we couldn't even get near the mountains with him around. staring' at a bunch of angry boars.
the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.
there are a lot of people out there with their eyes on this iron.
this is the latest rifle that i've asked these people to design.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
[whimpers] is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.

i'm very grateful for you bringing these men back to us, stranger, but something doesn't smell right.
you got back almost as fast as we did and through the forbidden forest.
we risked our lives to bring you the rice... you're all eating tonight, so watch your mouth.
and who made the iron that paid for that rice, huh?
see, the iron in the sand under this town had all been dug out.
then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain, but nago wasn't gonna stand for that.
some think you're either a spy for the wolf girl or for lord asano and his samurai.

this is the latest rifle that i've asked these people to design.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
how much more hatred and pain do you think we need?
yes, i'm the one who shot the boar, and i'm sorry that you suffer.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
if it would lift the curse, i'd let it tear you apart, but even that wouldn't end the killing now, would it?
without that ancient god the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
when the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out, this desolate place will be the richest land in the world, and princess mononoke will become human.
but it sure beats working a brothel in the city, huh?
here we get to eat as much as we want, and the men don't bother us!
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed, well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
this is what it does when it catches hold of you.
it's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me!
you know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.

ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but i can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
the stones tell me the boar god came from far to the west.
he had some kind of a poison inside him driving him mad... a poisonous hatred that consumed his heart and flesh... and turned him into a demon monster.
i was prepared the very moment that i let my arrow fly.
the infection will spread throughout your whole body, bone and flesh alike.
some managed to survive here for all these years... but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker... with each generation.

there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
the current's too swift for us to get across, and your friend's injuries are very bad.
if we don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
i'm very grateful to you for bringing these men back to us, stranger... but something doesn't smell right.
you got back here almost as fast as we did, and through the forbidden forest.

i'm the one he should have put a curse on, not you.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
you would do that, kill the very heart of the forest?
without that ancient god, the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
- princess of the spirits... of ghouls, beasts and ancient gods.
the wolves stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me.

okkoto's badly wounded, but he and the wolf girl are making their way to the realm of the forest spirit.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
i won't let him turn into a demon like nago did!
tell mother that the humans are setting a trap for the forest spirit.
lady eboshi and the men are on their way from the other side.
i'm going to try to return his head before he kills us all.
more than 500 years have gone since the mikado drove us into this land.

i know this, but i beg you not to kill this lady.
she is the only one who looked upon us as human.

it could cure these people, and perhaps even lift your curse.
to go on in this manner is to end as game the humans hunt for meat.

but as time went by... most of the great forests were destroyed.
those that remained were guarded by gigantic beasts... who owed their allegiance to the great forest spirit... for those were the days of gods... and of demons.
there is evil at work in the land to the west, prince ashitaka.
it's your fate to go there and see what you can see with eyes unclouded by hate.
it's 500 years since the emperor destroyed our tribe... and drove the remnants of our people to the east.
some managed to survive here for all these years... but the blood of our tribe has grown thinner and weaker... with each generation.
they'll wait till we're asleep, and then they'll slit our throats.
what do you say we give 'em a little demonstration of how fast we can run, huh?
so, the demon monster turned out to be a giant boar.
i followed its trail westward through the mountains... to where the samurai were attacking those villagers, but then--
there's a place high in the mountains far to the west of here.
it's where the spirit of the forest dwells, and it's a very dangerous place for humans.
- if yakul's not afraid... then we have nothing to worry about here.
would you be kind enough to grant us passage through your forest, little one?
ifwe don't get him back soon, he doesn't have a chance.
hey, little fellow, are you showing us the way or just getting us more lost?
you got back here almost as fast as we did, and through the forbidden forest.
on top of that, you did it with two badly injured men...
so then we tried to get at the iron under the mountain... but nago wasn't going to stand for that.
the problem was, before we could dig for the iron... we had to clear away the forest, and that's what made the boar angry.
the ones we brought here have turned out to be too heavy.
these will kill forest monsters and pierce the thickest samurai armour.
does that right hand of yours wish to kill me now, ashitaka?
if it would lift the curse, i'd let it tearyou apart.
forgive me, milady... but you must not make light of the boy's strength.
young man, like you, i know what rage feels like... and grief and helplessness, but... you must not take your revenge on lady eboshi.
without that ancient god, the animals here would be nothing but dumb beasts once more.
when the forest has been cleared and the wolves wiped out... this desolate place will be the richest land in the world... and princess mononoke will become human.
the wolves stole her soul, and now she lives to kill me.
the legends say the blood of the great forest's spirit can heal anything.
if you seek revenge for all the animals we've killed... well, there are two women down here whom i'd like you to meet.
they want revenge as well for husbands killed by your wolves.
this is what it does when it catches hold of you.
it's eating me alive, and very soon now it will kill me!
you know you can't possess the humans' strength by eating them.
all that'll do is make you into something else, something even worse than human.
if you want proof, look at my hand where he touched me.
i came here to beg the forest spirit to lift nago's curse from me.
he healed the bullet wound in my side, but the demon mark remains.
first it will tear my soul apart, and then it will kill me.
i believe you, and i thank you for it, young one.
i am only grieved and ashamed that such a demon has come from our tribe.
o mighty lord, is there a way to lift nago's curse from me?
leave this forest, for the next time we meet i will have to kill you.
- well, you know... it's gotten me all the best hunters and trappers around.
remember, my dear lady, we're after a god, not just a beast.
will jigo be satisfied with the creature's head... or will he be after my ironworks as well?
jigo's riflemen may turn on us... and if that happens, i'll need every one of you here to fight them.
so they're going to beg him for his help, are they?
keep after them... but stay out of sight or you'll frighten the forest spirit away.
he's here right now, trying to tell us something-- that it's time for both of us to live.
ashitaka, you mean so much to me, but i can't forgive the humans for what they've done.
it's a drawer you can put stuff you can't find any other place for.
like buttons and pins that don't work, string, thimbles, you know, navel lint, rakes, brooms, skis, poles...
well, this beautiful piece of furniture can fit under a windowsill, and it can house an entire entertainment system.
right. ln al's apartment, this is where he hides his square-dance caller.
i think it's important you think of your father as a human being with flaws like everybody else.
you know, i'm reminded of the english statesman, oliver cromwell, who told an artist, "l want my picture painted, warts and all."
-hey, i'm working at home... which means that i'm home, but i'm working, you know?
when i'm here during the day, you should just pretend that i'm not here.
actually i'm getting all the games, and i like watching them without pants.
i know, but, like, i see all these distractions, you know?
i like seeing them when they just come home from school.
they tell me about their lunch, their snack, and i got the boo-boo report.
marie, ray has the kind of job where he just can't leave at 5:00.
you know, games go into overtime, and players have to be interviewed.
you want to help me unload the bags from the car?
you know, i would, but i've got to get back to work.
yeah, i know, but look, if i'm gonna work at home, this is part of home, right?
okay, if you're sure you're gonna be okay, 'cause i got errands to run and....
you're probably not getting too much work done here, are you?
actually i'm getting all the games, and i iike watching them without pants.
i was playing with the kids today, and it was kind of fun.
i iike seeing them when they just come home from school.
i guess it'd be pretty tough to keep a secret from you, hmm?
how long had you been in the marketplace when the attack occurred?
it's an irrefutable fact that violent thoughts from others can lead to violent actions.
even if b'elanna had a violent thought, it was frane who attacked that man.
which he only did because he telepathically received that thought from b'elanna.
his mind was contaminated by the image, and it resulted in a loss of control.
he may have committed the physical act, but it was instigated by you.
where we come from, people are responsible for their own actions.
there is a risk of neurological damage, but it's necessary for us to treat frane.
will you at least delay the procedure until we've had a chance to review the evidence?
then let's hope the doctor can figure out how to reverse an engramatic purge.
all away personnel have been notified to return to the ship as soon as possible.
but i have a hard time buying that one fleeting thought makes her responsible for a vicious attack.
from what i've learned, crime here is a result of exposure to violent thought, much as it was on vulcan before my people learned to control their emotions.
in my opinion, the mari should be applauded for their efforts.
oh, i'm sure their intentions are admirable, but, uh... i'm not about to let them scramble b'elanna's brain without a fight.
when guill first met lieutenant torres, he sensed strong, violent tendencies within her, a potential for mental imagery which interested him.
in order to exploit that potential, he conspired with frane to provoke b'elanna.
why would peaceful men like guill and frane want to subject themselves to such hostile images?
my investigation has uncovered a rather disturbing side of mari society-- a black market if you will, in which many of your citizens trade in illicit mental imagery.
guill is a very prominent figure in this underground, or was, until i brought him into custody.
why would any of my people want to indulge in that kind of behavior?
it seems you have a somewhat more... serious problem than the random thoughts of a single alien.
even if i believed you, i'm not sure anyone else would.
whether his arrest will lead to reforms in the mari justice system is anyone's guess.
in the meantime, the doctor is treating lieutenant torres and commander tuvok.
this is some of the loveliest fruit i've- l've seen in a long time.
actually, it's been one of our worst waterplum seasons in years.
and on rare occasions, we have been forced to incarcerate a crew member who has committed a serious infraction.
i'm surprised that one of your people could be capable of doing something serious enough to warrant imprisonment.
and the two men involved in the altercation-- had you seen either of them before?
i'd never seen the victim... but the attacker... i think he was the same man who bumped into b'elanna.
so you believe that it's all right to tell people what they can and cannot think?
it's an irrefutable fact that violent thoughts from others can lead to violent actions.
even if b'elanna had a violent thought, it was frane who attacked that man.
which he only did because he telepathically received that thought from b'elanna.
his mind was contaminated by the image, and it resulted in a loss of control.
he may have committed the physical act, but it was instigated by you.
neelix is going to file a diplomatic protest and tuvok and i will be going over the witness statements.
maybe we can poke a few holes in the chief examiner's case.
i'm not dismissing it, but i'm not going to accept it blindly either.
i've spent a great deal of time with nimira over the past few days.
from what i've learned, crime here is a result of exposure to violent thought, much as it was on vulcan before my people learned to control their emotions.
in my opinion, the mari should be applauded for their efforts.
oh, i'm sure their intentions are admirable, but, uh... i'm not about to let them scramble b'elanna's brain without a fight.
but we must prepare ourselves for the probability that she will turn out to be culpable for the crime.
you told me your people spent centuries learning how to control their violent impulses.
i know we haven't achieved your level of discipline, but we're trying.
do you think this is somehow connected with the other attack?
i'm not certain, but it strikes me as more than coincidence that two violent altercations have occurred within two days, in a city which purports to have eliminated virtually all crime.
i don't know why that thought is still contaminating people, but i have got to put a stop to it.
i've never dealt with a murder before, but you've had experience with homicide investigations?
there must be violent thoughts to be had from your shipmates, whether they want to share them or not.
after all, they couldn't stop a telepath from probing their minds, could they?
in order to exploit that potential, he conspired with frane to provoke b'elanna.
they wanted to trigger a violent thought, so they could telepathically draw it from her mind.
my investigation has uncovered a rather disturbing side of mari society-- a black market if you will, in which many of your citizens trade in illicit mental imagery.
guill is a very prominent figure in this underground, or was, until i brought him into custody.
all you've done is force people to share it in back alleys.
it seems you have a somewhat more... serious problem than the random thoughts of a single alien.
so if i was responsible for passing that thought, you would have let them lobotomize me?
it is incumbent upon us to respect the laws of the societies we visit.
then you're not going to lecture me about losing my temper?
if you must know, investigating this case has given me a new respect for your inner struggle.
good. i dread the day when everyone on this ship agrees with me.
i thank you for your opinion, but our mission is not going to change.

they might aswell say "i want 100,000 kronor, call this number."
the only way you will get it is by paying a lot for it.
and i am a hero forced to fight the evils of the world.
and let's pretend that you love me more than anything else on earth.
the only reason you're invited to parties is because you let anyone sleep with you!
you know that if you don't put out you're not welcome there!
have you ever notice how a girl holds a cup of tea?
all of a sudden it interests you how her fingers touch it.
she had dyed her hair, she asked me what i thought of it ...
i told her what i thought, i wondered how it was done, stuff like that ...
tiny little movements, all these little things you never really notice.
the way she moved her shoulders and smiled as she was listening to me.
but i know jorma would die for me and i would do the same for him, if it came to that point.
but i think you know my world is full of threats.
the guy might grab a knife, or act like a complete maniac.
it has to be someone who knows how to fight, and knows when to stop.
if she finds out i got beat up by two nazis and got hospitalized, she has to go and see me.
when she visits me, i have my chance to explain what she means to me.
but if god exists, he would never never have created my father.
if i would burn the school down, social services would come and claim me.
senator bob dole says... trash tv is the beachhead of controversy... infinity backs shock jock howard stern... get this garbage off the air... declined to comment on the tv censorship issue... continues his attack on tv talk shows...
howard stern... take the trash out of talk television... demeaning, exploitative, perverted, divisive...
our guests today all live far beyond the borders of normalcy.
everybody, i'd like you to meet... the man who has fallen in love with the family dog...
well, if i'm ever going to fill that governor's chair when you become senator, i'd better finish my thesis.
by god, darling, you're starting to sound like a politician already.
the preston family name has always stood for good, wholesome american values,
so, remember... a vote for floyd preston is a vote for family.
i hope we can count on you for your support for the development of the new civil war theme park.
my problem there is you want to put that park on a protected historical landmark.
i know, i know, but it's going to mean millions and millions of revenue for the state, floyd.
the party is counting on you to do the right thing.
she was so ugly, i took her to the beach, they wanted to know what i used for bait.
hey, michael, you're going to sing for us tonight, aren't you?
but i think harvey might be running a new campaign commercial.
i had no idea there was going to be a screen presentation.
in a bizarre accident here at the governor's mansion, talk show host wally sparks heroically restrained a maniacal horse from injuring the governor and his party guests.
the governor's prize thoroughbred jericho was not seriously injured, b-b-but they say he's... suffering from a severe hangover.
we might be able to get some good play out of this, sir.
especially if we air your campaign commercials during the taping of his show from your house.
governor, i think it's very gracious for you to open up your home to wally sparks.
any man with a heart like that has got a vote from me.
well, wally, these fat tubs of lard have the nerve to call themselves professional athletes when they look more like the fuji blimp!
we spend long, hard hours in the gym getting our bodies to look like this.
i hear that wally sparks is actually sleeping in governor preston's bedroom.
the only problem is, wally says the governor's wife keeps hogging all the covers.
i received a fax and a telephone call telling me that if i don't do what they say and pull out of the race, they're going to go public with this.
they say that they have proof of my having had sex in a motel with a stripper!
so if i don't do it, it looks like i'm afraid to face you on the air.
well, you may have backed me into a corner this time, but let me tell you something.
on the other hand, if i back out, those people are just going to walk all over me.
and worse, backing out might look like an admission of guilt.
now, by the time you can prove your innocence, you'll already have lost it.
and if you can't prove your innocence, you might even lose your governor's position.
you have to do what's best for emily and the children.
you just gave me the same answer that i arrived at.
now you go ahead and tell our viewers the same incredible story you told me.
well, i first met governor preston in savannah at a campaign rally.
i took off my clothes, and i posed for those pictures with him.
well, thanks to my producer sandy, and a hidden video camera, we happened to get this little performance on tape.
i'm sure when he comes out, he'll feel like a new woman.
hey, what do you say we all get naked and see who the best man is?
well, like we say, "the right house for the right person."
listen, it's time i let you in on a little secret, marge.
well, like we say, "the right house for the right person."
listen, it's time i let you in on a little secret, marge.
well, like we say, "the right house for the right person."
listen, it's time i let you in on a little secret, marge.
being in a gang is a lot like being in a religion.
you got rules to follow, a leader to obey, and at the heart, it's about love.
well, over in harlem town, back in the old days, a couple of italians were giving muscle to a cat running a speakeasy.
he was doing a set, i think maybe of billie holiday.
well, the cops are telling the da and the papers and everybody else.
so you do some deed and you want to clean your conscience and still get away with it?
i was disbarred automatically after i was convicted of a felony.
even so, how come you ain't appealing your case and shit like that?
some people say that if you don't accept jesus christ as the son of god, as your personal saviour, you won't go to heaven.
but is there a guarantee that if you do believe in jesus, you will be saved?
one of these muslim monkeys was trying to tell me that jesus was a nigger.
he even quoted from the bible trying to back his shit up.
may the sun shine warm upon your face and rain fall soft upon your fields.
and until we meet again, may god hold you in the hollow of his hand.
the hack comes around and says that he'll let me out for ten minutes
- if i need to see you, so i say yes.
for instance, fear, hatred, loneliness, are more real to me than a shank.
and a soul, everyday, can grow into something you can almost hold.
that boy is 1 6 years old and he's in for 20, which means he can be out in six.
he could be back on the street by the time he's 22.
reverend, i hear what you're saying to me, but it's hard.
i mean, i been using these my whole life to settle things.
it's just that i feel so bad and so ashamed of everything i did before.
it's like i feel as though i should be going around to all the people that i hurt and telling them i'm sorry.
i am deeply concerned by the rash of murders that have occurred in oswald over the past few weeks.
and though i have every confidence in warden glynn here and his fine staff,
now, you run your cellblock and you think you're a god.
glynn runs the whole prison, he thinks he's a greater god.
i don't want the feds running around, waking my inmates, faxing me memorandums.
and the last thing i want, the last thing i need, is for you taking shit like this on yourself.
yes, in the same way it seems odd that post was let into the hole to burn ortolani.
so i wouldn't be too far off to think that the guards were involved?
i mean, you really gotta admit, i mean, he's the most beautiful baby in the world.
so now i'm thinking that, like, maybe i went a little overboard because maritza called me this morning talking about how the baby got a bad liver and he's still in the hospital and they think that he's gonna die.
maritza says that the doctor says that all this is going on because of the drugs that we did before she was pregnant, you know.
and after she was pregnant, you know, people were fucking telling us, you know, not to, you know--
then, in a couple of days, or a couple of million years, he breathed life into man.
and he's been sucking the life out of us ever since.
or maybe he's just tired of the gangster way of life.
we hit this guy hard right now, all his street instincts are gonna pop back up.
being in a gang is a lot like being in a religion.
you got rules to follow, a leader to obey, and at the heart, it's about love.
well, over in harlem back in the old days, a couple of italians were giving muscle to a cat running a speakeasy.
he was doing a set i think maybe of billie holiday.
i mean, he's about to smoke the stuffing in his mattress he's dying so bad, so he comes to me and he asks me for a cig, just one to get him through the night.
he begs me on his knees, he's weeping like a little girl.
i was disbarred automatically after i was convicted of a felony.
even so, you can enter an appeal on your case and shit?
i can say an our father and think about lunch at the same time.
some people say that if you don't accept jesus christ as the son of god, as your personal savior, you won't go to heaven.
listen, maybe he stripped you of the superficial sense of yourself, you know, doctor, lawyer, indian chief, so that you could find the real you through him.
that's what i'm saying, that's what i've been trying to do but god isn't in oz.
i think she decided when she saw the swastika on my butt.
she's gonna take the kids and go live with her parents.
he even quoted from the bible trying to back his shit up.
well, jesus was from judea so he was probably of an olive-colored skin.
for instance, fear, hatred, loneliness, are more real to me than a shank.
and a soul, every day, can grow into something you can almost hold.
but you are never going to reach billie's heart through intimidation.
you have to open up yours and show him the way by example, as i did to you.
and you can call him, and he will come, my brother, and he will give you strength.
it's just that, i feel so bad and so ashamed of everything i did before.
i am deeply concerned by the rash of murders that have occured in oswald over the past few weeks.
and though i have every confidence in warden glynn here and his fine staff,
doesn't it seem odd to you that keane and martinez were left in the gym unsupervised?
yes, in the same way it seems odd that post was let into the hole to burn ortolani.
i mean, you really gotta admit, he's the most beautiful baby in the world.
so now i'm thinking that maybe i went a little overboard because maritza called this morning talking about the baby got a bad liver and he's still in the hospital and they think that he's gonna die.
miguel, you should pray to god for your son's health but you should also ask god to give you and maritza the strength to face whatever happens.
maritza says that the doctor says that all this is going on because of the drugs we did before she was pregnant, you know.
we try to figure out what god wants from us, why he put us here.
we try to make deals with him, but god is one tough motherfucker.
hey, look, if you didn't mean it it was an accident.
if you're going to play sports there's going to be accidents, but we need you 100%.

that runt lerigot is still out there with the key to the island of muiranthias!
perhaps if we find out what he is receiving, we can help him.
alpha, attach the cranial transmission scanner and connect it to the viewing globe.
if only its magic would glow in my hands, i would have no need for you.
you will oversee our safe passage into the nemesis triangle, won't you, twerp?
once inside the nemesis triangle, communication with the power chamber will be impossible.
here are your new turbo morphers, five keys similar to lerigot's golden key.
individually, they power up your vehicles and give you access to your morphing powers.
but only together are they powerful enough to see you safely through your mission.
there you will find the ghost galleon, a phantom ship which will take you and the zords through the nemesis triangle.
you must merge the power of your keys the moment you cross into the triangle.
the combined power of your keys and the galleon will see you through safely.
neither the ship nor your zords will be detectable by divatox.
by accepting this honour, you are also accepting a great responsibility.

[ headmaster ] gentlemen, your days of disobedience and troublemaking have come to an end.
from this moment forward, you'll do what you are told, when you are told.

bobby, the unknown lynchpin of the family who committed the first murder.
sadie, now a born again christian, once charlie's most outrageous disciple.
and tex, the former high school football captain, who became charlie's bloodiest butcher.
in charlie they found a daddy, a lover, and a savior.
i followed them out to the ranch, and tried to integrate myself with charlie.
i came to you with all the love in my heart.
we were forced to examine our souls, not privately, or secretly, but before charlie and the entire family.
i mean, really, everything that everything was for, was for fucking.
and if we weren't leading up to it, we were fucking.
i didn't have any experience with group sex, but i warmed up to it.
the girls kept telling me, that it was my parents' hang ups, that i had to deprogram myself from their inhibitions.
that's what charlie said the whole universe was about, man it was all one big fuck.
he would have one of the girls strip down in front of him from time to time, just to see if there was some sort of reaction.
charlie was always trying to cultivate george with the girls, you know, to help cook and clean, and make love to him.
but we've seen charlie do things that no human being has done before.
we saw him pick up a bird in the desert and breath on it and bring it back to life.
and then i realized, that it's been all been leading to right now.
you know, it's like the family, this is the last time.
the one that's gonna make it through for the last time.
charlie told us that children were the real leaders of the family.
they were able to take off their clothes and lie in the sun and be one, together.
we took hundreds of acid trips together, smoked a lot of pot together, because we wanted to be like charlie, because to us, he was living perfection.
he'd, he'd bend over, he'd pick up a handful of rocks and he'd toss them into the air and say
see, you can throw it all away and it'll come back to you.
things kind of built to a critical mass and at one point, i actually thought,
well, maybe there is something we could do with this, but,
i mean things looked good for charlie and everybody was just goofing with their head in the clouds.
well, we gave up our own birthdays and renounced our families.
he's just a little con man, he's spent half his life in jail goddamn it!
well once the bikers and ex-cons moved onto the ranch, it became a chop shop for stolen cars, and dune buggies.
he never said, in so many words that he was christ, but he would imply.
like, when he'd look at me and smile and he'd say
he said take some clean clothes 'cause you'll get all dirty.
and so i went down to the market and i hopped in the can, and we went through everything and got all dirty and we just took the best of everything.
the record execs don't think your stuff is marketable right now.
what i suggest that we do is we'll sit on it until spring and who knows you, by then you could be the biggest name since, since jim morrison.
his album was going to make us rich and it was going to spread his message to the world.
i mean it didn't slow us down, we all the makings for a great party.
and then she'd realize what was happening to her, and she'd get all scared and frightened.
and and charlie was sitting in the corner just directing the operation.
use fear to help you exist and to live in the now.
well, i think i tried to make myself believe i was a witch.
you can't get caught if you don't got thought in your head.
sometimes we would steal from the people's houses that we broke into, other times we'd just move the furniture around to freak them out when they woke up in the morning.
he told us to imagine a rich establishment pig sitting in the chair.
now it's the pig's trial he'd say, and we'd stare at this imaginary person and project his fear right back at him, keeping him immobilized with his own projected fear.
keep judging yourselves in charlie, but don't look in the mirror!
i don't remember exactly when my mind crossed over from reality to imagination, but there was no escaping it.
death is beautiful, because it it's what people feared the most.
death is merely an illusion anyway, because the infinite soul can never die.
and annette's had the day off, and i'll bet ya, when i get home,
i just might have a couple of steaks on the grill, and maybe a cheap bottle of wine waiting.
he was so evil he would just scare us to death with his preachings.
every night he'd tell us that there was going to be a race war, and that whitey and the blacks were going to go to war, and it was going to he the worst war the world had ever seen.
and he said that we had to be ready to save the children and rescue the homeless babies, and carry them off into the desert to safety.
and he said we had to start collecting dune buggies, and guns and supplies and all these other things to help us survive.
it was perfect timing for charlie, because the family was starting to drift apart.
but now we were being pushed to the last safe corner of the earth, the desert.
as far as we were all concerned it was already coming down.
helter skelter is the name of a song performed by the beatles, period.
that the desert was the only way that we could be saved.
we'd still make music and orgy, but now it had this dark underbelly to it.
neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornications, nor of their thefts.
and they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit.
somewhere that we could raise our children, and let them teach us some of the things that we need to learn.
in a place that's closer to the land, and the stars, and the spirit of life.
gary said no, so charlie told bobby and i to try to convince him.
i've given you, given you all help in times of need.
during my trial the prosecution wanted to involve charlie in my case.
which is difficult because he was never there at any time.
i split the ranch on the pretence of ditching the car.
some cops woke me up one morning on the side of the road.
as long as any of us are in jail, we're all in jail, you know.
i'm walking around out here, but i'm in jail with every single young person that should be free, you know.
then he went on about how we were a family and we weren't going to let one of our brothers rot in jail.
girls loved bobby enough to do this, as they took these people's lives, they were willing to give their own lives.
that he had taken a life, and now it was my turn to repay that debt.
well the girls, decided if they found, the police, if they found more bodies, with, with writing on the wall in blood, that, that they'd assume the killer was on the loose,
he said, go to terry's old place, take all the money you find, and kill anyone there.
i was getting into my creepy crawl clothes and me and tex were sneaking some speed, and getting ready to go.
i went down an embankment, climbed a fence and over some barbed wire.
we were headed toward the house when we saw a car coming up the driveway.
charlie was waiting for us when we got back to the ranch, sitting naked in the moonlight.
he asked us if we had any remorse for what we'd done, and of course the right answer was "no".
charlie made sure that he, he sort of made me feel really guilty and said that i should want to do it, because it was going to help bobby.
linda drove of course, because she had the only valid drivers license.
and we went to this house that charlie had once partied at and he said we're gonna do the one on the right of that house.
he said that the night before had been too messy, and that this time we were gonna do it differently.
and maybe we'll all have to go to jail before we can get them out.
maybe we'll have to go up to the jail and say,
you can make more bogus books and movies about his life.
you can joke about him, you can pretend to be him, you can say and do anything you want.

portraits of the families is a lament for the loss of our beloved ones.
at that time, we were about to board a ship in guangzhou.
he is saying that, when he was young, unmarried, and lived alone, his name was shitaa kei.
before the takeover, during the japanese time, father didn't dare to say that we were chinese from the mainland.
it's just like, five or six years ago, parents didn't dare to tell their children about the massacre of february 28.
often, after seeing this, i would come to work swallowing my tears.
the people working with me were all 17-18 year old girls.
we were praying gods, and relying on religion... just to get enough determination to survive.
with mom's condition, we had to burn everything left from my father.
we couldn't leave anything by her side, so that she would be able to see it.
when it comes to farming, the first thing is to irrigate the field.
there were six taiwanese among us, and four japanese, all in one squad.
at that time we thought that only the best were assigned to the vanguard.
that one needs to excel... to receive the honor of being sent to the vanguard.
come to think of it now, the vanguard was a mere shield against bullets.
but his arms and legs were very awkward even back then.
when we came to that place, there were so many people outside.
i immediately got in touch with the society for victims of political repression, and they brought me over here.
with their help, i found this place with a yellow banner.
but all of them, tree or four people, kept looking around the yellow banner.
they looked everywhere, but they couldn't find the grave of my dad.
since 1940, my father was involved... into trade business from shanghai to hong kong and taiwan.
in 1951, he returned home at the time of spring festival.
because taiwan split off in the forties, there wasn't any way we could do anything... to find anything about what happened to my father.
it was only in 1984... that i went to the us to study.
but in 1987... a former trade partner of my father contacted my mother.
he told us that, back then... they were doing business together, and he had to meet my father at a wharf.
at that time people believed that joining the japanese army was like a death sentence.
when i was about to leave, my fiancee came to take a picture with me.
i first wanted to count for her, but then i said: if i count wrong, mazu may get angry.
so i said: "i'll take a hundred coins each worth one cent, and, every time you kneel, i'll hand you one coin."
she wanted to kneel a hundred times at both hsinkang and peikang.
so, altogether, at hsinkang and peikang, she knelt two hundred times.
at the end of the war, a year of two before the chinese takeover, we were mostly eating sweet potatoes...
we were taking a little bit of rice, mixing it with a lot of sweet potatoes, and cooking through.
all the rice would rise to the top, there would be just one bowl, and we'd give it to my little brother.
after the takeover, the first bowl of white rice with soy sauce i ate...
wake up in the morning, then study, eat lunch, take an afternoon nap, then study in the afternoon, then have dinner... also take a shower...
and, when you're done, you study all the way until midnight.
i told them i didn't need to do anything about my kids.
if they went out and quarreled with someone, i only had to tell them once:
"if someone hits you, no problem, you should never fight back."
i only had to say it once, and they would know it.
told him we were simple folks, that we just mind our own business.
all of our kids were crying, they tried to push him away.
he wanted to run away so that he would not be caught.
he ran toward the large concrete building, the one built where the temple used to be.
captain, we appreciate your efforts, but i think it's time we considered an evacuation.
according to my analysis, there are at ieast 12 more asteroids heading in our direction.
allowing anxiety to overcome you will only hinder the efficiency of our efforts.
he's really a very pleasant fellow once you get to know him.
yes, we use those to lift cargo from the surface to the orbital supply stations.
may i assume it uses magnetic leverage to lift the carriage?
it would take a little creative mechanics, but i think we can do it.
i spent two years on a tether maintenance team on rinax.
every night before i go to sleep, i recall their faces and share something about my day with each of them.
tonight, i'm going to have quite a iot to tell them.
we've only been able to fix three of the seven power supplies.
...were to turn back, we might not be able to break through the ionosphere.
my lungs are capable of respirating in an extremely thin atmosphere.
then if we can't fix this air supply, you may be the only one left to pilot this thing.
he attempted to open the hatch of this vessel and go outside.
it would have killed him and possibly all of us as well.
i think we should go up and find out what he was talking about.
if we stop the carriage, we'ii risk losing mag-iev cohesion again.
you have no feelings for me, but you have feelings against me.
for three years, you've ridiculed me and made it obvious to everyone that you have no respect for me and i've tolerated it.
but non-vuicans have feelings and they have to listen to them.
and i've got to listen to mine, and right now, they're telling me we need to get up on that roof and find out what the doctor was talking about.
first, they create what appears to be a natural disaster-- in your case, an asteroid bombardment.
once the population has evacuated, they arrive and stake their claim.
dr. vatm found out about the etanian order and was secretly collecting information about their starship technology.
he also knew that one of your colonists was a traitor, helping the etanians, feeding your government false information about the asteroids.
this loosely governed race of explorers has extensive knowledge of the territory ahead of us, which they are willing to share.
i landed my ship on the nearest of those 21 moons.
but my people consider outposts such as this... to be necessary evils-- places to refuel, repair, exchange information and leave as quickly as possible.
if i've observed anything working with kes, it's her great tolerance-- a quality you all seem to share.
i will take a look at your program when i finish my shift in engineering.
it shouldn't be too hard to smooth out the rough spots.
and i can see the value of fellowship in one's life.
and now that i've observed the closeness that exists among your crewmates,
they'll remove your entire crew, settle you on a moon somewhere and your ship will become their latest trophy.
you weren't planning on taking kes anywhere near this part of space?
that ruthlessness was an essential element of her personality, as much as her logical ability.
a lot of the historical characters you chose had this dark thread running through their personalities.
she's stabilized, but i'll need to monitor her condition for a few hours.
doctor, i have the raw data from the forensic investigation of the attack on zahir.

we could rendezvous with voyager afterwards, before you're too far away.
that would certainly give you a chance to get to know him better.
if you navigate here, away from this plasma belt, you'ii avoid the tarkan sentries altogether.
it would also take voyager several months off a direct course to the alpha quadrant.
he might not be unless i can figure out what's going on.
i need to run a complete analysis on all your subroutines while they're running.

the wedding reception is 150 people and is a captive audience.
now, i guess the, uh, bride- and groom-to-be are gonna show up here, huh?
you find your base, you become a monster, and then you expand.
bottom line is, a man's gotta do what he's good at.
i have been working my ass off for ten years, gary, to become the kind of guy that genie would want to marry.
so this wedding is gonna happen, and if you try and stop it, i swear to god...
i also saw this guy over at the water tower with two other guys that also had guns.
and when they got done talking, they started chasing me around.
that gift he arranged to pick up, gare, it had to be the bomb.
so nobody knew what uncle bob looked like, so they-they replaced uncle bob with a hit man.
and now, he enriches and strengthens you by a special sacrament, so that you may assume the duties of marriage in mutual and lasting fidelity.
since it is your intention to enter into marriage, join your right hands and declare your consent before god and his church.

and the cameras, no eyes on the corridors or the rest rooms.
yeah, well, we know where he went, just show us where he came from.
multiple blows to the head produced angular acceleration and deceleration to the brain.
twisting to the brain causes the bridging veins to rip from their the axons within the white matter of the brain begin to snap.
if i was here i would have been in there with you, you know that.
it's just that we're gonna come out looking like the bad guy again.
/ nothing i could find the guy had a big heart, 550 grams, but otherwise healthy.
this guy was pumped up before the fight, white knuckles veins popping.
is there any chance you still have a w2 lying around, or a copy of a driver's license.
girl wasn't here long enough to refill a coffee pot, let alone sign anything.
i don't know where she came from, don't know where she went.
what about this guy, did you ever see him with libby?
you think this is the waitress nick and sara are looking for?
well, there's no clothing left, the wedding band can be either or,
any blood's been exposed to the elements longer than the inside of these bones.
there's a little skin, clothing, and tissue to protect it, huh?
fractures to the zygomatic bone and maxilla, also to the left ulna, but no tool marks on any of the bones.
so may be, she was punched in the face and tried to shield herself?
foreign dna in her pelvis wasn't from her father, it was from her son.
there was no evidence of a fetus or a baby in that grave.
i've been working on that john doe envelope, the post mark was henderson.
the bates motel is in sloan, why would walter go that far out of his way to mail a letter.
maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs how about satisfying one of somebody else's?
speaking of which, i found a way to separate the skin from the top of the pudding without leaving any on the edges.
well, maybe if you called more often, i wouldn't have to.
- is it all right if i watch a tape in here?
no, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
jerry, i tell you, if this woman dies it is gonna be a major inconvenience.
so, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured meats?
she tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh, it's not a meal, you know?
would you like a kidney too, because i'll give it to you?
i'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!
newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and haul these beauties out of here.

no, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.
jerry, i tell you: if this woman dies, it is going to be a major inconvenience.
yeah well, newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer.
look, i've got to take my blood back to the bank, can i borrow your car?
well, i'm glad i got to see him before he hit puberty and got you know, all lurchy and awkward.

better look under the bed at night... before you go to sleep.
and when you make new friends, always check to see who's dead and who's alive.
there's a hole in the wall, and the wind whistles right through here.
you must have heard the wind whistling and it made you have a dream.
first you thought you saw that ray kid in our house, and now it's the dead girl.
well, don't you think it's a little weird... that i imagined ray, and then we met him?
all i'm saying is what i do is my business and what you do is yours.
yeah, and with that kind of thinking, how are things ever supposed to change, huh?
malcolm x don't got to feed my wife and kids, and if he was alive today,
i doubt very seriously that malcolm x would want me to pick somebody up i didn't want to pick up.
and don't be acting like i'm the only one who feels that way, either.

and all the rest of the ride, he's going on and on about what a hotshot businessman he is, how he's making money hand over fist, like he's at the top of this kind of ladder,
and he just spits down on all the rest of us here in a heap.
he wanted to fuck this other bitch, so he didn't need me no more all of a sudden.
then he calls back last week, all apologizing and shit, talking about, "i love you.

i'm only going a couple of blocks to that little diner up on melrose and broadway.
i'm gonna pick up some food and come right back here.
last year, my ma called me and told me she found a lump in her breast.
and then when the test results came back, they were inconclusive.
and then, right in the middle of it all, the doctor just had to go out of town for a week, so it was just taking that much longer.
man, i thought i was going to have a nervous breakdown.

you're the one who should be in that box you scum!
why is it that somebody like my daughter dies and you don't?
first i pick out a little family and then house stuff and clothes.
sleepwear and fancy jackets for the man and pantsuits and i outfit everybody-- the mom and the dad and the kids.
why would you want to stay here all the time, sweetheart?
i like it much better here now that my mom's not home anymore.
and i got all the stuff i brought back in your bedroom closet.
oh, hon, i meant you could stay for the weekend and then go back home.
we know things have been a bit difficult for you since your mother passed on.
we just want to do whatever we can to help you through this difficult time.
she would pull up the weeds and put them in little piles along the rows and my job was to pick up the piles and dispose of them.
when the beans were grown, ready to pick she'd let me help pick them.
she'd give me an example of a good bean to hold up in one hand while i picked with the other.
if i wasn't sure about a particular bean if it was at the right stage for picking
i might keep it in mind if i ever get a baby girl.
i also have diatoms on a slide and one of a paramecium but euglena's my favorite.
they generally believe that children should be with their families when it's at all feasible.
well, if we were walking down the street everybody would think we was a family.
they talked mainly above my head and usually, i can jump in and hang on to what people are saying but i felt so dazey in my head that not a word made sense.
then the judge who was up in the box he talked right to me for the first time.
i wouldn't hesitate for one minute to clasp him or her to my bosom and cherish and protect him or her.
the family is the cornerstone of society and when it begins to crumble we are bound to rush in with mortar and bricks and whatever else there is to hand to shore it up.
if i'd have known then all i know about her now
i would have jumped out of that big car moving and hightailed it.
thursday is when her mama gets her hair fixed so she won't know.
i don't think your grandmother would mind you going to visit your mother, hon.
you set up there in that house like the world owed you a living and you left her to die.
then someone comes to my house and tells me that they found you all laid up next to her like a little idiot.
later on i reminded jesus that i did lots better for my grandma than i did for my mama.
i hoped he'd give that some thought and help me find somebody good who could love me.
i think he liked it when i wasn't too friendly-- because if everyone was friendly and sweet he wouldn't have a job.
i understand from your teachers that you've taken to signing your papers differently.
so what matters is that you open up and talk to me.

i bet your mama and daddy are pretty worried about you right now.
my mama's dead and my daddy's in jail and i've been thrown out of my aunt's house.
i have to get lots more information about this situation and first thing in the morning
i'm going to call county social services and see if we can't get the ball rolling.
okay, wyatt, i'm going to teach you how to throw a ball.
it may not seem like a big deal now but trust me, it's your ticket to meeting babes.
perfect-- right now my dad's listening to country music in some dive telling roy the bartender how i done him wrong.
it's not like i'm all kicked up about being the "other man."
how about pick up the phone and dial my office, and you're in for a real treat.
you want me to pick up the phone and call your office?
it's... well, it's new in the sense that you can just push a button and it prints out a little report immediately.
for instance, look, it says here yesterday that someone from this system placed two calls to prague.
and then i would go out and play for about 15 seconds, and then i'd run back in the kitchen,
i'd put some more sugar in there, and then after a couple of years,
the guy who invented mad libs is laughing all the way to the pencil.
and my entire family is nonviolent, but nonviolent to the point of panic.
but i used my self-defense move on him, which consisted of holding my ear while back-pedaling furiously.
yeah, and i just want to go back just for one second to this prague issue because
dr. katz is getting me more in touch with my feelings, and i think it's very important that i say how i feel.
so i just want to let you know that i'm uncomfortable around you.
i always end up doing these corporate gigs and they're very, very depressing.
first of all, the people don't want to be working for the corporation, right.
and, thirdly, they don't want to have to focus their energy on you, and whenever i play these corporate gigs, they always have a special request, they always say,
"hey, can you come and dress as a table, and we'll eat off of you for a couple of hours, and then you pop up and do a couple of minutes?
so these are not good... good gigs, is what you're saying.
and they always want you to do something about the people who work at the company but they never give you information, and they always say like, something like...
...after seven rings, or if it gets to a certain heat in the room, it'll pick up.
you know, but i'm one of those guys who's always said that technology doesn't make our lives simpler, it makes our lives more complicated.
am i the only guy that actually owns a rotary cellular phone?
those are the days when you had to put some work into making a call, you know?
i flew to las vegas and they have one of these shuttles that you can save a couple of dollars on the taxi by taking a shuttle, and it only takes about seven hours to get to the hotel.
and you will get luggage back that looks very similar to the actual luggage you brought, in other words, if you bring a duffel, you'll get a duffel.
but doing these jobs, these engagements, you know, it must be satisfying in some way, or you wouldn't keep doing it, am i right?
here's my impression of me every time i go on the road and perform.
somebody's gotta teach him not to be such a sucker all of his life.
in case i didn't make myself clear before, again, i'm just really sorry.
[ mom ] i hope you learn something from this experience.
the only thing i'm gonna learn is how to waste most of my summer vacation.
gentlemen, your lives, as you know them, are about to change for the better.
your days of disobedience and troublemaking have come to an end.
from this moment forward, you will do what you are told, when you are told.
do not speak unless spoken to, do not move unless directed to.
if i take you to the place where i found it?
quite truthfully sir, that stone is so valuable that it may save the world from an energy crisis.
i' m pleased to see that you are all doing well.
leo, i know it is hard work protecting the jungle but believe in yourself and do your best.
with the moonlight stone, you could buy half the planet, if you wanted.
with the enormous profit from selling the stones, you' ll never have to work again!
the story of the bravest of them all, the true king of the jungle.
when two blue stars shine in the east sky i will see you, even though it's only in my memories.
comfort me, just like the rainbow after the rain, or the morning sun in the sky.
have faith in the light on the opposite bank, and just follow the wind.
fly to the promised hill, like a bird flies across the ocean.
embrace the belief that has no place to go and call the belief love.
i' m pleased to see that you are all doing well.
leo, i know it is hard work protecting the jungle but believe in yourself and do your best.
blessed moon, can you see my son, lune, from where you are?
if so, please light his way, bright and clear so that he won't feel all alone.
with the moonlight stone, you could buy half the planet, if you wanted.

i'll need a photo, the places he frequents, and the hours when i can find him.
put it all in an envelope and slip it into p.o. box 261 at saxagan and tolstoy.

nobody's gonna make any money suing denny crane with a client who initiated the conflict by throwing a rock.
but, hey, if you can find another shark like the last one, you know where to find me.
as i explained to your other agents, if i had communications, they would have occurred inside the confessional, and i would unfortunely be prohibited by canon law from revealing the content of such communications.
without revealing any specific exchanges, father, could you tell us if you've been in receipt of any information pertaining to this abduction?
the priest's got a printing press and a stack of these back there.
he's bootlegging papal blessings to the tune of about six figures a year.
evidently, if we get it over to the hospital, they can still reattach it.
i know it's a big favor to ask, but uh... would you deliver it?
by the way... it would be wrong for you to stop by the priest's hospital room and use the finger to try to extort information out of him.
the fbi could never do that, and i would never ask the two of you to do it, even though the priest likely knows something that could help us.
i suppose i thought i could prioritize principle over that friendship, but the reality is, i can't.
which means you either accept this check from me, or you get yourself another lawyer.
and if you're determined to be absurd, at least have the common sense, if not the decency, to keep it to yourself.
contrary to what you and the rest of the world think,
father ryan... we've discovered the counterfeit papal blessings and the printing press in your office.
your days as a priest are over should this become public.
i shot the guy in the head as a wake-up call.
we have got to motivate the lazy slobs in this country to get off their fat, lazy asses and go to work!
that hurricane was as much a social disaster as a natural one.
and the next hurricane to hit could very well be in the form of anarchy.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
when we do get off this rock..., ...you and that treasure you took are going back to king zolas.
if you can get us out of here alive, hercules, i'll think about it.
it's gonna take a lot more than that to stop her.
well, as long as we're blundering around here in the dark..., ...we're at a big disadvantage.
this treasure's going back to king zolas, just like i told you.
now why'd you have to go and say a thing like that, huh?
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
that's your problem, '''cause until we get off this rock, you don't have much of a choice.
when we do get off this rock, you and that treasure you took are going back to king zolas.
well, as long as we're blundering around here in the dark, we're at a big disadvantage.
arachne moves in the shadows because she's ashamed of her appearance.
my crew was as close to me as family, but he's gone and he's not comin' back.
and we have to get out of here while we still can.
is it me, or are you gettin' real comfortable with my goods?
this treasure's going back to king zolas, just like i told you.
you know, it's hard to believe this model prisoner... could be the same monstrous fiend who once ran for mayor.
it's a pleasure to have recommended you for the work-release program.
i really must thank you for this moment of tranquillity, edna.
you know, i haven't been on a date in six years.
i won't be happy until i find out what you're up to.
wherever you go and whatever you do, i'll be there watching and waiting.
if he crosses me one more time, just once more... well, i can't be held responsible for my actions.
well, i hope bob fed you 'cause i ate your dinners.
you know, the one who's been working at the dam and has a grudge against springfield.
i know cousin merl has had his troubles with the revenuers, but he's hardly a master-
wherever you go and whatever you do, i'll be there watching and waiting.
he says that, but i bet he gives up pretty quickly.

i slugged some jerk in tahoe they gave me one to three

i know it's hard to accept, bart, but face it sideshow bob has changed.
see, this beeper is part two of my three-part fail-safe system.
if she can't get me on the cell phone, she can beep me on the beeper.
okay, this is the first time i've run a background and actually come back respecting the guy.
william robard was decorated three times for bravery in battle during the gulf war.
according to his commendation, his platoon was cornered, so he snuck behind enemy lines and took out a squad of republican guards single-handedly so his men could get free.
well, that's great, but this is baghdad by the bay, not baghdad proper.
they read about them in the papers and they think they're cool, so everybody wants them.
but we haven't had vigilantes here since, well, not in this century, that i know of, and we're not startin' now.
um, you know that, uh, cradle that, uh, that, uh, he lent to us for cassidy?
yeah, the hand-carved one with the hearts and the flowers in it.
oh, uh, i think i put it in my storage unit.
yeah, i put all that baby stuff in there years ago.
but, uh, we've had, like, seven murders down there in the last two months.
so, i think it's probably good if i chat with him.
you gonna sit there and tell me you don't know what's going on down there?
look, mikey, uh, we just don't want your mother to lose a son.
if the cops did their job, we wouldn't need to be here at all, now, would we?
i'm thinking you're just about to see how good a job we can do.
the only dominguez child not raised in that cradle was my brother, enrico, and you know what happened to him.
oh, yeah, the, uh, rich one down there in mexico with the big farm.
we stage it to make it look like tyrell and the cops shot each other.
they'll assume tyrell took out the seau brothers, too, and the other drug dealers.
so, uh, the way i see it, you and i have an alignment of interests here.
well, that may be so, but just remember we're the cops and you're not.
william robard was decorated three times for bravery in battle during the gulf war.
according to his commendation, his platoon was cornered, so he snuck behind enemy lines and took out a squad of republican guards single-handedly so his men could get free.
you know, before they were afraid of the dealers, now they're afraid of the commandos, too.
well, the seau boys can't stay in hiding forever, can they?
if you're gonna call eva and tell her about it, then you're gonna have to call my sister karen and tell her about it.
if you call my sister karen, you have to call my cousin hermine.
j.j.'s a very special boy in his own particular way, man.
everybody that comes out of that cradle is a very special person, and it can't be duplicated.
if anyone helps the cops in any way, they can expect a surprise visit from us.
we should cut our losses and leave town with what we have already.
nobody cares about these people or a bunch of dead drug dealers.
the first time some yuppie gets blown away in his bmw in the marina, these cops are gone, and we'll still be here.
i am going to get these guys, i promise you that.
but you got to promise me that you're going to be as strong for mike as he was for you, okay?
oh, well, uh, the retirement home said, uh, you paid $75 for it, so i'm assuming that's fair.
i'm awfully fond of it myself, and i wasn't aware of its special value.
when those two turn up dead, it'll send every pig in the city down here.
not if they find dead cops and a cop killer at the same time.
we make the body placements match the angle of the entry wounds and make sure the distances are correct.
the coroner's going to check on powder burns and splatter patterns.
i mean, i'm from jersey, we got springsteen, so it's a different thing.
but you get off the plane in israel, and immediately, they're like, "welcome to israel...
so, finally, i just, i told them i had stomach cancer, and couldn't have anything spicy.
last night, i'm playing this game with ben, a board game...
why did you suddenly get it into your mind to play this game, and playing the game, why did you have to cheat?
i just... there was the winning card glaring right at me, and i just blurted it out.
we're gonna put 'em behind your hairline, so no one will ever actually notice them."
what he failed to tell me was five years later, my hairline would not be there.
i feel safe here, 'cause i got that chain that goes from the wall to the door.
you put that on at night, and that just says to criminals,
you know what, tonight is not a great night for this.
but if i can make this offer, if you would extend...
i mean, as soon as she comes out of the dressing room with the first thing on, to me, it's like a bank robbery.
"let's go, that's the one, let's go, get in the car!
she can see a 3 x 5 card tacked up on a tree three miles up ahead.
next thing i know, we're heading for somebody's yard full of junk.
some fool might come by who wants to throw away four dinars.
i can go as low as three dinars but, that's firm.
i'm not letting you out of my sight until i find gabrielle.
if anything happens to her, next time it won't be a bluff.
i bet you won't fight me again because you know i'd win.
don't flatter yourself.young thugs like you are a dinar a dozen.
when i heard what kind of a girl they were looking for, i figured i could kill two birds with one stone.
give them what they were looking for for a fee, and get you to fight me.
as you know, the royal court must approve the king's choice.
i'm counting on you to turn the little peasant trash into a queen.
we'll, we'll invade, the same way you did in vivlauser, a few years ago!
setting the oil reserves on fire was a stroke of genius!
they say you could hear their men scream all the way to athens.
or, how about the way you slaughtered those men in corinth, eh?
your majesty, i'm sorry to disturb you before the wedding, but, uh--
well, you know, i thought we should meet sooner or later, right?
bear witness to the holy wedlock of this mortal couple, bonded for all eternity.
let no man put asunder what the gods, in their infinite wisdom, have blessed.
so you better pretend to be something you can live with.
i think i'm gonna pretend to be good for a while.
i think i might follow him and see if he needs a-- sidekick.
you know, it's pretty good work, if you can get it.
some fool might come by who wants to throw away four dinars.
i can go as low as three dinars, but, that's firm.
if anything happens to her, next time it won't be a bluff.
that oil i got in my eyes, has that got sumac in it?
setting the oil reserves on fire was a stroke of genius.
they say you could hear their men scream all the way to athens.
by ancient proclamation the queen must accompany her king to the other side.
in other words the highlight of your honeymoon will be a trip to the royal crematorium.
let no man put asunder what the gods in their infinite wisdom, have blessed.
and now for a sip from the wine of dionysus to consecrate this holy bond.
i think i might follow him and see if he needs a sidekick.
you know, it's pretty good work, if you can get it.
some fool might come by who wants to throw away four dinars.

in this day and age a principal is no more than a glorified babysitter.
i lack the resources and authority to bring these vandels to justice.
have the cia bug the boys' bathroom in case someone starts bragging.
call the pta and postpone the spelling bee 'cause we got us some bad guys to catch.
if you're such a genius, how come you only have one arm?
well, i discovered your teleporter and i decided that was the perfect way to sneak into farber and to get some payback on scampi.
if you help me do my homework, i'll get you a biscuit.
and kenny tyler serves up the alley-oop and antoine tyler slams it home.
you did a little scraping and clawing yourself last night there, bernie.
incidentally, if they win the pac-10, it'll be the first time since 1985.
and that is a long, long, long, long, long time to wait.
and here's harry the husky to attempt his patented slam dunk.
i want them to think we're playing with eight guys out there.
if they make a pass half-court, they're gonna win the game.
can you believe that seven-foot serbian tried to pay me in traveller's cheques?
why are you taking that man's drachma or whatever it's called?
hey, look, i'm just trying to make this a fair bet.
better yet, i'll go down and pull her, she'll make us eggs in the morning.
all we gotta do is put the biscuit in the basket, the noodles in the soup, the cookies in the milk, the beef in the...
you said you wanted me to be a little bit more verbal, coach.
from the oakland memorial coliseum, it's the university of washington huskies against the bulldogs of fresno state.
first though, we got a chance to watch harry the husky as he'll perform his patented slam-a-jam-a dunk.
anyway, the thing is, there's something going on with this team.
i have a feeling kenny's got something to do with it.
what i'm getting at is something you ain't got: a break.
now if there's a story here and you drop the dime, you know, it could be the cover of sporting news.
and the little guy will bring it up for the dawgs.
and marlowe covers him stride for stride all the way up-court.
billy, it's gonna be a long night for the huskies unless they can find someone to put those defensive handcuffs on georgetown's jerrod smith.
george, when you got a 6'5" point guard that can go in the paint and shoot the three, it's an impossible match-up in the college level.
and i always felt that if i had played just a little bit better...
you know, if i had really played my guts out, that we would've won.
6'5" point guard, rudy olivera, 6'9" power forward, jj sampson, and 6'10" forward, mark tucker.
i don't even think lady luck can help the huskies tonight.
major has a look and sets, and he'll take the three and he got it.
the husky fans cheer their underdog udub squad for that three, but it's hardly enough to send the minutemen packing.
olivera proving his all-american status in this half, and he'll finish it with... a score!
well, umass leads 42 to 22 at half-time, billy, and i guess the $64,000 question right now is, has that magic that brought the huskies into the final four finally abandoned them?
you love to see big players come up in big games.
he's put this team on his back and he's carrying them tonight.
the huskies step up the d, but time is running out.
somebody's gotta force a turnover or a foul here or this one's in the books.
you did a little scraping and clawing yourself last night there, bernie.
incidentally, if they win the pac-10, it'll be the first time since 1985.
"while antoine is the engine that runs this team, she can write, man.
it is his younger brother kenny who leaves his mark on virtually every play."
first your father has a heart attack... ¶ oh, yeah ¶ ¶ deeper than ¶
¶ deeper than ever ¶ ¶ deeper than deeper than ¶
¶ oh, yeah ¶ ¶ deeper than deeper than love ¶
¶ etched on my heart ¶ ¶ etched on my heart ¶
but coach nichols thinks i should start jimmy at the point tomorrow.
normally i'd ignore him, but it's the first original idea he's had in five seasons, so i'm trying it on for size.
the next year we signed you, and i knew i had a team...
that could take washington to the final four for the first time since '63.
at the start of the second half, the cal bears lead the hapless huskies 43-31.
but the big story tonight, the continuing poor play of kenny tyler...
oh, the easy two would have sealed the game, but you went for the three.
were you trying to send the basketball world a message, kenny?
listen, either you talk to us right now, or we're gonna go talk to coach.
coach don't say nothin' to you other than "sit down," jimmy.
that can go in the paint and shoot the three, it's an impossible match-up on the college level.
i don't think the huskies have another upset in them tonight.
i'd come into the locker room, see all these jerseys hangin', and i'd find the one with my name on it.
i would just sit down, stare at it, wondering if i could go out there and lay some up one more time, and live up to the hype.
well, you know, we should have won that game, but we didn't, and i always felt...
that if i had played just a little bit better, you know, if i had really played my guts out, that we would have won, and i would have won that medal.
and believe me, you will have no regrets, and you will win your medal.
just go out there and play the game that you love.
olivera proving his all-american status in this half, and he'll finish it with two more.
well, u-mass leads 42 to 22 at halftime, billy, and i guess the $64,000 question right now is,
kenny tyler is lighting it up on both ends of the court now.
o'grady looks for someone, gets it to tyler on the wing.
¶ ain't no stoppin' us now ¶ ¶ no, there ain't no stoppin' stoppin' us now ¶
¶ you know it's time to get your groove on ¶
¶ keep on risin' ¶ ¶ straight to the top, baby ¶
¶ straight to the top ¶ ¶ ain't nobody standing' in your way ¶
virtually overlooked in pre-season polls, they have scraped and clawed their way into the top of pac-10 standings.
you did a little scraping and clawing yourself last night there, bernie.
incidentally, if they win the pac-10, it'll be the first time since 1985.
and that is a long, long, long, long, long time to wait.
can you believe that seven-foot serbian tried to pay me in traveller's cheques?
why are you taking that man's drachma or whatever it's called?
hey, look, i'm just trying to make this a fair bet.

all we gotta do is put the biscuit in the basket, the noodles in the soup, the cookies in the milk, the beef in the...
you said you wanted me to be a little bit more verbal, coach.
welcome to the san francisco bay area and the sights and sounds of the ncaa west regional.
from the oakland memorial coliseum, it's the university of washington huskies against the bulldogs of fresno state.
i know you're both adults, and what you guys do during recess is no business of mine.
anyway, the thing is, there's something going on with this team.
their little guy danny o'grady elevates his game to a new level.
so does his team, as coach pederson's squad upsets dean smith's north carolina tar heels, sends the heels packing back to chapel hill.
and look for tyler now to try to run a four-corner slow-down offence.
he looks inside, fakes and now he'll toss an alley-oop to lasalle.
ma, that man ain't got no teeth, but always wants something to eat.
look for tyler now to try to run a four-corner slow-down offence.
if you want me to go, you just tell me and i'm gone.
jimmy, this is my brother, and, um... ..if he wants to stay, then he stays.
gentlemen, keep an eye on this girl, because she has the drive.
you know, i think she'd sell her own mother for a good story.
welcome to the meadowlands, home of the ncaa, home of college basketball's highest honour, and home of all the pageantry and excitement that is the final four.
we kick off all the festivities with udub's harry the husky.
george, when you got a 6'5" point guard that can go in the paint and shoot the three, it's an impossible match-up in the college level.
i don't think the huskies have another upset in 'em tonight.
well, you know, we should've won that game, but we didn't.
and i always felt that if i had played just a little bit better...
and it's just you guys, two orange hoops, 94 feet of hardwood.
so go out there and play the very best that you can, and really play your guts out.
umass just too strong tonight for the huskies, as they pull to a 14-point advantage with five minutes to go in the half.
olivera proving his all-american status in this half, and he'll finish it with... a score!
he's put this team on his back and he's carrying them tonight.
tyler fakes left, circles in, drives, jumpshot up and it is good...
because of our action, we'll have autonomy without the influence of your immoral culture.
a twenty-megaton nuclear warhead has been hidden in one of your cities.
no one in the whole wide world will ever hurt you.
and, if they even try, they have to come through me, i will karate them down to pieces.
because if this ends up to another, really, it's coming out of you pay check.
alright, no i got it, ok, it's here i see it, i see it, no problem.
because you'll understand suffering the way we have for thousands of years.
because of our action, we'll have autonomy without the influence of your immoral culture.
a twenty-megaton nuclear warhead has been hidden in one of your cities.
there is nothing that you or anyone can do to stop it.
the trio is equipped with a transmitter that's broadcasts an electronic signature.
we're sweeping the metropolitan area now, about a third of it's covered.
we're implementing a horizontal escalation that's all over our active sights.
we expect to see significant improvement at this time and don't anticipate any problems.
some years ago there was a situation involving someone not dissimilar to rudy.
he helped us effect a mission, which resulted in the rescue ...of several hundred hostages.
because of our action, we'll have autonomy without the influence of your immoral culture.
a twenty-megaton nuclear warhead has been hidden in one of your cities.
no one in the whole wide world will ever hurt you.
and, if they even try, they have to come through me, i will karate them down to pieces.
it didn't work, but i did learn to wiggle my ears that summer.
anyway, uh, yeah, the short answer toyour question would be, "yes, i am a u.s. citizen."
i'm not gettin' anywhere with her until i whip out... my brand-new security clearance card.
next thing you know, she's all over me like a russian spy.
i can't tell you where he is unless you promise he's not gonna get arrested.
well, i can't promise that until you tell mewhere he is.
dharma, ifyou want to be mad at me that's fine... but, for the record, you're mad at me for something you think i might have done... whereas i'm mad atyou for something thatyou actually did do.
no, it's something that i didn't do, and i didn't do it because ifl did do it... you would have donewhatyou claim you might not have done.
why don'tyou call your mom and tell her the good news?
nah, i think i better break this to her in person.
isn't there some wayyou could getyour friends in the f.b.i.... to make him think he's a criminal?
i guess we could trump up a big old file full of groovy antiwar crimes... flytowashington and plant it at the f.b.i. headquarters.
letting a guy break in to steal a fake file... but the man's entire identity is wrapped up in being a '60's revolutionary.
like i was telling your friend, for season tickets to the 49ers...
the new modern piscinas aren't as nice as the old piscinas, but be careful.
you have no idea what a piscina is, do you, tim?
it's a basin, with a pipe that goes directly into the ground so that the sacred fluids go right back into the earth.
the piscina is a thousand year old tradition in the church and it's symbolic of many wondrous miracles.
to school to sign up to volunteer at the hospice home.
it's great you're doing it, but working with people who are dying isn't gonna be easy.
the concept of hospice is an alternative to the medical establishment.
which is a greedy, doctor-controlled bureaucracy that's death-oriented instead of life-oriented.
when i volunteer for the children i am bubbles the clown.
oh, becky, would you like to put these in some water?
corruption of the political establishment, lack of ethics in corporate america, hypocrisy of organized religion.
there are just so many things in this world that people follow blindly.
i know, but for a long time i've been questioning why i'm there.
question all you want to, as long as your butt's in that pew.
one night some kid took this beautiful chevelle super sport, a '67.
he just corkscrewed off a turn and the idiot wrecked it.
some people, uh, take their spare time and work on their cars and go to church on sunday.
others take their spare time to help their fellow man and then choose not to go to church.
what i always say is, "go in peace to love and serve the lord".
if you think about it, that's what randy's doing, isn't it?
unless i find some other way to do the lord's work.
nice try, but i don't think dropping a flathead into a convertible qualifies as the lord's work.
we spend our whole lives trying to figure stuff like this out.
i've spent a long time trying to understand why my father died so young.
homeless people enjoyed a roof over their heads... and hot meals over christmas...
if they find the stuff - they won't - but if they do, you can tell them you had no idea.
do it the way the sas do it with the irish firm.
put one in his head before he puts one in yours.
police are hunting a gang of armed ram raiders who stole an undisclosed sum yesterday, from a security depot in hounslow, west london.
they struck just after 5:00 using a stolen truck modified into a battering ram with a steel girder.
it may account for the fogging of your pet scan of leonard betts's head.
you know, with this equipment, i have been able to capture phantom images... ..of whole leaves that were cut in half,... ..or the vestigial image of a lizard's tail long after it's been cutoff.
what scientists call punctual equilibrium... ..theorizes that evolutionary advances are cataclysmic, not gradual.
that evolution occurs not along a straight graphable line but in huge fits and starts,... ..and the unimaginable happens in the gaps.
the gap between what we are and what betts has become.
what you're describing is someone so evolved... ..that you wouldn't even call him human.
so if there's anything you can get out of mrs tanner tonight...
at this point we don't have much else to go on.

on the other hand, how evolved can a man be who drives a dodge dart?

just this morning this is what i found under our door.
and now you've come here not to help us but to ask our help so you can impose yourjustice on the only man who's taken justice into his own hands.
if the groundwater was contaminated, arsine gas could've created a combustible mixture.
is there anything that distinguishes this particular sefer yezirah from other books?
until the day that i told him i was getting married.
and for the first time in 50 years, he took out this ring.
he emigrated to israel after wwii and joined the irgun - the jewish military underground.
he was arrested in 1959 by the british for a bombing that killed seven civilians.
the boys that killed him, their hate took him from you and you tried bringing him back with your love.
but what you brought back you have to understand, ariel it isn't him.
an unscrupulous medical supplier might pay top dollar, no questions asked.
but why take a headless one and leave top-dollar bodies behind?
maybe nothing, but it's all we got to go on right now.
you should see if you can find a place where you can examine betts' head.
he could diagnose illness better than any doctor i've ever seen.
you know how they say some people can look at you and tell you what's wrong?
i don't know, scully, but those sure as hell look like shoulders to me.
i don't even know how to explain that photo, or even what it proves.
we both know that salamanders have grown entirely new limbs-- regenerated.
salamanders are one thing, but no mammal possesses that regenerative power.
i'm just saying it's not unheard of in nature, that's all.
unheard of or not, someone is going to great lengths to dispose of evidence.
what scientists call punctualism or punctual equilibrium, it theorizes that evolutionary advances are cataclysmic, not gradual.
that evolution occurs not along a straight graphable line, but in huge fits and starts, and that the unimaginable happens in the gaps-- the gap between what we are and what leonard betts has become.
but what you're describing is someone so radically evolved... that you wouldn't even call him human.
well, on the other hand, how evolved can a man be who drives a dodge dart?
i mean, wouldn't it make sense that-- that evolution, or natural selection, would incorporate cancer, the greatest health threat, as our genetic makeup?
why do i think that charles darwin is rolling in his grave?
if this man really exists, what makes you think he'd come back here?
the only person connected with betts who knows his secret is his mom.
if he steals a car or gets a ride, he could get away for good.
i mean he obviously worked this thing out pretty well, scully, so if there's anything you can get out of mrs. tanner tonight, anything at all, at this point we don't have much else to go on.
nor do the corneas appear clouded,... ..which would seem inconsistent with the witnessed time of death, 19 hours ago.
i'll begin with the inter-mastoid incision and frontal craniotomy,... ..then make my examination of the brain.
the only thing that could account for the image distortion is some form of radiation.
but i don't see how or where it could be emanating from.
he could diagnose illness better than any doctor i've ever seen.
you know how they say some people can just look at you and tell you what's wrong?
at any rate, we should have some autopsy answers for you soon.
i'm starting with an anterior slice from your mr betts,... ..one favouring the frontal lobe.

mulder, mrs tanner's going into the er, but she took a downturn en route.
they defibrillated her, but there's no chance of getting anything cogent from her.
we've got a chopper coming, but i'd say betts has a pretty good chance of getting away.
if he steals a car or gets a ride, he could get away for good.
maybe nothing, but it's all we got to go on right now.

i'd get a plane ticket, a backpack, and enough cash to last me two months in europe.
that is if i steal all my meals and i sleep in a bus station.
and he said that thursday he had to, like, take his--
his car in to get this ding fixed that he got in a parking lot.
- but drew had never heard that story so, of course, he got all offended, thought that i meant that he, you know, willed his accident to happen or something.
well, i'm sure he would have had a sense of humor about it if he knew will, don't you think?
'cause you know how in the beginning when you're dating somebody and--
and you don't know each other's lives that well or anything, and you don't know each other like--
- he says it's his absolute first choice so he's definitely gonna go.
his mom and dad were so excited for him that they said that they were gonna pay for him to go to europe for two months in the summer before he started up.
into this relationship these this two persons are now to be joined.
if you know any reason why you should not be joined in marriage, make it now known.
i mean, there is no way that you would have done something like this if mom and dad--
maybe not, but if they had been around the last few years, charlie, i'd be, like, someone else entirely.
and, charlie, when i said yes, it felt like the rightest thing i have ever done in my life.
it felt like with that one word, that everything else just snapped into place.
it's, like, griffin loves me, and we are gonna be together forever and--
and that means that i can go anywhere, and i can be anything, and i will have that.
- what i'm about to ask you is... unauthorised by the millennium group.
if you tell me to take a flying leap, it won't affect our professional relationship.
no less than having my breast torn open, my heart and organs thrown over my shoulder and carried in the valley of jehoshaphat.
the decaying body in the lab isn't the only reason we're here.
what he saw in those bones gave rise to the persecution, torture, death of thousands.
at the same time, members of the order of knights chroniclers, whose warnings about the millennium conflicted with the order of the empire, became hunted.
legend has it that whoever has possession of the hand has the knowledge to overcome the evils of the millennium.
great story, but you can't believe that a mummified hand, even if it's a holy relic, can tell us anything.
peter watts was an assistant director at the fbi for ten years.
he led the international task force on crime for three years.
dr schlossburg identified mr watts as his attacker prior to being murdered.
we place him at the hospital via video surveillance before the crime.
can you tell who accessed schlossburg's account to go online two nights ago?
i can maybe get you the charge account of the user.
from the massive blood loss, i'd say the attack was violent and protracted.
looking around this expensive equipment, the only motive we can rule out is robbery.
don't tell me we had this conversation on an unsecured line.
in a court of law, this could be construed as a de facto admission of guilt.
the perp capped the mark at around, maybe, midnight three days ago.
i hope you don't mind me saying you have a colourful vocabulary.
the decaying body in the lab isn't the only reason we're here.
that's part of it, but i'm hoping that the body leads to a greater discovery.
just at a cursory glance, i'd say 50, 75 years at the most.
dr schlossburg has placed that body at a thousand years old.
the group asked me to speak about interview and interrogation techniques at the police academy in bremen.
i heard what happened, and came as fast as i could.
a guy using his work station for porn would likely have other salacious material for use... on hand, if you get my drift.

i'd rather be my own master and stand on my own feet.
the english ministry has already collected a tax on this tea, and added it to the price.
now, if we let that stuff in, every time we buy a pound of it, we'ii be paying a tax we haven't voted.
i copied this from the creamer and enlarged it, but it always comes out wrong.
this is properly the work for a master, not an apprentice.

[mrs. lapham] there'ii be no more following the trade for you.
why, we're not bound to his contract after this, are we?
if you can't serve me, you'ii have to find other work.

he lets us know every time he gets a new tenant.
looks as though mr. lyte intends to make an example of you.
but, sir, yours is a very weii-known family, both here and in england.
i'm under the impression that your father had five children, rather than the four you mention.
look at this beggar from the streets and look at me, sir, and let that be your answer.
your eloquence is respected by all, mr quincy, but i fear, sir, that not even you can alter fact.
that heirloom, of little value in itself, was plainly stolen for no other purpose than to establish just such a preposterous claim as that young ruffian has proposed.
your honor, the apprentices of boston get out of hand these days.
no, sir, because you'd brought us an order that could've paid all the back rent grandpa owes you.
your honor, it is not i who am prejudiced in this case.
a tenant who dares to testify against her landlord has courage, sir.
and in the opinion of this court, no possible motive but the truth.
his imagination gets the best of him every now and then.

on the other hand, there's a tea ship at griffin's wharf that will have been in harbor 20 days tomorrow.
the seditious meddiers who call themselves the sons of liberty have given us a bad time these past 20 days, admiral.
i swear if i hadn't stiffened the governor's resolution, he'd have shipped that tea back to england.
no damage to the ship, no violence to the crew, no harm to any cargo but the tea.
it would seem, mr. lyte, our celebration is a trifle premature.
i have lived in these provinces for too many years, sir, to enjoy the responsibilities now thrust upon me.
chatham speaks here of the ministry and the effects of its colonial policy.
"resistance to your acts was as necessary as it was just, and your imperious doctrines will be found incompetent to convince or enslave your fellow subjects in america, who feel that tyranny is intolerable to british subjects."
"aii attempts to establish despotism over such a mighty continental nation must be vain, must be fatal."
i must not open this port to any trade whatsoever, until the tea has been paid for to the iast shilling.
and i must stamp out vigorously the least sign of resistance to the ministry's policy.
to make an offer i now realize i would have regretted for the rest of my iife.
i've been at pains to investigate your claim of relationship to me.
i was willing to grant you might indeed be my dead sister's son.
i'd intended to take you to england with me, and try and make a gentleman of you.

colonel smith and his staff are quartered at the afric queen.
we've shouted our treason in the press and public squares for 1 0 long years without hindrance.
did ever an occupied city receive better treatment than we of boston have had?
is the earth so small there can be room for only one people?
or can we here fight for men and women and children all over the world?
even as we shoot down british soldiers, we will be winning rights their children shall enjoy forever.

fellas, my name is hank hill, and i'm the block captain.
now, it's not that i don't like music, it's just that...
what is wrong with you, picking on little kids like that?
how would you like it if someone bigger and stronger shot you up, you little freak?
i spent four years holding guys like you upside down over toilets.
i don't care how many guys you held in the men's room.
you are hank freaking hill... the man who won the texas propane association blue flame of valor award.
the man who drove raccoon after raccoon out of our attic... armed only with a broom handle and a pillowcase.
the man whose sperm struggled through that tiny urethra god cursed you with... to create our wonderful son.
now, you go back out there, and get yourself a rematch.
we're all here searching... for a clue that shows us what life... surely promises us.
for a way of seeing what lies... under the simple surface of things.
i lost a son to the war ... and my wife before it.
yet i believe we shall be together again and i rejoice in it.
perhaps even a tiny imperfection in the glass of the lens itself.
by why is it at the end of her hand, exactly where she said it would be?
do not think of death as a distant country ... for it is as quickly found as the blink of a man's eye.
do not suppose death to be a stranger... for it is as familiar as the beat of a man's heart.
we mourn at the passing of her physical shell... and we rejoice... at the flowering of her immortal soul.
she has awoken from a dream ... and we, who are left behind ... are the dream.
we've lost two day's business... and the partners were not amused, i might add.
i've been dragged down here without so much as a what's it... and you still haven't said a word about what we're supposed to do.
with trams and tea dances... and bills to pay and children to raise.
where real live people f all in love with other real live people.
the more i think about it the more i realize you're the only one for me.
we are bound together by strands as slight as silk ...
everyone of you here, ladies and gentlemen ... has something in common ... something that links you to your neighbour.
we're all here searching... for a clue that shows us what life... surely promises us.
for a way of seeing what lies... under the simple surface of things.
recently, we've had continued messages at seances ... indicating that a visible sign was coming through.
-it is a crime... to offer people hope when there is none.
does death, and what comes after, hold no mystery for you?
we are all of us here, a footfall all away from death.
do not think of death as a distant country ... for it is as quickly found as the blink of a man's eye.
do not suppose death to be a stranger... for it is as familiar as the beat of a man's heart.
we come here... to mourn beatrice templeton ... my wife ... known affectionately to us all as bea.
what i found when i went to burkinwell... is bigger than this trial and more important than my life.
there is another world... as close to this one as i am to you.
the only thing a guy like that understands is punishment, hard and swift.
leo, you said it yourself, our first conversation, all we do is recycle.
a new inmate comes in, we sit on him, send him back out, he's back with a vengeance.
if we don't do something different, we don't do something radical, we're never gonna break the chain.
timmy boy believes he can save every one of us, from each other, from ourselves, from the system that dumped us in here.
only thing he don't get is, you gotta want to be saved.
they call this the penal system, but it's really the penis system.
it's about how big, it's about how long, it's about how hard.
you do the work assigned you, you stay out of trouble, we're gonna get along just fine.
otherwise, you go into the general population and, kareem, in the rest of oz, nobody's treated the way they would like to be treated.
i know the influence that you can have over other men.
so i'm hoping we can work together, make everybody's stay here more productive.
seventy-eight percent of the population at oswald state penitentiary are men of color.
the ratio is, at last count, one officer for every nine prisoners.
our heart and our mind must be cleansed and set free.
and that means no drugs no alcohol, and no cigarettes, brother.
how come you're in here shaking your tits in front of 1400 guys?
i'm trying to meet men and i'm bored with the bar scene.
i'm gonna say it once and i'm gonna say it as simply as i can.
every inmate, every officer either hates your guts or they're terrified of you, or both.
what happened in that shower was between me and the fag boy, had nothing to do with you, you fucking redneck scumbag.
why don't you take your pure white ass and get the fuck away from me?
i don't want you ever bringing them back here, ever again.

only thing he don't get is, you gotta want to be saved.
take that for that fucking co for tarring across my face
feel that for that lawyer who don't give two fucks about me
you know, i'm not really used to doing this kind of work.
not that i think there's anything wrong with it or demeaning.
it's about how big, it's about how long, it's about how hard.
life in oz is all about the size of your dick and anybody who tells you different ain't got one.
i sure as hell don't hear you coming up with anything better.
i'm telling you, leo, fucking mcmanus is out of fucking control.
to finally be an equal in a place where i do not have the freedom to enjoy it.
you do the work assigned you, you stay out of trouble, we're gonna get along just fine.
so i was hoping we could work together to make everybody's stay here more productive.
i would like to help my brothers live a full life.
they must be replaced by a strict discipline and a channeled focus.
and not only will our lives here in satan's house be improved, but our spirits will be renewed.
now this white man, he may have enslaved us with his laws and he may have enslaved us in his jail,
but he has not, cannot, will not enslave the very essence of our mortal soul.
what happened in the shower was between me and the fag boy had nothing to do with you, you fucking redneck scumbag.

and not only will our lives here in satan's house be improved,
i'll be sitting in that cell until they carry my guinea ass out in a body bag so why don't you shut up and put me in the hole?
dino, do you know why in em city i put lifers in with all the rest?
you know, this is your third fight related to a homosexual encounter.
you can't go swinging on a guy every time he makes a pass at you, dino.
we have these routines that are supposed to give our lives order and meaning.
but i'm here to testify i'm less afraid of getting shanked in my back than the routine.
pussy inmate took the state to court, said smoking was bad for his health.
this whole fucking place is bad for your health, you know what i'm saying?
they're suddenly free in a whole other kind of way, they're ready to die.
and maybe they do what they can to help that shit along.
see, they each entered their girlfriends in the pageant and since then, we've had nothing but trouble.
wrecked costumes, ripped props, and now this business on the beach.
i want to introduce you to our newest contestant, miss amphipolis and her sponsor, the marquesa.
ladies, this is miss messini, sponsored by the doge of messini.
if miss messini had been skewered, the doge would've blamed the other two.
i would've lost both the peace and my shirt in one fell swoop.
if xena gets back, get her dressed and down to the stage fast.
if she doesn't stay in to keep this thing on the level we're all goners.
that it's hard for him to see past that to the person underneath.
but then i guess a lot of people make that mistake.
i have here the final results of the first miss known world pageant.
now, if for any reason, the winner is unable to perform her duties like, she isn't here..., ...then the crown will go to the first runner-up.
uh-- it's been almost a year, now, since the peace was signed.
ah-- that's plenty of time for things to return to being safe and normal.
see, they each entered their girlfriends in the pageant, and since then, we've had nothing but trouble--
wrecked costumes, ripped props, and now this business on the beach!
you wouldn't think a woman would put you through all this, just to win some silly contest.
i just keep focused on the extra food my village will get if i win.
this is a chance to use a part of me most people usually laugh at-- or worse.
the part i usually have to hide-- only here that part works for me-- you see?
you can't know how stupid something like this seems, when you've been through a war where it was a fight just to survive.
well, if that's how you all feel, then why are you here?
that it's hard for him to see past that to the person underneath.
but, then i guess a lot of people make that mistake-- don't you?
only the guy who rigged it could have looked up at that beam.
and as for the security you were adding well, there wasn't a guard in sight.
not quite the judges have voted and they're ready to crown a winner.
i have here the final results of the first miss known world pageant.
now, if for any reason, the winner is unable to perform her duties like, she isn't here!
then the crown will go to the first runner-up, and so on down the line.
however, their wish to the dragon balls was not granted, and the earth met with unprecedented abnormal phenomena.
every time the dragon balls grant a wish, minus energy accumulates within them.
due to the repeated use of the dragon balls, it had finally overflowed.
goku and pan have once again left on a journey to find the dragon balls.
the earth has returned to normal just as much as the liang xing qiu ball has.
which would mean that since there are seven dragon balls total... 1 ... 2... 3... 4 after we defeat six more of those guys, the earth will be the way it was?
there ain't any reason why i couldn't take on all six of them together!
as long as i have gill around, i could more than handle them all myself!
now then, i ain't got a lot of time to be playing around with you.
i've still got five more of you to go after this.
that thing appeared suddenly and started sucking up all the electricity in town.
it was so creepy that all the people in town went somewhere else.
did you think i would be surprised by you showing off?
do you want to try me, to see if i'm just showing off?
now then, i ain't got a lot of time to be playing around with you.
i've still got five more of you to go after this.
he sure can't get in out of the rain like that.
he relied too much on his own power, and brought about his own destruction, huh?
(quinn) what if you found a portal to a parallel universe?
what if you could slide into a thousand different worlds, where it's the same year, and you're the same person, but everything else is different?
you know, you'd think someone who sucks brain to stay alive would stand out in a crowd.
and where are all the coma patients he usually leaves behind?
i would think you'd be willing to give up a little sleep if it meant finding rickman.
if you don't get his timer, you don't get the coordinates to go home.
perhaps if you didn't drink so much, it would last longer.
hey, i'm the one running around all day getting business done.
(van) see, you got your body, you got your soul or your spirit.
it the spirit gets trapped inside the body at the time of death, it freaks out.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
mayhem, i don't care about the leadership of our tribe, not yet.
all i'm concerned about now is winning tomorrow's battle with as few casualties as possible.
and when we take back our valley..., ...we'll be sending a message to the whole world.
amazons want what is rightfully ours..., ...and we'll fight our righteous war until we get it!
but if we truly want to put an end to our enemies' lies their broken treaties..., ... we must prevail.
be assured, we will reclaim the ancestral lands that are rightfully ours.
he's also the key to that village, maybe the whole war.
you kill hercules and the fight'll go out of the rest of them.
we make promises and we try our best to keep them.
if they don't work out, we still have to go on.
my life's not worth anything anymore..., ...not after what the amazons have done to you.
they've done nothing to me except teach me to be strong and independent.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
you may have it in you to take over this tribe, one day.
mayhem, i don't care about the leadership of our tribe not yet.
it's not blood that makes an amazon warrior it's training and preparation and attitude.
we need to be able to count on each other watch each other's back.
tomorrow we take the next step in reclaiming our ancestral lands.
and when we take back our valley we'll be sending a message to the whole world.
my sisters... we have reached a critical stage in our righteous war.
but if we truly want to put an end to our enemies' lies their broken treaties we must prevail.
be assured, we will reclaim the ancestral lands that are rightfully ours.
but i beg you don't be like our fallen sister, lucine.
hercules... well he's the epitome of everything that we're against male, glory, and domination.
he's also the key to that village maybe the whole war.
i'm gonna take care of my sister one way or another.
you can keep shooting, and i can keep catching but it won't do us any good.
i found you crying, then because your parents had left you to die like an animal all because you were first-born and female.
you're a blessing given to me from the gods, because i couldn't have daughters of my own.
my life's not worth anything, anymore not after what the amazons have done to you.
uh, they've done nothing to me except teach me to be strong and independent.
i caught a break, being as you were in the area and not in seattle.
i would have been here sooner, only i got stuck behind a truck loaded with elephants.
but it's an incredibly significant archaeological site, and i want that respected.
i told you once, i told you 90 times, dr michaels, this site is closed.
or they put religious statues on the dashboard of their car.
even if he did do that, it wouldn't mean nothing to me.
now, it usually followed an unsuccessful attempt by the victim to reach, and return from, the spirit world.
so, in order to converse with his ancestors, he would have to bring himself to the brink of death.
these people believed, and still do believe, in another plane of existence.
people actually died from the heart squeeze - a myth in which a seneca sorcerer committed murder by psychically squeezing a victim's heart.
and our culture ignores the fact that the hopi predicted the railroads, the arrival of longhorn cattle, the strip mining of hopi land.
the native americans appeared to have access to an elevated plane, that no matter what i do, or how much i think i understand...
well, early researchers thought that the prayer stick was a kind of indian rosary.
the top and bottom represent heaven and hell, and the symbols in-between normally suggest specific prayers that the stick's owner might say, but...
could this be a resurrection symbol one would carry if you were sent to the other world?
if this messenger was carrying one, daniel olivaw must have been carrying one too.
i believe the symbol may belong to a lost tribe of the iroquois.
when the seneca were put on the first reservation in the 1790s, the bond between the five iroquois tribes was severed.
through separation and time, the original prophecies have been lost or forgotten.
the men who killed daniel olivaw have been taking from other tribes and filling in the blanks.
the book of revelations may be portrayed allegorically, but the overarching idea of the apocalypse is real.
"everything starts with one blade of grass. " these events, to them, are coming true.
long ago, there were two brothers, one red, the other white.
the great spirit gave them a stone tablet, with the sign of a circle upon it.
each brother took half of the tablet, half of the circle.
the white brother went west to develop the power of reason.
the red brother stayed behind to develop the power of spirit.
when pahana, the lost white brother, returns, he will bring together both halves of the circle.
spirit and reason will become one, and at last we will have a paradise on earth.
once you've joined daniel on the spirit road, the circle will be complete.
they're 50 yards long, so if daniel opened the door to the west... there, in the hotel, then frank is intended to fulfil the prophecy by opening the door to the east.
so they're somewhere between 25 and 75 yards from the hotel in that direction.
tramps don't have heart attacks on other people's property in the nude.
detective chief inspector walsh, detective sergeant mcloughlin, silverbourne police, to see mrs maybury.
the whole area from the abdomen down has been almost completely devoured.
imagine him sitting up with his legs out in front and blood pouring from his belly.
my only choice was to keep things normal while you accused me of murdering their father.
this time, i'm not having your vicious lies anywhere near them, all right?
her father must have thought highly of you to entrust you with his grandchildren's future.
did he know about the relationship you both had with his daughter?
dump the body here and everybody's sure to think phoebe did it.
assuming you're right and the murderer is local, how did they know about the ice house?
i know anne would say i was collaborating with the enemy, but we have to give them all our co-operation.
the sooner they solve this, the sooner they'll leave us alone.
once he'd got the money, he didn't have to pretend any more.
you know what kept me going through those hours of questioning last time?
how i managed to stay calm, in spite of what they were accusing me of?
it was the sheer bloody relief that i'd finally got rid of the bastard.
she wanted to make people sorry for her, "loyal wife" shit.
probably reckoned it would make a good defence if you ever found the body.
that's not exactly a sensible question to ask a lesbian, is it?
there are allegations that the women here have tried to seduce the local female population.
and you, revelling in your superiority as a heterosexual male, have a go at me on matters of principle.
you're not interested in the truth, just whether your inflated ego can make a dent in mine.
you don't expect me to believe that mrs maybury connected the central heating by herself?
just because your wife doesn't know an s-bend from a y-front!
mrs fowler sent him away 'cause he turned up in the middle of a kid's party.
he was wearing an old trilby, green jacket and bright checked trousers.
on two occasions during the first two weeks of september he and his girlfriend were, i quote,
"scared shitless by the most god-awful racket, like souls crying in hell".
how about the feral cats from the farm fighting over the body?
if that's right and the dates are accurate, we're beginning to get a timescale.
you haven't got a public life, never mind a private one.
take your warrant card away and your balls would drop off.
your diary will help us establish your movements during the past few months.
you'll get it back as soon as we're finished with it.
god knows why you joined the police force, but if you want to keep your job, do yourself a favour.
walsh will have a fit if he sees you like this.
one night he screamed he'd only married her because of the baby.
if i hadn't been born, none of this would have started.
i've a mind to charge you both with wasting police time.
no, i do the charging. 50 quid every time i draw breath.
find out who cleared it out and ask them a few questions.
the inspector ordered a constable to be here while i was away.
a few days later, i went to his office and he'd disappeared.
anyone who invests in see-through radiators should expect to lose money!
he hangs about in london but finds living there harder than coming home.
mrs goode phones mrs thompson who discovers that her husband was seeing another woman, one with a reputation, and she's near the edge.
now you persecute the rest of us for the sins of the father.
you knee us in the balls and send us on our way before we've had a chance to discover that you're the boring girl your father believed you to be.
when you said you thought it was your father, that was because you were frightened?
there wasn't anything in the breathing that reminded you of him?
if you can't bring yourself to ask, what do you expect me to say?
you'll be gone soon, suddenly awoken out of your temporary madness and i'll be left here.
what makes you think you've got the monopoly on wanting to ball suspects?
what do you mean, "he held her future in his hands"?
if he was fully clothed, the clothes would soak up the blood.
you're saying if he was nude, he couldn't have been stabbed?
second time, i thought every bloke deserves a burial, so i nipped back and opened it.
i reckoned it would be easier to find him with the door open.
i could tell you there's a brick wall in the cellar which i'm going to examine closely.
you'll probably despise the romantic in me, but i was hoping you'd tell me what he'd hidden because you trust me.
i bricked the revolting mess up behind a wall in the cellar.
diana checked when fred found that thing in the ice house.
some sod's bound to want to rip out the cellar and put in a jacuzzi!
at times it's been almost unbearable but when i look at the three of them, it was worth it.

i and the treasured sword are same, are doomed to fight for the emperor perishes for my country you already were qin empire's li imperial concubines protect you are my mission let li's imperial concubine frightened a moment ago
so long as has you in the side, my anything does not fear
that my swords, you come with me, here this are any place here is emperor sand martial arts place of origin already had three millenniums historical
my uncle, he is the 270th five dynasties teaches other people that is my uncle
but wants to be low you the head academic societies humble and honest
young people, i knew why you do come this are not an ordinary sword it is your 0
present, in your heart had answer you may the human sword gather 1 this are surely your previous generation fate masters, you thought the human really has previous generation
do previous generation why worlds, this life why live any is the illusion, any also is real
i always see in the dream ancient times generals with a princess
i did not know all these have any relational with me
i did not know in the dream is really or vacation
but yesterday, i in the coffin bottom saw that princess paints a portrait this were i first time has verified dreamland in the real life masters, i really very much confuse now
although dreamlands looked resembles mysterious disorderly actually can explain reality actually
on the one hand dreams come from, the human brain imagination innovates
don't why you dare to look at my end will not dare
again do not say this kind of speech, do not have to be deprived of this kind of feeling later i no longer will call you general hoodwinks resolute
do why we do utmost live down finally also only can make the destiny slave
which do we have to arrive one day, can obtain free arrives that day which dies
do not want to forget mission which you this time come you want to live for yours subjects so long as is living only then hopeful
you want to promise me, good good work since, you want me like this painfully to live good
is suitable this river to walk two day might arrive chinese frontier thanks you to help can again see your
i can certainly come back to look at you, but also has uncle takes care
i really floated we use the rmi from the spectroscope even uses each matter to attack its atomic
but makes us unbelievable is its atomic spectra unexpectedly do not conform to which we know
half any, you said this is meteorolite is not comes from the solar system pairs, now most importantly
actually found other meteorolites in where coffins bottoms that picture in my here
present penetrate the museum to return to give back to others very to be supposed
moreover , your this counter- gravity studies keys do not have in the meteorolite with these two cultural relics what to relate does not have in front of any conclusion in mine experiment each link all possibly is key
how can you make such carelessly judge my experiments are for benefit human antiques are the things from a former age, dying they will not have the life not future
but the science care will be exactly the future good, since such said, this different thing is before two millenniums death that you that care about do any swords are we use which the life trades my
good, if in other words later we found meteorolite you can send back equally meetings so long as is others cultural relic, we must certainly return to give back to others nobody may rob others from others country the cultural relic
suspends at oneself country museum said helps others the storage, actually wants to appropriate to oneself this are ignominious behavior
is you, ancient professor my already was not professor to be very many a year
ancient gentlemen these for years always are you are subsidizing me to study
i present my king. the jade rinse princess will come with us
all daring to prevent us, will summarily die princesses is already my honoured qin empire's li imperial concubine who dares to interfere, is my qin empire's enemy
last year our research funds were reduced by half not enough funding to complete our plans
i have sold the house and moved into the work room
i have come back specifically to help you solve your funds problem may i?
i want you to help me with a matter you are coming in clear william, i am dr. chen the arab league organisation
i am qi, i welcome you in joining our counter- gravity research counter- gravities?
these are my laboratories, come and look us over we have asked dr. smith to introduce you to us weclome doctors
science has defined that as rotation increases it may cause an event where the material weight reduces through our research, we hope to make such a conclusion
these are one of a kind, extremely expensive tests we do not have the means to make our investment practical as we may not be able to continue to use the existing biological matter in the experiment
more than 2,000 years ago, the frontier was a small country, south was an emperors lands where once an emperor after dying becomes an immortal
but his coffin containing his corpse floats in the air it was your article that gave me inspiration
50 years ago the mobile phone was a myth airplanes are myths, landing on the moon is huge myth if i had lived 50 years ago computers and the digital sciences and technology are not equally myth?
do you know has how many people are currently studying this science?
if you let me study it successfully, i can change humanity's history our future lives, in ground transportation airborne flights, even future space emmigration they all have very close relationships with this particular science and technology:
i know this treasure is very important in your work but nobody has entered this ancient tomb
it is you who have not been practicing basketball i have, just not from this angle then try to shoot from here forget the ball then you couldn't manage anyhow, come with me is that qi your girlfriend?
she isn't, she is my sponsor's representative have things been right with that hailin
it is floating record it floating in the air to get proof of its actions
jake, you must see there is also a hanging sword i have seen
i think the writing in the bottom of the coffin is a record of his biographical data ...goes abroad on a diplomatic mission the qin empire his princes led the bejeweled beautiful woman, to go to........ ?
qin huangrang chose a beautiful harem woman he selected as his imperial concubine, the woman qin huang most liked on qin huangshi's command he asked an artist to draw a picture of the imperial concubine and the qin empire day-star gem will deliver the painting
the imperial concubine does not smile, how can the old man paint the face
since the imperial concubine has entered the palace, i have not seen her to smile ever receives, general
don't be dreaming now it is bad, i have heard some people come in
get me up was bad of you call on them to help
jake it is too dangerous to hang around we need to leave promptly, get him in quickly
jake this is not good, we are hit, we must leave immediately
i and my treasured sword are the same, doomed to fight for the emperor
i die for my country you are qin empire's imperial concubine, protecting you is my mission
here is emperors martial arts origins it is three millenniums old
my uncle, he is the 270th fifth dynasties, he teaches other people that is my uncle
but if you lower your head the academic societies are humble and honest
young person, i know why you came this is not an ordinary sword it is yours?
this is why we live as is the illusion, as is the real
i always see in my dreams a general of ancient times with a princess
but yesterday i saw in the coffins bottom a portrait of the very same princess painted this was the first time my dreams were verified in the real world master, i am very much confused now
although the dreamworld resembles the mysterious and disorderly it can actually explain reality
on the one hand, dreams come from the human brains inventive imagination
on the one hand the source remembers itself in the real world therefore the dreamworld can only then be imaginary
if you return in your dreams repeatedly to this specific person
i am thinking there is a very real possibility your inner worlds tribal memory is releasing
why don't you dare look at me you must dare look now
do not talk like this, i cannot have these kinds of feeling from you now
do you lead me to walk, where all is not good?
so long as i am with you in the same place, i do not have to marry to qin emperor
jade rinse, imperial concubine imperial concubine, calm down do not forget my mission by which you are here now you have to live for your subjects so long as you are living, be hopeful
you want to promise me something, do good work since you want me so painfully to live good
this river will lead you in two days to arrive at the chinese frontier thank you for your help will i see you again?
i will certainly come back to see you and also your uncle take care
i am really floating we use the rmi from the spectroscope it even uses matter to attack its atomic weight
but what makes it so unbelievable is its atomic spectra unexpectedly does not conform to anything we know
we have actually found other metals in there the picture in that coffin bottom i'm here
i go to xi'an now, to look for it do not forget that picture good good, bye
warring states in qin dynasty time forging smelting technology moreover above its scale of shape and matter only then can we see into the qin dynasty's archaeological finds if you look at that, its shaping and its decorations it looks like it should be aqin dynasty series soldier, a senior general's saber
this may really be a national treasure take this and be careful
moreover, your counter- gravity studies have found keys in the meteorite that don't relate to these cultural relics in conclusion there is no link between the relic and your experiments every link is possibly a key
how can you possibly judge so carelessly my experiments will benefit the human race antiques are things from a former age, a dead age they will not benefit the living nor the future
but the sciences will be the future good, since as you said, this is a different thing it is from two millenniums ago you will not care about swords as such. which take life mine
good, if in other words later we find meteorites you can send them to us agreed so long as you hand in cultural relics as we must certainly return to give back to the owners nobody may rob from another country their cultural relics
you and jake are studying this emperor what difference does it make in who robs this particular grave?
i have been on many digs for treasure in my lifetime
continue to stay by jakes side follow him. aspire to him he can enable you to become this worlds greatest scientist is this not your lifes dream?
36 years before the politician, defender of the heart a star fell in the east of the country, the stone resides there engraved in stones are curses on qin huang's character
i said that to the prime minister anything more than that, i cannot say
i did not know that, you speak to the prime minister father emperors commands are confused, perhaps the matter will go disastrously wrong near the bodies of the dead, moral integrity is lost
but on its return it is besieged by the rebel army it is close, i plead you to let me bring it back
general to have heavy responsibility in escorting it back, leave immediately the military situation is urgent, the matter is not too late yet
general go fast to bring back the important medicine do not fail on your orders from the emperor wait, general!
the emperor will go on an inspection tour, bringing the army is not a simple task if the general is to lead the army to go get the potion then the opposing rebel army will challenge you with their machines
perhaps it is unable to say for certain if the the emperor will complete his part of the plan if this is the case you will end up only bringing the light cavalry to get at the potion
i cannot say the emperor needs me to look after him lets me try again, prime minister
general for many years we have had the honor to enjoy you we still share life and death in the present
nangongs yan pledge to fight to the death following our general
xu is important, you clearly do not want to disobey an order for the emperor's efficacious medicine from me i will only give the important medicines to the general not to any other person, important xu excuse our inability to comply
the prime minister is presenting the emperors superior instructions you dare to defy the emperor?
jake sorry, you were right when you said that those two cultural relics should have been returned to the rightful owners
i made this print up for you personally, i hope you like it
i hoped these may help to obtain you this waterfalls are in the far mountains probably 200 kilometers away
the soundings i am taking through the massive curtains of water display holes leading to a very large cavern it has rained hard for a year, our villagers have not managed to come out thanks
i do not know if the villager and i have any relations
but i feel his love such a sad speech, if you cannot decipher this dream this whole life cannot all be joyful
william, what i'm seeing resembles the artificial hole in the picture which you have drawn
i am going in to look, then i will contact you again
jake, thanks if not for you this secret would be lost again for a 1000 years cannot some people be able to know about it both i and the arab league outstanding said the dreamland is entirely alike my capabilities have not really explained all this with science
this world has many matters that science is unable to explain this grottos enclosed environment
keeps it seperated from the world outside, the air currents are unobstructed they build on a large scale in the mountain and actually draw through a hundred mile long passage to here from peru it arrives here to construct the underground imperial tomb
high up, where it can't be seen or heard. good method
that day, i give you the important medicine horse, you have been utterly loyal to me
today, i can kill the enemy shoulder to shoulder together with you is it really xu's illustrious life that is the largest honor?
jake, i has already told you it is human nature to be greedy reading past the corrupt human essence, the intellectual curiosity is humankinds power
i have only used william's greed along with your intellectual curiosity congratulations on your achievement, you have fulfilled my wishes
jake, i only wanted to take the ore back to do the research you knew this discovery can benefit our universe
i can become this century greatest scientist nobody may carry anything off from here everything here belongs to history we should forever bury it underground you can not have this
that just took a year off of my life, i think.
i'm gonna scare the pants off those kids, i tell you what!
first of all, in the eyes of the lord, you're a genius.
the devil fools you into thinking you're stupid... because it makes it easier for him to trick you.
luanne, just when i think you've said the stupidest thing ever, you keep talking.
junie says i'm smart, so don't try to trick me into thinking i'm not.
tomorrow night, i'm gonna teach bobby... the true meaning of halloween, come hell or high water.

a newly-revitalized united nations passed the global freedom and equality act soon after
ensuring every citizen of the world those same civil liberties and standards of living enjoyed by those of free western nations.
2011 was the year in which a unified body of world scientists discovered the x-vaccine, which wiped out every last form of disease from cancer on down to the common cold.
later that same year, global warming was reversed, the tropical rainforests were replenished, and the ozone layer was repaired.
he could not speak, yet he was able to tell me through much painstaking translation of his grunts and groans of how he came into possession of this golden disc.
he was a slave in north and his master was a wicked mutant who was in search of the source.
nobody had ever seen the source, but it said that he who found it found an oracle of eternal knowledge.
the mutant cut out his tongue, but the savage escaped in the night.
perhaps he could not fully grasp its power, but his killing prowess would prove useful,
i was certain, should i run into any more mutants or nomads.
you and your tribe move your camp and paraphernalia out of the way just long enough for my servant and i to pass through...
in return, i'll give you, absolutely free, this wonderful, magical, highly useful and practical egg beater.
i wanted to keep negotiating, but the savage would have none of it.
he slew them brutally, as is the way of his peoples.
at lunar labs, dr. theodore wegener developed what had become known as the pangaea project
a network of orbital satellites which used an array of powerful gravity beams to induce continental drift.
the ultimate goal... to bring the continents of earth together into one single supercontinent, called new pangaea.
creating a world without borders, and bringing the brotherhood of man together on one big happy landmass.
you know, you're not only very beautiful you're incredibly intelligent much like myself.
you know, i have people tell me that all the time
and all of the knowledge of the ancient world was standing before me in giant towers
books like mine for as far as the eye could see
i profit off the stupidity of the world, and you're damn lucky i'm not profiting off of you!
i was just trying to be nice, you didn't have to pull off my hair, you dickmo.
the further north we went, the more peculiar and dangerous the world got.
every day was a new test of will as if the ghosts of the ancients themselves were out to stop me
mankind had never experienced such death and destruction on so massive a scale.
the gravity beams from the satellites shredded coastlines, pushing continents much too far, much too fast.
mountains folded, titanic rifts in the crust opened up, and whole continents sank into the sea.
the world government instantly collapsed, and within hours, 45 nations launched full-scale nuclear strikes against each other.
on one single day, november 1, 2013, ten thousand years of human civilization was wiped from the face of the earth.
is this or is this not the place you escaped from?
and welcome to the way the world ended - the living video chronicle of the destruction of mankind... and of our planet earth in the efrly 21st century and within hours, 45 nations launched full-scale nuclear strikes against each other.
on one single day, november 1, 2013, ten thousand years of human civilization was wiped from the face of the earth.
i am public opinion, a symbolic personage, and what you might call a stickler.
the ancient chorus took it upon itself to explain to people what they' already understood, if they were intelligent.
but i'll be there all the time, ready to appear from the wings like a "deus ex machina".
the woman with a dream in her heart cannot sleep;, every day she rises with the sun.

but if you knew who i am and what infernal plans i'm hatching!

unworthy spouse, my wrath will pursue you in every possible way,

because if madame had rung, that would have been because she needed something.

i've been considering it for quite some time, and i feel that i've made an error in selecting surgery as my specialty.
for the most part, the training has been excellent but i just feel that ultimately i don't belong in surgery.

if you're asking will he be a doctor or a lawyer i can't say.

how about last year when we went skiing and i didn't break anything?
that's because you sat in the lodge the whole time, saying:
i always thought i was just an occasional worrier, you know, like... a guy comes up and says "hello," and i'm thinking:
"hey, is this guy gonna hit me?" that kind of thing.
you know, most people think an award and a promotion are good things.
i enjoy my work and i'm glad to be recognized for it.
hey, and i'm gonna pat myself on the back and feel good about it.
well, i must say, ray... this is a side of you that's not very attractive.
and i can see the good in a lot of things, okay?
how about last year when we went skiing and i didn't break anything?
nice answer, but it took a little too long getting there.
i could tell you threw out like 15 words before you got to "wife."
i enjoy my work and i'm glad to be recognized for it.

he told us the assassins were members of the olympic team.
so we bought a television at his request so we could identify the killers.
we spent two weeks watching him, monitoring his every move, noting every statement.
then, when it was all over, he admitted he simply wanted to watch the diving.
you provoked him, and if you use it against him i will fight you myself.
i should still go to the board, and let them know the appalling manner with which you treated him.
25 year old parker has been in psychiatric care ever since.
he was able to escape after murdering 2 doctors and wounding 3 wardens.
since then, 3 cars have been reported stolen and 3 other persons have been brutally murdered.
who has seen cliff parker or one of the stolen vehicles.
...yes, actually against all commandments of our lord and so we continue asking ourselves the question...
what goes on in a person when he takes the life of a brother or sister?
now we ask our father in prayer to give us bravery and strength.
holy father who art in heaven hollowed by thy name, thy kingdom come
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us.
take a look at the trees or the birds or the beetles.
god has created everything to take it back to him one day.
i accuse you jehova, in the name of my god lucifer, and pour the pain of my true father over you and the kin of your earthly followers.
so, all those who serve in the name of the self called false god will be released and be welcomed into my heavenly kingdom.
hey dork, switch the light on if you are hanging about anyway!
it's no use, he is to stupid to take a shit.
will it be easier if we decide what everyone will bring to the party?
those who have good music can obviously bring cds or tapes.
what does that have to do with the plot of the story, her being butt-ass naked ?
i don't know about the plot, but i got a stiff one.
don't forget about the martini mixer tonight at the delta lambda zetas.

the two windsor college students were murdered... last night during a sneak preview of the new movie stab.

sidney, i'd just like to say that i forgive and forget, and just like you, i'd like to get back on with my own life.
i'm afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
well, i play this young girl, sidney prescott, who discovers that her boyfriend is this crazy serial killer... who also killed her mother the year before that.
so what kind of research did you do for the part ?
i mean, with your given track record, why would you wanna be here when the killer strikes again ?
i mean, granted, i should've read your book before i took this job.
now shrouded in the deathly smoke of ruin, her royal children pitched from her walls, her people driven through her ruins.
and now alone in fate's cruel isolation... stands cassandra, her kingdom, family and friends... driven to the wind.
- no crime against gods or man... have i committed, saith to speak the truth.
and each hideous vision born from my mind... has come to pass.
if this is about money, it's not like we're not getting paid.
there's $10,000 each, not to mention what i've got going on the side with the 900 number.
so until you find me standing over a dead body with a knife in my hand,
i think you better treat me with the rights and privileges... accorded to every innocent citizen in this country.
i was in the right place but it must have been the wrong song
i was in the right vein but it seemed like the wrong arm
it's not wise to patronize a woman with a gun, sidney.
randy spoke poorly of billy, and i got a little knife happy.
when all at once i wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
before i go insane i hold my pillow to my head
i think i love you so what am i so afraid of
i'm afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
though it worries me to say that i never felt this way, yeah
but i think better still i'd better stay around and love you
do you think i have a case let me ask you to your face
afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
though it worries me to say that i never felt this way, yeah
i don't know what i'm up against, i don't know what it's all about
i be trying to shake it but it seem to be like right there
i know some homies who made deals for a short time to live good
what does that have to do with the plot of the story, her being butt-ass naked ?
i don't know about the plot, but i got a stiff one.

i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
though it worries me to say that i never felt this way, yeah
but i think better still i'd better stay around and love you
do you think i have a case let me ask you to your face
afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
though it worries me to say that i never felt this way, yeah
i don't know what i'm up against, i don't know what it's all about
i be trying to shake it but it seem to be like right there
i know some homies who made deals for a short time to live good
well, no, all i'm saying is that the horror genre is historical... for excluding the african-american element.
when the hell you get your ph.d. in black cinema, sister souljah?
you know, ron, uh, it's not an easy thing... to be accused of a crime you didn't commit, particularly one as heinous as murder.
but how do people treat you now that they know the truth about your innocence?
don't forget about that martini mixer tonight at the delta lambda zetas.
- i don't think i'm going to be able to make it, hal.
the two windsor college students were murdered... last night during a sneak preview of the new movie stab.
police haven't released any information except for the victims' names, but a press conference is scheduled for later today.
i went around to the back of the house and ran into sid there.
that's when she told me the killer was inside, so i went in to see.
i think it would probably be in your best interest to... stay as far away from me as possible.
i hope that was an off-the-cuff remark... that holds no subtext whatsoever.
you are concerned with my personal well-being and... not with trusting me or anything, right?
like i said, i just don't want to see you get hurt.
well, it just seems that if the killer is repeating what happened in woodsboro, it's quite possible that the killer could be from woodsboro, that's all.
derek, you think sid will let me interview her for my documentary?
well, i play this young girl, sidney prescott, who discovers that her boyfriend is this crazy serial killer... who also killed her mother the year before that.
so what kind of research did you do for the part?
all, behold the dreaded fate of troy... that once stood proud and light upon the hills of sparta!
now shrouded in the deathly smoke of ruin, her royal children pitched from her walls, her people driven through her ruins.
and now alone in fate's cruel isolation... stands cassandra, her kingdom, family and friends... driven to the wind.
no crime against gods or man... have i committed, save to speak the truth.
that was a very insightful programme... on which it was made abundantly clear that i'm an innocent man.
so until you find me standing over a dead body with a knife in my hand,
you see, this is just the beginning, a prelude to the trial.
that's where the real fun is 'cause these days it's all about the trial.
what does that have to do with the plot of the story, her being butt-ass naked ?
i don't know about the plot, but i got a stiff one.
don't forget about the martini mixer tonight at the delta lambda zetas.
- i don't think i'm going to be able to make it, hal.
the two windsor college students were murdered... last night during a sneak preview of the new movie stab.
police haven't released any information except for the victims' names, but a press conference is scheduled for later today.
tell us everything that's happened, looking back on the last two years.
sidney, i'd just like to say that i forgive and forget, and just like you, i'd like to get back on with my own life.
i'm afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for
i think i love you isn't that what life is made of
well, i play this young girl, sidney prescott, who discovers that her boyfriend is this crazy serial killer... who also killed her mother the year before that.
so what kind of research did you do for the part ?
i mean, with your given track record, why would you wanna be here when the killer strikes again ?
i mean, granted, i should've read your book before i took this job.
now shrouded in the deathly smoke of ruin, her royal children pitched from her walls, her people driven through her ruins.
and now alone in fate's cruel isolation... stands cassandra, her kingdom, family and friends... driven to the wind.
- no crime against gods or man... have i committed, saith to speak the truth.
and each hideous vision born from my mind... has come to pass.
if this is about money, it's not like we're not getting paid.
there's $10,000 each, not to mention what i've got going on the side with the 900 number.
so until you find me standing over a dead body with a knife in my hand,
i think you better treat me with the rights and privileges... accorded to every innocent citizen in this country.
i was in the right place but it must have been the wrong song
i was in the right vein but it seemed like the wrong arm
it's not wise to patronize a woman with a gun, sidney.
randy spoke poorly of billy, and i got a little knife happy.
when all at once i wake up from something that keeps knocking at my brain
before i go insane i hold my pillow to my head
i think i love you so what am i so afraid of
i'm afraid that i'm not sure of a love there is no cure for

well, i play this young girl, sidney prescott, who discovers that her boyfriend is this crazy serial killer... who also killed her mother the year before that.
sid, i think you need to just deal with that and move on.

unfortunately, there is a time and a place, and indeed, a price for everything, so feel free to call me.
i'm sleepin' and right in the middle of a good dream
when all at once i wake up from something that keeps
before i go insane i hold my pillow to my head
and spring up in my bed screaming out the words i dread

another time, ray had fucked mark's fiancée, causing them to split.
but the worst was when mark hit ray in the face with his shoe
if i were you, i'd just worry about someone seeing me in those pajamas.
did they come like that or did you have to cut out the feet?
but i'm a boy scout and one day i want to make eagle,

he said "i have not sent for you." "i do not want them here."
"my diamond has disappeared, neither you nor anyone else will find it. "
if there is an item of clothing in the house with a spot of paint, who owns and how that person
can you explain being in the room between midnight and three o'clock.
if the response is appropriate, you do not have to go far to find the hand holding the diamond.
seagrave agent, this trifle yours it has grown in importance since the investigation began.
i would like to know on the linen of the house.
if any items are missing, we presume is the stain that we seek.
i hope not think rosanna it has something to do with it.
i do not want to hurt his feelings, mr. betteredge, but rosanna is sly.
i suspect that in the morning after robbery noticed the stain on the door, discovered the stain on her nightgown,
he pretended to be sick and ran to town to buy cloth to make a new one.
we have a lot of this and that that the sea returns
he said the case would serve him to their collars and cuffs.
but ... if you give me the letter, i can send it.
rosanna asked me to give it to him in person, and that's what i'll do.
i declare that i have stolen my own diamond and i have committed to pay my debts.
mom, i must be crazy if i do not speak now.
i'm about to commit a "pious" fraud which even your high moral rectitude, miss clack, surely excuse.
any discomfort that may occur ... it's nothing compared to the importance to preserve a pure name.
then, sir, should not one consider the view of the famous sergeant cuff?
in his mind, there is no shadow suspicion about anyone except miss rachel verinder.
the agent had warned us stain on the door and penelope had seen the door without any stain.
i had my hands proof you had been in miss rachel's room, between midnight and three in the morning.
i decided to keep and see what i could use him.
bought cloth in the village, with the excuse to stay in bed, and sewed an identical nightgown i replaced it in his room.
the idea that you had fallen my level ... and i had the means to protect discovery gave me the opportunity to earn goodwill.
i tried to talk diamond to look at me, speak to me ... but he chose to ignore or we were interrupted.
i knew it would be safe as much as it was her nightgown.
and how to destroy the only right to your confidence and gratitude which i made me lucky to own.
if i lose the next opportunity to talk and if you sign cruel as always
say goodbye to the world that put me the joy that has been given to other stood before you, sir
what is proven is that you it was the one who used it.
and if rachel suspected only by evidence nightgown chances are that rosanna spearman was the person who showed it.
within weeks, the time commitment is complete if we believe the jewel it was committed.
it is the usual mode of payment a loan there is a chance that the person he insisted that the bailout.
and he said, "it is wrong doctor i slept well without it. "
and i say, "it took more a good rest, a dose of laudanum before going to sleep."
recreating, best, circumstances night that the stone was stolen the latent memories of their actions they may be activated.
we must do everything we can to place in the same mental state.
dr. candy invited mr. ablewhite in his joke at his expense.
i needed someone to prepare your drink and ablewhite was the obvious choice.
upon entering, you must have touched her nightgown fresh paint the door.
not only saw him ablewhite take the diamond but also saw miss verinder watching from your bed.
"i was recently in town seringapatam call, where there is a shrine the god of the moon.
they had a ceremony whose purpose was the purification three brahmins.
when the coast guard found it, it was floundering in the middle of lake michigan.
so they towed it in, and nobody knows how long it had been like that.
in any case, our superstition exhibit is excellent box office for this museum, and that benefits you, as well.
using superstition to bring people to the museum is like hiring topless ushers for the bolshoi ballet.
it would be a disaster for us if we had to postpone.
we're checking your offices and labs first so you people can go back, do your work.
i'm sorry you had to see all that at the crime scene.
i said hello to that man every day for the past six years.
it doesn't look like a good place to light a match.
according to museum security, you were the last one to leave last night.
do you have any idea what might have been in this office that someone would want so damn bad?
i have no idea why anyone would want anything of john whitney's.
there are an undetermined number of lacerations preceding from the left anterior pectoral region downward through the sternum, terminating at the right anterior abdominal region.
the pectoralis minor and pectoralis major are separated to a great degree.
listen, dig up whatever records we have on those bodies from the ship.
if there were any autopsies done, check and see if any part of the brain was missing from any of the heads.
-well, if you don't catch your man, there's going to be about 300 pounds of it.
yeah, but have you tried the lattes with the whole milk?
it's the consistent repetition of sequences of three that are unique to each individual.
but before you begin dna testing, you have to be able to identify the specimen.
she believes that science must destroy myth, and as a consequence, she has very little patience with superstitious people like us.
margo, did i ever tell you about my experiences with the khoe tribe in botswana land?
the khoe tribe, lieutenant, believed that headaches were caused by sorcery and the pin poke of the headache victim would identify the sorcerer, and then go off and murder him.
of course, the kinfolk of the sorcerer would feel they had to avenge his death, so they'd go and in turn kill the headache victim.
dr. frock argues that sometimes there are sudden evolutionary changes that create a grotesque and short-lived aberrant species.
okay, so, john whitney's down in brazil studying ancient tribal rituals.
this guy gets on a boat sailing from brazil, he kills everyone onboard, then he catches a cab to the museum, where he hides in the closet in the sub-basement.
i don't know anything about boats from brazil, but it's obvious to me that this man killed frederick ford.
so the thing is, vincent, this gala tonight is very important.
it's important to the museum, it's important to my wife, it's important to the city, and it's real important to mr. and mrs. blaisedale.
we know these hormones are responsible for growth, bone structure, exoskeletal physiology and skin maintenance.
a huge influx of these could easily cause it to change.
the hormones listed in this analysis of the leaf, they're all produced by the human hypothalamus.
of course, it's a much more concentrated form here, and one milligram of this material is equal to more than 1 00 milligrams of the hormone produced by the hypothalamus.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you very much for being here.
i'd like to introduce to you one of this museum's best friends and staunchest supporters, the mayor of our city, the honorable robert owen.
i am so excited and honored to be here at this wonderful museum this evening.
as we march forward with fragile footsteps into the sunset of the last few years...
but right now, i want you to shut your fucking mouth and listen.
i'm putting sergeant hollingsworth in charge, and you're going to do exactly what he tells you to do.
in those crates that whitney sent back, the artifact was packed in a leaf specimen that carried a parasitic fungus.
the fungus was loaded with hormones, animal hormones that are produced in the thalamoid region of the human brain.
some horrific beast, but the beast needed those hormones to stay alive.
so when it was big enough and deadly enough, they stopped feeding it.
then, this machine will amplify the dna strand, and, finally, scan the created gel image.
then it's matched against a huge database we've compiled over the last three years.
-i was on the beat my rookie year, and i saw this guy who'd locked his keys in his car with his motor running.
he's got a clothes hanger and he's trying to get the lock off.
where are those leaves with the hormones that thing likes to eat?
okay, we know this thing is part reptilian, probably ectothermic, so it can't handle extremes of hot and cold.
i'm gonna take them and tie them on that grate over there.
i think the draft will blow the smell down the tunnels.
when the coast guard found it, it was floundering in the middle of lake michigan.
so they towed it in, and nobody knows how long it had been like that.
could there be anything special that you'd like to tell me?
of course not. 'cause if there was, you would've just come out and told me.
no word from john yet, but these crates arrived this morning.
they were supposed to be on a ship except there was some mix-up in brazil, and they never made it.
i want to interview every employee whether they worked yesterday or not.
if they did work, i want the hours, what part of the building, if they saw the victim, what time and where.
exhibition areas only show about 2% of what the museum owns.
it doesn't look like a good place to light a match.
do you have any idea what might have been in this office that someone would want so damn bad?
i have no idea why anyone would want anything of john whitney's.

with all due respect, sir, you can fire me on monday.
but right now, i want you to shut your fucking mouth and listen.

okay, we know this thing is part reptilian, probably ectothermic, so it can't handle extremes of hot and cold.
now, whatever that was, something made it go the other way.
so stay close to me and i will get you out of here.
you haven't been keeping up with your studies, have you, little lady?
you'll know soon enough which one of us is the dummy here!
are you planning to get all of the dragon balls together so you can have yourself made taller?
or is it that you want to get those arched eyebrows of yours fixed?
the minus energy which was developed at that time gave rise to me!
you mean, you were born because i used the dragon balls back then!
it's all you can do now just to rise to your feet.
if the slightest strong wind came along, you'd fall right over backward, right?
however, the evil dragons that will be waiting for them from here on will surely not be as easy as this!
the minus energy of the dragon balls gave rise to evil dragons, who then took the dragon balls away from goku and the others.
the minus energy which was developed at that time gave rise to me!
you mean, you were born because i used the dragon balls back then!
it's all you can do now just to rise to your feet.
if the slightest strong wind came along, you'd fall right over backward, right?
first, you win, then you rob me of the opportunity to lose with dignity.
i think you lost that when you listened at the door.
your idea was to tell mel not to do it with a jewish accent.
no, my idea was to tell you not to do it with a jewish accent.
oh, by the way, i changed my mind about jon stewart.
i think he should sit as far away from larry as possible.
"name 3 things i'd rather do than go to larry's roast.
and p.s., tell hank that ed said to shut the fuck up."
the great thing about larry sanders is that he never exploited the fact that he was a homosexual.
he was gay, he was proud, but he didn't shove it down anybody's throat.
most of it hit you when he tripped over the microphone cord.
remind me to send him some flowers at the hospital tomorrow.
i remember he had me go around and tag all the sheep that kicked.
ok, anyway, i've been asked to inject some class into this evening.
but first, i'd like to thank the hotel for having us here.
you see, this thing was sort of like a last-minute thing, and, uh, and tom arnold's asshole was booked, so... oh, yes, the great carl reiner!
no, he's actually a favorite of larry's, but no one else's.
please welcome... and let's hope he can hear this introduction... norm crosby!
he knows, for example, the similarity between eggs benedict and oral sex.
you just... never seem to be able to get 'em at home.
you know, it's now time to pay tribute to a man who needs no introduction... and definitely not his own tv show, but as you can see, that's too fucking late... please welcome the man of the hour,
or as most women known him as the minute man... please welcome larry sanders.
society doesn't take the key with it while it goes to starbucks.
so i suppose the cage was the last straw for you?
because if you had, you would've enjoyed what thenew york times calls
"the most delicate white truffle pasta this city has to offer."
listen, i was in this relationship once where i started to lose myself.
but at first, i didn't care because of all the fantastic sex.
and i'm not budging from this spot until i get it.
you know, i had the strangest lunch today at that salvador's that keeps popping up on your expense report.
because if you had, you would've enjoyed what thenew york times calls
"the most delicate white truffle pasta this city has to offer."
he slips the robe off my shoulders and lowers me onto the bed.
he takes the candle and slowly, seductively, achingly... drips hot wax all over my naked body.
listen, i was in this relationship once where i started to lose myself.
but at first, i didn't care because of all the fantastic sex.
we're putting the spit-shine on our bar here to get money from the christmas crowd celebrating the birth of our saviour.
hopefully visiting us in our humble inn and knocking back a few brewskies.
all of us working for the common good, sharing our burdens, sharing our joy.
if we don't get some crowd in here tomorrow night, some drinkers drowning out their christmas blues, we won't have any floors to scrub.
i go in the back to make change and when i come out he's dead on the floor.

i don't know if i can fit it in my schedule.
no one has expressed an opinion as to how it will impact the pampered existence of nicholas van orton.
the one thing on which both democrats and republicans agree is that most americans harbor serious doubts about the economic future.
a recent poll suggests a staggering 57% of american workers believe there is a very real chance they will be unemployed within the next five to seven years.
but what does that matter to a bloated, millionaire fat cat like you?
stock markets rose both domestically and abroad after the announcement of stronger than expected earnings by several hi-tech companies, but dipped again after reports that nicholas van orton had sneezed.
are you gonna spend the rest of the evening prying at that clown's mouth?
now, do you really believe that just because you publish children's books, people will care about my reputation?
you can have pictures of me wearing nipple rings, fucking captain kangaroo, they only care about the stock!
what i remember most was that his manner was so slight.
you could spend time in a room and not know he'd been there the whole time.
would you like to have a coffee with me at the airport?
cover for me in case dorkface comes back around, will you?
the unexplained death of a postal worker... that somebody has apparently gone to great lengths to keep unexplained.
these photos were sent to me by a detective who thought i might have a fresh take on the case.
her oncologist was concerned about some microscopy results, that, uh, her tumor may be metastasizing.
anyway, l-i'd like you to take a look at those photos, please.
she suffered from a mild form of anemia characterized by folic acid deficiency.
the blood sample at the police forensics lab has a normal folate serum level.
the gun that killed detective thomas... ballistics has identified it as a sig sauer p-228.
i'm having ballistics run comps on all weapons... registered to federal agents and local officers.
if i told you there was a chance the bees that made that could be lethal, would that be helpful?
any kind of bee can be lethal, provided you get stung by enough of them.
but i think that somebody is trying to engineer a method of delivery... for a disease that has killed more people throughout history... than any other contagion known to humankind.
if you want me to suggest an appropriate response, i will.
i have a man in place... a man with no other choice but to succeed.
what assurance can you give us that he can be trusted?
if i lied to you... i have lied to you, and i won't make excuses for those lies.
but there's a reason i did what i did... one that i think you're in a unique position to understand.
these photos were sent to me by a detective who thought i might have a fresh take on the case.

i'm playing catch up here, and i'm already two steps behind.
the man who impersonated me at the forensics lab last night- apparently he replaced a blood sample.
the blood sample in the police forensics lab... is b-positive, as is the postal worker's.
she suffered from a mild form of anemia characterized by folic acid deficiency.
perhaps because you realized that you'd be admitting to the obstruction of justice, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence.
the consequences can be very serious for you, even in the unlikely event that you were able to persuade the authorities... that you didn't kill the detective.
if i told you there was a chance the bees that made that could be lethal, would that be helpful ?

both of us were tryin' to lose weight, so we could buy new bathing suits.
the men who came here-- they said if i talked to anyone, i'd lose my job.
- damaged packages are routed here for inspection, before they get reshipped.
the place where these damaged packages are kept-- how close is it to the restroom where you found jane ?
we went through every inch of that tape... to find the best angle for identification purposes.
now, remember, it was videotape shot at a distance under extreme low light.
we don't vaccinate kids against smallpox anymore because there is no smallpox.

you came to me for information, mr. skinner, but you still haven't told me what you know about this.
my office has to answer to the secretary general of the united nations.
but there's a reason i did what i did-- one that i think you're in a unique position to understand.
i advised you against a certain course of action some time ago... concerning agent scully.
how soon will you be able to determine if that's the weapon that killed detective thomas ?
as long as it takes me to put one of these slugs into a scope and run a comp.

the police said we could put the bathroom back in service.
but the truth is, no one wants to use it, not after what happened yesterday.
oh, it's hard to tell with just the comb, but i might be able to give you an answer.
if i told you there was a chance the bees that made that could be lethal, would that be helpful ?
any kind of bee can be lethal, provided you get stung by enough of them.
even africanized honey bees-- so-called killer bees-- basically have the same venom as the european honeybee.
- bee stingers and venom sacs... recovered subcutaneously from the victim 's face, arm and neck.
you're saying this man was stung by bees carrying smallpox ?
i have a man in place-- a man with no other choice but to succeed.
what assurance can you give us that he can be trusted ?
every child in this town who hasn't already been infected... needs to be vaccinated immediately.

he calls me names so hard and bad it hurts my heart more than it hurts my crack, and he don't stop there.

there's nothing quite like a couple of killers with a shotgun at your head... to make you pay attention.
anyway, this michael max, he looks to me like one of these guys that'd have his own murder catered... gentlemen, michael max is a very innovative guy.

he say change your name from six to four, you'll win the game, gain much more.
i'm talking about some new kind of sound... that's so phat, kinda cool in a suit like some old hep cat.
for me, when i close my eyes, i only hear one sound.
the sound of my brother ashe when he hit that ground.
well, see, i overheard this guy... before he killed my sister, and the last thing she said was, "how did you find me?"
and he says, "i've got eyes in the back of my head."
# we've ever made love to # # so when you take him down inside #
# just know i'm there with you # # and you may feel me crying #
and if it's all true, you're gonna have to trust someone.
you know, i hate it in movies when the guy running from the government... meets a well-intentioned, beautiful girl, gives her top-secret information.

i watched movies. they got me wondering what we'd do if we were ever attacked. we suddenly seemed so vulnerable to killer sharks, nuclear submarines, an alien invasion. the enemy could come from anywhere.
the land, the water, the sky, the chinese. [ beeping ] couldn't trust any of 'em anymore. yeah, brian.
how was your flight ? [ groans ] oshima called from tokyo.
she said the three million won't be in the account... till friday noon, our time. the studio said they are only releasing the video in june. you can sue them.
it's urgent. [ chiming continues ] [ conversation continues, indistinct ] [ sighs ]
seeds of violence got through the night shoot, but there was an accident with one of the stunts. [ helicopter overhead ]
- cat, the stuntwoman for daisy, got hurt in the explosion.
- how is she ? she cut her face and got banged up, but she's fine. [ helicopter continues ] did we get the shot ?
how's that view ? look, man, you know my shit is phat. it's hot, man.
so you gonna be usin' it or you gonna be losin' it ? go ahead and show me the dailies and you can put the song on over it. okay, one more thing.
i went into the movie business. [ machinery whirring ] turned what you could call a basic fear of strangers... into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. after all, paranoia is our number one export. everybody needs an enemy.
it's only now i've come to understand that there are no enemies or strangers-- just a strange world.
claire, call zoltan... and have 'em screen-test cat for the part of the sister. cat ?
she's a stuntwoman, not an actress. [ coughs ] schwarzenegger. [ chuckles ] everybody there ?
thanks for mentioning my name. it don't matter if i mention your stupid, inbred name. he's about to die.
now shoot him ! [ lowell ] you shoot him. you don't want that mercedes anymore ?
i don't wanna kill him. maybe there's some other way we can enter the 20th century driving a mercedes.
i am not going back to stealing ! maybe there's other stuff we could do. what other stuff ?
[ panting ] we could go into business, maybe. maybe-- maybe the entertainment business.
the what ? now i've fuckin' heard everything ! [ lowell ] shh !
a percentage. [ laughs ] it means percentage ! when was the last time somebody gave you percentage ?
shut up, lowell, or i will torture you. [ chuckles ] never is when. never did, never will.
he goes inside my crack, and he don't stop there. he keeps going, tearing everything apart while he makes them sweet lovin' sounds, and he don't stop there. he calls me names so hard and bad it hurts my heart more than it hurts my crack,
and he don't stop there. see, he's lookin' for my soul. everything they took from him he wanted back. he's starvin' for it, starving' so bad he'd kill me for it.
make him think he got it all. and i slip away inside my head and visit... the princess of beverly hills.
hair blond, eyes green, painting her fingernails like jellybeans, vanilla skin shimmering. she don't even notice when i slip inside her soul... like a ghost in a crystal palace.

see, she ain't never needed to know she needed a soul.
♪ don't even know she got one ♪ and i watch her-- i'm so close-- while her fingernails dry. and the princess, she don't feel a thing. she can't smell the burning knife that's splitting me in half.
one time, i think, she smiled at me, i think she saved my life. and now...
[ imitating crying ] it's over... and daddy start to cry.
we go walkin' and talkin' in macarthur park, and i forgive him sometimes. the princess of beverly hills--
jeez. yeah, they're, uh-- they were blown off. shotgun, three feet.
unhinged, clean at the cortex. that one, two feet max, between the cerebellum and the frontal lobe. yeah, what'd i say ?
the killer was the kidnap victim... who was brought here by these two now-headless kidnappers, a mr. lowell lewis and a mr. frank cray, and during an apparent altercation between the two of them, said victim, mr. michael max, the guy they carjacked in that mercedes there,
freed himself and blew both their heads off. wait a minute.
why people do what they do. and now, who cares ?
you just wanna find your man. no, i wanna find my woman, marry, settle down.
i wanna find my man first, i guess. unless my man turns out to be a woman. better than if your woman turns out to be a man, i suppose. you know, you have an interesting approach, doc.
we have barely spoken, and yet i feel i could be a murder suspect or a fiancee. [ chuckling ] ♪ [ male vocalist, indistinct ] sorry.

i think everything's connected. did you know that in nuclear physics, if you just look at a so-called particle, you change it ? imagine, just by looking at something you can actually change what it is.
sometimes you can even destroy it. it's like turning on the light to see the darkness.
[ mike narrating ] i didn't know where i was, but i knew i was alive.
there's nothing quite like a couple of killers with a shotgun at your head... to make you pay attention.
no, i don't know how to use it. that's the last thing i want.
then i'll come by to pick it up, okay ? don't push me.
i'm sorry. but sooner or later, you're gonna have to get your head out of the sand... and start dealing with this.
[ claire over speakerphone ] hang on, paige. [ sighs ] six just came up from the recording studio.
he wants to tell you something. [ six over speakerphone ] yo, madam max.
i'm supposed to tell you to hand over the computer... and cooperate with the powers that be, but you know that's not exactly my style.
- all right. the coroner said the recovered skull fragments... were in a state of critically infarcted bifurcation, meaning all the bone was thoroughly shattered, meaning the bullets could have been high-density, army-style splinter shot,
which can be fired from three feet or 3,000 feet with the same effect. see what i'm sayin' ? get outta here.
you play too many video games, kid. you think maybe low-flying f-16 fighters shot 'em, huh ? [ imitating plane engine ] like i said, only in hollywood. can't be coffee and danish.
has to be cappuccino or that thick, creamy stuff, that italian thing-- what is that ?
and he's gonna do it big, he's gonna do it right. that's exactly why somebody probably wanted him dead.
i'd say someone very professional, obviously... and very paranoid. [ technician ] i don't exactly understand what i just did for you. it's okay.
i'm just trying to debug a little number here. so, uh-- so, thanks. you're the wizard.
[ chuckles ] well, i guess i'd better head back to the shop. okay.
i always did, even when i made her suffer, on purpose, for long periods of time, and enjoyed it perversely.
"perversely." that's one thing i think i can define now. it's when things are upside-down and you start to like 'em that way.
violence is bigger than ever. you see, little baby white girls be piercing' every floppy piece of skin they got, creaming' to every flavor of gangsta. pretty soon records just gonna have the sound of gunshots on 'em.
everywhere you look, billboards got some movie star holding' some big-ass gun. let me tell you somethin', motherfucker. violence rules, man.
[ claire on computer ] mike, you'll probably never get this. the fbi's been all over everything. but if you're out there-- this is very strange. a guy called you.
he wanted to talk to you very urgently. he asked me whether you'd had a chance to read the file he sent you on e-mail. he sounded scared.
he didn't want to leave his name or number. he insisted that you would know how to reach him. apparently you met at the technology fair in florida last year. he said you liked each other.
i hope this means something to you, and i hope you're alive.
[ gunshots ] [ woman screams ] [ people shouting in spanish ]
[ vehicle engine starts ] [ engines revs, tires squeal ]
they're getting it all going. that, uh, maid working out okay ? [ coughs ] yeah, fine.
it's hard to get good help these days. your part should be done in a couple of months. then the operators will take over.
that will be good. just wanted to touch base, tell you we're all very happy with your work. country's grateful and all that.
if we can get this thing fully operational soon... it'll be an awesome tool. cut down on crime response time by 200 percent. accuracy, eyewitness evidence.
could mean the end of violence as we know it. that would be good. of course if there was just one little, tiny, infinitesimal leak... before congress approved it, we'd have to wipe the whole thing out.
everything down the drain. poof. oh, they'd crucify all of us.
that's messier. a system like this, there's the chance for abuse.
if you, uh, see anything that i miss-- any misuse, anything, uh, strange-- you'll let me know, right ?
he say that nasty groove is something to prove, that getting in your face can leave an angry taste, get you up in arms about the disgrace... and make you shake it all over the place. he say, that's been here, and now it's gone.
it's time for the wise to move on. he talking about some new kind of sound with a different view. we used a hammer.
a golf club would do. he say machine-gun lyrics just fire blanks. you're outta the trenches, put on those pink-checkered pants. he say don't matter what you say, it's what they see that win the day.
he say change your name from six to four, you'll win the game, gain much more.
i don't know, and i need it loud and proud, not 'cause i need to stick out the crowd, it's 'cause the sound of silence, see, it makes me cry. burns my ears and spits blood in my eye.
'cause it's not the echo of the shots still ringing in my head... or the line on page three saying some other black man dead. for me, when i close my eyes, i only hear one sound.
i think the link is in your head. have a nice day, detective doc.
boom is in the shot. look, claire, this is impossible. you cannot just waltz in here with anybody.
[ laughs ] a little silly. it's called "i'm a fluff ball."
"i'm a fluff ball, living my fluffy life in scarcity. the life i choose is an illusion.

so you gonna be usin' it or you gonna be losin' it ? go ahead and show me the dailies and you can put the song on over it. okay, one more thing.
someone dumped a 400-page file into your e-mail. some weird, secret fbi file with diagrams. an fbi file in my e-mail ? yeah, about some new surveillance system.
when i was a kid movies scared the shit out of me, so then when i grew up,
i went into the movie business. turned what you could call a basic fear of strangers... into a multimillion-dollar enterprise. after all, paranoia is our number one export. everybody needs an enemy. it's only now i've come to understand that there are no enemies or strangers--

i don't wanna kill him. maybe there's some other way we can enter the 20th century driving a mercedes.
i am not going back to stealing ! maybe there's other stuff we could do. what other stuff ?
hi, ray. didn't think i'd find you there so late. anyway, i'm finally sending you a cleaning lady-- mathilda. she'll start tomorrow.
she's from salvador. she passed security. speaks five words of english, badly. her family was wiped out by the death squads, except for her little daughter. they have you working late at nasa every night like this ?
he comes right in. after a hard day at whittier, he comes all the way inside that room, that bed, my pajamas. he comes all the way inside my room, and he don't stop there.
he goes inside my crack, and he don't stop there. he keeps going, tearing everything apart while he makes them sweet lovin' sounds, and he don't stop there. he calls me names so hard and bad it hurts my heart more than it hurts my crack,

see, she ain't never needed to know she needed a soul.

backed up to the pasadena freeway. montebello, a sig alert for the 60 eastbound at finley. the freeway's still closed because of an accident.
what is the point of you having a phone... if you don't answer it ?
you guys are a little cynical, aren't you ? okay, here's the spin. the gentleman in question, the apparent killer, was, in fact, originally the victim. you got that ?
the killer was the kidnap victim... who was brought here by these two now-headless kidnappers, a mr. lowell lewis and a mr. frank cray, and during an apparent altercation between the two of them, said victim, mr. michael max, the guy they carjacked in that mercedes there,
you just wanna find your man. no, i wanna find my woman, marry, settle down.
i wanna find my man first, i guess. unless my man turns out to be a woman. better than if your woman turns out to be a man, i suppose. you know, you have an interesting approach, doc.

mike's discovered a lot of people. he sees something in them no one else sees. he believes in them. his love is like a rocket-- it blasts you forward into your future, into your destiny.
but no matter who you are, sooner or later, you wake up in your shiny new rocket...
alone... and realize he's in the cockpit, and he has the keys.
the view is amazing. but somewhere in the back of your mind, you can hear the crash coming, somewhere, somehow, anytime.
can have an effect on reality, like, sort of... unintentional prayers ? definitely.
i think everything's connected. did you know that in nuclear physics, if you just look at a so-called particle, you change it ? imagine, just by looking at something you can actually change what it is.
take me. one of the main reasons i'm standing here is because of your husband's movies. now i'm here fighting crime, and he's a victim of it. we're connected, and we never even met.
god only knows the amount of subnuclear transference that goes on in a marriage. it's almost incalculable.
i didn't know where i was, but i knew i was alive.
there's nothing quite like a couple of killers with a shotgun at your head... to make you pay attention.
no, i don't know how to use it. that's the last thing i want.
then i'll come by to pick it up, okay ? don't push me.
i'm sorry. but sooner or later, you're gonna have to get your head out of the sand... and start dealing with this.
hang on, paige. six just came up from the recording studio.
i'm supposed to tell you to hand over the computer... and cooperate with the powers that be, but you know that's not exactly my style.
i say just take your own sweet time, madam max. it's a cold world out here, even in the sun.
- all right. the coroner said the recovered skull fragments... were in a state of critically infarcted bifurcation, meaning all the bone was thoroughly shattered, meaning the bullets could have been high-density, army-style splinter shot,
which can be fired from three feet or 3,000 feet with the same effect. see what i'm sayin' ? get outta here.
you play too many video games, kid. you think maybe low-flying f-16 fighters shot 'em, huh ?
like i said, only in hollywood. can't be coffee and danish. has to be cappuccino or that thick, creamy stuff, that italian thing-- what is that ?
- well, whatever. anyway, this michael max, he looks to me like one of these guys that'd have his own murder catered-- gentlemen, michael max is a very innovative guy. if he's gonna do something, he's gonna do it first,
and he's gonna do it big, he's gonna do it right. that's exactly why somebody probably wanted him dead.
i'm just trying to debug a little number here. so, uh-- so, thanks. you're the wizard.
well, i guess i'd better head back to the shop. okay.
violence is bigger than ever. you see, little baby white girls be piercing' every floppy piece of skin they got, creaming' to every flavor of gangsta. pretty soon records just gonna have the sound of gunshots on 'em.
everywhere you look, billboards got some movie star holding' some big-ass gun. let me tell you somethin', motherfucker. violence rules, man.
the thing about sudden attack is... you never know where it's coming from. but it's usually not from where you expect it, unless you expect it from everywhere, which makes you paranoid.
mike, you'll probably never get this. the fbi's been all over everything. but if you're out there-- this is very strange. a guy called you.
he wanted to talk to you very urgently. he asked me whether you'd had a chance to read the file he sent you on e-mail. he sounded scared.
he didn't want to leave his name or number. he insisted that you would know how to reach him. apparently you met at the technology fair in florida last year. he said you liked each other.
that will be good. just wanted to touch base, tell you we're all very happy with your work. country's grateful and all that.
if we can get this thing fully operational soon... it'll be an awesome tool. cut down on crime response time by 200 percent. accuracy, eyewitness evidence.
could mean the end of violence as we know it. that would be good. of course if there was just one little, tiny, infinitesimal leak... before congress approved it, we'd have to wipe the whole thing out.
everything down the drain. poof. oh, they'd crucify all of us.
that's messier. a system like this, there's the chance for abuse.
if you, uh, see anything that i miss-- any misuse, anything, uh, strange-- you'll let me know, right ?
i don't know. this here is called "when i close my eyes." okay.
i'm gonna try and lay it down for you... like the black man and not the gangster man do, because you ladies like to watch your figure.
♪ somebody tell me just the other day, like a... voice from heaven while i'm riding down the freeway. he say that gangster sound is dead and gone.
he say that nasty groove is something to prove, that getting in your face can leave an angry taste, get you up in arms about the disgrace... and make you shake it all over the place. he say, that's been here, and now it's gone.
it's time for the wise to move on. he talking about some new kind of sound with a different view. we used a hammer.
a golf club would do. he say machine-gun lyrics just fire blanks. you're outta the trenches, put on those pink-checkered pants. he say don't matter what you say, it's what they see that win the day.
he say change your name from six to four, you'll win the game, gain much more.
i'm talking about some new kind of sound... that's so phat, kinda cool in a suit like some old hep cat.
'cause it's not the echo of the shots still ringing in my head... or the line on page three saying some other black man dead. for me, when i close my eyes, i only hear one sound.
♪ the sound of my brother ashe when he hit that ground.
i sure admire the way you guys have jumped back in the saddle here. some people'd be in hawaii under protection. police protection gives me the shivers.
i know what you mean. in the movies, it always turns out that there's a leak on the force, or the guard just went for a piss when the killer comes.
he's a missing person. you're the only one who's trying to figure out the big, hidden story. if there is a connection between the movie and mike's case,
i think the link is in your head. have a nice day, detective doc.
well, see, i overheard this guy... before he killed my sister, and the last thing she said was, "how did you find me ?" and he says, "i've got eyes in the back of my head."
now, that guy, he works here. so i decide to come pay him a little visit.
show me yours, i'll show you mine. listen, baby, i got a better-- forget it. my way or no way.
what is this ? the ultimate good news/bad news situation ? see ya.
- witty. okay, all right, whatever you want. good, i'll have a cream soda.
i'll have a cream soda. doesn't a sweet thing like you worry about getting hurt ? there's a lot of bad boys out there. mm-hmm.
no, it's okay. don't worry, i won't sue. well, i gotta say, you know how to tell a story.
it must all seem completely bizarre to you. just a little.
and if it's all true, you're gonna have to trust someone. you know, i hate it in movies when the guy running from the government... meets a well-intentioned, beautiful girl, gives her top-secret information.
that character, she always dies. look, just because some real fbi guy believes in movies so much... doesn't mean you have to. he doesn't know any better.
you should. in case you haven't noticed, i'm not exactly the stupid actress... who stands at the edge of the cliff screaming for help. no. you're the stupid stuntwoman who jumps off the cliff.

truth is, there's usually some kind of personal motive. some hook in the gut.
is that what's going on with you, doc ? what's going on with me is that you're trying to infect me... with your good old-fashioned cynicism, so i doubt myself and decide... that we're really not trying to cover up some...
covert, totally illegal, murderous operation. listen, you just watch your step. excuse me.
rare but beautiful. okay, i am here as a human being. welcome.
cat's told me all about you. the doc's here on a social call, blanche.
i realized after, uh-- after they tried to close the case... and stop me from digging, even on my own time, that, uh...
this instinct i had about you-- that you had some valuable information, some key to the whole puzzle and that i had to see you-- was... based on nothing except that...
hey, flashback. remember, we have an agreement. you are on a special visa, or you can fly your camel ass outta here.
okay ? he's a missing person, and this is a double murder case. that's just the tip of the iceberg.

you can´t keep anton depeux down... because anton depeux is going to be just fine!
but i didn´t think it mattered... because i was... sure that i would grow to love her.
i thought if i could just love her, then... it would be all right.
i don't know why, but... they faint at the slightest thing.
if they hear a loud noise or a gun goes off... they black out, fall right over, one after the other.
the baby maggots have crawled up and started to grow... and eventually they're going to eat the dog alive... from the inside out.
he says it should be put to sleep... because it's an old dog, anyway.
so i let go with my hands... and i fell off the top of the junglegym face-first... and i broke this tooth right in half.
i'm laying on my back, blood all over my face... the kids are yelling, the teachers are freaking out... and i look up, and there she is.
she's just looking down at me... with this worried little smile on her face.
i swear to god, when i saw her, the pain just went away.
once i took pictures of a bunch of ducklings... who imprinted on a gardener in the park.
they thought he was mama... and they used to chase him around all day... while he drove around on his lawn mower.
and now perfume... from squirt guns from rich new york kids.
what do you think the odds are... of something like that happening to one person?
i just couldn't take it if you were lying to me.
sweetie, why would i have sex with a hamburger... when i can make love to a steak?
it's one thing not to call your mother for ages... but to hide from me for two months.
you better be found lying dead in the gutter... if you know what's good for you.
that last night at the restaurant... everyone is running around, even me... but i notice you in your little room.
you were not looking out... you were not staring stupidly like the rest.
i only slept with her to help the loan for my restaurant.
it's not like i cheated, you know... and it was only once with this woman.
i have a nice little modeling job waiting for me... with a nice little agency... and after i get my money, i'm going to go down... and wipe it in their disgusting credit card faces!
you can't keep anton depeux down... because anton depeux is going to be just fine!
they are going to break up... and i'm going to be right here for her.
tonight this will all be over... so you might as well start packing your bags.
except for her boning my boyfriend... you guys are the perfect couple.
listen, catwoman, at the end of the day... she is coming back to me, and we're going to be happy.
i met an old man, and he said... only prepare it for the woman you love.
later i found out he made it for a party he catered.
it started to get weak and sickly so he took it to the vet.
the doctor examines it and says... a maggot must've laid eggs in the dog's butt.
he starts to reach up into the dog... picking out the maggots with his fingers, one by one.
it takes him all night, but he gets every last one.
he's going to make her feel... like she's the only woman in the world.
when he looks at her, it'll be just like a kid...
i'm laying on my back, blood all over my face... the kids are yelling, the teachers are freaking out... and i look up, and there she is.
she's just looking down at me... with this worried little smile on her face.
i swear to god, when i saw her, the pain just went away.
once i took pictures of a bunch of ducklings... who imprinted on a gardener in the park.
i would sit out on the curb with you all day... and sell pencils.
then when it got dark, we would crawl... into our cozy refrigerator box and make love all night... and then sell pencils again at sun-up.
he starts crying and begging her to forgive him... and she says a certain four-letter word... more than a couple of times and storms out.
i didn't know you were so interested... in this kind of thing.
i still got some work to do... and, no offense, but i really miss my privacy.
i thought we could just take a minute to say good-bye.
it's not like i cheated, you know... and it was only once with this woman.
and i hardly came at all... just a fraction of what i'm capable.
help me find my other shoe... because if i find my other shoe, i will be just fine.
i have a nice little modeling job waiting for me... with a nice little agency... and after i get my money, i'm going to go down... and wipe it in their disgusting credit card faces!
it's none of your business anymore what i do or why.
you were there watching me because you care about me... because you have feelings for me.
but i didn't think it mattered... because i was... sure that i would grow to love her.
i thought if i could just love her, then... it would be all right.
you simply turn the crank and three pieces of twine become one piece of rope.
in the time before television, families would sit around the rope machine and watch knots landing.
now, how does this compare with the one in your mom's house?
you see, the way these work is the hog comes up and it rubs against the rollers like so.
honey, this is the most powerful cleaning agent approved for use during peacetime.
would you have bought that if it had been a man?
if i get this job, not only will i get to work with dr. matthews, but my name will be on a research paper.
[siren wailing] i hate to tell you, but your name is also gonna be on a speeding ticket.
to the untrained ear, this is gonna sound ridiculous, but it sounded like you were begging a michigan state trooper to give you a speeding ticket.
i wasn't begging. i was just asking for what is rightfully mine.
well, jill, unfortunately, everybody, at some time or another, is susceptible to the wiles of the opposite sex.
well, i come from the old school of feminism. i don't want to be wily.
unfortunately, in many societies, women are at a disadvantage, so that subconsciously, or consciously, they flirt in order to level the playing field.
in other words, you guys own the stadium, and we're the pom-pom girls.
um, i'm jill taylor. i have an appointment with dr. matthews.
oh, he's just finishing with the other candidate. it shouldn't be long.
but, um, the truth is i object to women who flaunt their sexuality to get something.
i know because i have been one of those women at least three times this week.
- lf l get this job, i want it to be based on merit and not on this.
what makes you so sure i'm not gonna base this on merit?
i feel as though i've come to the warmth of my mother's lap.
today my lndia may have something to offer, or not, but she has one thing in abundance, and that is love.
the scent of this dust from india is out of this world.
for 35 years you've been living in the u.s., but you haven't changed.
it set the waters on fire... such were the notes of the raag deepak
a confluence of the seven notes... it's the essence of life
but he definitely knows the hearts and the thoughts of his indian parents, and he respects them.
i'm asking your daughter's hand because we n.r.i.s need girls like her very badly.
because we've pushed our kids so deeply in english books and manners
that somewhere or the other, even after seeing so much success we feel as though we're failures.
and seeing all this today, girls like ganga are our only source of hope.
that's why i've decided that by making her my son's wife i'll take her from this house, to that house.
my father was a musician, and my mother, a school teacher.
i was just living a life of an orphan, when kishorilal who was like a brother to my mother, came into my life.
just think that this is my life's most important and beautiful dream.
which only you can fulfill for rajiv is your friend, and...
so then... that is... you are chosen by daddy for rajiv?
yes, when uncle saw me, he said he won't find such lovely ganga in the whole of india!
every relation in this house is bound with bond of love.
whether it's with an animal, or between a servant and his master.
in the house of a benevolent man like kishorilal half are indian, and half are westerners.
that's why, a pure soul like you will always be shown resentment.
the would-be daughter-in-law of kishorilal, miss kusum ganga is india's goddess of knowledge, a symbol of our culture.
i'll now request her to come here and sing some songs for us.
we'd all like to know how you feel after coming abroad.
the land where my beloved dwells... is where my heart is
and you want me to hang on some wall quietly and become a part of this synthetic decor!
had i come with this dream to this foreign land, arjun?
but girls from india especially those from rural areas, they can't bear this cultural shock.
if you want to change her, then go slow about it.
let the friend stay a friend, and the wife, a wife.
and it'll be better if you don't interfere in our personal matters.
heart is a lover not some thief, what am i to do
i have no control over my heart, what am i to do
heart is a lover not some thief, what am i to do
i have no control over my heart, what am i to do
it is not a weak thread, what am i to do
i have no control over my heart, what am i to do
it is not a weak thread, what am i to do
i have no control over my heart, what am i to do
i have now donned love, i have wrapped love around my head
i have thrown away the ring of false traditions in an alley
i have broken all the chains of modesty, i have escaped all confinement
on every step even if i stumble, i will keep on walking with my eyes downcast
in front of me is my lovers home, the world got left behind
come i will make a prayer, may i get back my separated friend
it wasnt to happen, it wasnt to happen, but it happened
i have fallen in love.... my beloved, my beloved my beloved, my beloved, my beloved...
you lied that an indian girl can be a wife to a foreigner like him.
and to turn this lie into truth, you made me lie too.
i ask you, what kind of a culture is this where a would-be husband, behaves like this with his fiancee?
even then, if you ask me to throw myself in this fire then i'll do it, papa.
i feel as though i've come to the warmth of my mother's lap.

this welcome is of that ganga who has come here for the 1st time.
the would-be daughter-in-law of kishorilal, miss kusum ganga is india's goddess of knowledge, a symbol of our culture.
taking me to be some innocent photo, you've trapped me in a golden frame.
and you want me to hang on some wall quietly and become a part of this synthetic decor!
this world is a bride, and the jewel on the bride's forehead
this world is a bride, and the jewel on the bride's forehead is this india of mine.
verdana}{s:14}{c:$ffffff}you didn't tell rajiv, that when you sent me those parathas... {f:

we've grown up in this dust... so how can we stop it from coming in?
the scent of this dust from india is out of this world.

you, thodin of the ostral b pair you are hereby given an award of merit

the divine predecessors have suffered casualties but they are now safe
and why are those who are disloyal to my rule still alive?
we turn the lexx around and blow the cluster into little tiny shadow bits right now.
ok propeller head let's find a course back to the cluster
a cat last week gave birth to a litter of snakes.
a family was swimming in whisper lake when the lake suddenly began to boil.
the last time the master tried to rise was the harvest.
he sent a bunch of vampires to get him fresh blood.
"a family was swimming in whisper lake when the lake began to boil."
and "mercy hospital last night, a boy was born with his eyes facing inward."
if you could show up tomorrow morning, i'd be really grateful.
i mean, i'd talk to you at the dance and everything.
so this master guy tried to open the hellmouth, but he got stuck in it.
now all the signs are reading that he's gonna get out, which opens the hellmouth, which brings the demons, which ends the world.

buffy herself has thwarted them time and time again, but this is the codex.
there is nothing in it that does not come to pass.
"the calf and the lion and the fatling together with a little child to lead them."
it's kind of warm and fuzzy for a message of doom.

as of next week, i will be a resident of the montana.
niles, why would you even want to live in such a stodgy building?
the best part is i'll never have to give my address again.
from now on, i'll simply be dr niles crane, the montana.
i noticed that she'd left her suede jacket in my car.
i called to offer to swing it by, and she said, and i quote, "just keep it."
it just proves how essential it is to make a good first impression when you move into a new building.
which is why i'm throwing a dinner party friday night for a few select residents.
no, no, as long as no one rings the doorbell, i'm fine.
well, you know, niles, you seem to be relaxing a bit.
i don't think my reputation can suffer any more than it already has.
i wouldn't be so sure about that, wearing a white bird after labour day.

i noticed that she'd left her suede jacket in my car.
i called to offer to swing it by, and she said, and i quote, "just keep it."
and in my experience, the minute you stop looking, the perfect person falls right in your lap.
well, roz, as much as i appreciate you comparing me to a dead squirrel in a heating duct,
it just proves how essential it is to make a good first impression when you move into a new building.

still, in oz, you get decent food, exercise, regular check ups.
and if you don't get whacked you live longer than you would in your own hood.
and less stress will help slow down the aging process which will help save on medical costs.
plus, the older guys are not a security problem, so you can save money on the officers.
so many little pieces, so many things that could break down, and add on to that the wear and tear we give our bodies, what with the drugs and drinking and chicken fried steak.
man, that any of us are still standing, still breathing, it's a miracle.
unfortunately, oz is just not equipped for long term custodial care and there isn't anywhere else to send him.
you're telling me the state doesn't have anyplace to take care of its old prisoners?
when i was growing up, both my father and my grandfather came to oz.
you know, when i was little i always wondered what was so great about prison that they'd wanna leave us to come here.
dr. nathan's not sure how long your grandfather has to live.
look, since your father's an orderly in the hospital and is going to spend the remaining time with your grandfather, there's no reason you can't do the same thing.
i'd like a few years at the end of my life to be free.
do we care for people when they're sick because we actually care about them?
adebisi, you make your peace with this any way you can.
i say o'reily's gonna run the kitchen as good as dino ever did.
they're great for when you're taking a shit or before you go to sleep.
while i'm sleeping i actually dream about going to these places.
he was born to slave parents but he worked his way up and through iowa state college, becoming a botanist and an agricultural chemist.
now, he discovered hundreds of uses for the peanut, the sweet potato, and the soybean.
god does not need you to defend him from a moron.
what god needs you to do is to rein in your basic instincts.
what god needs you to do is be a little patient, brother.
the more of these little skirmishes you get involved in, is the more you weaken the holy war we're about to fight.
so many little pieces, so many things that could break down.
and add on to that the wear and tear we give our bodies, what with the drugs and drinking and chicken-fried steak.
if there's any doubts about that, spend ten minutes with my mother-in-law.
leo, a 31 -year-old inmate costs $21,000 a year to maintain.
since i figured out that the money we're gonna waste taking care of ricardo alvarez could be put to much better use.
besides, ricardo doesn't know where he is or even why he's here.
when i was growing up, both my father and my grandfather came to oz.
you know, when i was little, i always wondered what was so great about prison that they'd wanna leave us and come here.
look, since your father's an orderly in the prison hospital and is gonna spend time with your grandfather, there's no reason you can't do the same thing.
maybe if you take care of him, you'll learn to care for him.
i'd like a few years at the end of my life to be free.
do we care for people when they're sick because we actually care about them?
well, now we have to get him back to when he was in charge.
we have to remind him that there's another victim involved here, the little girl he killed.
hey, adebisi, you make your peace with this any way you can.
i say o'reily's gonna run the kitchen as good as dino ever did.
they're great for when you're taking a shit or wanking before you go to sleep.
while i'm sleeping, i actually dream about going to these places.
he was born to slave parents but he worked his way up and through iowa state college, becoming a botanist and an agricultural chemist.
now, he discovered hundreds of uses for the peanut, the sweet potato, and the soybean.
i keep bugging over the reasons for this shit, i yearn
years in this piece got me wanting the shit that i unlearned
what god needs you to do is to rein in your basic instincts.
what god needs you to do is just to be a little patient, brother.
if on the grass my mother put me, my mother put me,
i would have picked a basketful of it, a basketful of it...
we worked on the barn like donkeys, but never used it as a barn.
and just when we finished it, we had our land taken away from us.
we wanted to take out the coffin but couldn't turn in the corridor.
so i opened the window and we took him out through there.
you, my dear, do not put on any make-up at any rate.
if you want to show your beauty, do not hide your wrinkles, do not take shame in your natural ugliness.
one day we were to rake off fallen leaves round the mansion.
with my friend we hid ourselves in a pile of leaves.
when i find mother, i'll tell her that you are fine.
tell mother, that i don't cry out in my sleep anymore.
all of them here booze only that stinking juniper brandy and stuff themselves with potatoes.
then their dull-witted heads go dizzy and humming and they even take pride in it!
why do we have to part when it is our destiny to reach happiness only together...
darling, can you hear the sound of a love song which tells us what's coming...
when you catch a glimpse of the rabbit, you take a rock and keep smashing your knee with it until it bleeds.
the rabbit will stop and look at your bleeding knee, as if hypnotised.
then you come to him slowly and catch him by his ears.
i smashed my knees quite a few times, but never caught anything.
all is as it should, finally i grew an arse where my head used to be.
a hare hangs upside down, one who has all does not frown.
i'm in debt and they have already kicked me out of the school.
those who wish to support their favourite song should move for the switches to turn the lights off.

take something in your palm so that i can't see it.
through this piece of glass i'll see what you are holding.
the rabbit will stop and look at your bleeding knee, as if hypnotised.
then you come to him slowly and catch him by his ears.
i smashed my knees quite a few times, but never caught anything.
and when my father died, i had to see to everything.
no, i mean you and al should see a marriage counsellor.
well, if i'm so difficult to put up with why don't you just leave?
she wouldn't want me talking about her in front of another woman.
she's the fiery type, wiggles when she walks can't get enough of me in bed.
no, i mean you and al should see a marriage counsellor.

once we rode out of the sun bringing death at the point of a sword.
there was no man and no immortal who could stand before us.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
once we rode out of the sun bringing death at the point of a sword.
there was no man and no immortal who could stand before us.
and for 2,000 years i have dreamed of the day when we would ride again.
like you always said, methos, we live, we grow stronger, and then we fight.
she escaped across the wilderness, and she must have died a dozen times before she found a village that would take her in.
and i bet it was worth it just to get away from us.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
they did what a lot of people thought was the impossible.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
and while i still had plans to shine the blazing light of justice into every dark corner, what i really needed right now was a job, and badly, because there are too many lawyers in memphis.
well, rudy, you draw $1,000 a month, and you get to keep 1/3 of all the fees that you generate.
now, if you can't cover your draw at the end of each month, you owe me the balance.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided with a little bit of careful estate planning.
you see... in law school, rudy, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big fat ethics books.
are you gonna tell them where all this stuff came from?
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.
kelly riker was admitted to st. peter's hospital 3 days ago, at midnight, i might add, with assorted injuries.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
which was, by the way, a severe beating with an aluminum baseball bat.
she did indeed inherit a couple of million bucks from her late second husband.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments, and the irs totally devoured the estate.
in my first year at law school, everybody loved everybody else because we were all studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
there are police reports, there are ambulance reports, there are hospital records.
how long are you gonna wait, kelly, until he decides to hit you in the head with that bat of his?
kelly, i'll try to help you any way i can, but you have to file for divorce.
do it now while you're in the hospital being treated for the last beating.
mr. stone filed this on my behalf until i passed the bar.
well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve walking into my courtroom without a license.
i would be honored to introduce mr. baylor to the practice of law in the great state of tennessee.
judge, you can give him the oath right now, and i'll be pleased to stand for him.
he's an just an old angry man who's been sitting on that bench too long.
the best thing we can do is grab what we can to make things easy on his parents.
i can't help thinking that while we're all out there scrambling around for an edge like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
furnishings, bar dues, 750 for a fax machine, 400 for a lease on a computer, a down payment on a new secondhand car, and we're broke again.
i'm looking at a team of lawyers who are pulling down a $1,000 an hour, and i hate them.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
now i hate them for who they represent and what they represent.
i think i can smell her perfume all the way to cleveland.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
now, rudy, don't be intimidated by all these boys on this side of the table.
i guarantee, you get them on the golf course, they fold like a cheap suit.
i served the papers on cliff when he was on his way to lunch.
he didn't take it too well, but i said i was ready to rumble.
in which the insurance company has in plain english wording said that it will not pay for experimental procedures.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
but he is a licensed, experienced, capable physician who lovingly told you time and time again what you quite understandably did not want to accept:
that your son was going to die of leukemia despite the best efforts of medical science.
they say when you commit a murder, you make at least 25 mistakes, and later you're lucky if you remember 5 of 'em.
it was self-defense, but i can't get past the fact that he's dead.
underwriting sends a memo back to claims saying, "don't pay this until you hear from us. "
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had 2 choices-
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i hate great benefit and most of the worms that work there.
did you feel mr. lufkin was a worm when you were sleeping with him?
in fact, you were very angry at great benefit and mr. lufkin, weren't you?
you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
and that $10,000, that was just a piece of blackmail, wasn't it?
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, according to these head notes, this case will overrule your objection.
well, sometimes we get some frivolous and fraudulent claims in our business, and sometimes we have to use this kind of language to focus in on the legitimate and more needy claims.
mr. keeley, do you honestly expect this court to believe that explanation?
ladies and gentlemen of the jury... when i think of donny ray black... gasping for his last breath of air and slowly dying...
i am disgusted with myself... and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.
i'm asking you, the jury... just... do what you think is right in your hearts.
"we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of $150,000."
"and we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award punitive damages in the amount of $50 million. "
"mr. wilfred keeley, ceo of great benefit, was detained yesterday afternoon at jfk just after boarding a flight bound for heathrow.
traveling with his wife, they claimed to be sneaking away for a quick holiday.
at 5 p. m. today, insurance company great benefit filed for protection under the bankruptcy code in federal court in cleveland.
many states are now investigating great benefit, and a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and she's gonna need a lot of cover for a while.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
they did what a lot of people thought was the impossible.
now, some of my classmates, they knew they were going straight from school into the top law firms, thanks mostly to their family connections.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
well, rudy, you draw $1,000 a month, and you get to keep 1/3 of all the fees that you generate.
now, if you can't cover your draw at the end of each month, you owe me the balance.
it basically says that y'all hire us to be your attorneys, and we take care of the case for you.
we handle any expenses that we might have, and then we get 1/3 of any recovery.
now, buddy, you gotta sign this paper so donny ray can get that operation he needs, and i don't want no trouble out of you.
i'll take that damn bottle and throw it across union street.
i had trouble sleeping last night 'cause i was worried about your estate.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
there are gonna be people coming at you from every direction offering you settlements.
i do not want you under any circumstances to sign anything without me reviewing it first.
hey, rudy, look, you want to study, why don't you run over to the hospital and study with deck?
i'm not gonna study with-- l'm not gonna study with deck.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
she did indeed inherit a couple of million bucks from her late second husband.

in my first year at law school, everybody loved everybody else because we were all studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
well, i just passed the bar, and, uh, these are my clients.
mr. stone filed this on my behalf until i passed the bar.
well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve walking into my courtroom without a license.
now get the hell out of here, get your license, and then you come back.
i would be honored to introduce mr. baylor to the practice of law in the great state of tennessee.
judge, you can give him the oath right now, and i'll be pleased to stand for him.
rudy... i'm a very expensive lawyer from a very expensive firm, and, uh... i've had a lot of cases.
i can hit pretty close to the center of the dart board, and i told my clients, great benefit, that cost alone here gonna be a big deal.
but maybe i could lean on leo to make you an offer of a settlement.
they'll probably want to throw some money at you to keep from paying leo a thousand bucks a minute.
he's an just an old angry man who's been sitting on that bench too long.
the best thing we can do is grab what we can to make things easy on his parents.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.

around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
in a society filled with brilliant doctors and state-of-the-art technology, it's obscene to let this boy just wither away and die.
he was covered by an insurance policy that his mother paid good money for.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
isn't it a fact, mrs. black, that there are only 7,000 bone marrow transplants performed a year in the united states?
and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm simply asking that this witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612 of the tennessee rules of evidence.
but he is a licensed, experienced, capable physician who lovingly told you time and time again what you quite understandably did not want to accept:
that your son was going to die of leukemia despite the best efforts of medical science.

did you feel mr. lufkin was a worm when you were sleeping with him?
even though in your mind, you never intended to keep that promise.
in fact, you were very angry at great benefit and mr. lufkin, weren't you?
you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
your honor, i move that all documents provided the plaintiff by miss jackie lemancyzk be deemed stolen work papers and struck from these proceedings.
based on the evidence presently before the court, these documents are inadmissible.
number 585, southwest second, page 431, argued by bruiser-- by j. lyman stone.
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, sometimes we get some frivolous and fraudulent claims in our business, and sometimes we have to use this kind of language to focus in on the legitimate and more needy claims.
mr. keeley, do you honestly expect this court to believe that explanation?
ladies and gentlemen of the jury... when i think of donny ray black... gasping for his last breath of air and slowly dying...
i am disgusted with myself... and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.
i'm asking you, the jury... just... do what you think is right in your hearts.
"mr. wilfred keeley, ceo of great benefit, was detained yesterday afternoon at jfk just after boarding a flight bound for heathrow.
traveling with his wife, they claimed to be sneaking away for a quick holiday.
at 5 p.m. today, insurance company great benefit filed for protection under the bankruptcy code in federal court in cleveland.
many states are now investigating great benefit, and a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and she's gonna need a lot of cover for a while.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
and then one morning, i'd wake up and find that i'd become leo drummond.
so you might think i became a lawyer just to piss him off, but you'd be wrong.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
and so i went to law school, and it did piss my father off, but he was pissed off anyway.
in my first year, he got drunk one day and fell of a ladder manufactured by the company he worked for, and he didn't know who to sue first.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
and while i still had plans to shine the blazing light of justice into every dark corner, what i really needed right now was a job, and badly, because there are too many lawyers in memphis.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided with a little bit of careful estate planning.
you see... in law school, rudy, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big fat ethics books.
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.
like i'm 10 years old, my father crying in the bedroom, my mother sitting at the kitchen table with blood all over her face telling me that daddy's sorry, and he's never gonna do it again.
kelly riker was admitted to st. peter's hospital 3 days ago, at midnight, i might add, with assorted injuries.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
which was, by the way, a severe beating with an aluminum baseball bat.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments, and the irs totally devoured the estate.
all except for about $40,000, which miss birdie probably tucked in her mattress for all we know.
i went to austin peay and then law school at memphis state.
i always wanted to go to college, but it didn't work out.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
people stole exams, hid research materials from the library, and lied to the professors.
there are police reports, there are ambulance reports, there are hospital records.
how long are you gonna wait, kelly, until he decides to hit you in the head with that bat of his?
kelly, i'll try to help you any way i can, but you have to file for divorce.
do it now while you're in the hospital being treated for the last beating.
mr. stone filed this on my behalf until i passed the bar.
well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve walking into my courtroom without a license.
i can't help thinking that while we're all out there scrambling around for an edge like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
well, your honor, uh... this issue's already been ruled upon by judge hale.
uh, the preparations required for fast-tracking the case place an undue burden on both parties,
now deck wants to do an ad on the local rap station.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
i represent great benefit, and i'm very sorry... i'm very sorry to be here under these circumstances.
well, we wouldn't be here if your clients had done what they should've done.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
and they'll wake up fresh and rested and ready for war.
now, rudy, don't be intimidated by all these boys on this side of the table.
i guarantee, you get them on the golf course, they fold like a cheap suit.
i served the papers on cliff when he was on his way to lunch.
he didn't take it too well, but i said i was ready to rumble.
in which the insurance company has in plain english wording said that it will not pay for experimental procedures.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
it was self-defense, but i can't get past the fact that he's dead.
and the mistakes are piling up in my mind so fast
underwriting sends a memo back to claims saying, "don't pay this until you hear from us."
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
i was fired so the company could claim that i no longer worked there.
can you please point out the man in the courtroom who made you write this letter?
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
and i had to make that decision right there in his presence.
i am suffering from alcoholism and depression, and i voluntarily checked into a facility.
i was supposed to be covered by my group policy at great benefit, and they, of course, are denying my claim.
in fact, you were very angry at great benefit and mr. lufkin, weren't you?
you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
and that $10,000, that was just a piece of blackmail, wasn't it?
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, according to these head notes, this case will overrule your objection.
does the figure of 11,400 sound correct to you, give or take a few?
that's about right, but i'd have to verify it, of course.
i am disgusted with myself... and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself as a lawyer to make my own summation.
i was in the hospital being treated when the doctors realized that the only thing that could save my life would be a bone-marrow transplant.
so, i got released from the hospital, 'cause my family couldn't afford to pay the bill for what they had recommended.
i hope that you are astonished... as i am, at the lengths to which a wealthy insurance company, like the defendant, will go to take money from a low-income family and then keep it by denying a legitimate claim.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.
i'm asking you, the jury... just... do what you think is right in your hearts.
if you don't punish great benefit... you could be their next victim.

however, they could not produce the name of a hotel anywhere in europe..."
every lawyer in america is talking about me right now, but that doesn't exactly make me feel like a member of the legal community.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and then one morning, i'd wake up and find that i'd become leo drummond.
now, you give me a call when you pass the bar exam.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
they did what a lot of people thought was the impossible.
now, some of my classmates, they knew they were going straight from school into the top law firms, thanks mostly to their family connections.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
well, rudy, you draw $1,000 a month, and you get to keep 1/3 of all the fees that you generate.
now, if you can't cover your draw at the end of each month, you owe me the balance.
it basically says that y'all hire us to be your attorneys, and we take care of the case for you.
we handle any expenses that we might have, and then we get 1/3 of any recovery.
now, buddy, you gotta sign this paper so donny ray can get that operation he needs, and i don't want no trouble out of you.
i'll take that damn bottle and throw it across union street.
i had trouble sleeping last night 'cause i was worried about your estate.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
there are gonna be people coming at you from every direction offering you settlements.
i do not want you under any circumstances to sign anything without me reviewing it first.
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.

i would be honored to introduce mr. baylor to the practice of law in the great state of tennessee.
judge, you can give him the oath right now, and i'll be pleased to stand for him.
but maybe i could lean on leo to make you an offer of a settlement.
they'll probably want to throw some money at you to keep from paying leo a thousand bucks a minute.

and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
furnishings, bar dues, 750 for a fax machine, 400 for a lease on a computer, a down payment on a new secondhand car, and we're broke again.
i'm looking at a team of lawyers who are pulling down a $1,000 an hour, and i hate them.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
now i hate them for who they represent and what they represent.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
and they'll wake up fresh and rested and ready for war.
now, rudy, don't be intimidated by all these boys on this side of the table.
i guarantee, you get them on the golf course, they fold like a cheap suit.
in a society filled with brilliant doctors and state-of-the-art technology, it's obscene to let this boy just wither away and die.
he was covered by an insurance policy that his mother paid good money for.
in which the insurance company has in plain english wording said that it will not pay for experimental procedures.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm simply asking that this witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612 of the tennessee rules of evidence.
it was self-defense, but i can't get past the fact that he's dead.
and the mistakes are piling up in my mind so fast
underwriting sends a memo back to claims saying, "don't pay this until you hear from us."
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had 2 choices...
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i hate great benefit and most of the worms that work there.
did you feel mr. lufkin was a worm when you were sleeping with him?
even though in your mind, you never intended to keep that promise.
in fact, you were very angry at great benefit and mr. lufkin, weren't you?
you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
your honor, i move that all documents provided the plaintiff by miss jackie lemancyzk be deemed stolen work papers and struck from these proceedings.
based on the evidence presently before the court, these documents are inadmissible.
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, according to these head notes, this case will overrule your objection.
well, sometimes we get some frivolous and fraudulent claims in our business, and sometimes we have to use this kind of language to focus in on the legitimate and more needy claims.
mr. keeley, do you honestly expect this court to believe that explanation?
does the figure of 11,400 sound correct to you, give or take a few?
that's about right, but i'd have to verify it, of course.
and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself as a lawyer to make my own summation.
i was in the hospital being treated when the doctors realized that the only thing that could save my life would be a bone-marrow transplant.
so, i got released from the hospital, 'cause my family couldn't afford to pay the bill for what they had recommended.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and she's gonna need a lot of cover for a while.
every client i ever have will expect this... the same magic, nothing less.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
they did what a lot of people thought was the impossible.
now, some of my classmates, they knew they were going straight from school into the top law firms, thanks mostly to their family connections.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
well, rudy, you draw $1,000 a month, and you get to keep 1/3 of all the fees that you generate.
now, if you can't cover your draw at the end of each month, you owe me the balance.
it basically says that y'all hire us to be your attorneys, and we take care of the case for you.
we handle any expenses that we might have, and then we get 1/3 of any recovery.
now, buddy, you gotta sign this paper so donny ray can get that operation he needs, and i don't want no trouble out of you.
i'll take that damn bottle and throw it across union street.
i had trouble sleeping last night 'cause i was worried about your estate.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
there are gonna be people coming at you from every direction offering you settlements.
i do not want you under any circumstances to sign anything without me reviewing it first.
hey, rudy, look, you want to study, why don't you run over to the hospital and study with deck?
i'm not gonna study with-- l'm not gonna study with deck.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
she did indeed inherit a couple of million bucks from her late second husband.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments, and the irs totally devoured the estate.
in my first year at law school, everybody loved everybody else because we were all studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
well, i just passed the bar, and, uh, these are my clients.
mr. stone filed this on my behalf until i passed the bar.
well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve walking into my courtroom without a license.
now get the hell out of here, get your license, and then you come back.
i would be honored to introduce mr. baylor to the practice of law in the great state of tennessee.
judge, you can give him the oath right now, and i'll be pleased to stand for him.
rudy... i'm a very expensive lawyer from a very expensive firm, and, uh... i've had a lot of cases.
i can hit pretty close to the center of the dart board, and i told my clients, great benefit, that cost alone here gonna be a big deal.
but maybe i could lean on leo to make you an offer of a settlement.
they'll probably want to throw some money at you to keep from paying leo a thousand bucks a minute.
he's an just an old angry man who's been sitting on that bench too long.
the best thing we can do is grab what we can to make things easy on his parents.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
furnishings, bar dues, 750 for a fax machine, 400 for a lease on a computer, a down payment on a new secondhand car, and we're broke again.
i'm looking at a team of lawyers who are pulling down a $1,000 an hour, and i hate them.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
now i hate them for who they represent and what they represent.
i think i can smell her perfume all the way to cleveland.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
in a society filled with brilliant doctors and state-of-the-art technology, it's obscene to let this boy just wither away and die.
he was covered by an insurance policy that his mother paid good money for.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
isn't it a fact, mrs. black, that there are only 7,000 bone marrow transplants performed a year in the united states?
and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm simply asking that this witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612 of the tennessee rules of evidence.
but he is a licensed, experienced, capable physician who lovingly told you time and time again what you quite understandably did not want to accept:
that your son was going to die of leukemia despite the best efforts of medical science.
they say when you commit a murder, you make at least 25 mistakes, and later you're lucky if you remember 5 of 'em.
it was self-defense, but i can't get past the fact that he's dead.
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
nor do they know what the other department is up to.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had 2 choices--
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.

your honor, i move that all documents provided the plaintiff by miss jackie lemancyzk be deemed stolen work papers and struck from these proceedings.
based on the evidence presently before the court, these documents are inadmissible.
number 585, southwest second, page 431, argued by bruiser-- by j. lyman stone.
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, sometimes we get some frivolous and fraudulent claims in our business, and sometimes we have to use this kind of language to focus in on the legitimate and more needy claims.
mr. keeley, do you honestly expect this court to believe that explanation?
ladies and gentlemen of the jury... when i think of donny ray black... gasping for his last breath of air and slowly dying...
i am disgusted with myself... and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.
i'm asking you, the jury... just... do what you think is right in your hearts.
"mr. wilfred keeley, ceo of great benefit, was detained yesterday afternoon at jfk just after boarding a flight bound for heathrow.
traveling with his wife, they claimed to be sneaking away for a quick holiday.
at 5 p.m. today, insurance company great benefit filed for protection under the bankruptcy code in federal court in cleveland.
many states are now investigating great benefit, and a number of class-action lawsuits have been filed.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and she's gonna need a lot of cover for a while.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
and then one morning, i'd wake up and find that i'd become leo drummond.
it pissed my dad off, but he was pissed off anyway.
in my first year, he got drunk and fell off a ladder made by his own company.
some of my classmates knew they'd be going from school to top law firms, thanks mostly to family connections.
my only connections were made in the bars i worked in to pay my tuition.
it says you hire us to represent you, and we take care of the case for you.
we handle any expenses and get one third of any recovery.
in law school, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big, fat ethics books.
colleen janice birdsong's late second husband left her a couple million.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments and the irs devoured the estate, except for $40,000, which ms birdie probably tucked in her mattress.
pass your test booklets to your right so we may gather them up.
in my first year of law school, everybody loved everybody else.
we were studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
they've authorised me to offer you and your clients $50,000 to settle this thing out.
i may even be able to raise that figure up to... 75,000.
while we're all out there scrambling, like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
i think i can smell her perfume all the way to cleveland.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in first class, and after dinner, they'll discuss my destruction.
when i check in to motel six, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
you say your son would have survived if he'd had a bone marrow transplant.
only 7,000 bone marrow transplants are performed a year in the u.s.
a letter from the blacks' physician to mr drummond is inadmissible.
that's correct, and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
the handler sends the file to underwriting, who sends a memo to claims saying, "don't pay until you hear from us."
all these people work for this company, but they don't know each other.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had two choices:
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write the letter and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i hate great benefit and most of the worms that work there.
was mr lufkin a worm when you were sleeping with him?
and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself to make my own summation.
if i had had a bone marrow transplant, i'd have had a 90% chance of survival.
i hope that you are astonished, as i am, that a wealthy company would take money from a low-income family, and then keep it, while denying a legitimate claim.
we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of $150,000.
and we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award punitive damages in the amount of $50 million.
'wilfred keeley, ceo of great benefit, was detained yesterday at jfk, just after boarding a flight bound for heathrow."
"he claimed he was sneaking away for a holiday, but couldn't name a hotel..."
every lawyer in america was talking about me, but it doesn't make me feel like a member of the legal community.
i might be able to go on practising law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
every client i ever have will expect the same magic, nothing less.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
so you might think i became a lawyer just to piss him off, but you'd be wrong.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
and so i went to law school, and it did piss my father off, but he was pissed off anyway.
in my first year, he got drunk one day and fell of a ladder manufactured by the company he worked for, and he didn't know who to sue first.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
and while i still had plans to shine the blazing light of justice into every dark corner, what i really needed right now was a job, and badly, because there are too many lawyers in memphis.
well, rudy, you draw $1,000 a month, and you get to keep 1/3 of all the fees that you generate.

now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided with a little bit of careful estate planning.
you see... in law school, rudy, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big fat ethics books.
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.
like i'm 10 years old, my father crying in the bedroom, my mother sitting at the kitchen table with blood all over her face telling me that daddy's sorry, and he's never gonna do it again.
kelly riker was admitted to st. peter's hospital 3 days ago, at midnight, i might add, with assorted injuries.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
which was, by the way, a severe beating with an aluminum baseball bat.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments, and the irs totally devoured the estate.
all except for about $40,000, which miss birdie probably tucked in her mattress for all we know.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.

i can't help thinking that while we're all out there scrambling around for an edge like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
well, your honor, uh... this issue's already been ruled upon by judge hale.
uh, the preparations required for fast-tracking the case place an undue burden on both parties,
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.

i'm simply asking that this witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612 of the tennessee rules of evidence.

when i think of donny ray black... gasping for his last breath of air and slowly dying...
i am disgusted with myself and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i hope that you are astonished as i am, at the lengths to which a wealthy insurance company, like the defendant, will go to take money from a low-income family and then keep it by denying a legitimate claim.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.

i don't want neither one of you going through my stuff.
i come to see mama and she's got a stinking lawyer living with her.
i hope so, because i might have you handle some of that argument, rudy.
it would be awfully embarrassing if we lose this case on a dismissal.
i read all the books on jurisprudence, the rules of evidence and discovery.
but a look around the courtroom, and i know i haven't even been born yet.
i'm from a very expensive firm and i've handled a lot of cases.
i told my clients at great benefit that costs alone here are going to be a big deal.

that's correct, and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
anyway, the handler reviews it and immediately sends a letter denying the claim.
the handler sends the file to underwriting, who sends a memo to claims saying, "don't pay until you hear from us."
i was fired so they could claim i no longer worked there.
would you point out the man who made you write this letter?
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write the letter and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i had to make that decision right there, in his presence.
i move that all documents provided by ms lemanczyk be deemed stolen work papers and struck from these proceedings.
based on the evidence presently before the court these documents are inadmissible.
the plaintiff would like to call wilfred keeley to the stand.
do you swear your testimony will be the truth, and nothing but the truth?
when i think of donny ray black gasping for his last breath of air, slowly dying i am disgusted with myself.
and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i was being treated when they realised that the only thing that could save me would be a bone marrow transplant.
so i got released from hospital, because my family couldn't afford what they had recommended.
i hope that you are astonished, as i am, that a wealthy company would take money from a low-income family, and then keep it, while denying a legitimate claim.
it's no wonder they spend so much on their lawyers and pr machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to end punitive damages.
these people were trying to hide things, and they got caught at it.
the lead attorney on the case, rudy baylor, was trying his first case.
i'm gonna go to donny ray's grave and tell him all about it.
i guess kelly and i will be taking off first thing in the morning.
in fact, i'm so hot, there's no place for me to go but down.
every client i ever have will expect the same magic, nothing less.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
and then i'd wake up one morning and find that i'd become leo drummond.
it pissed my dad off, but he was pissed off anyway.
in my first year, he got drunk and fell off a ladder made by his own company.
some of my classmates knew they'd be going from school to top law firms, thanks mostly to family connections.
my only connections were made in the bars i worked in to pay my tuition.
it says you hire us to represent you, and we take care of the case for you.
we handle any expenses and get one third of any recovery.
in law school, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big, fat ethics books.
colleen janice birdsong's late second husband left her a couple million.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments and the irs devoured the estate, except for $40,000, which ms birdie probably tucked in her mattress.
pass your test booklets to your right so we may gather them up.
in my first year of law school, everybody loved everybody else.
we were studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
they've authorised me to offer you and your clients $50,000 to settle this thing out.
i may even be able to raise that figure up to... 75,000.
while we're all out there scrambling, like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on thejustice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
i think i can smell her perfume all the way to cleveland.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in first class, and after dinner, they'll discuss my destruction.
when i check in to motel six, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
the insurance company says it will not pay for experimental procedures.
you say your son would have survived if he'd had a bone marrow transplant.
that's correct, and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm only asking the witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612.
i'm going to give you a little latitude, but don't stray too far.
does that letter refresh your recollection as to whether donny ray's leukaemia could be helped by a transplant?
he told you what you, quite understandably, didn't want to accept.
that he'd die of leukaemia despite the best efforts of medical science.
the handler sends the file to underwriting, who sends a memo to claims saying, "don't pay until you hear from us."
all these people work for this company, but they don't know each other.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had two choices:
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write the letter and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i hate great benefit and most of the worms that work there.
was mr lufkin a worm when you were sleeping with him?
and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself to make my own summation.
if i had had a bone marrow transplant, i'd have had a 90% chance of survival.
i hope that you are astonished, as i am, that a wealthy company would take money from a low-income family, and then keep it, while denying a legitimate claim.
we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award actual damages in the amount of $150,000.
and we, the jury, find for the plaintiff and award punitive damages in the amount of $50 million.
"wilfred keeley, ceo of great benefit, was detained yesterday at jfk, just after boarding a flight bound for heathrow."
"he claimed he was sneaking away for a holiday, but couldn't name a hotel..."
every lawyer in america was talking about me, but it doesn't make me feel like a member of the legal community.
i might be able to go on practising law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
every client i ever have will expect the same magic, nothing less.
and i could probably give it to them, if it didn't matter how i did it.
you might think i became a lawyer to piss him off, but you'd be wrong.
i'd wanted to be a lawyer since i read about civil rights lawyers of the 60's, and the amazing uses they found for the law.
my only connections were made in the bars i worked in to pay my tuition.
i still had plans to shine the light of justice into every dark corner, but i needed a job, badly.
if you're not careful, the government is gonna get a big chunk of this.
a lot of these taxes can be avoided with careful estate planning.
kelly riker was admitted three days ago, at midnight, i might add, with assorted injuries.
the cops found her on the sofa, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
i went to austin peay, then to law school at memphis state.
i always wanted to go to college, but it didn't work out.
in my first year of law school, everybody loved everybody else.
we were studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
people stole exams, hid research from the library and lied to the professors.
i don't want neither one of you going through my stuff.
i come to see mama and she's got a stinking lawyer living with her.
i hope so, because i might have you handle some of that argument, rudy.
it would be awfully embarrassing if we lose this case on a dismissal.
i read all the books on jurisprudence, the rules of evidence and discovery.
but a look around the courtroom, and i know i haven't even been born yet.
i'm from a very expensive firm and i've handled a lot of cases.
i told my clients at great benefit that costs alone here are going to be a big deal.
deck wants to do an ad on the local rap station, but we can't afford it.
furnishings, bar dues, 750 for a fax, 400 for a lease on the computer, down-payment on a car, and we're broke again.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in first class, and after dinner, they'll discuss my destruction.
my congratulations, mr lufkin on your survival of the carnage of late here at great benefit.
i may not be 100% today, but i'm here in spirit.
in a society filled with brilliant doctors and state-of-the-art technology, it's obscene to let this boy wither away and die.
he had an insurance policy that his mother paid good money for.
let's say, to put numbers on the board, that the claim was covered...
my client should have paid out somewhere around 150,000 - 175,000.
the insurance company says it will not pay for experimental procedures.
you say your son would have survived if he'd had a bone marrow transplant.
that's correct, and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm only asking the witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612.

so you might think i became a lawyer just to piss him off, but you'd be wrong.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.
and so i went to law school, and it did piss my father off, but he was pissed off anyway.
in my first year, he got drunk one day and fell of a ladder manufactured by the company he worked for, and he didn't know who to sue first.
now, some of my classmates, they knew they were going straight from school into the top law firms, thanks mostly to their family connections.
now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
i had trouble sleeping last night 'cause i was worried about your estate.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
there are gonna be people coming at you from every direction offering you settlements.
i do not want you under any circumstances to sign anything without me reviewing it first.
in law school, rudy, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big fat ethics books.
are you gonna tell them where all this stuff came from?
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.
kelly riker was admitted to st. peter's hospital 3 days ago, at midnight, i might add, with assorted injuries.
the cops found her lying on the sofa in the den, beat to hell, wrapped in a blanket, naked.
cliff riker, her spouse, was obviously intoxicated, highly agitated, and initially wanted to dish out to the cops what he was giving his wife.
which was, by the way, a severe beating with an aluminum baseball bat.
she did indeed inherit a couple of million bucks from her late second husband.
but lawyers, bad trust department investments, and the irs totally devoured the estate.
please pass your test booklets to your right so that your proctors may gather them up.
in my first year at law school, everybody loved everybody else because we were all studying the law, and the law was a noble thing.
by my third year, you were lucky if you weren't murdered in your sleep.
people stole exams, hid research materials from the library, and lied to the professors.
there are police reports, there are ambulance reports, there are hospital records.
how long are you gonna wait, kelly, until he decides to hit you in the head with that bat of his?
kelly, i'll try to help you any way i can, but you have to file for divorce.
do it now while you're in the hospital being treated for the last beating.
well, i just passed the bar, and, uh, these are my clients.
mr. stone filed this on my behalf until i passed the bar.
well, you got a hell of a lot of nerve walking into my courtroom without a license.
now get the hell out of here, get your license, and then you come back.
to offer you and your clients... $50,000 to settle this thing out.
and i--i may even be able to raise that figure up as high as, uh, maybe 75,000.
he's an just an old angry man who's been sitting on that bench too long.
the best thing we can do is grab what we can to make things easy on his parents.
i can't help thinking that while we're all out there scrambling around for an edge like we're never gonna die, this boy's looking right at it, and he's doing it almost alone.
i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
now deck wants to do an ad on the local rap station.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
and they'll wake up fresh and rested and ready for war.
i served the papers on cliff when he was on his way to lunch.
he didn't take it too well, but i said i was ready to rumble.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.
isn't it a fact, mrs. black, that there are only 7,000 bone marrow transplants performed a year in the united states?
and i'm not asking for this letter to be admitted into evidence.
i'm simply asking that this witness be allowed to read the letter under rule 612 of the tennessee rules of evidence.
it was self-defense, but i can't get past the fact that he's dead.
and the mistakes are piling up in my mind so fast
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
nor do they know what the other department is up to.
he told me i was leaving immediately, and i had 2 choices--
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
i am suffering from alcoholism and depression, and i voluntarily checked into a facility.
i was supposed to be covered by my group policy at great benefit, and they, of course, are denying my claim.
even though in your mind, you never intended to keep that promise.
in fact, you were very angry at great benefit and mr. lufkin, weren't you?
you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
your honor, i move that all documents provided the plaintiff by miss jackie lemancyzk be deemed stolen work papers and struck from these proceedings.
based on the evidence presently before the court, these documents are inadmissible.
number 585, southwest second, page 431, argued by bruiser-- by j. lyman stone.
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, sometimes we get some frivolous and fraudulent claims in our business, and sometimes we have to use this kind of language to focus in on the legitimate and more needy claims.
mr. keeley, do you honestly expect this court to believe that explanation?
and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself as a lawyer to make my own summation.
i was in the hospital being treated when the doctors realized that the only thing that could save my life would be a bone-marrow transplant.
so, i got released from the hospital, 'cause my family couldn't afford to pay the bill for what they had recommended.
every lawyer in america is talking about me right now, but that doesn't exactly make me feel like a member of the legal community.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
i'm gonna go to donny ray's grave tomorrow and tell him all about it.
so, i guess kelly and i will be taking off first thing in the morning.
so you might think i became a lawyer just to piss him off, but you'd be wrong.
i've wanted to be a lawyer ever since i read about the civil rights lawyers in the fifties and sixties and the amazing uses they found for the law.

now, the only connections i had were made in the places where i tended bar for 3 years so i could pay my tuition.
and while i still had plans to shine the blazing light of justice into every dark corner, what i really needed right now was a job, and badly, because there are too many lawyers in memphis.
now, if you're not careful, miss birdie, the government is just gonna get a big chunk of this.
now, a lot of these taxes can be avoided with a little bit of careful estate planning.
you see... in law school, rudy, they don't teach you what you need to know.
it's all theories and lofty notions and big fat ethics books.
i know what's going on the second i lay eyes on them.
like i'm 10 years old, my father crying in the bedroom, my mother sitting at the kitchen table with blood all over her face telling me that daddy's sorry, and he's never gonna do it again.

i can't even begin to imagine the courage it must take.
well, your honor, uh... this issue's already been ruled upon by judge hale.
uh, the preparations required for fast-tracking the case place an undue burden on both parties,
now deck wants to do an ad on the local rap station.
and as much as i'd love to hear it, we can't afford it.
from their lofty perch, pissing down on the whole justice system with disdain.
i used to hate them because i wasn't good enough for them.
i represent great benefit, and i'm very sorry... i'm very sorry to be here under these circumstances.
well, we wouldn't be here if your clients had done what they should've done.
it's hard keeping my mind on leo drummond and his people.
they'll be flying in, first class, and after a leisurely dinner, they'll meet in some board room and discuss my total destruction.
around the time i'm checking into motel 6, they'll be sleeping soundly in their suites.
and they'll wake up fresh and rested and ready for war.
now, rudy, don't be intimidated by all these boys on this side of the table.
i guarantee, you get them on the golf course, they fold like a cheap suit.
i served the papers on cliff when he was on his way to lunch.
he didn't take it too well, but i said i was ready to rumble.
in which the insurance company has in plain english wording said that it will not pay for experimental procedures.
now, your lawsuit says that your son would have been saved if he had had a bone marrow transplant.

and the mistakes are piling up in my mind so fast
underwriting sends a memo back to claims saying, "don't pay this until you hear from us."
now, what you should keep in mind is that even though all these people work for this big company, and they all work in the same building, they don't know each other.
i was fired so the company could claim that i no longer worked there.
can you please point out the man in the courtroom who made you write this letter?
i could call it a firing and leave with nothing, or i could write that letter, call it a resignation, and the company would give me $10,000 in cash to keep quiet.
and i had to make that decision right there in his presence.

you know, they preyed on me, because i was broke, and i was single, and i had 2 kids.
so you told him you're gonna go to his wife, go to the newspapers.
and that $10,000, that was just a piece of blackmail, wasn't it?
and it shows very clearly that stolen documents are, in fact, admissible if the lawyers played no part in the theft.
well, according to these head notes, this case will overrule your objection.
does the figure of 11,400 sound correct to you, give or take a few?
that's about right, but i'd have to verify it, of course.
i am disgusted with myself... and with the entire legal profession that could not save him.
i don't even feel good enough about myself as a lawyer to make my own summation.
i was in the hospital being treated when the doctors realized that the only thing that could save my life would be a bone-marrow transplant.
so, i got released from the hospital, 'cause my family couldn't afford to pay the bill for what they had recommended.
i hope that you are astonished... as i am, at the lengths to which a wealthy insurance company, like the defendant, will go to take money from a low-income family and then keep it by denying a legitimate claim.
it's no wonder they spend so much money on their lawyers and their lobbyists and their public relations machine to convince us we need tort reform, that we need to put an end to punitive damages.
i'm asking you, the jury... just... do what you think is right in your hearts.
if you don't punish great benefit... you could be their next victim.
traveling with his wife, they claimed to be sneaking away for a quick holiday.
however, they could not produce the name of a hotel anywhere in europe..."
every lawyer in america is talking about me right now, but that doesn't exactly make me feel like a member of the legal community.
i might be able to go on practicing law if i was working with my whole heart, but i can't do that and cover kelly.
and then one morning, i'd wake up and find that i'd become leo drummond.
now, you give me a call when you pass the bar exam.
please, for one night, i beg of you, there is no topang.
if you care about me at all, and even if you don't care about me but could someday care about me, then go.
and, you know, i always thought we were meant to be together for the rest of our lives, but two weeks ago, she moved to pittsburgh, and i never got a chance to say goodbye and that i love her.
and, you know, what if i never get a chance to tell her?
i had the same problem when i broke up with francesca.
there was a lot of pain, there was a lot of heartache, but eventually time stepped in and i got over my devastating loss.
why don't we just drive down to pittsburgh this weekend, huh?
i need to see some suppliers, and you can spend some time with topanga.
i'm the one writing all the letters, but i will not be the one who travels 300 miles to be rejected and look like a fool.
so if life doesn't want me and topanga together, then you can't fight life, can you?
i told them how much cory meant to me and how i couldn't be away from him.
they said i was too young to say things like that, that i didn't know.
topanga, i know you miss cory, but to come here without your parents' permission, that's just wrong.
how can it be wrong, mom, if she loves me enough to do that?
so the first day we didn't connect was monday, but i figured you were busy with school and you had a lot of other stuff to do, but then we missed tuesday and wednesday, and i started wondering who were you with?
cory, i could've sat and talked to you on the phone every day, but it was just the phone, and every time i hung up it got harder for me.
she always was talking about these crazy things, and i never understood a word she said.
all i understood was that she was the girl i sat up every night thinking about.
i was looking forward to doing all the things that people do who are in love with cory.
and not with just some guy in pittsburgh because i'm there.
certainly you're not suggesting that i let some puppy love between two 16-year-old children interfere with her parents' wishes?
i am suggesting that topanga was born in philadelphia and has spent her entire life here.
to plant wild ideas about true love in young undeveloped minds is as irresponsible as my sister and brother-in-law ripping her from the only environment she's ever known at this delicate time.
madam, if you choose to question my opinions, then you disregard 38 years in the public school system where i have borne the responsibility of those opinions for 30,000 students, none held in higher regard than mr. matthews and miss lawrence.
i have spoken to your parents, and while i don't condone the intensity or exclusivity of this relationship,
i also cannot condone the actions of my sister and brother-in-law.
darling, i have known richard since i was nine years old.
he's not the most tactful guy in the world... but he's decent and reliable... and he won't ruin the most important day of our lives.
miss gardner, mr. tuttle realizes, as i'm sure you do... that the case could drag on for days, weeks even.
excuse me, you were the one... that was practicing law without a license, right?
you tell me... what would you like to see happen here?
i would like to see you turn and walk out of my office.
hundreds upon hundreds of unsuspecting consumers... paid 17.99 for a copper engraving... of the great emancipator abraham lincoln.
for their $17.99... plus taxes, plus shipping and handling... this, ladies and gentlemen, is what they got.
tell me what to say, i'll play the shit out of it.
three years of law school... two years of clerking for a federal judge.
dan white committed a single act of violence... in a fit of rage.
our client has been systematically bilking people... for over forty years.
but over the next few days... the defense will prove conclusively... that mr. gibbs never acted with intention... because of one indisputable fact.
mr. gibbs does not have the capacity... to tell right from wrong... and through the testimony of a nationally renowned... psychiatric expert... we will show that mr. gibbs was, in fact... incapable of normal, rational thought.
you know, folks, at the heart of every trial... is a performance... and the heart of every performance... is the truth.
when you walk into the courtroom... you're the actor... you're the director, you're the producer... and if it's going to be a great performance...
soon i was working even harder to get skipped all over again.
and that, my friend... is how you end up in the junkyard.
jesus, we're gonna end up with a hundred frigging ice buckets.
charles, i know you have to work this week... but i feel very isolated and unsupported... having to go through this whole present thing by myself.
dr. stone, would you clarify what you mean... by "frequently abused" and "rarely..."
i hold degrees from... the stanford university school of medicine... and the university of south carolina.
i came dressed as the great pumpkin... but everybody called me little pumpkin.
but it was so cold that particular year... that one of the big boys, eddie rollins, and his pals... they built a fire... which got away from them, i guess... because that's when the pier caught fire and collapsed.
well, he's this old man, used to run his own business.
it went belly up, but he saved a little cash for his old age.
it's not the dress that bothers me... it's the whole question of friendship.
and i figure if she's willing to clash with the flowers... and screw up my whole color palette... then she's really not my friend to begin with.
uh, ladies and gentlemen, it's, um... kind of hard for me to know what to say here.
what can be said about this man and everything he's done?
he's not the most tactful guy in the world... but he's decent and reliable... and he won't ruin the most important day of our lives.
ok, ok, he may not be totally reliable... but he is thoughtful.
i hate being the one to tell you... but the law is on his side.
prior use of the machine... is not determinative of possessory interest.
i would like to see you turn and walk out of my office.
hundreds upon hundreds of unsuspecting consumers... paid 17.99 for a copper engraving... of the great emancipator abraham lincoln.
we structure a deal wherein gibbs will work with the feds.
they'll use his inside knowledge... to expose other con men throughout the nation.
well, simply that the prosecutor must prove... beyond a reasonable doubt... that my client benjamin gibbs... intended to commit the crimes of which he's been accused.
but over the next few days... the defense will prove conclusively... that mr. gibbs never acted with intention... because of one indisputable fact.
mr. gibbs does not have the capacity... to tell right from wrong... and through the testimony of a nationally renowned... psychiatric expert... we will show that mr. gibbs was, in fact... incapable of normal, rational thought.
and, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... it's up to you to see that justice is done.
look, i had a day to find somebody and get them up here.
wouldn't you feel a little bad if gibbs went to jail?
as you can see... the chemical composition for table sugar... is c12, h22, o11.
that's how mr. gibbs' brain reads the sugar puffs... the chewy bears, and the jelly beans.
she said i was too advanced for my class... so they skipped me a grade, but i didn't want to be skipped... but everybody acted like i was so special.
soon i was working even harder to get skipped all over again.
i'm currently head of... the utah state institute for psychiatric studies.
dr. stone, you wrote a best-seller... on the insanity defense, did you not... in which you characterized this defense as misleading...
i was with my girlfriend, nancy newcombe, she was seven... and i was holding mama's old pillowcase full of candy.
i remember i was holding it when the pier collapsed... but i can't remember what happened to it afterwards.
the sisters gave a halloween party on the pier every year.
i came dressed as the great pumpkin... but everybody called me little pumpkin.
it went belly up, but he saved a little cash for his old age.
gibbs finds him, shows him this big, fancy business plan... shows him how he'll triple his money in six months... even if the business fails.
i said, i can choose to stay here... and turn into a righteous bitch... or i can choose to go to nevada and get the attention i need.
it's like dr. pearlstein said... about taking responsibility for your circumstances.
'cause if we didn't... well, then we'd have to look at who we are... who we really are...
and if we didn't like it... well, we'd have nobody to blame but ourselves.
that his eyes had become bulging and black, his skin mottled.
one even claimed that two horns had grown out of his forehead.
your husband was ordered to give his ship to the king.
if he had received the order, the king would have had his ship.
when the king tried to impound all ships for his army, chieftains came from far and wide to reason with him.
they waited at the gate for days, but the king refused to see them.
rumour had it that the king suffered from a strange disease.
that his eyes had become bulging and black, his skin mottled.
even if the king is lawless, and his power has gone too far.
when his soldiers rode off to impound ships, they spread his madness across every single village.
more taxes, more silver, more corn, more horses are what he wants.
up north they want to rebel, and we must choose sides.
just a little something i threw together as i was leaving the house this morning:
salmon in a pastry shell, sun-dried tomato and scallop salad on baby greens and crêpe suzette.
i told you two dust mites-- juice pitcher on the left side of the fridge specimen pitcher on the right.
mr. duckman, that was all-natural lemonade made exclusively from lemons that died of natural causes.
so, once in a while, someone has a big area rug smuggled in.
we dance on the rug, and for one night, it's like... it's like... we're free!
if you ever get out, hemple's department store has two new trundle beds with our names on them.
sorry to get down to business, but you're in danger here.
my investigation turned up a lot of scams in this prison-- prostitution, extortion, counterfeit simpson's merchandise-- and the money trail leads right to the warden.
this place is dirty, duckman, and it's gonna make you dirty, too.
don't you see that any popularity you have now is because they can profit off you?
when the inevitable fall happens, you'll be as forgotten as jesse jackson after a democratic presidential victory.
so what if it's 'cause i'm a boy-toy for slavering, disgusting men.
they'll drag me away by my press-on nails before i give up this gig.
i really wish the warden would gave me some advance notice on these things.
okay, just hold your bit under five minutes and don't mention vietnam.
you two are under arrest for price-gouging on vending machine sodas.
oh, and we're pretty sure that dance ring stuff was illegal, too.
but the right undergarments can make you feel so alive and that with the slightest lifestyle adjustment, you, too, can know the wild abandon i feel every time i look in the mirror.
let's say we go talk about it over some tiramisu and cappuccinos.
each year each school would have an annual concert at the city hall and perform for a whole night.
when one school performed, the other three would go and watch and when it was our night, we performed.
and for... stage swordplay... when one disarms an opponent with a sword, they may disarm them with one kick.
then everyone else would practise more kicks so that there was variety for the audience.
the director saw the boxer couldn't control himself and wondered what to do.
so he had the actor with the supporting role take the lead and i took his role.
in the past, we didn't have the support apparatuses there are today.
a lot of the time, they just relied on people for stunts.
it was 20 to 30 times more difficult to do stunts then.
for example, the padding was not as good as it is now - the pads then were small and thin.
during this period it was quite chaotic in the film industry.
if you had a bit of kung fu or style or anything, the directors would pick you and would try you out.
jackie said it was good and asked me to join his team.
i said, "later", as i still had other films to do.
we talked every day and i went to his company office a lot.
then, when i finished my film and there was a dry spell with my current company they allowed me to go over to jackie's.
back then, jackie and i... had both been in peking opera school and grew up at the same time so we knew of each other.
also, being in the same martial arts field, we often bumped into one another.
when making a film... there's usually a script but dragon lord didn't have one.
when i got there, they told me what a scene involved but they didn't say what was to follow.
they were like brothers - but not of the same father and not of the same home.
the two fathers were good friends and so were the two sons.
when we kicked the shuttlecock, it went up and everyone looked up.
and when it came down, it was kicked up again and again.
the shuttlecock was not within the frame and it didn't look good.
because it didn't look good we had to shoot it all again.
this time, we tried to keep the shuttlecock within the frame.
we adjusted the action so the shuttlecock wouldn't go above the frame.
there was a crossbeam and a ledge on which i stood.
there was a six foot gap i had to fly over and then slam onto the ground.
so we came to do it and we did three takes.
in the first take, i fell backwards and when i got to here, i got scared and my hands touched the wooden crossbeam.
i was on the ground and he was pushed off by what's-his-name.
after a somersault, i was to dive in and cushion him.
if i couldn't get to him in time, he'd slam onto the bare ground.
so he had a hole dug, just large enough for a small mattress.
if i could get to him in time, he'd land safely onto the mattress.
i thought it was ok and not a problem as i would be underneath him.
the awful part was that the mattress was three foot square.
and i'm over five foot, so the mattress was like this.
even though he understood just a bit of the language... he was of a good standard and met our expectations.
you can see his kung fu is good as well as his action style and the way he portrays power is just beautiful.
it had to be edited to fit the duration of a film for the cinema - 85 or 90 minutes.
for dragon lord, there was tens of thousands of feet of film.
he'd rather edit each scene, cutting out the bad bits and putting in the good bits.
just cutting it that way, he got rid of some but he still had 15,000 left.
because you could only watch a film at the cinema and nowhere else.
when videos and vcrs came out people began watching films at home.
i still work with jackie but i am no longer contractually bound to him.
so if he wants to hire me, i will still do it.
a lot of the actors in television do not know how to fight.
if the script calls for fighting and they don't know how to do it, they have to fight without getting hurt.
if the stuntman is injured, there's no one to double for the actor.
so it is more comfortable doing television, more convenient than doing film.
trunks, the youth who traveled back 20 years from the future in a time machine, delivers some frightening news.
in three years from this time, on an island about nine kilos from metro south, a terrifying pair of villains will appear.
i made friends with them, and they gave it to me.
these clothes looks a little funny, but mine were all torn up.
three years from now, on may 12, around 10 a.m., on an island nine kilos southwest of metro east.
we can get together at that island at 9 a.m., an hour earlier.
let me say now, that if any of you are unsure of yourselves, stay away.
our opponents this time are even more terrible than any before.
without the target provided by a common enemy, even allowing that piccolo wouldn't make trouble, we can pretty well guess that vegeta is going to lord it over us.
kuririn-san, you had such a good speech going there for a while.
there's nothing i can do about it, so i'ii keep associating with you for now.
well then, three years from now- um, may 12, 10 a.m. at that island.
just because you can become a super saiyan, don't get too full of yourself!
i'm still going to beat the crap out of you some time.
but i already told you, we're going to need gohan's power too.
i understand about studying, but in three years, earth itself is going to be in great danger.
have you ever earned even a penny, in all the time we've been married?
when you say it that way, i'm sorry, but this isn't the time for that.
this is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.
hey, why don't we walk over to grampa's and cheer up the old folks?
this is the one day that shouldn't be about material things.

no, i meant it's weird that you only have nine now.

could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over here and unlock me?

and on a totally separate subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.

good thing chandler's not here, he always wins at this game.
i just told my mom i'd cater a party for her.
oh, well richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him.

chandler, please, i have to get you locked up back the way you were,
i am sooo gonna lose my job, she's very private about her office.
teal'c, there are a lot of things... we do... that we wish we could change, and we sure as hell can't forget.
but the concept of chain of command undermines the idea of free will.
worse yet is the face of the victims, whom i selected, as they realise they are about to take their final human breath.
hanno's father's not the first nor the last of the lives i've taken.
but now i know that it was a different teal'c that chose sha're.
i know that if there were any way for him to help me get her back, this teal'c would do it gladly.
it would be made lovelier were it not for the goa'ulds and the jaffa.
the one thing i can't seem to figure out is... where you live.
so although you were faced with a terrible decision, you chose the lesser of two evils.
he chose to kill a crippled man, the man least able to run away, the most helpless of us all.
as a member of the clan, he would never be left behind.
in other words, your group can only move as fast as its slowest member, right?
you have defended this jaffa repeatedly by saying he is a changed man.
for proof, you have given examples of his firing upon his former comrades.
i'm hoping once they see our fire power, they'll release him without incident.
the united states is not in the business of interfering in other people's affairs.
teal'c spent years serving the goa'uld doing some damn distasteful things.
surely you must realise that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
daniel jackson, you must not allow colonel o'neill to deny the retribution the byrsa deserve.
you know, i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.
now see, it's that near as i can figure part that's got me a little worried.
but the whole concept of chain of command... undermines the idea of free will.
so as soldiers,... we have to do some pretty awful stuff.
but it does put some of the responsibility on the guy giving those orders.
then you are saying apophis is responsible for hanno's father's death?
i see the horror on the faces of many others,... as their loved ones prepare for goa'uld absorption.
worse yet is the face of the victims whom i selected... as they realize they are about to take their final human breath.
well, the way i look at it, teal'c has already pled guilty.
so to draw a parallel to an american trial,... we have to look at this as sort of like the sentencing phase.
but the fact is you now work side by side... with the man responsible for your wife's fate.
it was difficult for me at first, i wanted to hate him.
it would be made lovelier were it not for the goa'ulds, and the jaffa.
the one thing i can't seem to figure out is, where you live.
as a member of the clan, he would never be left behind.
so in other words, your group can only move as fast as its slowest member.
i am trying to prove to you that teal'c is a good man.
he is very important to all of us in fighting the goa'ulds and the jaffa.
i'm hoping once they see our superior numbers and firepower,... they'll release him without incident.
colonel, the united states is not in the business... of interfering in other people's affairs.
even setting aside that teal'c is our friend,... how can you let such a valuable information resource be taken away?
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
now teal'c spent many years serving the goa'uld doing some damned distasteful things.
surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
- i would like to volunteer my lifeless body, and that of my symbiote, for your scientists to study.
perhaps you can better learn ways to battle the goa'uld and the jaffa.
well, don't worry, teal'c, there's not going to be any body to donate.
jack and carter should be back any minute with the troops.
you know i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
i mean, i respect your wishes, but i don't believe that you deserve to die.
we can help you, but he is no good to you like this.
now i give you my word he will not try to run away.
now there could still be survivors out there, shouldn't we be looking for them?
no, not until i examine you, will use the barracks room.
i know i must look pretty scary in this mask but i'm not going to hurt you.
colonel, there's someone in the bushes and they won't come out.
are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
yes sir, in fact i think we may have brought back the cure.
now i'm hoping she has some sort of natural immunity... that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on earth.
why didn't the telescope team report that this outbreak was going on?
one side of the object is made up of iron and potassium.
the other is made up of the element that makes up the stargate.
and then they made us think that it was our fault... because they new we wouldn't leave her there... they new we would bring her back here.
and they used there technology to put that thing inside of her.
according to dr. fraiser, measurements of the devices atomic decay... we have one hour and 20 minutes left.
the girl should be prepared to go back though the stargate.
it occurred to me that she first slipped into the coma when we brought her close to the stargate.
as soon as we got her far enough away from the stargate, she woke up... and i knew.
no daniel, your right, you can't actually see it, not the singularity... it's self it's so massive not even light can escape it.
but during the totality phase of the eclipse... we should be able to see matter spiraling towards it.
no, not until i examine you, will use the barracks room.
colonel, you said you touched one of the victims before putting on gloves?
they told me when we came here three months ago... that with darkness would come the apocalypse.
it was part of there mythology, and what did we tell them?
don't be afraid, i'll be holding your hand the whole way, all right?
i know it looks kind of scary, but it's really a lot of fun.
it's possible someone from earth brought a normally harmless bacteria to that planet... it learned some new traits from a local organism... and mutated into the most deadly infectious strain i've ever encountered.
are you absolutely positive you haven't brought any of this disease back here with you?
sir, somehow this little girl survived against all odds on a completely contaminated planet.
now i'm hoping she has some sort of natural immunity... that we might use in fighting other serious infections already here on earth.
i'm assuming it's the naquada that was in her blood, some how the object is collecting it.
now potassium can be one of the most volatile alkali metals on earth.
the goa'uld wiped out every last living person on that plant except cassandra.
and then they made us think that it was our fault... because they new we wouldn't leave her there... they new we would bring her back here.
and they used there technology to put that thing inside of her.
it's like they designed away for us to help them create the device after she came through the stargate... so we wouldn't detect it until it was to late.
dr. frasier says this device inside the girl is on some kind of timer.
your sure it will go off if we send the girl through the stargate?
no daniel, your right, you can't actually see it, not the singularity... it's self it's so massive not even light can escape it.
but during the totality phase of the eclipse... we should be able to see matter spiraling towards it.
no, not until i examine you, will use the barracks room.

they recognised the significance of an egyptian sarcophagus... in a mayan temple.
since i was the only one to ever research... cross- pollination of ancient cultures, they tracked me down.
do we really think anyone'll believe that woman... if she goes around blabbing about a'stargate'?
i have a hard time believing this woman on 73rd... who talks about these devil people that live in her hair.
have you ever heard the old saying 'my enemy's enemy is my friend'?
yes, but even when the cia grants sanctuary to an enemy turncoat,... they never trust him.
i spent years studying you as a student, and now i'm with you.
do you know you're described in history... as the most beautiful woman that ever has or ever will be able... to control men with just your beauty?
this is really daniel's field, so i'm kinda starting from scratch.
one web page theorises that a bunch... of sex goddesses from different cultures... were actually all the same woman
she was supposed to be able to seduce them into doing anything for her.
in almost every case, it describes them as'drunk with her presence'.
this creature who calls herself hathor, is a goa'uld... or some form of goa'uld.
so she has who knows what kinds of weapons or defences.
yeah, we touched on that earlier... but i'd like to be the one asking questions now.
we must praise you and give to you a great honour.
you know, using seduction wasn't in any af training manuals i've read.
you think the pentagon anticipated an alien walking onto a base... and drugging the men to make them...?
i mean, i have a hard time believing this woman down on 73rd...
who walks around talking about these devil people that live in her hair,
she was supposed to be able to seduce them into doing anything for her.
in almost every case, it describes them as "drunk with her presence."
all of the men on this base are under hathor's control from what i can tell.
i hate to break it to you, teal'c, but you are male.
and if they're male, they'll be under hathor's control before they can think about it.
besides, when was the last time you saw a new woman get assigned here ?
-i've only heard stories but it seems they take on mortal features just before they strike.
then they go back into shade form once they hit you.
if he were to become the dominant power in our world..., ...goodness itself would be the casualty.
when your friend was on the altar in the temple of dahok..., ...he planted his seed within her.
our tradition states that one day a great warrior will be born to our people.
he will become our king and lead us in our fight against the barbarians.
you talked about wanting to end the cycle of pain and violence!
by protecting that thing, you're only ensuring the victory of that cycle!
unfortunately, it is the only way to get back to greece.
well, i guess i'll be glad to get off this island.
i've only heard stories, but it seems they take on mortal features just before they strike
then they go back into shade form once they hit you.
you incited the entire village to try and kill her-- that's just as bad.
our oath forbids us ever to bring harm to the innocent-- and that young girl beamed with goodness.

i don't know exactly, but i figure my grandpa will give me around 12 or 13 hundred a month.
and my old man, who keeps brown-nosing him, won't get a cent.
but before he gets his hands on it i'd rather invest in your education.
of course you should learn that you have to work for everything you get.
isn't it true that the same people you discussed with in your seminar don't say hello in the hallways or in the cafeteria?
isn't it true that the university is full of students, but you're all completely alone.
here's the room plan showing without a doubt that my course is located here.
ladies and gentlemen, it appears that we will have to postpone our lecture.
as far as i'm informed there was no change in values in the science of education between the years of 1907 and 1908.
as a result of the senselessness of our existence, we are forced to age, although there is no reason...
i had to give thet jerk 50 marks so he wouldn't get suspicious.
- what if he shows up with marlis as an alibi?
you puke all over my apartment, you fuck up the job
i got you, then you lie to me for that slut, lea!
first main goal was to define post-marxist principles for the 20th century.
the crucial observation, which is why adorno was so significant, is not only that the worker is exploited by the classical entrepreneur.
sorry, you have to fullfill the conditions, even if others make things hard on you.
my dear friends, fellow students, live from sweden, their first time in germany...
but you, son, i can feel it coming off you like heat.
i bet you just about glow in the damn dark, boy.
now, you know the winters in vermont, but it's different up here.
compared to vermont, this place is the dark side of the moon, buddy.
and it had a picture in it of a man with a lady's cut-off head.
my mom was mad at my dad for reading it to me.
well, the way i see it people are either meant to be together or they're not.
i guess i'd rather believe that any relationship can work as long as both people really want it to.
if there are, i'd be interested to see how they've adapted to the quantum fluctuations in the barrier.
can't we check it out the next time we come this way?
i realize this is going to be hard for you to accept but that ship was the defiant.
two days from now, when you leave here and try to pass through the energy barrier you will be thrown back in time 200 years.
all right, if you want, i could tell you something that only curzon would know.
do you remember that dancer that you met on pelios station?
this is our meeting hall, which, as you can see we sometimes use as a schoolroom.
...needs one square kerripate of land to grow in what is the total number of melons you can plant?
she took quark's image from the security logs of the defiant.
i've always thought that quark would make a great math teacher.
the energy discharge that struck her on the bridge damaged her neural pathways.
the defiant didn't have the medical equipment that julian needed to treat her.
i don't quite know how to say this but now that we know about the accident that sent the ship back in time, we should be able to avoid it.
well, if we do that, your timeline will collapse and everything here will cease to exist.
when you encounter the temporal anomaly the duplicate will be thrown back into the past, and the original... you... will pass through the barrier unaffected.
so you're saying we go home and your timeline is preserved.
well, it would appear that i'm not the only legend around here.
once the emitter array is recalibrated we can start synchronizing the shield generators.
this is what your crew and their descendants will build if you let history play itself out.
i'm not saying that it won't be hard at first but they will have good lives here, happy lives.
she's the one who insisted that the defiant investigate this planet.
you know as well as i do that you should have been more careful... you should have seen that the barrier was unstable when you scanned it.
you don't know what it was like to live with that.
for years, benjamin, every time i looked at you all i could think about was jake, and how, because of me he would never see his father again.
don't make us wait for the end like farm animals waiting for slaughter.
i will come to you tomorrow... and do what you ask.
yeah, well, i wouldn't mind cheating fate all the way home to the station.
neither would i but if we go home, 8,000 people are going to cease to exist.
the navigational logs from the original crash... download them into the ship's autopilot and it'll match the original trajectory.
that should send the defiant back to the right point in time.
this is about the 8,000 people down on that planet their children and their grandchildren.
what about the children who'll never be born because the defiant doesn't return to ds9?
the defiant is returning to deep space 9 after a week-iong reconnaissance mission in the gamma quadrant.
i can't wait to get home and sleep in my own bed.
the house itself was easy, but the furniture... even with a microlathe, i'm not sure i'm going to get it all finished in time.
i guess her dolls are going to have to rough it for a while.
it's hard to tell from the interference but there could be life-forms on the surface.
if there are, i'd be interested to see how they've adapted to the quantum fluctuations in the barrier.
this settlement was founded by the crew of a starfleet vessel that crashed on this planet two centuries ago.
i realize this is going to be hard for you to accept but that ship was the defiant.
two days from now, when you leave here and try to pass through the energy barrier you will be thrown back in time 200 years.
you'll be stranded here and become the founders of this settlement.
say you have 27 tessipates of land you want to plant with nice, juicy yelg melons.
this is our meeting hall, which, as you can see we sometimes use as a schoolroom.
how much were we... were you able to salvage from the defiant?
a portable generator, a replicator a few phasers, tricorders, things of that sort.
if we make certain modifications to the defiant's systems we should be able to amplify this doubling effect and create a quantum duplicate of the entire ship.
when you encounter the temporal anomaly the duplicate will be thrown back into the past, and the original... you... will pass through the barrier unaffected.
now, according to the logs i retrieved from the wreckage the defiant encountered the anomaly 39 hours after it arrived in orbit.
if your plan is to work, we must do the same.
but he'll be as right as rain as soon as we leave orbit.
you, on the other hand... are going to have to undergo a complete neural pathway induction as soon as we get back to the station.
think of the things that you've seen since you got here.
this is what your crew and their descendants will build if you let history play itself out.
if we don't get her back to the station, she'll die.
is one life too much to ask if it saves 8,000?
for years, benjamin, every time i looked at you all i could think about was jake, and how, because of me he would never see his father again.
eventually, i had to accept the fact there was nothing i could do to change things.
for two centuries, i have watched it grow into something to be proud of.
for generations, these people have worked to make a life for themselves here.
i can't let him do that... not if it's going to cost 8,000 lives.
no, we have to let history take its course even if it means i have to die here.
neither would i but if we go home, 8,000 people are going to cease to exist.
i don't know those people but i have a wife and kids back home who need me.
look, we can sit here and argue about destiny till we're blue in the face but the bottom line is, nobody has the right to tell me i can't go home to my family.
i want to go home as much as you do, chief.
that should send the defiant back to the right point in time.
i don't know... how to thank you for what you're doing.
the, uh... other day, when i told you about shakaar and... me not seeing each other anymore... you seemed so uncomfortable.
i had come to accept the fact that you were involved with someone else.
well, the way i see it people are either meant to be together or they're not.
i guess i'd rather believe that any relationship can work as long as both people really want it to.
if there are, i'd be interested to see how they've adapted to the quantum fluctuations in the barrier.

this is about the 8,000 people down on that planet their children and their grandchildren.
what about the children who'll never be born because the defiant doesn't return to ds9?
it's been a week since our return to ds9 but the celebration continues.
we're still at war, and the station is now the hq of the ninth fleet.
that, plus our position by the wormhole, makes ds9 one of the most tempting targets in the quadrant.
but for now, at least, the war seems very far away.
u.s.s. potemkin has completed repairs and is rejoining the fleet later today.
exeter, sutherland and agaki have submitted resupply requests and there are 1,000 messages from starfleet command awaiting "your eyes only" attention.
it's cramped but at least i'll feel like i'm still at war.
by the way, i'd like worf to continue as my intelligence officer.
at least if he's busy he'll stop going on about this wedding of his.
there were times on the rotarran he nearly drove me mad.
a traditional klingon wedding is what worf's wanted since he was a boy.
it probably has something to do with being raised by humans.
mostly, but the truth is i've been through five trill ceremonies and i'm a little bored with it.
is it me or did odo just try and avoid us?
as you probably know, jadzia and i will be married here in six days.
there's nothing so romantic as a wedding on ds9 in spring.
the whole point is to push yourself to the limits of endurance.
i will. i want to travel the entire path to "kal'hyah."
of course, we cannot expect you non-klingons to have the same stamina as us.
if you wish to quit, no one will think any less of you.
they will tolerate your weaknesses and your failings in a way that a klingon family never will.
in our house, you would always be an alien, an outsider.
when emperor reclaw was killed, all members of the imperial family were put to death, including shenara.
when the third dynasty was founded ten years later, a new group took the titles and names of the original lmperial family to create the illusion of an unbroken line.
so the woman that you think of as your 23rd maternal grandmother isn't related to you at all.
your real ancestor's name was karana, a concubine living outside the imperial stables.
so why don't you go back to sweating and bleeding with your friends and when you're done, meet me in benjamin's office and he'll perform the ceremony.
if that is your attitude perhaps sirella was right about you.
she says it's because he's a pig-headed, stubborn man who puts tradition before everything.
he says it's because she's a frivolous emotional woman who refuses to take him or his culture seriously.
she is nothing like the woman i thought i would marry.
we are not accorded the luxury of choosing who we fall in love with.
do you think sirella is anything like the woman i thought i'd marry?
she is a prideful, arrogant, mercurial woman who shares my bed far too infrequently for my taste.
but how hollow is the sound of victory without someone to share it with?
honour gives little comfort to a man alone in his home and in his heart.
you can't expect to be treated like him just because you carry his memories.
to her, you're just a young woman marrying into her family.
if it means you have to kiss her boots, that's what you have to do, and you knew that.
the moment you chose to marry worf you knew sooner or later you'd have to show her the respect she's due.
with fire and steel did the gods forge the klingon heart.
so fiercely did it beat, so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out, "on this day we have brought forth
the klingon hearts destroyed the gods who created them and turned the heavens to ashes.
to this very day, no one can oppose the beating of two klingon hearts.
it's been a week since our return to deep space 9 but the mood of celebration continues.
we're still at war, and the station's been designated headquarters for the ninth fleet.
that, plus our strategic position guarding the wormhole, makes ds9 one of the most tempting targets in the entire quadrant.
but for now, at least, the war seems very far away.
uss potemkin has completed her repairs and is rejoining the fleet later today.
exeter, sutherland and agaki have submitted resupply requests and there are about 1,000 messages from starfleet command awaiting your "eyes-only" attention.
allow me to offer my congratulations to the new supreme commander of the ninth fleet.
do you have any idea how much paperwork a supreme commander has to do?
he's the only officer i know who can never get enough work.
well, at least if he's busy he'll stop going on about this wedding of his.
oh, there were times aboard the rotarran he nearly drove me mad.
until his son arrived, it was all he could talk about.
but when he ordered me to bring the system back on line i thought he was still talking about the hydro-static system, so...
you didn't engage the pumps while the check valves were open.
he has everything figured out right down to the color of my shoes.
no offense, jadzia, but it seems like this wedding's all about what worf wants.
a traditional klingon wedding with all the trimmings is something worf's been thinking about since he was a boy.
it probably has something to do with being raised by human parents.
so, uh, that's why you're letting him make the plans for the wedding?
mostly, but the truth is i've already been through five trill ceremonies-- three as a bride, two as a groom, and i'm a little bored with it.
we've been avoiding each other ever since the dominion left the station.
i think we're both afraid of talking about what happened during the occupation.
jadzia and i will be married here on the station in six days.
there's nothing more romantic than a wedding on ds9 in springtime.
i captured three targs in the hamar mountains made the ritual sacrifice at dawn came back to the station asked quark to boil their shoulders into tallow.
then, i spent two days molding them into candles with my own hands.
in our house, you would always be an alien-- an outsider.
at best, you'd be an object of pity but you'd never be accepted, never an equal because you can never truly be one of us.
but the second dynasty ended when general k'trelan assassinated emperor reclaw.
for the next ten years, the empire was ruled by a council elected by the people.
your task is to recite the complete chronicle of the women in my family.
i just thought i'd give you a broader historical perspective along the way.
you see, i did some research and when emperor reclaw was killed all of the members of the imperial family were put to death, including shenara.
when the third dynasty was founded ten years later a new group of klingons were given the titles and the names of the original lmperial family... to create the illusion of an unbroken line.
so, the woman that you think of as your 23rd maternal grandmother... isn't related to you at all.
your real ancestor's name was karana a concubine living outside the imperial stables.
so why don't you go back to sweating and bleeding with your friends in the holosuite and when you're done meet me in benjamin's office and he'll perform the ceremony.
if that is your attitude... perhaps sirella was right about you.
we are not accorded the luxury of choosing the women we fall in love with.
do you think sirella is anything like the woman i thought that i'd marry?
it means that you can't expect sirella to treat you like curzon just because you carry his memories.
to her, you're just a young woman who decided to marry into her family.
if it means you have to bow down and kiss her boots that's exactly what you have to do, and you knew that.
the moment you decided to marry worf you knew that sooner or later you'd have to bow down and show her the respect that she's due.
well, he may have let this wedding business go to his head, but you are 356 years old.
compared to you, worf is just a kid and if you can't abide by klingon traditions then you never should have let yourself fall in love with him in the first place.
then one day... this klingon with a bad attitude walked into my life and the next thing i know, i'm getting married.
after 356 years and seven lifetimes... i still lead with my heart.
whatever happened to that young, callow ensign i used to know?
the one who used to turn to me for advice all the time?
with fire and steel did the gods forge the klingon heart.
so fiercely did it beat so loud was the sound, that the gods cried out
the klingon hearts destroyed the gods who created them and turned the heavens to ashes.
to this very day no one can oppose the beating of two klingon hearts.

but when he ordered me to bring the system back on line
i thought he was still talking about the hydro-static system, so...
the rotarran's crew actually thinks of me as a good luck charm.
you know, the more mistakes i make, the safer they feel.
he has everything figured out right down to the color of my shoes.
no offense, jadzia, but it seems like this wedding's all about what worf wants.
a traditional klingon wedding with all the trimmings is something worf's been thinking about since he was a boy.
it probably has something to do with being raised by human parents.
i've already been through five trill ceremonies-- three as a bride, two as a groom, and i'm a little bored with it.
is it my imagination or did odo just try and avoid us?
and in the future if you cannot trouble yourself to make real var'hama candles try not to use such obvious fakes.
you never told me that your wife was opposed to this marriage.
you know, turning down the heat might be a good idea.
the whole point is to push yourself to the limits of your endurance.
of course, we cannot expect you non-klingons to... have the same stamina as we do.
if you wish to quit, no one will think any less of you.
they will tolerate your weaknesses and your failings in a way that a klingon family never will.
in our house, you would always be an alien-- an outsider.
well, that's where we run into a little bit of a problem.
you see, i did some research and when emperor reclaw was killed all of the members of the lmperial family were put to death, including shenara.
when the third dynasty was founded ten years later a new group of klingons were given the titles and the names of the original lmperial family... to create the illusion of an unbroken line.

we'd probably have shot him ourselves if he hadn't caught the shrapnel in the shoulder.
he must have seem me coming because the whole place went up.
- it knocked me all the way back to the end of the driveway.
- and why would he keep all of his bomb-making equipment... in a box in the garage when he had his own basement workshop?

there's nothing we can do to alter the original royalty agreement.
what i need is a good bankruptcy lawyer and a gun.
a gun with a bullet to put through my fucking head.
they have this powerful duality... as both signage designed to attract the opposite sex... and then as a food source to nurture the offspring of the alliance.
they also give off special energy because they're circles within circles.
i hate to put a label on myself, but i am a feminist.
i got the surgery, not in spite of, but because of that fact.
all the guys i worked with began treating me like a moronic bimbo.
i've known them for years, and now they were calling me... baby and doll face and sweet pants.
it's like in one weekend, i went from being a respected equal... to some kind of totally vacuous, available, helpless, slut secretary.
like i'd paid the doctor to take out my brain and stuff it in my tits.
it's nice, but if you really want to stop the trains... we can do something like that.
then, we would take your nipple... move it up to here.
you have 36 cancellations this week and two death threats, one sounds serious.
the times, tribune, post, and sun want to speak with you.
channels 2, 4, 5 and 11 all want you on the news tonight.
they found three women out of three million... and they put them on tv.
david kessler should read the mayo clinic and the harvard medical school studies.
the number of sick women with implants is proportional... to the sick women in the general population.
the problem is that the majority... the women who are happy with their implants... aren't gonna stand up at their next town meeting and say:
"excuse me, i have augmented breasts and i'm pleased as punch with them."
we'll explant the silicone implant, which will be fully covered by your insurance.
if you want to swap, i think you'll be very happy with our new saline implants.
the point now is not to be depressed, but to take positive action.
perhaps trading up to a larger size would be a pick-me-up.
you'll get two free visits and a holistic mineral and relaxation kit.
tension and anxiety are the two greatest causes of health problems.
they have form and function based on the concept of giving.
a penis isn't on display, it doesn't have to fill a sweater.
as though it was a totally flat place upon which a person can... unthinkingly lay their things and get them later.
i know you don't like it that i'm getting the operation because you're feminists.
i have this 12-year-old boy here, we've got an aponeurosis of the velum.
since he's here at this operating room, why don't we give him some of that...
that little snap of the bra clasp opening... which to the guy, i assume, represents some rush of erotic victory.
a sound which should be a happy sound... creates in me a feeling of horror and panic so acute...
i used some of that technology to create a simplified dialysis procedure.
my team's just come up with a new way of mapping neurons in the brain.
we couldn't even keep it on the navy docks in okinawa.
turns out the japs were stealing the stuff... and injecting it directly into women's breasts.
we talk as doctors... in terms of the tangible and the empirical... but now i ask you to consider the psychological... the mental aspects and then the opportunities that we have.
it's a low-risk operation that can be done inexpensively and quickly... as both a reconstruction and an augmentation... to the betterment of the... overall self-esteem... to the women who get it.
once you've finished with your strippers... and your prostitutes... what respectable woman's gonna pay for this?
i think, louis, that if she knew... how you were behaving with some of your nurses... perhaps your wife might be...
it's just kind of embarrassing, 'cause i've had six kids... and they're sagging.
in fact, my ex-husband used to say that i had a couple of flat feet.
and the result is a beautifully contoured breast... with softness comparable to that of the young adult.
the psychological well-being of women who feel crippled... by their own perceived shortcomings... can be cured with one simple operation.
i was thinking that... maybe you could give me something like you gave katy.
i mean, i'm a little more skinny on top and she's more...
if you approach it like it is, you'll end up with some extremely unhappy women... with displeasing, wandering or... walleyed breasts.
they'll be angry at you and you'll be out of business quickly.
she has a husband who isn't maturing as quickly as she is.
the girls flock around him, he looks good on the golf course.
meanwhile, she's borne all the children, her breasts are sagging... and she wants the operation so she can feel good again.
in one respect, it isn't important what he thinks you look like.
we can't make any prank phone calls, because we can't pay our phone bill.

i've got a staff and i'm not afraid to use it.
by sundown, the amusement park will be a giant crater and children everywhere will weep with anguish.
after freeza's spaceship discovered mine, they must have known when i would arrive.
speaking of which, who was it that defeated freeza and his men?
he didn't seem at all sorry about what he'd done, so i was going to put him away, and then you showed up.
there were three hours until you got here, so of course it was impossible for you to deal with him.
not all that powerful, but they did know all kinds of techniques.
i couid have moved myself from inside the spaceship i was in to wherever freeza was in an instant.
i couldn't at first, but i struggled with it and managed to bring it under control.
then may i ask you to turn yourself, here and now?
son-san, there are important things i must make you aware of.
in roughly three years from this time, on may 12, at around 10 a.m., on an island located 9 kilos southwest of metro south, a terrifying pair of villains will appear.
in short, all that remained were the artificial humans, who liked nothing better than causing death and destruction.
well, iike he said, if son goku really does show up here, we should be able to unravel some of this mystery.
i've stood up to them, but there's two of them, after all.
even one-on-one, it was all i couid do just to escape them.
in twenty years, i will be the only warrior to survive!
in the battle three years from now, my dad vegeta, kuririn-san, yamucha-san,

as you are already aware, with piccolo gone, the dragonballs also disappear, so we were unable to bring anyone back to life.
i believe that you will definitely manage to do something about all this.
my mom also hopes so, which allowed her to struggle through and finally complete her time machine.
piccolo told everyone what was to happen, while skillfully leaving trunks' nature a mystery.
as might be expected, no one was able to conceal their shock.
why did you have to go tell nancy about my bathroom shortcomings?
food that is not absorbed becomes waste... and enters the pouch-like cecum.
but i spoke to his mom, who said the most interesting thing.
she said, when he was a teenager... he would be in that bathroom three or four times a day...
the colon has to twist and turn because it's surprisingly long.
you know, bobby, if i were to take your grandfather's intestine...
and if i don't ever poop again, well, that's just gonna be who i am.
i'd rather die with a burger in my colon... than live and eat faux fu.
you might have noticed in tonight's episode there was some brief nudity.
now, as an actor, i only do nudity when i feel the script warrants it.
and i thought tonight's episode only warranted seeing the side of my rump.

i've been working an auto-theft ring for two years run by a pigtown bully boy named frank cantwell.
cars stolen out of philly, new york, and then sent to chop shops here.
you asked me to meet you here so you could handle me?
i wanted you to come and meet me so maybe you could just talk about it.
yeah, i filed the report, next of kin have been notified.
i'm waiting for is the final autopsy report from cox, and that'll be here tomorrow morning.

- 'that's a loss of life.' - 'every life has meaning.
i hated him for that and being weak and... selfish, for everything i hated about him when we were partners.
but it was always when i was hating him the worst, that he would turn around and do something incredibly... stupidly sweet.
we found what could be a bullet hole above the bathtub.
the luminol test for blood came up positive in the tub and along the walls.
we put them in the box until we find who's responsible.
if we start questioning cantwell's crew, we'll never find our leak.
after 30 years of painstaking research and excavation dr. margaret madsen has brought the ultrasaurus back to life so to speak, here in gotham city.
i'd say the work has paid off very well for you, dr. madsen.
by the time these doctors stopped my deterioration all that was left undamaged was this.
that's what you meant when you said it was too late for you.
do you have any idea why someone would want to kill him?
no, but considering what he did for a living he probably had dealings with all sorts of marginal characters.
i think about that from time to time but there's not much i can do about it.

your seminar is the reason i went into criminalistics in the first place.
well, i'm happy to take the credit, but with a mind like yours, you would have ended up there eventually.
i think silvia was more than a victim in this case.
i think she was vestigating it, and she got too close to the killer and ended up dead.
this is all the surveillance i got from the night of the murder.
that's her in the parking lot of the golden gate hotel.
any of these wrestlers had the strength and the skill to induce spinal shock.

(aidan) i'm covered in mud, head to toe, and it's drying , it's caking, as i chase after her.
every time she turns round, she looks at me, she screams and she laughs and keeps running ahead, and i can't stop myself.
i get down on my muddy knees, and hold out my muddy arms and say, "i won't leave until you promise to go out with me."
she says, "i don't know what you look like." i go into the shower, in my clothes, come back clean, dripping wet, and she looks at me and smiles and says ...
in some ways, you're the most enigmatic of all my holograms.
i don't have a history with you like with mom and dad and griff.
would you prefer having someone you share a history with as your interface to the computer?
no, i like the fact that your personality matrix isn't based on anyone i used to know.
i want to paint you more than anything in the world.
in fact, i won't let you leave until you promise to let me paint you.

perhaps i'm too soft, but i don't want her to come home alone.
you see if you have a bit of money, people are a bit envious, but if you are really rich, then you have real enemies.
maybe she's deaf, but for god's sake they'd have told me.
"suddenly she started to be poorly and ill, growing paler and weaker, grieving and sighing."
he wants us to discuss it in a creative writing course.
i accepted because he offered me a lot of money at least from my perspective.
would you believe nine boys out of ten don't know the basics.
i gave them a mute map of a woman's genitals and they didn't know what it was.
when their times comes it won't be marked for them either.
bára thinks i only make fun of her, but i feel like you're making fun of me.
i won't pretend this quotation came to me in the morning
i didn't get on a crowded bus full of kids and adults.
you really left college just because you hated going through the piss passage?
i knew i shouldn't have given it to you to read.
you know what comes to my mind if you say "pile it on"?
i imagine a soldier dying in a trench, eaten by lice and writing to his mother that everything is fine.
when you move on it you'll feel like you're at sea.
once you catch the right rhythm you'll understand about being excited to go to bed.
like re-lining the chimneys, constructing a third greenhouse and making structural changes for mink raising.
in addition to this i'd like to remind you that we mustn't neglect our own teaching.
make sure desks aren't shifted from their marked positions, otherwise they move out of alignment and it's just awful.
we should put a condom vending machine in the cloak rooms.
you repeat over and over and they don't know a single word.
i sign the class register, and then a book to say i signed it.
why do my boys have to sing in the choir if they don't want to?

did you tell me about the secret trysts in hyde park ?
i won't let you make the same mistake as your mother.
if you see your friend ever again, i can't be responsible for you.
i think we're going to leave you until you've sobered up.

then i'm sure you'll have a good time together in venice.
i know it must be difficult to write... when you're with her all the time, but please try, if only to reassure me.
in my head i follow you around the streets and canals.

did you tell me about the secret trysts in hyde park?
surely this was modelled after the great byzantine steam house in constantinople.
yes, but many would argue that that miraculous monument pales against the splendour of this-this later masterpiece.

yes, but many would argue that that miraculous monument pales against the splendour of this-this later masterpiece.

maybe we just kept missing each other-- me turning the corner just as you went the other way.
i thought of that so i stayed in the same place... and waited for hours.
- actually we're waiting for dr. klein to tell us if we can even have kids.
did you ever have any qualms about raising children after you started trying?
star labs, a subsidiary of dynacord international is rumored to be ready to unveil their latest technological breakthrough:
the reintegrator, a device which will be able to disintegrate matter transport it across space and then rematerialize it.
and then they told me to get back to my toys.
now i discover that they have assigned a scientist from star labs to oversee its development without me.
the reintegrator was my baby, and they stole it from me.
therefore, i think it's only right that i steal their babies from them.
what i could never figure out was how to consistently rematerialize the transported matter into its original form.
this transponder actually codes each separate molecule of the disintegrated object so they can be decoded upon reintegration.
both jonathan and i know how hard you two are working right now.
and we want you to know that if you can't celebrate our anniversary with us tomorrow night we absolutely understand.
which means somebody obviously thinks we're getting too close to them.
i just wish we knew who we were supposedly getting too close to.
hard to believe he's the evil villain behind the curtain, isn't it?
yeah, but he's still one of the only names on the list connected to toys.
in the meantime, i've gotta cover my tracks so that husband of yours doesn't follow.
i think i'll arrange to meet him at the toy store and then blow it up.
once upon a time there was a little boy who had to leave his home because his planet was going to explode.
and his mommy and daddy, they didn't have time to build a spaceship big enough for the whole family so they built one just for him so that he had time to escape.
and then he traveled millions and millions of miles through space until he landed here, on earth.
and he was really, really scared too because he missed his home and his mommy and daddy, just like you guys.
listen, i've got an idea how to let clark know where we are.
kripstly just got word to him to go to the toy store.
i think you care too much about those kids to ever hurt them.
superman, i don't mean to be critical, but what do you think you're doing?
are you sure you guys don't wanna stay for a nightcap or something?
no, your mother and i are gonna head back to the hotel.
i see great possibilities for these beings, under my guiding hand.

reports of devastation are coming in from all over the world.
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
there were a couple calls last night but, uh, i don't think any of them are gonna work out.
i mean, i guess until she, you know, gets used to the fact that there's you know, a new mom.
you know, i think she's worried that she's gonna be replaced.
you know, and i see spindler a lot, and levine, kelly.
and i run into goldie from time to time stick, brown, sulkov, mcguire j.t., beardsley.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin.
and you got to ride off on chip's motorcycle and wear his letterman jacket.
i went to one where i wore a band uniform that you had to have specially made.
well, you know how i always wanted to go out with chip in high school?
well, tonight, i actually went out with chip matthews in high school.
um, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat.
when, clearly, you are also the reincarnated spirit of my friend's mother.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin.
she always wanted to get married where her parents did but it's getting torn down.
i know it's crazy, but everything's been so crazy and it just feels right.
if there was just one little area where i think we need to work on, i would think it's that we're just not crazy enough.
i got to say, i'm not too sure i agree with that.
you know how ross and i have always been on-again, off-again?
i guess i just figured, somewhere down the road we would be on again.
i got to tell you this really does put me in a better mood.
i wish there was a job where i could wear this all the time.
and you got to ride off on chip's motorcycle and wear his letterman jacket.
i went to one where i wore a band uniform that you had to have specially made.
um, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat.
when, clearly, you are also the reincarnated spirit of my friend's mother.
yeah, but i can stay out as late as i want.
you know, with all of our stuff gone, the unit doesn't seem that big.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.

hey, here's a question; where did you guys get the finest oak east of the mississippi?
uh-huh, first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land.
this is the spirit of my mom lily, the one who killed herself.
are you sure she's in the cat, or have you been taking your grandma's glycoma medicine again?
you went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off chip's motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket.
i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.
it was a project for one of the home ec classes.
oh my god, they told us that was for the mascot!
back then, i thought that i would never, ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews, and now he's-he's called me up and asked me out.
and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go.
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?
well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, i don't think any of them are gonna work out.
i mean, i guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that there's y'know, a new mom.
y'know, i think she's worried that y'know, she's gonna, she's gonna be replaced.
no you do--y'know what, you're not gonna suck me into this.
oh sure i am, because you always have to be right.
sorry, about what i said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat.
when clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friend's mother.
so honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?
yeah, okay, listen, umm, mom, i hope you know you still mean a lot to me.
then he stuck a board through the handles and locked me in.
it was funny till i felt like it was a coffin.
yeah, but i can stay out as late as i want.
you know, with all of our stuff gone, the unit doesn't seem that big.
one of them will realize what they've done and call it off.
you'll be dancing at my wedding before you dance at theirs.
i look down and i know this won't be the most special day of my life.
i mean, it was kind of fun for a while but didn't you feel kind of silly?
i know i said i'm totally okay with ross getting married.
but as it turns out i don't think i'm handling it all that well.
and if they call you on it, tell them it was lost in the mail.
that is why the judicial system is in such a shambles.
well, yeah, i'm not about to serve on a jury in the summertime.
well, winter, spring, summer, or fall, all they have to do is call and i'll be there.
harry and tommy solomon will demonstrate how pre- verbal societies functioned.

sally, i have a play to write, and an artist lives only for his art.
can you live with sending this man to jail considering the indisputable fact that chris foster... is so pudgy and cute?
how pudgy and cute the defendant is has no bearing on this case.
look, this morning, no one was thirstier for vengeance than i was.
but now it's not just a crime, it's a face, it's a person.
and there are phone records, canceled checks, and 8 witnesses all saying foster did it!
well, if he stole this money, what did he do with it?
i was so dedicated, i snuck out of the motor lodge and talked to my friends and family about this case.
you spoke with others about the facts of this case during the deliberation process?
shot between 1995 and 1997, it follows the lives of four institutionalised adolescents in custody.
the law forbids to reveal their identity before they reach adulthood.
that is the image of a trip, a card with a drop of l.s.d. that i had blown up, because i like that.
this is a drawing of a cannabis plant, to remind me.
if it all came back, i don't know what i'd do.
if i were 15 years old, i would go on stealing and everything.
it won't always be easy, because i know the taste of easy money.
once you've got a taste for it, it's very hard to kick.
do you resent your parents for having you outside the law?
no i can't hold it against them, because i like it.
as far as the removal of your case, it depends more on your behaviour than on the judge.
it pends on whether or not it's open to corrective measures within the framework of law 65.
last time it took 9 months to get 3 months worth of work.
what remains to be said is that your future is in your hands.
because for them this is an infrastructure that is supposed to allow them to orient and observe the youngsters in a closed system.
it is a complete joke to put me here a second time.
there was the first time i was in an open house.
there's the death of my father and that of a friend.
a robbery involving a blauwpunkt car radio and cd player, compact discs, a lee cooper sweatshirt, a hat, you may assess it.
in verviers, on february 4, 1994, it's an attempted car theft.
- i want you to realise they are not abstractions, they are real people who exist, to whom you caused harm, who have the right to be respected.
and when you commit offenses, do you or did you have an idea of these individuals or were they anonymous abstractions?
i never got into it at all, but when i see people i know who are, it's ugly.
and with all the will in the world, they can't really get off it.
i think i got something out of braine-le-château, and that now i'm going to les glanures,
i think i will do my best to make it and i'm glad to leave here.
but i think, contrary to what you said, that you are different, everybody is different.
and as far as you are concerned, i contacted the social worker and educational counsellors.
i only hope you'll be strong enough, firm enough in your actions, in the decisions you'll make.
at this point, i have a certain misgiving, but it's up to you.
a new summons for the removal of the case was issued by my office this morning, in line with the procedure in other cases.
braine-le-château proposes the continuation of certain programmes and that certain things be put in place.
along with what we just got from the re-education service, also proposing the set up of some programmes to get this youngster back on the straight and narrow path.
there is no other way than to defer, for the moment.
perhaps, in order to allow these programmes to go on, should the boy not behave as he should,
i would then ask you to accede to my request for removal.
now i'm going to do my best, to do the 50 hours of work and do them right.
then i can take things more easy and the case will be closed.
if i can be with manu and all that, i will do it.
is the problem with dope the same as that of delinquency?
when i say sure i mean that your programme shouldn't throw sand in our eyes, so we'd be happy to let you leave.
no, i want it to be a programme in which you're interested.
no, i'm always cautious with any youngster, to emphasise that you really must do what you say you will.
i can change midcourse after discussing it, if certain things aren't achievable, and replace them with things that are.
and that you can say to the court and society, represented by the crown prosecutor:
"i have been dysfunctional, but i have demonstrated i can do positive things, and function completely normally in a society, that has nothing to fear from me."
may i sum up by saying you consider that a juvenile court has no right to tell you what to do?
i didn't say that, but in the end, if i say yes, that'd be the end of it.
what do you hope for your adult life that is starting now?
some dough, some money, living my life as i want, without anyone telling me what to do or who stands before me saying: "do this, do that".
i hope i'll get through the crap that's getting me down.
if i fall back into delinquency, it will be because of money.
obviously, i'd seen a lot of awful things done to the body.
i mean, i'd seen the results, but i'd never actually seen shots fired before.
it didn't scare me as much as i thought it might, though.
maybe because i knew i could repair the damage, undo what had been done.
like a prisoner getting one day out in the sun, it just made the prison seem that much more dismal.
on the way home, i said, "tonight, i will not get high."
when i pray to god, i don't ask him to eradicate disease.
i pray that he sends me something that i haven't seen.
a man with gangrene thinks he's lucky if he only loses a finger and not an arm.
so if your life was going along well, and you found yourself walking with two guys that look like metallica rejects, you might think it was a bad day.
you can either do what you did in the nightclub, or you can let him die.
if i don't like what i see, he goes to the hospital.
i didn't think about how much i missed being a doctor.
i'd gone from hoping ray wouldn't call to wondering if he might... to wishing he would, and then he did.
either she hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me, or she really liked me and wanted to get rid of me.
anyhow, wondering about claire stopped me worrying about what i'd find on this house call.
by the way, that, uh, work you did on vlad was, was really good.
it's too bad that ray shot him two hours after you left.
three to four fun-filled days of sweats, dehydration and panic attacks.
if i crash out, you can wake me up if... if you need me.
you get your chinese friend on tape buying, and you leave quietly.
you do that, we'll see what we can do for you and your girl.
they look at you with eyes full of hope, and you want to do it.
you think, " if i go to sleep, who's going to save all these people?"
some meth to get up, a little fentanyl citrate to come down.
and then one day, i found myself up and down at the same time, and i realized that i wasn't god.
claire, she's tryin' to get her life back together, but this time, she's being very responsible.
i made her take out insurance so she can get a really good doctor.
he'll live, but you better get him to a hospital now.
obviously, i'd seen a lot of awful things done to the body.
maybe because i knew i could repair the damage, undo what had been done.
i guess i should have felt better after saving that man's life, but i didn't.
on the way home, i said, "tonight, i will not get high."
i might just as well have said, "tonight, i will not breathe."
days had passed since i'd sewn vladimir back together, and this time not a single hour had slipped by that
i didn't think about how much i missed being a doctor.
i'd gone from hoping ray wouldn't call to wondering if he might... to wishing he would, and then he did.
he said he had a little day trip planned and had another little surprise for me.
it was a nice car, all right, but the radio was shot, so i had a lot of time to think... about claire, for instance.
either she hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me, or she really liked me and wanted to get rid of me.
anyhow, wondering about claire stopped me worrying about what i'd find on this house call.
who was it that said, " when a doctor sees a man, he doesn't see good or evil, only sick or healthy"?
- well, i told you that when you said get the guns and the...
i said, " get the guns and get the masks." that's two things.
there are so many times i should've fired eric, but i didn't.
i would have been admitting that i was a lousy boss.
i remember dr. hodges gave me these rubber gloves to put on to keep everything safe and clean.
so i put them on, and then you were born, and you were moaning and groaning like you do now.
i did not know the bosses required us to have a guard dog.
well, actually, they don't, but i just figure with a beat as rough-and-tumble as john adams high, we could use a little backup.
i thought you said that back home you were, like, an engineer or something.
back home, i am an engineer, but, here, they don't know that.
you've already gone to college, and now you want to go again?
i know it's a lot of hard work, but anything of value is worth that hard work.
and judging from the hotbed of criminal activity raging out here,
i think your time would be better spent inside with us.
i heard you told my parents you thought i was smart.
just knowing you said that was worth about 1,000 sat points.
a nice pot roast, little red potatoes... carrots cooked in the sauce.
before he even tasted a bite... he had the nerve to ask me for salt.
after your father left, we didn't talk for a long time... and i thought it was over.
but then you realized you made a big mistake and you got back together, right?
then i gave her a check for $20,000 and she was mine.
in the long version, i dump him for telling people the short version.
listen i gotta say goodbye, and i gotta say it quick because this is killing me.
one thing you gotta know is that i will never forget you.
and so i'm gonna get on this spaceship and i'm gonna go to blaargon-7 in search of alternative fuels.
but when i return 200 years from now you'll be long gone but i won't have aged at all.

and if we're still going out, she has to go to the ball.
- mike, you say you're a bookie you take a bet and then you can't pay.
i don't know, mike, to me it sounds a little, how you say, phony.
but i think that at its core this is a susie-and-elaine problem that requires a susie-and-elaine solution.

you think the only nina that you see exists in the office?
your own child you cast out for his crime of loving me.
your own child has his honour as a knight mocked in every alehouse and ne'er a word said against it from you!
you will not talk to me like that in my house!
well, then let me stay in this house and you will never hear less than gentle words from me!
i'd say follow this road for 10 miles, you'll come to the priory at brinksby, where they live rich and soft.
but as you are the humblest servants, the poor hermitage of reith is two miles that way.
take the north road for half a mile, then turn west.
you'll come to a stone cross at the centre of a crossroads.
and after the first child, well, once a month will suit him fine, you'll see.
and if the first child is a boy, you'll be able to bolt your door in no time at all.
he knew what he was doing when he wanted you bound to the house of coningsburgh.
and not just because of the power that goes with it.
oh, i think, of all men, lord cedric is most aware of that.
his son's infamy is the stock and trade of every balladeer in england!
oh, by god, sir brian de bois guilbert, if i were a man,
i would take up the shield of ivanhoe, ride against you at your tournament and show you the nature of saxon valour!
i'd hate them to say that prince john is less generous than king richard.
sire, i should warn you there are those that will say that such generosity ill befits one who is having such difficulty raising a ransom for his brother.
and how much money does this country have to spend on that devil?
he's already stripped it to the bone for his blessed crusade.
cedric, i am now betrothed to the man that you and my father chose for me.
i shall honour him and i shall obey him, but do not ask me to love him.
there are not many who will defend a poor jew in these times.
perhaps they believe there are not many poor jews to be defended.
you're not fit to be let out on your own, are you?
i'd have gone with you the first time if you'd told me you was going.
it gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved.
most people will go in the tank for an hour, tops.
i never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life.
maybe if he showered once in a while, the experience wouldn't be quite so unique.
maybe no one will miss you, but i have a little daughter who loves her daddy.
we don't even know if he'll want to talk to us.
more than likely, he never had time to encode the event into his long-term memory.
you don't know about bungee cords... but you know about dearling's theory on shock trauma?
so you followed chris welman up to the training tower, and you cut his rappelling rope.
and then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.
it gave him a taste of the freedom he so desperately craved.

and then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.
and then he'd come out and go around hugging everyone he saw.
i never experienced such a connection to another human being in my entire life.
genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
in 1963, a corporation known as the centre isolated a young pretender named jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.
maybe no one will miss you but i have a little daughter who loves her daddy.
we don't even know if he will want to talk to us.
yet beneath all these heroics he's lead a very sad life.
he never knew his parents, he feels responsible for his uncle's death people are always trying to kill him.
there's no one faster with the rope than bobby that's where you need improvement.
and just think, you can sleep in on saturday and get some extra beauty sleep not that you need it.
i mean, this guy, he, he came up and he said sorry about the noise
gave me twenty bucks and told me to get a hot meal.
it must eat you up knowing that people have picked on you your whole life, and you've always had to take it, never getting to even the score.
how long will you let people demean and belittle you until you finally say
if the mother rejects her offspring rarely does the blame fall upon the child.
it is usually an indication that the woman does not love herself.
bobby would only deny it and i would become the black sheep of the squad, if i wasn't fired.
believe me it's hard enough being one of the boys around here.
so you followed chris welman up to the training tower and you cut his rappelling rope.
and then you made it look like he tried to commit suicide.
well, if that were true, i'd be dating my aunt ruth.
and the two times we went out, it was just plain awkward.
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
if i didn't leave you that tip you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument and there wouldn't be this heat between us.
you gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
for the first time in my life after my dad left me and then getting arrested for stealing those birds and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather but with alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
my mother didn't want us to be together but the worst thing she ever did was tie me to the porch.
you know, i came to you because i thought you'd understand.
well, i mean are you sure you wanna go out with her?
that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what i mean?
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
for the first time in my life after my dad left me and then getting arrested for stealing those birds and then the whole punctured-lung thing.
it's still really hard to take deep breaths in cold weather but with alice, all that stuff kind of went away.
hey, how much cash you got in your pocket right now?
and that's why i'm not inviting you in for a drink.
and then, uh, my mom locked me out of the house, so i couldn't find it.
and, uh, then i tried to find a pay phone, and the receiver was cut off.
well, i mean are you sure you wanna go out with her?
that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what i mean?
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.
yeah, but if i do tell him, then he's gonna hate myself.
if you can't get it out, cut around the stain add a little lace, you make a stylish throw.
or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, frank?
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.

you always pull your pants down and play "wipe out" on your butt.
i was trying to distract attention from that poor, old woman who was trying to stuff her breasts into tube socks.
you wanna go out with me because of my wig, boobs, and because i serve you food.
well, if that were true, i'd be dating my aunt ruth.
you think he'll enjoy it when he's up to his elbows in diapers of all the babies they have to have right away?
this is not fair to frank, and it's not fair to the babies.
if i didn't leave you that tip you wouldn't have come, we wouldn't have this argument and there wouldn't be this heat between us.
you gotta admit that our relationship is hitting a new level now.
you know i would storm out of here if i had some money or a place to go.
ross, if you had a million dollars, what's the first thing you'd buy?
well, i mean are you sure you wanna go out with her?
that ain't a pretty picture in the morning, know what i mean?
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.

it seems her father, your grandfather wanted her to travel around europe like he did.
of course, he got to do it on uncle sam's nickel because he was also strafing german troop trains at the time.
if you don't tell him, soon he'll be married, then you'll hate yourself.

- oh, nina, call the florist and tell them no carnations.
i want those flowers that look like bird's heads with a stick stuck in its eye.
no, you know, you try to fit in with a group of people by pretending you're just like them.
you talk like them, you act like them until they think you're one of them.
because i'm an adult, and what dick did does not affect our friendship.
don and i are going to the rutherford renaissance fair tonight.
i mean, you know what i need and you tell me to go for it.
it's like... you're the best friend a gal like me could have.
rock and roll music preaches a gospel of easy sexuality and relaxed morality, and i will not endorse an enterprise which is as fraught with peril as i believe this one to be!
so, you resent us for being young and living in a world full of carnal possibilities which you can't possibly enjoy.
as a student of the ancient chinese art of feng shui,
i can assure you that the spiritual harmony of this room was upset by having that bitch sitting there.
how can i cut him out of the herd and bring him down?
why bother when you have a sick, hobbled wildebeest right in your own front yard?
because i'm an adult, and what dick did does not affect our friendship.
don and i are going to the rutherford renaissance fair tonight.
well, as far as i'm concerned, it's about impressing august, and one song ain't gonna cut it.
hey, man, if you're true to the music, women, they can sense it.
i mean, you know what i need and you tell me to go for it.
it's like... you're the best friend a gal like me could have.

of course, they were horrified, and it didn't help my social life at all.
oh, but for a while there it was nice having a sister.
all right, pull out your shirttails and lay face down on the sofa.
i can guarantee you within a minute you'll be feeling much better.
it goes on cool, but then it turns into a blowtorch.
well, i guess now we know who the real man in the family is, don't we?
knowing you, you'd beat yourself up worse than he would anyway.
i hope you remembered to tell him i was an expatriate.
well, yes, you may have treated this man unfairly, but think of all the people you've helped on your show.
well, just yesterday you reconciled that couple on the brink of divorce.
it's not enough that i've helped other people, i want to help this man.
i hope you do, because then you'll stop torturing the rest of us with all your--
well, i can't tell you how much fun this has been.
listen, now that you know the way, don't be a stranger, okay?
an argument can certainly be made that a lie is good when it spares someone unnecessary pain.
i'm reminded of maris' brief flirtation with active wear when i assured her,
well, apparently, she was driving him and two of his friends over to a junior mensa meeting.
she looked in the rear-view mirror and saw that they were making faces at the other cars.
i once told my school chums i was born with a tiny embryonic twin attached to my hip.
of course, they were horrified, and it didn't help my social life at all.
oh, but for a while there it was nice having a sister.
oh, remember in prep school when we were so desperate to avoid the president's physical fitness test...
this is the thanks i get for introducing you to my personal shopper.
i gave rinaldo instructions to write down every article of clothing i've purchased so we could avoid this sort of calamity.
oh, yes, i remember my brother niles once sat in your chair in the cafeteria.
as i recall, you put him on a tray and ran him through the dishwasher.
you know, dr crane, i've always believed life has a way of balancing itself out.
well, yes, you may have treated this man unfairly, but think of all the people you've helped on your show.
well, just yesterday you reconciled that couple on the brink of divorce.
today you helped molly from tacoma overcome her addiction to swedes.
clark and i have to get better about our scheduling, that's all.
well, maybe by the time you pull this off, i'll actually have a date.
how else would someone like him ever hope to lead any kind of normal life?
if that's true, i don't how you expect to find out what it is.
we need to test the pulse converter prototype before the real one goes up thursday, peters and i've just decided on the ideal target.
a high-profile astronaut doesn't just disappear 36 hours before a mission.
it makes it very difficult to get near the other astronauts.
if the disappearance of one lousy astronaut gets this much heat just think of the reaction when an entire state disappears.
when the world sees what the annihilator can do nations will beat their swords into plowshares.
and mankind will live in perfect, blessed brotherhood or i will blast the hell out of them.
after congress pulled the plug, honeybraun went belly-up and was sold off, piece by piece.
which means whoever got ahold of those blueprints was one of several buyers.
i mean, but the cards, the postcards, the letters, the charity functions they do serve a purpose.
i see so much of the bad in people crime and violence.
but to see the good things, it sort of recharges my spirit.
just like the sun recharges superman's powers well, these small things, they sort of recharge me.
when superman sees what we're about, world peace for right-thinking people he'll gladly help us.
he'll fly directly to that satellite and install the pulse converter for us.
these are all the records of where every single piece of honeybraun industries ended up after liquidation.
so somewhere in this mess is the name of the person we're looking for.
she's not calling for me, or maybe she's not able to.
or maybe she's being held somewhere where you couldn't hear her calling you.
but once that shuttle reaches the platform, all deals are off.
i've instructed my man to do away with lois lane and that girl if it gets there before you do.
well, that was one of the more interesting birthdays i've had.
i'm sorry, clark, i really tried to pull off a party for you.
jury nullification basically means telling the jury to acquit, even though the defendant is guilty.
lawyers aren't technically allowed to make this argument but they invariably find a way to do it anyway.
he'll be saying, "hey, whatever the law says you can't put gerald braun in jail."
it can be effective with sympathetic defendants and the prosecution knows this.
then he took, like, two steps pointed the gun again and shot him in the head, and that was it.
did you have opportunity to observe the demeanor of the defendant, sir?
the bullet entered the temporal lobe just above the eye socket causing a pressure explosion of the upper brain and skull.
do you have a medical opinion as to how long it took ronald martin to die?
from the time of the first wound, probably about 30 to 40 seconds.
do you have an opinion as to whether the victim suffered?
the defense wants to prove heat of passion but this is where it gets tricky.
normally, heat of passion means a flash of rage or that the defendant somehow lost control.
but here, we have eyewitness accounts as to how calm dr. braun was.
the defense is basically arguing that the passion here is moral passion.
this is gonna sound a little bit out there, but just the same, we...
you know, david and melanie, maybe it would be best for you two to wait outside at first and i'll call you back in later, okay?
genesis: "whoever sheds the blood of a man by man shall his blood be shed."
then according to exodus and genesis should you now be put to death?
when god confronted cain after the murder of abel he didn't forgive him.
he shouted out to him, "your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground."
you had to know he was considering to go out and shoot ronald martin.
you may not have thought he was going to, but you knew there was a possibility, danny.
we bury him as we found him, to provoke in people fury and the desire to avenge.
donna braun was buried in the clothes she was strangled in.
it becomes easy to see why gerald braun was so impassioned to believe he was right.
he went to his own rabbi who compounded this passion by saying it was more moral for ronald martin to be dead than free.
and the mixture of this religious influence and his own rage and religious pain, he marched toward ronald martin with a loaded gun in his hand.
and with each step, as he got closer and closer to the man who choked the life out of his only daughter he waited for the impulse to tell him, "stop!"
but there's no doubt, ladies and gentlemen of the jury today he's now in yours.
i ask not that you abandon your compassion for this man.
and when he champions revenge murder as being in keeping with judaism he offends me as a rabbi.
and when he claims that what he did was moral he offends morality itself.
- with all due respect to my bias this isn't unprecedented.
these kinds of marriages have been recommended before with minors when the sex is consensual, both partners are committed to marriage and the father is the only real means of financial support.
something tells me i'm gonna wake up tomorrow feeling sick about this.
but for now, i'm going to accept ms. mcguire's recommendation conditioned on marriage counseling to begin immediately.
but she's 14 having a baby and planning to get married.
yeah, but she's a girl who's listening to some voice inside telling her what she thinks is right.
in your defense, i suppose black and white makes us all look a bit like moe howard.
well, it gets me ticked off every time i see the damn thing... and there is not a word of truth in it.
mr. shore is asking that you impose prior restraint on speech.
and not just any speech, but the robust dialogue of a political contest.
what if they ran a campaign commercial with footage of this young woman here showering?
footage secretly taken with a lipstick camera mounted in her health club locker room.
but please understand... ordinarily, i place great value on all things explicit.
is it your feeling that denny crane will protect you from me?
it is... to the extent that he recalls who i am.
well, perhaps it will jog his memory... when i devote a large portion of next month's senior partners meeting... to a discussion of your situation here.
i went to spend the weekend at my sister's, and there was a guy there... this houseguest of hers.
we were all drinking wine, and suddenly, he and i were alone.
- and all night long... the rooms are flooded with the glow of that neon.
and i always wondered how you would look naked... in all that pink... green and orange.
she, of course, smiling at all times exactly like pat nixon.
and in return, after the divorce... she gets a meaningful role in every high-level appointment... and major policy initiative during your first term.
and at other times, often obnoxious... this refusal of mayor snyder to agree to debate his challenger...
of course, there was onejoint campaign appearance... the candidates sharing the same stage at one point several weeks ago... when the snyder camp called a debate...
the thomas snyder era is coming to an end... and boston's new mayor will bejack fleming.
stan forrester is standing by at the fleming victory party at the hyatt... where a very happy crowd is waiting for the mayor-elect... and his wife to make their way down to the ballroom.
that an attorney like denny crane... with extensive class action experience... could easily turn mr. shrum's case into a lucrative opportunity.
on the other hand, if they were to give denny crane their ongoing legal business... augmenting the fine work done by the in-house counsel... then denny crane would be unavailable to represent mr. shrum... who incidentally is going to receive $50,000... from the company as a goodwill gesture.
i was hungry for knowledge, doing groundbreaking research in chastity belt metallurgy, lingerie tensile strength and the legal difference between search-and-seizure and just plain fondling.
lauren ridiculed my theories, but i told her to just wait.
for we have come to the moment when i watch your leathery face fall further, as i tell you that i-
- duckman-- am here to pick up my lifetime achievement award.
besides, we're here tonight not to bury you, but to praise me.
i hope this doesn't sound grandiose, but tonight, i begin my preordained ascent toward the global adulation i so richly deserve.
dad, we're still glad we could share this trip with you.
that's the worst part-- being humiliated in front of my sons.
i've worked hard to prepare you boys for a lifetime of broken promises and dashed expectations, but this is different.
i just hope this doesn't affect you permanently-- that you can gather yourselves together and somehow get past this trauma.
it even makes a soothing little whirlpool when you pull the lever.
duckman, it says here in the convention itinerary that there'll be a best detective contest tomorrow morning.
ladies and gentlemen, it appears that we have a devious kidnapping on our hands.
in times like this, we need the greatest crime-solving mind of our age.
i had for myself, so i must have over-compensated, turned it to hate.
but when i saw you in that bathroom, looking so lost and hurt, i knew it wasn't hate.
more than likely, but for me to be interested in a woman, my only requirement is that she have legs and a pulse and i even waived those in new orleans last year.
i think a few dates with you should finally rid me of any unresolved romantic feelings.
church leaders blame the rise of hate crimes and racially-motivated attacks on a militia-like group calling themselves "the holnists."
one of the most radical and powerful of these groups claims as its founder, the famed motivational speaker nathan holn.
the last of the great cities died when my father was a child victims of yet another war.
he told of the plagues that followed and how the living hid themselves, scattered in tiny hamlets in hopes of surviving whatever new madness conspired to rob them of the little that remained.
and how they watched the sky for 16 long years praying for the great lungs to start working again.
he said it was as if the ocean had breathed a great sigh of relief.
things go okay until the woman shows, then it can be difficult.
but you'll only be around once in a while with the mail.
do not try to sell me on any restored united states!
the new capital is based in minneapolis inside the hubert humphrey metrodome.
but the fact is that you're in no position to negotiate.
these people made it through the bugs and the riots and the 3-year winters, but they're not going to survive you.
do you say hi, or do you blow their heads off?
do they want to share what they got or take what you have?
i officially declare postal station number 10 in elvis, oregon open for business.
from now on you got to get your mail down there, okay?
they're dying because of bethlehem because this is a shitty world!
if we're going to change it then someone might have to die.
it is my duty to hereby disband the postal service of the restored united states.
you are to burn your uniforms and the postman is to return to minneapolis at once.
"once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more or close the wall with our dead!
in peace, nothing so becomes a man as modesty and humility.
he saw that ordinary men could reach deep within themselves and find courage.
he saw that if we began to communicate as a nation we could become strong again united.

now that we understand each other, i know we'll get along fine.
there are a lot of things i'll want to teach you - how to draw harold's bath, how to make some of his favorite dishes...
far too many for you to appreciate her little prank, i'm sure.
may i ask if that's your car out front, the datsun with the dents in the side?
for obvious reasons, the name, phone number and location of the shelter are kept confidential.
we put emily's mom in touch with a psychiatrist for post-traumatic stress disorder.
unfortunately, the hmo, "well benefits" posted jackie's information, including the name and address of her psychiatrist on their web site.
emily's father found jackie's psychiatrist via the "well benefits" web site and tracked her down at the psychiatrist's office.
the good was we just made a strong opening impression with the jury.
the bad was you just had to listen to testimony of how your father killed your mother.
could it be the new lexus you ordered online from a broker has been delayed?
gosh, i hope you're not forced to keep driving that sedan with the dent in it from your recent fender bender.
you're in the business of ensuring the health and well-being of your clientele.
and yet, you weren't able to ensure the safety of their records, which you could have done had you spent just a fraction of those billions on internet security.
mr. shore, as we all know, health care costs have spun out of control.
information technology is the single largest cost for us and for all other fortune 1000 companies.
it will save us a lot of money, time and grief.
but i want you to know that we will aggressively fight to keep you from exercising any control over denny or the firm.
i'm willing to roll up my sleeves and work with you on this.
maybe we can set up a little office for me at the firm.
so you made this insane offer, put the firm at risk for nothing?
when this gets back to denny, and it will, he is going to blow sky high.
and they'll have the jury convinced it's a misdirected and therefore frivolous lawsuit, and that's how we'll lose.
i suspect the most difficult thing one could ask of you is trust, but that's exactly what i'm asking for now, emily.
i wish i could get you to come to the shelter.
so many of the women there desperately need legal advice, someone who will speak to them openly and honestly.
well benefits could not reasonably foresee this killing and did nothing to encourage it.
they were in compliance with all state and federal regulations regarding internet security.
and the little metal clasp on it was simply no match for the paper clip and the screwdriver.
i was eventually caught, prompting my sister to have a lock installed in her door.
the only consequence of the invasion of my sister's privacy was the temporary loss of her confidence and trust.
the invasion of jackie hayden's privacy led to her being stabbed and left to bleed to death in the street.
privacy and the safety and security that that word has always implied has, with time and technology, become an illusion.
the national security agency has access to all our e-mail the world over with its echelon system.
virtually every web site you visit installs a delicious cookie onto your computer, which is in fact a spy to track your every move.
there are predators out in cyberspace collecting data on your children while they innocently type away in chat rooms.
let me tell you what jackie hayden could not foresee, that after years of cruel and violent debasement at the hands of her husband, after she finally found her way out of the shadows, she didn't foresee that the people she most trusted
with her health and well-being would lead the darkness right back to her door, and now she's dead.
we the jury find in favor of the plaintiff and award compensatory damages in the amount of $950,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $2 million.

i would call her a sad and lonely old woman, a woman who spent many years living in solitude with nothing to occupy her wit and intellect.
then one day, she became my assistant, and suddenly she was in an environment equal to the task of entertaining and stimulating her magnificent mind.
you don't get to set all the rules in this relationship.
your whole life, you have used money to set the rules, and now you're using your illness.
i just have so much respect for people in your line of work.
it's just hours of boredom interrupted by moments of unbelievable horror.
it's just that i've been out of the loop for a while.
well, most of the women i talk to are in handcuffs.
you can't assume that she wants a kiss, so this is what i do.
when the moment arrives, you kind of lean in a little.
once you reach a certain point, you got to go in, you're committed.
then, if she's not expecting a kiss, you got to whisper something in her ear.

now, listen, unless you want me to make a movie about a couple of grips sitting around, jerking' off and eating crullers, you get that script down here pronto!
and you, marcel marceau, i don't need some fucking coffee shop mime throwing attitude at me like it's fucking rice at a wedding.
now, you get me that cappuccino now or i'll blow that fuckin' bonnet-wearing head of yours right off.
you're just a guy in a bad bald cap and my hair's a black and stringy white-trash mix.
we were well on our way to becoming the most infamous homicidical maniacs this country's ever seen.
the nicky and vallory of old are about to weave their most intoxicating spell over all of america.
once we doublecross monticello and, um... win this match, we'll have enough money to stage the most violent and memorable comeback in serial-killing history.
now, all this money might seem unfair, but if it's any consolation to you, i just took it up the butt myself.
couple of whacked-out wrestlers doublecrossed me and made off with a very valuable briefcase.
all i know is mimi sends tony out for some chimichangas, right?
the next thing you know, he's packed tighter than a japanese subway at rush hour!
get the fuck outta my way before i take your fuckin' ear.
well, i tell ya, you know, i had this tuna fish salad sandwich up my ass for two years.
monticello doesn't leave for the bank until around 2:00, so at 1:30, this should give us plenty of time.
i'm gonna smack him in the head with this, you're gonna grab the cash and hide it in this.
now drop the gun, mr buffalo bill, before i blast you and calamity jane here so far into next week, you'll have to time-travel just to take a dump.
coming into my store and waving your big gun around like you were walking past the white house.
i'm not gonna see the light - the tunnel, the light.
i'm gonna go right past the light and go straight to hell!
what i'm saying is mimi's moustache is between mimi and monticello.
mm-hm - now, let's just suppose you and this mimi go out to a fancy restaurant.
some over-caffeinated patron of this fine dining establishment has located our briefcase for us.
hand over the briefcase, java girl, before we decide to decaffeinate you.
i work like a slave all day long... to make enough money for you.
why do we need so much money, when we've never been so distant?
it's believed that he's being held in the outskirts of madrid.
a week after his disappearance... the police still have no clues as to his whereabouts.
i'd like everyone to know that we're doing everything we can... to find david uriarte and return him to his family.
do they agree with the police's decisión... to intercept any ransom payment?
rent a blue 106 and go to the cableway parking lot.
leave a bag with the money in the trunk and leave it open.
there's no doubt that david uriarte's release is the day's big news.
just a few hours ago, his mother... took him to the clinical hospital... where he underwent a thorough medical checkup.
a hospital spokesperson said his state of health... was absolutely satisfactory.
while questions remain about the details of his release... it seems he was drugged and abandoned by his captors... at a highway rest area on the a-6, close to madrid.
the trucker who found him there... proceeded to inform the authorities.
it's still unknown whether his family... paid a ransom for his rescue.
physically stronger than human beings with keener senses and two hearts... these alien newcomers have joined the american workforce.
the tenctonese have been accepted by many, but feared and hated... by so-called human purists... now incensed by the newcomers ' right to vote and run for public office.
are you going to ask senator silverthorne if he's concerned... that human police corruption in the riviera heights narcotics case... or civil rights violations by human officers in the bradley case... are going to hurt his chances to widen the gap?
the truth is, malfeasance by any sworn officer is bad... whether they be newcomer or human.
while details are still sketchy, sources have told knrg news... that the assassin was a newcomer policewoman.
authorities have only confirmed that two detectives guarding carter are also dead.
he's so committed to what he does, i never wanted to burden him.
but now i'm worried that because of what i said, he might just-
your mother is a very brave woman... not unlike anyone who loves someone who wears a badge.
she's doing what her hearts tell her- trying to protect you.
we've got a bomber sitting with the girls' varsity volleyball team.
he's got about 50 sticks of what looks like commercial grade dynamite strapped to him.
and this len guini guy is just a loony somebody hired.
this is everything the bureau of newcomer affairs had on udara.
now, most of the craft in this range are all cash, mr. duncan.
and your present boat won't bring too much in its current condition.
he may have been udara on the ship, george... but that cause is long gone.
both tina and leonard, not a hint of a criminal background, no apparent motive.
george, you ever hear the expression "there's a price at which everything moves"?
somebody offered these guys a number they couldn't say no to.
this is the physical education building at hesiod university... where the newcomer held the college's volleyball team hostage... while wearing what police described as at least 10 pounds of dynamite.
now, authorities have still not disclosed how much money... may have been extorted from anxious parents- but reliables sources indicate it may be in the millions-
you had good reasons for what you thought you had to do.
i feel differently, but i don't want this to spoil what we have.
then they were given a phrase... that would initiate their mission.
if they returned, all memory of udara, of what they had done... would be wiped out by a termination phrase.
the udara needed young people- children- so we would be ready to fight for generations.
george, you have to understand what it was like for me.
we get the b. n. a. computers to spit out form letters to each one- some big increase in the benefits package.
but they gotta come in for an information meeting, a qualification check.
and despite the polls that show the majority of citizens in the united states... feel that gun legislation, as it stands, is basically ineffective-
senator silverthorne, would you like to be the first to respond?
why is it that people we don't want to have guns... always seem to get them, no matter how many laws or bans we pass?
now, why make it harder... for decent, honest, hardworking americans... to protect themselves from the armed marauder, the thief, the rapist?
you're also under arrest for murder, conspiracy to commit murder, extortion.
should you so desire and cannot afford one... an attorney will be appointed to you without charge before questioning.
do you understand these rights as i have told them to you?
all six networks have already projected paul bearer as the winner... in a race which became a non-contest... after senator silverthorne's arrest on felony, murder, kidnapping and other charges.

it's this dumb thing ross made up to fool our parents.
it's a way of giving the finger without actually giving it.
all i'm gonna say is, finally, it's nice to be in a mature relationship.
you know, the world would be such a better place if that actually was all you were gonna say.

i'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep.
i blocked the adult channels for the other babysitters, but the code is four, three--
what do you say i go over there and tell her how much i like her?
i can tell her how much i've been thinking of her.
gunther, be a good little boy and bring me a whiskey.
at 2:30 a.m., i didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
i could write about the time my hair did that whoo-hoo thing.
it was the first time i realized i was cooler than my big brother.
i'm going to go get ready for my date tonight so i'll just "head."
i have been trying to go out with this guy for a month.
i'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep.
you should just go home, get in bed, and stay there.
but i'm unemployed, my music is all i really have now.
jeez, at 2:30 in the morning, i didn't expect to have to fight over the remote.
i'm sorry, it's just this ernie cofax thing on in a few minutes i wanted to watch.
so, i need to write some depressing stuff to go along with my new floozy voice, but nothing that sad has ever really happened to me.
oh umm, how about your mom dying, or having to live on the streets when you were 14?
it's so nice to finally be in a fun relationship, y'know?
there's nothing boring about him, and ah, i bet he's never set foot in a museum.
well maybe he'll get to go soon, like on a class trip or something.
y'know what else is really great about him, oh, what is the word for the adult that doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?
`cause it was the first time that i realized that i was actually cooler than my big brother.
well, i'm gonna go get ready, for my date tonight, so ah, i'll just head.
- oh, i don't mean to be a square, but i'd really appreciate it if you wait and drink your wine after the kids are asleep?
oh uh, thanks for this, i hope i can do the same for you sometime.
here, now i don't eat chicken, so it's just noodle soup.
and there's no chicken in the broth either, so it's really just... noodle water.
okay, what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her?
no-no it'll be good, i can tell her much i've been thinking about her.
that i haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her.
that i'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!
yeah, that's one of the things i love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive.
so uhh, i guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?

the kids are gonna play together, and then when they're asleep...
i'm thinking amanda and i break open a bottle of wine... do a little playing ourselves.
it was the first time i realized i was cooler than my big brother.
i'm going to go get ready... for my date tonight... so i'll just "head."
i have been trying to go out with... this guy for a month.
i'd really appreciate it if you'd wait and drink your wine... after the kids are asleep.
i'm so over the top, want-to-slit-my-own-throat... in love with her that for every minute...
i can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!

no matter what the us attorney asks, what is your response?
i assert my right against self-incrimination as guaranteed under the fifth amendment.
but since the sentencing commission isn't interested in what judges think,
i'm obligated to hand down the sentence in accordance with guidelines.
for this defendant, a level-13 offence carries a maximum of 18 months.
mitch roland, you are sentenced to serve 18 months in prison.
according to her, she's up for the parent of the year.
she has no idea why her daughter had 26 imprints of a belt buckle on her body.
you want me to invite mr henson down to police headquarters?
yeah, we'll interview both thomson and henson and play 'em off each other.
you want to get in your own way, you're gonna lose this case.
you jump on lynette thomson and she'll call for a lawyer.
even if she wasn't directly responsible, she'd know, and she let it happen.
so let's just soft-pedal the mother into giving up the boyfriend.
i'm gonna get brought up on charges for failing to report the graft.
if i manage to keep my badge after that, i gotta walk back in this building.
"please, make it stop." but you see, you didn't hear her.
you didn't listen to her begging for you to stop and to let her be heard and to let her alone, right?
and she... and she shut right up... then she... she laid there quiet.
but then... but then i got scared, cos i began to realise that i...
he hit her with the belt, then she fell on the floor and then he...
she was laying on the floor and she couldn't get up.
i went to wake her up for school the next day and she wasn't breathing'.
i got a mirror from the bathroom and i held it to her mouth.
how much being a cop meant to you, how you were willing to give that up.
i've never understood why a good cop can't just tell the truth about a bad one, but, again, i'm a lawyer, not a fraternal brother.
and he just... he stared at me and he asked me why i was lying.
and he was my father, and he was supposed to protect me, but he didn't, frank!
damn, it would have been fine not having to grow up at your place.
to be rid of your fish fingers and your bloody vodka bottles and your disgusting, hairy men who ogled us as soon as we moved!
you're lying to me now, and i don't want to hear any more lies.
no one in this world is going to lie to me anymore.
this week we've been showing you how to turn the dead space in your house into living space.
today's challenge is how to turn the dead space between al's ears into a nice bric-a-brac room.
the dead space between your ears could fill the mall of america.
today, we'll be installing a sliding pocket door in al's bathroom.
next, we'll try to convert some poor sap into al's first house guest.
and then we'll convert that stuff on your face into an actual beard.
in the spare room above the header in the kitchen, we have a home entertainment system.
with this set up, my guests can now watch tv in bed.
i don't know which i'll get first, my diploma or menopause.
i have three sons, each of whom is the center of his own universe.
i'm running a house, going to school and leading my own counseling groups,
i'm having some people over for dinner and i have no idea what to make them.
a mistake i'm very sorry for and will obviously never hear the end of.
but, patty and doug are coming over for dinner and i need your help.
well, your needs are obviously so much more important than mine, if it makes you feel better, do it.
i wouldn't pick up a hammer if you got down and begged me.
you know, he was a man that needed to work with his hands.
when he was home at monticello, he'd lose himself building his house, tending his garden, and it was while doing these simple hands-on tasks, that jefferson saw his life more clearly.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
yesterday, a marine expeditionary unit sent a recon team into haiti.
well, i doubt they sent two jag officers 1200 miles to mete out credit.
by "take the heat," are you saying you disobeyed a direct order, sir?
yet i can't help but feel that the marines that were captured and tortured would not share your concern.
our men's welfare weighed heavily on our decision not to go in.
oh, i think you would have managed just fine without me.
you have a killer instinct, which i've never really appreciated until now.
with all due respect, sir, we haven't submitted our final report.
not that i have to explain myself to you, major, but secnav is very interested in this case.
bud, i need you to research wilful-disobedience cases, particularly in combat situations.
commander, excuse me, but if this is pertaining to the farrow court-martial,
they are killing our men one by one and dragging their bodies through the streets.
if we don't go now, there won't be anyone left to rescue.
react quickly and effectively, with the welfare of his troops uppermost in his mind.
admiral colter, did you order colonel farrow to hold execution of operation manta ray?
the speed's just right, only i think we need to talk about a few things before...
bud, i'm not asking for more than right now, if that's what's worrying you.
they want the world to know they're freedom fighters, opposing a tyrannical government which you blokes support.
so you say a rebel guerrilla used this child as a shield?
john, this country can't afford to throw away men like you.
for the sake of the service, you gotta stay and fight.
and if i did nothing, how would i ever lead again?
capable officers are leaving the military every day because our leaders put their political self-interest above what's right.
i don't give a damn whether you think he's a hero or hitler.
i want you to go at him with everything you got, and then i want you to go out and get him more.
your honour, this woman has suffered immeasurable loss due to a united states military action.
it seems to me the least we can do is hear her story.
your honour, i intend to establish a causal relationship between colonel farrow's action and the death of this woman's son.
the identity of the shooter is a crucial link in that chain.
your honour, this issue here is, was colonel farrow justified in sending in his men based on the information he had at that time?
i'm afraid your chain's going to have a missing link, commander.
- i called him at nine this morning, which was seven o'clock at night cairo time.
is that pertinent or are you dazzling me with your command of time zones?
luckily she flies to zürich twice a year to have it reset.
babies are wonderful, but roz does have a rough road ahead of her.
why don't i get a feather duster and a french maid's uniform?
that would teach them, wouldn't it, daphne, and i would pick it out for you.
we just went out for a couple of weeks, and then it was over.
it's embarrassing, though, him being seven years younger than i am.
go to the men's room and rinse it with cold water.
i'm glad i worked all those extra shifts to put you through medical school.
a university education is an admirable thing, of course... so long as you remember that nothing worth knowing can ever be taught... least of all at cambridge.
but you told me... in ancient greece the older men taught the younger.
yes, well, greek love-- platonic love-- is the highest form of affection known to man, of course.
you also told me... that the greeks put statues of apollo in the bride's chamber... so she would have beautiful sons.
i feel... like a city that's been... under siege for 20 years.
suddenly the gates are thrown open... and the citizens come pouring out... to breathe the air and walk the fields... and pluck the wildflowers.
whereas this giant, the one whose garden it was... he'd been away for seven years, staying with an ogre in cornwall.
"and after seven years, when he'd said all he had to say... because his conversation was very limited... he decided to return home to his own castle.
'and i won't allow anyone to play in it except myself.'
so he built a high wall all around... put up a large notice board on which was written, in capital letters:
the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play... and your appreciation has been most intelligent.
i congratulate you on the great success of your performance... which persuades me that you think almost as highly of this play... as i do myself.
i wish you'd draw some blood down in oxford... though you'd need a miracle.
all the dons at my college have dust in their veins.
they tried to play on the road... but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.
they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over... and talk about the beautiful garden inside.
what's tiresome is he's threatened to show my letters to my father.
who will show them to all his friends for the excellence of their style.
thy body is white like the snows that lie on the mountains... like the snows that lie on the mountains ofjudea... and come down into the valleys.
the roses in the garden of the queen of arabia... are not so white as thy body. "
he knew perfectly well the lord chamberlain would never allow... a play with biblical characters.
oscar doesn't think there should be censorship of plays at all.
"then the spring came... only in the garden of the selfish giant it was still winter.
the birds did not care to sing in it, as there were no children.
the thing about renters is you don't have to consider their feelings.
but if someone is willing to give one pleasure, one should show gratitude.
he must do as his nature dictates... as i only wish i had done.
"'i do believe the spring has come at last,' said the giant.
through a little hole in the wall... the children had crept back into the garden and were sitting... on the branches of the trees.
and every tree that he could see, there was a little child.
and the birds were twittering and singing above them with delight.
and the flowers were looking up through the grass and laughing.
bosie, dear... you have beauty, you have breeding... and, most glorious of all, you have youth.
but you are very fantastical if you think that pleasures... don't have to be earned and paid for.
i'm delighted, of course, that you find my lines funny... but please don't try and make the audience laugh with them.
they should sound completely spontaneous and natural... as though people spoke like that all the time.
and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently by the hand... and put him up into the tree.
and the tree broke at once into blossom... and the birds came and sang on it, and the little boy... stretched out his two arms... and flung them round the giant's neck... and kissed him. "
i've never heard such bad luck as yours with the grand national.
bosie tells me that you would have won... but that your cousin wouldn't let you ride the horse?
the church of england only has respectable people... who believe in respectability.
you get to be a bishop not by what you believe but by what you don't.
you will cease to see wilde, or i'll cut you off without a penny.
as though i wanted your money... what little you have left from your tarts.
it's so much more convenient for oscar living in the west end... when he has a play coming on.
i'm like a northern businessman keeping an eye on his factory.
i could take the boys to the dentist on thursday on their way back to school.
but the whole point of them having dentistry now... is so they can stuff themselves with sweets for a week before we lose them.
you can't be too kind about someone who's been so hurt.
yet if i go on trying to come between bosie and his father... that'll destroy me.
we've got to stop him, oscar... before he drives my whole family to suicide.
i promise you, i won't let him hurt you ever again.
i suppose you've come to apologize for the lies you've been spreading about me?
i've come to tell you to leave my son alone, you sodomite.
i wonder, and the fact that she's seeking divorce for non-consummation?
unless you swear that you'll have nothing more to do with bosie...
your treatment of your wives... your neglect of your children... and, above all, the depraved insistence... that they be as tyrannical and unloving as you are yourself.
arthur, this is the marquis of queensberry... the most infamous brute and the least tender father in london.
robbie... you're a dear boy, but i can't even think of leaving the country.
as a matter of fact, i can't even leave this hotel.
the point is, queensberry's already caused the death of one of his sons.
if i don't try and stop him now, whom will he harm next?
in writing a book or a play, i'm concerned entirely with literature-- with art-
- i do not aim at doing good or evil... but at making a thing that will have some quality of beauty.
so, do i understand that... even a boy you might pick up in the street would be a pleasing companion?
i would talk to a street arab with pleasure if he would talk to me.
my information is that the crown wishes to pursue the matter.
in which case, an arrest and a charge of gross indecency... are certain to follow.
then what is the love that dare not speak its name?
the love that dare not speak its name... in this century... is such a great affection... of an elder for a younger man... as there was between david and jonathan... such as plato made the very basis of his philosophy... and such as you may find in the sonnets of michelangelo... and shakespeare.
it is, in this century, misunderstood-- so much misunderstood that it may be described as... the love that dare not speak its name.
and, on account of it, i am placed where i am now.
the world mocks at it... and sometimes puts one in the pillory for it.
the crime of which you have been convicted... is so bad... that i shall pass the severest sentence... that the law will allow.
but so long as i think he is thinking of me-- my sweet rose, my delicate flower, my lily of lilies-- it is in prison that i shall test the power of love.
i shall see if i can't make the bitter waters sweet... by the intensity of the love i bear you.
"years went over, and the giant grew very old and very feeble.
he couldn't play about anymore, so he sat in a huge armchair... and watched the children at their games and admired his garden.
"the giant hastened across the grass and came near to the child.
and when he came quite close, his face grew red with anger.
for on the palms of the child's hands were the prints of two nails.
and the prints of two nails were on his little feet.
i think it will come as a shock to bosie to realize... that even he is relatively unimportant in the scheme of things.
but, no doubt, bosie will be remembered as long as oscar... unfortunately.
it's a letter to bosie telling him... how i love him but can never see him again.
i'm going to ask robbie to have it copied out before i send it.
the coward does it with a kiss... the brave man with a sword.
some kill their love when they are young... and some when they are old.
some strangle with the hands of lust... some with the hands of gold.
the kindest use a knife... because the dead so soon grow cold. "
greek love, platonic love, is the highest form of affection known to man, of course.
you also told me the greeks put statues of apollo in the bride's chamber so she would have beautiful sons.
i feel... like a city that's been... under siege for 20 years.
suddenly the gates are thrown open and... the citizens come pouring out.
whereas the giant whose garden it was, had been staying for seven years with an ogre in cornwall.
after seven years, when he'd said all he had to say because his conversation was very limited, he decided to return home to his own castle.
what's tiresome is, he's threatening to show my letters to my father.
who will show them to all his friends, for the excellence of their style.
through a little hole in the wall, the children had crept back into the garden and were sitting on the branches of the trees.
in every tree that he could see, there was a little child.
but you are very fantastical if you don't think that pleasures have to be earned and paid for.
whenever i want to do anything, you say you can't afford it.
the little boy did not run away for his eyes were so full of tears that he did not see the giant coming.
and the giant stole up behind him and took him gently by the hand and put him up into the tree.
bosie has told me so much about your exploits on the race track.
i've never heard such bad luck as yours with the grand national.
the church of england only has respectable people who believe in respectability.
you get to be a bishop not by what you believe, but by what you don't.
so much more convenient for oscar living in the west end when he has a play coming on.
i'm like one of those northern businessmen who has to keep an eye on his factory.
i could take the boys to the dentist on thursday on their way back to school.
the whole point of dentistry now is so they can stuff themselves with sweets for a week before we lose them.
you like me, you lust after me, you go about with me because i've got a title, that's all.
you like to write about dukes and duchesses but you know nothing about them.
i suppose you've come to apologise for the lies you've been spreading about me.
i've come to tell you to leave my son alone, you sodomite!
your... your treatment of your wives, your neglect of your children.
and above all, the... the depraved insistence that they be as tyrannical and unloving as you are yourself!
i knew from the first you could've had no other name.
gwendolen, it's a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life, he has been speaking nothing but the truth.
if you take queensberry to court, all hell will break loose.
all my life, i've fought against the english vice - hypocrisy.
my information is that the crown wishes to pursue the matter.
in which case, an arrest and a charge of gross indecency are certain to follow.
my dear constance, the name of wilde will be a word of execration for the next thousand years.
you can't let your boys grow up with people knowing who they are.
in this century... is such a great affection of an elder...
for a younger man as there was between david and jonathan.
oscar wilde, the crime of which you have been convicted is so bad... that i shall pass the severest sentence that the law will allow.
in my judgement, it is totally inadequate for such a case as this.
but so long as i think he is thinking of me - my sweet rose, my delicate flower, my lily of lilies - it is in prison that i shall test the power of love.
i shall see if i can't make the bitter waters sweet by the intensity of the love i bear you.
years went over, and the giant grew very old and very feeble.
he couldn't play about any more so he sat in a huge armchair and watched the children at their games and admired his garden.
the giant hastened across the grass and came near to the child.
when he came quite close, his face grew red with anger.
it's a letter to bosie, telling him how i love him but can never see him again.
i'm going to ask robbie to have it copied out before i send it.
with each other, it's true they could be a little brusque.
they hanged two men in the theater one night before i gave a lecture.
i'm to go into parliament, we're to have a nice house... and live a proper, settled life...
literature, lectures... the house of commons, receptions for the world in general at 5:00.
well, that was the idea, but it doesn't seem to be working.
i've lived here since i was three, and you see the pitiful result.
platonic love... is the highest form of affection known to man, of course.
you also told me... that the greeks put statues of apollo in the bride's chamber... so she would have beautiful sons.
i feel... like a city that's been... under siege for 20 years.
suddenly the gates are thrown open... and the citizens come pouring out... to breathe the air and walk the fields... and pluck the wildflowers.
whereas this giant, the one whose garden it was... he'd been away for seven years, staying with an ogre in cornwall.
"and after seven years, when he'd said all he had to say... because his conversation was very limited... he decided to return home to his own castle.
'and i won't allow anyone to play in it except myself.'
so he built a high wall all around... put up a large notice board on which was written, in capital letters:
the actors have given us a charming rendering of a delightful play... and your appreciation has been most intelligent.
i congratulate you on the great success of your performance... which persuades me that you think almost as highly of this play... as i do myself.
i wish you'd draw some blood down in oxford... though you'd need a miracle.
all the dons at my college have dust in their veins.
they tried to play on the road... but the road was very dusty and full of hard stones, and they did not like it.
they used to wander round the high wall when their lessons were over... and talk about the beautiful garden inside.
what's tiresome is he's threatened to show my letters to my father.
who will show them to all his friends for the excellence of their style.
and bosie's father, lord queensberry... he's a dreadful man, constance... eoesn't believe in god or marriage.
a marquis should set a proper example... or what are the upper classes for?
after vyvyan was born, all i could think of was the children.
so that's why oscar spends so much time with his men friends.
"'i do believe the spring has come at last,' said the giant.
he jumped out of bed, and looked out of the window."
and the flowers were looking up through the grass and laughing.
oscar, it's time the boys changed, or we'll miss the train.
but you are very fantastical if you think that pleasures... don't have to be earned and paid for.
whenever i want to do anything, you say you can't afford it... but you give all those renters cigarette cases.
"but in the farthest corner of the garden... it was still winter, and in it was standing a little boy.
he was so small, he could not reach up to the branches of the tree.
do you really think your own son could love someone evil?
i just wish i could love oscar as loyally, devotedly... unselfishly and purely as he loves me.
i will put that little boy on top of the tree... and i will knock down the wall, and my garden shall be... the children's playground forever and ever. '
he was really very sorry for what he had done. "
how do you know what he's like when you've never met him?
you're not a man to be influenced by other people's opinions.
bosie has told me so much about your exploits on the racetrack.
i've never heard such bad luck as yours with the grand national.
you wasted time at oxford pretending you were going into the foreign office.
thank god you didn't when thatjew queer roseberry... can become foreign secretary and bugger all the juniors, including your brother.
it's so much more convenient for oscar living in the west end... when he has a play coming on.
i'm like a northern businessman keeping an eye on his factory.
i could take the boys to the dentist on thursday on their way back to school.
but the whole point of them having dentistry now... is so they can stuff themselves with sweets for a week before we lose them.
you can't be too kind about someone who's been so hurt.
yet if i go on trying to come between bosie and his father... that'll destroy me.
queensberry thinks bosie and i are locked in nightly embrace... and in reality, we've been the purest model of greek love since...
bosie doesn't like doing it with me, but i've loved him.
he says it's a judgment on roseberry and my mother... and me and you.
we've got to stop him, oscar... before he drives my whole family to suicide.
you're not frightened of what this little man thinks, are you?
i think the pleasures of the evening should be resumed elsewhere.
i've never received so large a sum... for a prose work of that length in all my life.
tell him i'm delighted that someone in england values my work so highly.
i don't allow people to talk to me like that in my house, lord queensberry... or anywhere else.
i suppose you've come to apologize for the lies you've been spreading about me?
i've come to tell you to leave my son alone, you sodomite.
the marquis appears to be very obsessed with other people's sexual activities.
your treatment of your wives... your neglect of your children... and, above all, the depraved insistence... that they be as tyrannical and unloving as you are yourself.
arthur, this is the marquis of queensberry... the most infamous brute and the least tender father in london.
we shall need all the money we can get for the libel case.
my father can't go on making all our lives a torment like this.
the point is, queensberry's already caused the death of one of his sons.
if i don't try and stop him now, whom will he harm next?
no doubt he will perform his task with all the bitterness of an old friend.
in writing a book or a play, i'm concerned entirely with literature... with art...
"if one tells the truth, one is sure, sooner or later, to be found out."
that is a pleasing paradox, but i do not set store by it as an axiom.
i think that the realization of one's self is the prime aim of life... and that to realize through pleasure is finer than to do so through pain.
i am, on this point, entirely on the side of the ancients, the greeks.
did you know mr. taylor kept ladies' dresses in his rooms?
did you know he was notorious for introducing young men to older men?
so, do i understand that... even a boy you might pick up in the street would be a pleasing companion?
i would talk to a street arab with pleasure if he would talk to me.

"years went over, and the giant grew very old and very feeble.
he couldn't play about anymore, so he sat in a huge armchair... and watched the children at their games and admired his garden.
i've been thinking, when you do come out... when they let you out...
you can go to switzerland or italy... write another play, get yourself back.
"i know not whether laws be right... or whether laws be wrong.
all that we know who lie in jail... is that the wall is strong... and that each day is like a year... a year whose days are long.
some do it with a bitter look... some with a flattering word.
the coward does it with a kiss... the brave man with a sword.
some kill their love when they are young... and some when they are old.
some strangle with the hands of lust... some with the hands of gold.
it gives it to us... with bitterness and disappointment in its train.
and we find ourselves looking with dull heart of stone... at the tress of gold-flecked hair... that we had once so wildly worshipped... and so madly kissed. "
with each other, it's true they could be a little brusque.
they hanged two men in the theater one night before i gave a lecture.
and my mother has our future planned out in every detail:
i'm to go into parliament, we're to have a nice house... and live a proper, settled life-- literature, lectures... the house of commons, receptions for the world in general at 5:00.
well, that was the idea, but it doesn't seem to be working.
i've lived here since i was three, and you see the pitiful result.
you also told me... that the greeks put statues of apollo in the bride's chamber... so she would have beautiful sons.
but i can't help noticing that here the statue's in your bedroom.
yes, but i only go for a night or two at a time, and i always come back.
whereas this giant, the one whose garden it was... he'd been away for seven years, staying with an ogre in cornwall.
"and after seven years, when he'd said all he had to say... because his conversation was very limited... he decided to return home to his own castle.

did you know he was notorious for introducing young men to older men?
to me, youth-- the mere fact of youth-- is so wonderful that i would sooner talk to a young man for half an hour... than, well, than be cross-examined in court.
so, do i understand that... even a boy you might pick up in the street would be a pleasing companion?
but my wife-- i have to say good-bye to my wife.
unless you positively wish to subject her... to the further humiliation of seeing you arrested... and taken away in front of the gutter press...
no one will ever speak to me again, whatever i do.
of course i'm your son, madre... which is why, even if i lose... the english will never forget me.
my dear constance, the name of wilde will be... a word of execration for the next thousand years.
you can't possibly let your boys grow up with people knowing who they are.
so, is it not clear that the love described... relates to natural and unnatural love?
then what is the love that dare not speak its name?
the love that dare not speak its name... in this century... is such a great affection... of an elder for a younger man... as there was between david and jonathan... such as plato made the very basis of his philosophy... and such as you may find in the sonnets of michelangelo... and shakespeare.

it's about time we both got serious and had a final battle among final battles...
what do you say we have ourselves a super concluding final battle?
this time for sure, i'm going to kill you and put an end to this!
you seemed so gigantic earlier, but looking at you this way, you ain't nothing special, huh?
there are times when i get so that i want to look back, just a little bit, but holding on to love and courage and pride, i fight on!
dan dan, little by little, i'm being charmed, this planet's last remnant of hope.
no one on earth has anything to do with this, right?
you turn papa, and mama, and everyone else back to normal right now!
as my loyal follower, you could have lived as a reborn tsufruian!
if it means having to live under your control, i'd rather be dead!
what do you say we have ourselves a super concluding final battle?
this time for sure, i'm going to kill you and put an end to this!
you seemed so gigantic earlier, but looking at you this way, you ain't nothing special, huh?
finally, an unexaggerated full power collides head-on with another full power, as the great battle begins!
i wish the words would come to me easily, like when writing a letter to a friend.
i'd like to have more time, for us to get to know each other a little better.
to think that your family members are the only ones who won't betray you, it's just too forlorn-- love is asking to be loved.
and though i know that giving up on believing would let me be at ease,
"i'm going to create the world over a number of days.
"not sure how long, might be a bit pressed, you know."
so then god created the world and on the first day he created light and air and fish and jam and soup and potatoes and haircuts and arguments and small things and rabbits and people with noses and jam, more jam, perhaps, and, er,
and soot and flies and tobogganing and showers and toasters and grandmothers and belgium.
you know how if you've got a deadline, everything builds up.
on the seventh day god was in a panic, "oh, what haven't i...?
"bigger engine and it can shoot across the water like that."
"no, i want an ark with a big room for poo."
so, he built an ark and that was great and then he collected two of every animal from all around the world, including two baboons, one a bit punch-drunk.
"he was hitting me, i didn't know what was going on."
there's a huge hole in the whole flood drama because anything that could float or swim got away scot-free and it was the idea to kill everything.
he didn't say, "i will kill everything except the floating ones and the swimming ones
the ones that go round in twos and swim up to other fish with their lights at the front.
and the other fish go, "no, it's a car coming towards me!
"i want bees on elastic so when they get pollen they come back here.
"my father was a beekeeper before me, his father was a beekeeper before him.
the monarchy system, gradually, over a period of time, has fallen apart but in britain it's stayed together while falling apart at the same time.
and i think people become their faces, as they get older, people look how they are and the queen is too severe.
so i preferred that direction but i think we were thrown because it was like a soap opera.
front page for the last four months, dodi and di, on holiday, and that was so in your face that you had to be thrown.
by the end of the show there's martians with big elbows everywhere.
she's swatting them off with a tennis racket, "i believe you, scully!
there was a lot of focus on that so i don't know how it all fits together but we were thrown.
and everyone came on telly, there was bill clinton, tony blair, saying,
someone says, "look, i fucked up at this" or, "i'm trying to do this."
but she's there saying, "we're very sorry about diana, she died."
"but i didn't want her to die and so that's a sad thing."
i'd have more respect if she was upfront about it and also if she said, "about resigning the throne, i'm never gonna do that.
a german archaeologist dug it up with very precise tools and...
"15.7 metres down, i found it, very precise, it's here." in a very german way.
and they built a huge wooden horse, 100 metres high, wooden, hollow horse, put some soldiers inside, left it there.
they built this big horse and said, "we're going now, bye!
the horizon is where the water tumbles over into a huge waterfall.
underneath the waterfall is a cave and in the cave is daniel day-lewis, elisabeth shue and a load of mohicans and daniel day-lewis is saying, "just stay alive and i will find you,
which made the people who made calendars very happy because they were going out of their minds.
"so we go five, four, three, two, one, nought and then what?
he said... (as sean connery) "i've got the speedboat out on the sea of galilee.
"if anyone wants to come for a spin, it'd be great.
you need to bang the set before you go to bed.
and they're so vivid to us - you're there and your grandmother's attacking you with a spoon, the pope's playing a banjo and you're totally au fait with it.
you fly around - never hit a light bulb, do you?
birds don't have flying dreams - they'd be boring for birds.
"we must go with our strange accents, go to the war, i must do it."
if that's the east end then what's a posh person's accent?
i had my own personal fight last year, last november, in cambridge!
did three good gigs in cambridge and then had a fight.
"you're a big lad but you've got no brains so shut your fucking face."
so he went for it, and i was blocking and blocking, which is, you know, that, block, block.
and, er, and there was that series on telly, kung fu.
david carradine or keith carradine, and he was always, "grasshopper, you must not fight.
all through a half-hour episode, "no, i will not fight you.
"i do not want to do that." why is he french?
jujitsu i learnt from a book i got when i was about 14, and it had...
learning a martial art from a book is weird cos you've got all the pictures.
and the grim reaper should update, he has the scythe of death.
the scythe was a modern piece of equipment after the iron age.
i had a real problem with throwing up, so that must have been a fun trip.
throwing up is controlled by three little bones in the inner ear.
i take the best ones and it goes to the guy at the back. "these are crap."
when you're not hungry but you get offered a biscuit, you want better than that.
"now, i've got a macintosh computer plugged into a canon printer and...
"yes, i've been into the printer file and chosen canon printer.

i was seeing somebody, and i was staying over at her place a lot.
obviously, the hospital is interested in finding out if anything could have been done to prevent this tragedy.
well, if they do rule it a suicide, maybe we'll get some shorter hours.
dennis said something at christmas about his girlfriend but if he were depressed, you'd have noticed.
but in my family, if a man sends flowers twice in one week the only thing left is conversion to catholicism, marriage and 7 kids.
should i look over my shoulder for your father with a shotgun?
i haven't gotten it together long enough to stay with a woman let alone family and babies and long-term commitments.
you wouldn't have to have a baby if you had a foster kid.
when dennis quit therapy, did you think that it was okay?
i mean, did you feel it was all right for him to stop?
i wanted to compliment you on how you handled yourself today.
it isn't easy to be a manager when it's hitting the fan and your workers are your friends.
dennis' e-mail gave me a sense of how demanding your schedules are.
in fact, i had to admonish my son for taking time to write home at all.
well, we hadn't seen much of each other for the last month.
i was seeing somebody, and i was staying over at her place a lot.
we're both aware of the complaint about dr. benton dennis lodged on the day of his death.
in your judgment was this day unique in dr. gant's experience or had he frequently felt he was treated unfairly?
well, if they do rule it a suicide, maybe we'll get some shorter hours.
dennis said something at christmas about his girlfriend but if he were depressed, you would've noticed, right?
i think he was wondering about gant's state of mind these last couple weeks.
did he call you guys in one at a time or all together?

this unit of a-positive must have been left on the infuser.
when i started it up, i'm sure there was a bag on there.
i know that dennis greatly respected your work and looked up to you.
well, i'm afraid i was a bit tough on your son.

in your judgment was this day unique in dr. gant's experience or had he frequently felt he was treated unfairly?
but what i'm asking is if anyone or anything put undue pressure on dr. gant.
a policy, a teaching method, anything that seems, in retrospect, too harsh.

i won't say i don't have a temper, and i've made a lot of mistakes.
but i love charlie like crazy, and i just want her to find something.
and a third of the guys are in prison, and i bet another third are dead.
you hear about this one and that one over the years.
i had nobody to discuss with, when i wanted to talk to someone.
so, when i have to make up my mind for something important,
now, if there is anybody with a good suggestion, please say it out.
you should know that our arboretum is targeted for the whole nation's nature studies.
if we have some lacking points, the time wasn't enough for people to experience nature in more detail and realistically.
love for nature that is too broad, should be made more specifically.
it's like a mere thing like the sun sets and the wind breezes but some time, when you're hopelessly lost in pain,
i will call you with the mere-ness that's been delivered for a iong time.
in my lessons, you will study about the nature and structure of poems images of poems, similes and irony of poems.
however, my wish is, i'd iike you to accept poems as a form of iife and not as a study.
thinking about you, is always in the scene where you're sitting
it's like a mere thing like the sun sets and the wind breezes.
i never my first letter to you would be like this.
how nice would it be if you don 't have to get this letter?
now, what's he up to, anyway sending you off on your own?
he went to get help, and he's bringing back cops and rangers.
you'll be lucky he doesn't trade you in for one of his precious bears.
he doesn't care for people just animals and rivers and trees.
we're back together two hours, we're having the same problems we had 12 hours ago.
tell me about it, i don't know why i ever took you back.
i don't wanna hear how interesting the change with the hole in it is.
and tell me what time it is in new york, you are going home in a body bag.
name one thing i have that puts me in a position of advantage.
there was a guy that worked at the yankees, no arms.

or have the only thing you care about ruined right when you have a chance to get ahead?
maybe not, but i know that you need all the friends you can get right now.
but you know, if you don't believe me, please, be my guest.
now are you glad we didn't start with the bikini strips?
i'm sorry. i wish i could take it back, but i can't.
i just can't see us throwing away something we know is so damn good.
oh, my god, they should call it "pain-zine, now with a little wax."

rachel's all like, "i love you," and "let's work on this" and all i can think about is what is she gonna do when i tell her what i did?

he hooked up with another gang, in order to ruin our place in tsim sha tsui.
then he stood in front of me and cried crocodile tears.
which we, from time to time, most grievously have committed, by thought, word, and deed, against thy divine majesty.
we do earnestly repent, and are heartily sorry for these our misdoings.
later, i knew a japanese, i wanted to marry him within a couple of days.
i flew to yokohama to look for him, however, i found out that the address and phone number he gave me... were a fake.
father, it's just your bad luck to meet that crazy woman!
just take it as a lesson... better be careful next time.
god, please make us your tools... to spread the message of peace.
let's sow the seed of forgiveness... in a planet filled with hatred.
i am not the judge to determine if you are guilty or not.
if i take over a case only after knowing the client is not guilty, can i still make a living?
i've been informed that the jesus' felow... refused to give statement.
so the police can't use that tape as evidence a one.
may i remind barrister koo... what rare case means in precedents?
defence counsel , i th ink you have gone far is it me.
since you are not catholic, why did you confess to a priest?
i think, the fact is, you take confess on as line game.
if not, why did you report to the police... 2 days after the rape?
may i put in this way, you are actually a bitch.
if you are put in a cross, you will not be back to life!
father li, i am fong siu man, reporter of the orienta weekly.
when you met the victim, a woman who is used to abused by her boyfriends ends, you thought she wouldn't mind having sex with you.
so you used her as a too to release your pressure, is that right?
your honour, please remind the defence counsel , now she can only clarify the quest on i've asked.
prosecutor, i would like to remind you too, you asked the details... of the sex intercourse, won't you kissed when you make love?
this is a mark of deep red stick, it belongs to the victim.
except the stick, smegma, a secret on... by a man's cock was found too.
ladies and gentlemen, after the hearing of these days, in fact, what you are going to decide is very simple.
the victim was willing or not...... if you think the victim was... willing to have sex with the accused, you have to plead him not guilty.
she's willing to do oral sex, don't you think she's refuse... to have sex with the accused?
sex is a part of life, a young man, he shouldn't resist the temptati on of sex and break his loath, that s church regulation, not law.
after that, she migrated to foreign country, no one knows her whereabouts.
shun fat on doing his underground and decent business, and he started his pontificate.
thank you so much for waiting for me l really appreciate it
is there any lock you can't pick your way in through?
l imagine that's why he locked it - to protect his work.
and this suit of armour, or whatever it is, in there?
because he believed in what he was doing, and said so, he was not very popular with the so-called animal rights fraternity.
it appears he was speaking into this dictaphone when the attack took place, just seconds before you returned.
out of all this lot, why pick three books from a shelf that he could hardly reach?
unless he didn't and they flew across the room on their own.
we leave our mouths open for longer, we moisten our lips more.
if you study his eyes, his pupils dilate when he looks at you.

if he was on the phone, how come the receiver was replaced?
she told me the same as she told you, that your body language showed interest.
that just shows you what a hollow farce it all is, doesn't it?
l could almost say he needed it to flush it out of his system.
afterwards, when he told me, he threw himself on my mercy.
a book of his... that he had signed on the inside.
all sealed up and ready to be sent off to someone called teresa tolling.
i'd say a particular kind of poison, like some sort of bad acid, something that would kill him, but would turn his brain inside out along the way.
you are saying some... animal rights activist could put something on the flap of that envelope?
no one else could get into this study and no one could get out.
it may be that there's another sequence that could explain it all.
he taught me how to dance to reggaeton, what the fuck.
like it or not, we're going to oxford to get you your girl.
do you have to tell the whole truth on a first date?
"look, dinner was nice, but i just want to shag you".
i forge files, steal lungs, hire transvestites... i'm capable of anything.
but my legs shake at the idea of inviting a girl i like to coffee.
13 years making excuses for not telling natalia i love her.
the only girl who ever smiled at me without looking at the iron on me.
but i asked her what i should do, and you know what she said?

the predator is a queen, which uses satellite worms... to infect and enslave people by attaching to their brains.
i don't know who to, 'cause i don't think there's anybody left out there.

i was grown on the cluster, which is ruled by his shadow.

they will be destroyed at the hands of the brunnen g.

take us away from here, take us out past the frontier, take us someplace better!
the only other man on board is kai, last of the brunnen g, but he is dead so he can't make zev happy.

kukaru is not screaming because he's afraid to lose his life
he's screaming because he's afraid he's not going to get anymore pattern
i'm making this recording in the hope it might be of some use to whoever might find it
all the planets in this system, except klaagia, managed to mutually destroy each other in a trade war
we thought we were ok, until we discovered that the marvans had infected klaagia with a type of predator used in the early stages of the war.
the predator is a queen, which uses satellite worms... to infect and enslave people by attaching to their brains.
i don't know who to, 'cause i don't think there's anybody left out there.
i think all i can do now is to somehow, some way find the queen again, and kill it.
i am the most powerful weapon of destruction in the two universes.
i was grown on the cluster, which is ruled by his shadow.
the time prophet said that kai would destroy his shadow's order
they will be destroyed at the hands of the brunnen g.
but that will be hard because his protoblood is running out and he must stay inside a very cold box.
be certain of your need before you choose to reanimate me.

look, er it's, er, not good news, what happened but er, we're all we've got now, and we're alive .
i guess because as a garbage planet with a few hundred workers it wasn't a significant target
we thought we were ok, until we discovered that the marvans had infected klaagia with a type of predator used in the early stages of the war.
ommander bog and the others are building a probe to send out for help.
i don't know who to, 'cause i don't think there's anybody left out there.

mr. shore, we appreciate your input, but you are not a partner.
i made not a peep when you deftly ushered lori colson out of the firm.
i even understood when you fired catherine piper, a woman i profoundly adore.
i swallowed all of it, because i know it's a business.

yet you exhaust your potential in the pursuit of a perfect stranger, the imagined assassin of your wife.
how might a human under my guidance defy the wish of a companion for a motive so paltry as revenge?
tell me for what reason i might choose the death of an innocent human?
it strikes me how much better i am able to serve you without the hindrance of a wife.
then most likely the bomb that killed her was meant for me, in retaliation for saving your life.
and so, by pursuing the killer of your wife, you thus serve the companions.
we have not worked this hard to position you among the companions just so some high-tech hit man could wipe you out.
it's a shame dr. belman can't fix my implant so that i could just serve you.

i would be glad to help you regardless of the effort involved.
you may not need my assistance in this matter, but i have been thinking about the recent attack in yokohama.

i wonder if shigure is laying in wait for you, kenshin?
they have disgraced the memories of those like gentatsu who fought from pure motives.
can you forgive a government that acts in such a manner?
do you want to atone for their loss by shedding more blood?
do you want to make a new world by trampling over more bodies?

kamiya kasshin ryu etsujiro the more i think about it, the more i am impressed by his great will .
since you have great skill, you could start a new sword school in your own way.
what kind of swordsmanship do you expect from my murdering sword?
i thought that my father never felt pain, even when my mother died.
however, i saw him crying silently while holding her kimono once.
in this meiji era, a sword can't do anything at all.
with a sword ,i can protect people whom i can see.
live w ith the sword and die with the sword .
there is no other way for you to live. " someone told me that.
it's been ten years since then, but i still don't understand what i can do.
until i find the answer, i can't put down this reverse-bladed sword.
now that i have you as a hostage, he will go mad .
the madness will make him revert to what he used to be as an assassin.
you don't know how strong he was in the last days of the tokugawa.
just hearing stories about him, people got goose pimples because of his cold and cruel sword.
the man who masters how to draw the sword from the sheath...
that's the reason for his other name, "battosai", i've heard .
since he is a master of the hiten mitsurugi style with its godlike speed, he must be the fastest at drawing his sword from the sheath.
however, i wonder how fast he can draw now since his arm is injured?
but a cherry tree is a cherry tree, not blood .
right, matters of the past are the same as a dream, and they will fade out in time and disappear someday.
however, other than that, he's the same as any ordinary person.
if something happens next time, it will be no surprise if he dies.
no matter what happens to you, you'll come back to me alive.
when i came back here from kyoto, when i heard you saying "welcome home, "
he is the man who murdered his own wife with his own hands.
would it put him into a living hell to lose you, or not?
if you're the most important person to him, he'll find this place and come here soon.
then, i'll kill you in front of him, and make him feel the same as i have.
if he doesn't show up, i have nothing to do with you.
i will let you go home alive, so for a while, stay here and be quiet.
he took many people's lives and happiness away from them, erased them with his own hands.
the people left behind are still in the darkness of sadness and desperation.
i understand how she felt, because i'm a woman who loves the same person she did.
he's been living by rescuing more people than he killed, and he has been seeking for away to atone for his guilt.
i wonder if kenshin finally got the answer he has been seeking so long?
you make me laugh if you're thinking about not killing me.
in order to light more smiles and happiness in this world, as long as i live, i risk my sword and my mind for those who are alive now, and i will complete my life.
this is the answer i found as a way of atonement, led by tomoe's smile.
i don't think i can be more important than you were for kenshin.
however, i will support him as much as i can in the best way i can.
so things have happened which i don't know about, but it must have been hard for you to live here after that.
even after he got the answer, he lived in battles more than before.
he told me he would do all he could while he was able to use his sword.
his thoughts are left to you along with his reverse-bladed sword.
nowaday s i don't have a sword and i've lost the power to protect people, so instead of reaching out to help from above,
i can share their pain and suffering and become an encouragement for the people.
the only thing i can do is to raise this baby safely, and let hi m leave the house with a smile.
i feel it's been very long, or sometimes, it's been very short for fifteen years.
that's why i asked him to share a little piece of his suffering.
i wanted to have something which we could share, because we are husband and wife.
i am so sorry to have made you suffer through painful days...
i've found out how happy it is to devote yourself to someone after i met you.
i can't lose the battle, as a doctor and as a woman.
in order to get onto a ship to japan, we will probably have to go to shanghai.
i'm going to make a special meat dish for you tonight.
is there any meaning to this sword that my father kept after he quit being an assassin?
he was strong and became a legend, but it was in the last days of the tokugawa.
the father i knew was not even a man who lived by the sword.
what i wanted to be passed on was not the kasshin swordsmanship, nor my father's swordwhich doesn't kill people, but hiten mitsurugi swordsmanship.
i will learn it and create a new legend superior to my father's.
i believe i appeared as jin'e udo for two or three weeks in the original show.
that set of weeks six years ago has become quite blurred in my memory.
i didn't have as much a sense that he was a monster.
so, may be the character's feel, the character's image was not a monster in my eyes.
in the end, the span of time between appearing and dying is just so short.
how do i depict this jin'e, who abandoned his humanity and all sorts of other things in an attempt to live solely in this world of the sword?
even with the shinsengumi, it was formed for various purposes, but it still ceased to exist as its era came to an end.
however, i believe there is a certain, hidden beauty to ceasing to exist.
i think jin'e might have a share of that as well.
it is a historical tale, as well as a romantic story.
and, well, i guess it's not so strong in terms of a biography.
but it's a kind of epic drama that's tangled up with this great era and flows with it.
and i feel it was an honor to have been able to play him.
and it certainly is a joy to be given the director's favorite character to play.
if someday, by some chance, this series is ever presented to the audience once more,
i would truly love to participate in this series once again in some capacity, even if it is not as the voice of jin'e.
in the end, there are not so many opportunities to work on a period drama, and an epic tale like this one at that.
after all, when it comes to anime, there are fundamentally more stories about robots and sci-fi.
something about her, maybe that her hair style had changed , made her seem somewhat more mature.
before, she had a lot of row dy scenes with yahiko where she'd yell, "h ey !" and things, but this ti me, i played a more quiet and mature aspect of her.
in the modern age, it wouid be like, "i'll go with you too,"
but in the old days, things were different in those aspects.
well, it's just my voice, but i really love the people that appear in rurouni kenshin.
well, this is the last time, but i do hope that i will love them forever.
i have never worked on one project over such a long time period.
so i really feel close, likee family, not only to the story and its characters, but also to the staff and other voice actors.
i was naturally able to get into it for some reason.
so, i felt that the character kenshin was already there in me.
when i saw the drawings of him, i felt like he was my other half.
of course, well, it's been seventeen years and kenshin has aged into a man, who is forty-four, forty-five years old.
those are the things i tried to accomplish and i think i was able to produce the feel of kenshin.
so, rather than the previous, somewhat hig her-pitched "oro" and things like that,
i tried to make it more like "kaoru", with a heavier tone that will reach out and touch people's hearts.
so, i wold be happy if you would enjoy those things along with kenshin.
and i think it's a burden he just has to carry forever.
that's his fate, so i think it cannot be helped , but i also feel sorry for him.
so i would love to have all sorts of people to see it.
and i hear that it's actually quite popular overseas as well.
rather than say, please don't forget him, it's more like, please always think of him.
and i belive the fans and the staff members who were involved in creating this show know far better than i just how good this series is,
i was able to play kenshin very naturally, so i would like a really wide audience to see it, but i also hope that you, personally, will watch it and treasure it.
there is also a part 2 to this, so please cheer us on.
voice of sanosuke sagara yuji ueda so i wondered if i could reconnect...
the timeline is continuous, so i wondered if i could get back to that time.
or rather, i wondered if i would be able to go straight into playing that role again from where we left off.
i was very worried about that right up to the day before recording.
the tone of the film is different from that of the tv series, so i hoped that i would be able to interact with the others on a more humanly neutral, or rather, natural plane.
i was very interested in seeing how that kind of character would turn out visually when he was given a more natural look.
and in that regard, they kept a lot of the old design, but gave him a very realistic look and proportions.
so i thought, "wow, so this is how he turns out, how interesting !"
and i'm thinking that i'd like to sort of match the nuance of my performance in accordance with those things.
getting a glimpse of everyone after all that time had passed, like kaoru, yahiko, and kenshin...
sort of how he had grown a little independent of kenshin was fun to watch.
well, the kenshin project was a key turning point for me in all sorts of ways.
i heard from someone that it's an interesting show for people who like period dramas, but are getting a little tired of them.
so, it seems there is quite a breadth to the audience watching it as well.
i'll get to see sanosuke sagara well past his mid-30s, so i'm kind of looking forward to how i'll play him then.
i also hope he'll get to fight a lot of things.
i think you'll be able to watch this as just one possible timeline.
please take your time to really savor it as you watch it.
voice of seijuro hiko shuichi ikeda i met mr. hiko again after all this time
well, it has always been the same since we first met, but how should i say this?
essentially, i think that even though time passed and the era changed in various ways,
i felt that his stance in life would not have shifted so much.
i've still got a bit to go, but it's actually getting closer to my real age now.
yes, so well, yes, everything went fine without having to be too conscious of his age.
i'd like to continue at the same pace as before and play him calmly and coolly.
and that's how i'd like to play him in part 2 as well.
the weather will be growing colder, so i think watching this show at home, especially on a snowy day, would be a fine way to pass the time.
please sit back and relax and enjoy the show to the fullest.
also, he has grown into an adult, which was not exactly a surprise, but something that made me happy as well.
generally speaking, i thought it was so elegantly tasteful and so mature.
and for that part, if it was the boy yahiko, he would have said "hey !" like that.
but he's not and he doesn't, and i sort of thought that "hey"
also, one of the lines i love over all is kaoru's one word of "welcome home."
a feel for the depth and strength of their bond .
i felt that i wanted to play the part of yahiko while carefully maintaining the show's atmosphere.
i was able to tackle the challenge of playing the role of a boy, so this is an important project for me, personally.
it's been a while, so how did you like this episode of rurouni kenshin?
well, part 2 apparently has an even more grown-up yahiko, so please look forward to that as well.
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." nozomu sasaki but when i received the offer, i thought, "oh, finally enishi gets to..."
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." nozomu sasaki but when i received the offer, i thought, "oh, finally enishi gets to..."
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." i had personally felt that you couldn't just end it like that,
i had personally felt that you couldn't just end it like that, so it's weird to say that enishi finally got to settle things.
performing the part of "enishi yukishiro?" ever since the incident with tomoe happened when he was young,
performing the part of "enishi yukishiro?" he'd been nurturing his feelings for kenshin and his older sister, he'd been nurturing his feelings for kenshin and his older sister,
envisioning all sorts of things and waiting for a chance for revenge.
and at long last, in this chapter, he has his final battle, where everything is settled.
the thing is, it was a long recording session and rather than splitting it into several chapters, it was all in part 2 in a very concentrated format.
and his lines were somewhat fast as well, so the recording was sort of difficult.
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." miki fujitani and she will follow him in the decisions he makes
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." and she will follow him in the decisions he makes and she will follow him in the decisions he makes and his way of life.
i played kaoru hoping that i could convey those feelings of hers.
she's very positive and it's a role that cheers you up as you pay her.
how do you feel about "rurouni kenshin?" up until now, in the series, there were some romantic scenes,
how do you feel about "rurouni kenshin?" but it was mostly just a small part of the story.
but it was mostly just a small part of the story.
but this time, the entire thing is sort of like the story of kenshin and kaoru's love.
so i think you'll get to see a different kind of kaoru than what you saw in the tv series.
i sort of miss the fact that there aren't any silly scenes, but i really think
a message to the fans i'm sure there were many aspects of my kaoru that were not perfect,
i'm sure there were many aspects of my kaoru that were not perfect, but i did the best i knew how.
well, this is now the end, but i think we have been able to bring this to a conclusion with a truly good piece of work.
so, please keep cheering for me outside of this work as well.
yuki kaida this show has been carefully crafted over the last six years
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." yuki kaida this show has been carefully crafted over the last six years
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." yuki kaida and it's a show that the audience has loved the entire time,
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." and it's a show that the audience has loved the entire time,
so, above all else, i felt that i had a g reat responsibility.
it was an honor, but i was also daunted when i accepted .
i'm sure the staff and cast have worked together for a long time, so there was a clear, mutual understanding and they had a clear vision of what they wanted .
so, in that sense, i think it was a very easy situation to work with for someone joining in just for the last part.
and he had a iittle bit of both his parents in him.
personally, i had imagined that he would be a little softer, but among the direction i received on site, the first was a request to show how strong-willed he is.
honestly speaking, i believe there are not many shows these days that are crafted with this level of attention to detail.
and i think these chapters have been made into something worthy of being the final episodes, so i hope that you will watch it over and over again.
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." mayo suzukaze just how hard it is express yourself with only your voice.
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." mayo suzukaze
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." mayo suzukaze also, i don't really feel like this is the end.
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." also, i don't really feel like this is the end .
and because i was lucky enough to work on this great project,
i feel like i may have grown as an individual through kenshin.
i thought that it might be because he's married and has a wife and a child ...
i thought a lot about it from a normal perspective, but i think even beyond all that, he's a person with meaning in his life.
how do you feel about "rurouni kenshin?" and there is a part of me that can become kenshin at anytime.
and there is a part of me that can become kenshin at anytime.
i met all sorts of people while working on this project, and, well...
i also learned there are so many people who love kenshin himura.
a message to the fans well, i don't feel like it has ended at all,
well, i don't feel like it has ended at all, but this is the end .
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." mika doi i think her character was already an adult from the beginning,
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." i think her character was already an adult from the beginning,
having finished recording part 2 of the final chapter "reflection..." but i felt like she was carrying all these burdens but i felt like she was carrying all these burdens about her family, regarding the era, and other things,
and was really straining herself so much that she might break at any time.
that's the kind of woman i saw her as, with all these things bottled up inside her.
so, even with the people around her, she acts strong and tends to behave aggressively towards them.
i suppose you could say that she is single-minded, but there was a side to her like that.
but as the months and years went by, she went from being a woman who needed someone to a person who could support others.
she stands tall, knowing who she is and she walks through life on her own two feet.
i think both ways are great, but i feel they were all influenced by kenshin and went their separate ways.
a message to the fans the staff has done such careful work on this show
a message to the fans and i believe we, the actors, feel it has turned into a wonderful show and i believe we, the actors, feel it has turned into a wonderful show and have nothing but admiration and appreciation for them.
i think the realistic artwork and the very careful, sincere work really comes across to the viewer.
thank you very much for loving and watching this show all this time.

yahiko has grown up and ms. miina continues to do his voice.
when i heard her voice, i thought, "wow, yahiko sounds so cool!"
and i felt a thrill in my heart for the yahiko that ms. miina was depicting.
in that sense, i think it was easy for me to step into the shoes of the older tsubame.
how do you feel about "rurouni kenshin?" i was asked all along to speak in a non-anime way.
thank you for supporti ng rurouni kenshin over such a long time.

yes, but i invented stories about where he was and what had happened to him.

no, i'm your friend and i have to watch out for you when your judgment's been impaired.

if they had been fully effective, you wouldn't have found anything interesting enough to bring you here.
we can show you how we detected the gallicite, so you can disguise it better.
we can also help you eliminate the last traces of the ruins on the surface, so no one else will be curious about them.
oh, believe me, i'd like to, but i know this isn't really you.
you've made it clear that you're not interested and i have to accept that's how you feel, even now.

you don't even go, like, 50, 40, 30, 20, ten, just nothing.
and then you go a half mile, and you're going again.
all right, i can't really talk about it now, but the point i'm trying to make, laura, is that last night i'm watching the news with my dad, mm-hmm.
they report a guy, bald, late 40s, hits a mailbox, and then drives away.

can't you just exert yourself a bit according to the idea?
it's not that i am stupid, it is your words that i don't understand.
i have spent all the money the other person gave me.
listen to me, take 100 yuan from me and get lost in no time.

i am most disgusted by your sort, and this is what i hate you most.
i visited liu delong several times these days, and we reached a good solution according to my proposal.
this solution accounts for your loss as well as my loss.
in fact, i think liu delong is a good guy, i didn't think that he would eventually give 50 thousand yuan out.
he's a sensible person, he doesn't want to fight about this.
he agreed as soon as i proposed, it is wise to sacrifice some money to avoid disasters.
he has said that, it's not because he's afraid of you.
there're so many hoofs in the big boiler that some may be southern pigs, and some northern pigs.

the family is good, friends are good, and i'm good too.

he's a sensible person, he doesn't want to fight about this.
he agreed as soon as i proposed, it is wise to sacrifice some money to avoid disasters.

i don't go back on my word, but i agreed with just 50,000.
tell me, can the pig hoofs be told which is left, which is right?
then tell me, of these two, which is the left, and which is the right?
at least i dare say it's hard tell these two in the plate.
this one may be the left, and the other may be the left too.
you break your promise like this, then what do you take me for?
to tell you the truth, i feel really sorry for this.
if you don't want there to be a death-causing accident you needn't do it this way.
these are so many ways for revenge, why do you have to chop off his hand?
we change our way, to complete the end, and reduce the consequences.
don't you think we should put these dishes away, and we go to some other place to reach the end?
an hong, i miss you so much that i want to sleep!
it's not "i want to sleep"; it is "i can hardly sleep".

you are the first party, liu delong is the second party, i am the third party.
"the three parties have agreed on the following protocol about the june-28 incid ent:"
to speak the worst, it'll be miserable if you get infected with some disease.
for such a girl, it's not worth fighting about, even with blood.

life or death of liu and me doesn't concern me at all.
but from the moment you gave me the computer, i changed my view about you.
we're talking about taking over a massive yakuza sect with 30,000 members.
don't you think we should at least bring some kind of gift?
if you want to live out the rest of your short fucking life?
or shall i put the medicine in your stomach right now?
but it's like i just like i just killed your father.
he was meant to end his life now, in any case.
it's just a matter of time before they find out who shot uzaki.
if you're still in japan, i'll be in the shit with you.
i still can't believe that i almost betrayed the boss by trusting you.
you offered me a life insurance scheme and i nearly fell for it.
i'm gonna make a delivery tonight so i won't be back till the morning.
but if you take a rest, you should feel better soon.
yoko wants to hurt in the same place of her body too.
she doesn't care that you are a yakuza who keeps shooting shabu ...and running away from other yakuza.
he hasn't got any family, so there's nobody to pick up the body.
according to his driving license, he's from an orphanage in wakayama, but the orphanage has been closed down.
my mom was called masae and she was a very nice woman.
but i was a rough kid and made her cry many times.
and my ex-wife reported me to the police and i was in prison for a while.
and she ran away with another man and took my daughter with her.
violation of gun and sword control law violation of gunpowder control law
obstruction of police in the execution of duty violation of drug control law
why do i have to bow and accept his fucking offer and work for him?
when i became the boss of this gang, he was only a kindergarten kid running around in the playground.
it's not that i don't trust you, but can i hear your declaration again?
brother, i swear that i will fight for you as long as i live.
i've never met anyone, who so desperately wanted me like him before.
i'd never been wanted like that before, and i didn't think i ever would be.
i hope that's the only reason but he seems to be doing a lot of shabu.
i used to be a shabu addict so i know what it's like.
if you kill me, i think i can at least go to heaven.
it's just a matter of time before they find out who shot uzaki.
you offered me a life insurance scheme and i nearly fell for it.
i maybe the only one, but i'm still a member of the ohkuma sect.
she doesn't care that you are a yakuza who keeps shooting shabu ...and running away from other yakuza.
she's scared... but wants to believe that she could be happy here with you.
i don't even know my dad's face and my mother was a mistress.
my mom was called masae and she was a very nice woman.
as you can see, our lawndale high students take great pride in their school.
that's why you'll each be taking a small psychological exam to spot any little clouds on the horizon as you sail the student seas of lawndale high.
they said i didn't have to try out, but i said, "look, i'm new here.
give me a chance to get used to the place first."
as long as you can join pep squad later if you want to, it's your choice.

in a related note, the school nurse will be visiting homerooms tomorrow to collect dna samples.
now, mr. o'neill has exciting news about our after-school self-esteem class.
she felt i should have thanked you and mom as well.
no, we should thank you for being such a great kid.
a month ago, i found him in the kitchen at 3 a.m. talking to himself.
it's possible you have a low-grade infection in your nervous system.
it makes me feel even more foolish for speaking the way i did.
you know, when i was in the alley with the kid hernandez...
you could have years to teach the pinos to be better cops.
or i could be here lying flat on my back stuck full of tubes.
now, discussing the causes and evaluation of surgical hypertension will be my colleague dr. peter benton.
except that he was detained, which is why he asked me to stand in for him.
we've always been committed to each other from the day we met to now.
we can treat you with iv antibiotics check cindy for exposure.
i was thinking about what i said to you earlier, and i was wrong.
sometimes when you try to help somebody and you can't it gets inside you and it twists, and you wonder why.
i'm sure it's not serious, but i'd like to do a neurological exam.
i want you to squeeze my fingers when i say so.
or i could be here lying flat on my back stuck full of tubes.
let me do a cat scan, find out what's going on.
and treatment was via an aortorenal-bypass graft using a segment of the saphenous vein.
now, discussing the causes and evaluation of surgical hypertension will be my colleague dr. peter benton.
except that he was detained, which is why he asked me to stand in for him.
the surgically correctable causes of hypertension include coarctation of the aorta, cushing's syndrome and pheochromocytoma.
you're not about to have a crisis at the office, are you?
well, i can't very well do it now that you said that.

as some of you know, the board has voted to move curfew to sundown and to increase security patrols.
the sheriff has assured me that everything that can be done is being done.
we moved our families here to be safe from this sort of tragedy.
now we find out that the sheriff has withheld the truth from us.
drives a late-model car - probably a minivan or a sport utility vehicle.
i believe his parents were divorced when he was a child.
if he's married, his wife doesn't know anything about the crimes he's committing.
in all likelihood, the killer lives here - in the community.
and when that death is a violent death, the pain is compounded by images of horror.
images that threaten to blot out the memory of the innocence that once was.
we've got one dead boy, one returned alive and one still missing.
i think the unsolved death of the swim coach's son may be related.
that the sins of the father are visited on the son.
after mr comstock confessed his sin, his son was released alive.
the first boy was killed because his father didn't confess his sin - one involving money.
he's warning you to confess what you've done in order to save your son.
sheriff, my client insists he's absolutely innocent of any charges relating to the death of carl burke.
i don't care if your client insists he's the king of prussia, i'm bringing him in.
the other boys were returned in under 72 hours. lt's almost that now.
sheriff, we got a man approaching the house from the front walk.
when i aaw it on the newa i recogniaed a certain type of criminal pathology.
i think the group'a reaourcea could prove valuable in aolving thia caae quickly.
everything you can do to keep aafe, theae folka have done it.
the boy that went miaaing, you found no connection between him and the dead boy?
a community free of all the dangera of the outaide world.
no one'a gonna want to believe that the killer comea from within.
aa aome of you know, the board haa voted to move curfew to aundown and to increaae aecurity patrola.

in all likelihood, the killer livea here - in the community.
why not the van horna acroaa the atreet or the trimblea?
i know that aounda aelfiah of me, but i juat can't make any aenae out of it.
she'a a conaultant for a firm that doea deaign work for ua.
i atarted aeeing her a couple of timea a week at the hartman hotel.
juat thinking about thia caae - an old one i had.
it felt a lot like the one i'm working on now.
we've got one dead boy, one returned alive and one atill miaaing.

he says, for my sake, you have to pay for what you've done.
that if you've taken a life... then your life must be taken in return.
i can't honestly say i know exactly how you can help us.
i work with a group of ex-law enforcement people called the millennium group.
when i saw it on the news, i recognized a certain type of criminal pathology.
i think the group's resources could prove valuable in solving this case quickly.
can you send me a copy of the results when you get 'em?
i'd like to have a colleague of mine take a look at them.
they think they've created a safe haven... a community free of all the dangers of the outside world.
no one's gonna want to believe that a killer comes from within.
we all feel for what tom and linda comstock are going through... and our prayers are with them.
but we also have to be concerned for the safety of our own children.
i hope this tragedy can bring us all together... that it can strengthen the ties that bind us, rather than tear them apart.
with all due respect, ed, we didn't come to listen to crap.
he drives a late model car, probably a minivan... or a sport utility vehicle.
i believe his parents were divorced when he was a child.
the blood in the stomach of the first victim... is that of a white male, type a-positive.
it's also the blood used to paint 331 on the bedclothes.
images that threaten to blot out the memory of the innocence that once was.
and yet, god offers us no meaning, not in the personal sense.
we can only cherish the innocence that once was... keeping it alive by remembering it.
and pray for the preservation of innocence in the face of evil.
the kidnapper picked up kids at the bus stops... took 'em to his cabin in the woods, tortured them for seven or eight days.
then he'd return them to the bus stops as if nothing ever happened.

it was the time when dogs were swept away from the street, and people started to seek their own prosperity.
but anyone that went against the social stream were oppressed and forgotten by society.
however, this lead to another battle against the elite security unit that is known as "kerberos," who refused the order from their officials to disband.
it created a symbolic figure at the end of this age.
it was a rebellion of watchdogs who had lost their masters.
koichi todome, midori washio, and soichiroh tobe of first platoon must report to headquarters immediately!
i'll tell you about koichi todome, who you requested us to investigate.
after he escaped from japan, he drifted from south america to central america... and finally arrived in this country at the end of last year.
i can't believe that he was once the leader of "kerberos" which terrified an entire metropolis.
he escaped from his country with determination to continue the battle and rebuild his organization, but after all he set out to do...
the time when you guys can eat at a roadside stand has ended.
the time when dogs disappear from the street will come soon to this country.

heck, i'm over at your house twice this week for dinner.
i mean get out and meet some women, get back in the saddle.
i also found some packets of hot sauce in case tomorrow night we go "south of the border."
al it's not that we don't love you coming over for dinner
well, al, you can't go to a singles bar by yourself.
you need to take a friend with you, that way you feel more relaxed and confident.
well... oh, either that or we could just have al here for dinner every night for the rest of our lives.
dad, if you love your family, you'll go to the singles bar, cruise for chicks.
you're only gonna be there long enough for al to meet somebody.
that's not long enough for anybody to fall... you gonna wear this tie?
al's been really lonely, he's hanging around our house way too much.
so, i volunteered tim to go with him to a singles bar for moral support.
i remember when i was in japan, my old flame, miyoshi, was too ill to attend a cooking contest.
so i donned her kimono, applied a light blush, and submitted her spinach wasabi rice cakes to the judge.
go stuff yourself into those jeans, then we'll talk about pick-up lines.
i can use the same pick-up line i used on you.

i just bought an apartment here working for ten years as a prosecutor.
but if you guys fuck around here every morning, how would i feel?

i'm number two in axe gang, and you are the number three in do-kang gang.
i told you i will pay it back by making it thousand times or ten thousand times.
for reigning this area, now 300 million won is the matter?
hey, have you heard of 'an axe of a praying mantis'?
it's likely to a rudely acting mantis knowing its hands as an axe.
while doing like that, it'll be entangled when he get broken.
you, by using ashtray rudely, was it once or twice you made matters wrong?
elder daughter is a college girl, younger daughter is a high school chicken.

hey, as i figured it out, i'm working for twelve and half hours a day on average.
i have to control the ring, handle my district, and have to settle an accident.
that's just like saying of a president of certain big company.
"my zone is large, and a bunch of things to do"
do you know what do i hate like a fucking word?
it's the saying that you must hate the offense, but not a offender.
while i have struggled to get this position, how many guys do you think i have gotten rid of?
honestly for us, just a few daggers and a bath fee for followers are all we need to invest.
my son is a elementary school student in the second grade.
by the way, the fellows in the sixth grade already organize a gang and pluck of money.
i go back to home at 2 o'clock in the morning.

he'll surely keep away from him, and he'll be caught by him.

[ boy narrating ] ln issue number 141 of the fantastic four, published in november, 1973, reed richards has to use his antimatter weapon... on his own son who annihilus has turned into a human atom bomb.
it was a typical predicament for the fantastic four... because they weren't like other superheroes;
the closer you're drawn back in, the deeper into the void you go.
[ man ] the dilemma dostoyevsky claims here to have discovered... goes to the very core of christianity's relationship to the modern world.
they've got this humongoid place in new york and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here ?
i hope you changed the water in that bong from last night.
the water, as you call it, is a special mixture of amaretto and brandy... blended for just the exact chemical interaction... with the last of our precious thai stick.
[ nixon on television ] ...but a record which would only be disclosed- [ continues, indistinct ]
- well, that's the whole point of the holidays, paul, so you and your sister can mope around the house and your mother and i can... wait on you hand and foot while the two of you occasionally grunt for more food... from behind the hair in your faces.
as a matter of fact, i have a practice, whenever i'm not too tired at night, of dictating my own recollections of the day.
i think that, perhaps, will be the more accurate record of history in the end.
you know, i have to admit the movie didn't do much for me.
but being in that theatre, surrounded by all those horny young college boys and perverts,
but you two are still sticking it out with dr pasmier ?
oh, actually, ben decided that-- well, i mean we both decided--
but elena and i, we don't, uh, go in for those sort of histrionics.
about the only big fight we've had in years was about whether to go back into couples therapy.
you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out... and whoever's they've got they go home with.
anyhow, that's how she met this rod person or whatever his name is.
i've never been much of a joiner, although i still consider myself a somewhat religious person.
well, i, of course, flatter myself that our church is not exactly... what most people would call organized religion.
i bet the entirety of his disposable income has been dedicated... to humiliating me on the golf course.
and that guy talks nonstop throughout the entirety of the miserable 18 holes...
i just play a few notes, anyway, so i figured i'd just stay in.
well, i'm sure your father and i would love to hear what you're playing these days.
so when you smell something bad it's like, in a way, you're eating it.
this is why you should not really smell things... in the same way you don't eat everything in the world around you... because, as a smell, it gets inside of you.
[ paul narrating ] to find yourself in the negative zone, as the fantastic four often do, means that all everyday assumptions are inverted.
even the lnvisible girl herself becomes visible... and so she loses the last semblance of her power.
it seems to me that everyone exists partially on a negative zone level-- some people more than others.
in your life it's kind of like you dip in and out of it:
the place where things don't quite work out the way they should.
but for some people, there's something about the negative zone that tempts them, and they end up going in-- going in all the way.
well, um, on the self-abuse front-- and this is important, uh--
i don't think it's advisable to do it in the shower.
well, i really let him have it, and wendy came home peacefully.
so, uh, what were you doing in the carvers' basement, anyway ?

and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation... and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this.

can you sally forth and secure us some more mead ?
okay, everyone, we have a little business to attend to now.
so, everyone who'd like to stay, please gather in the living room.
[ sighs ] my husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were.
i've been married to him for 17 years and i have no intention... of going in there to get him.
it's like someone's always leaving the door open to the next world, and if you aren't paying attention you could just walk through it, and then you've died.
that's why in your dreams it's like you're standing in that doorway... and the dying people and the newborn people pass by you... and brush up against you as they come in and out of the world during the night.
reed richards has to use his anti/hatter weapon on his own son... who ann/hi/us has turned into a human atom bomb.
/t was a typical predicament for the fantastic four... because they weren'!
that was the meaning of the fantastic four - that a fiami/y is like your own personal ant/matter.

i think that, perhaps, will be the more accurate record of history in the end.
the dog jumps up on the barstool, and he says, "okay."
but elena and i, we don't - we don't go in for those sort of histrionics.

and i was on the goddamn golf team in college... so it's something one would assume i do well.
and i bet the entirety of his disposable income... has been dedicated to humiliating me on the golf course.

i think, uh, you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake... and i think he 's t/j/ing to get into your slacks!

and since you can't choose to be good... because that'd be too rational, you have to choose to be bad.
you think francis is going to beat me to the punch here ?
since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your libbets fixation a secret from him ?
well, you can't come on thursday, paul, because thursday's already thanksgiving.
[ nixon on television ] ...but a record which would only be disclosed- [ continues, indistinct ]
- now we're in some geriatric group, though i must admit there are a couple of lookers.
but you two are still sticking it out with dr pasmier ?
that scuzzy husband of hers... dragged her kicking and screaming to one when they were out in l.a.
you know, the men put their car keys in a bowl, and at the end of the evening the women line up and fish them out... and whoever's they've got they go home with.
anyhow, that's how she met this rod person or whatever his name is.
he's left his wife, she's packing for california and irwin is devastated.
but, um, i did think for a time that you might be someone who--
well, what i mean is that you didn't seem to think what we were trying to do is laughable,

you think it means two times two equals four, but they really mean a square-- it's really space.
it's not numbers, it's space, and it's perfect space, but only in your head 'cause you can't draw a perfect square in the material world, but in your mind you can have perfect space.
because when you smell a smell it's not really a smell, it's part of the object that has come off of it-- molecules.
so when you smell something bad it's like, in a way, you're eating it.
this is why you should not really smell things... in the same way you don't eat everything in the world around you... because, as a smell, it gets inside of you.

now, as your own parents have probably told you, in adolescence our bodies tend to betray us.
that's why in samoa and other developing nations... adolescents are sent out into the woods, unarmed, and they don't come back till they've learned a thing or two.
i don't think it's advisable to do it in the shower.
it wastes water and electricity and because we expect you to be doing it there in any case.
dear lord, thank you for this thanksgiving holiday... and for all the material possessions we have and enjoy...
- and for letting us white people kill the indians and steal...
[ sighs ] you know, i think elena might suspect something.
[ sighs ] maybe it's all for the better, you know ?
i think you're touching that reckless jerk-off, for god's sake, and i think he's trying to get into your slacks.
i think at 14 years of age you're getting ready to give up your girlhood !
they're on the floor, and he's got his trousers undone-- though, thank goodness, she was still dressed.
well, i really let him have it, and wendy came home peacefully.
- in other news, outside-- - ...a few snow showers which quickly turn to light rain.
unless that rain comes down even harder tonight, accompanied by decreasing temperatures... getting down to around freezing by midnight.
and you're gonna put it on the house keys so that janey can find it.
and then when i get back to the house, i'm gonna find the two of you in there, and wendy will be able to hear you, and paul will be back and he'll hear you.
when i remembered some chores i wanted to get done before the party...
