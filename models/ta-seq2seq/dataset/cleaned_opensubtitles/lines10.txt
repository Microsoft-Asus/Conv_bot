his grace has always let known his love and understanding of french culture.
as usual, his grace schlapas refused to answer journalists' questions, and to all of those concerning his elevation to cardinal.
the camera operator was close enough to capture the exact moment of the murder.
this footage makes it possible to identify the murderer, who fled.
watch carefully, we have studied each frame and have enlarged the footage.
to the left, you can clearly see the weapon and the murderer's hand.
the police hope that these blurred images will help the investigation.
some suggested that the group who took over lithuania in 1940 are responsible.
his grace schlapas was due to return home the day after tomorrow.
- if only i had guessed that you were hiding here with this genius.
is it true that elena came to ask you for a part?
she wanted me to help her go back to her country.
all you want is to imprison me, and show me that there is a huge spider inside the wardrobe, as big as a man.
and we will spend the rest of our lives, staring at it, admiring it, knowing it...
i was meant to be the kingpin, helping the ascension of a proletariat that doesn't exist, like everything else.
and it just seemed so natural, a director who is lonely but in love... with the woman he made fantastic films with.
no, i was merely there to remind mr. mliska what was expected of him.
to help him get where he was meant to be, at the right time.
this incident is bringing new light on the investigation into the murder of his grace schlapas, which took place a few days ago in paris.
the victim of the car accident is a czech dissident, milan mliska.
a note was found on his body, claiming that he was the archbishop's murderer.
this would make investigators reconsider their previous theory of a conspiracy.
the letter is leading them to consider that mliska had mental health issues.
it appears that he was trying to bring attention to prisoner conditions.
now it's home to the world renowned museum of fine arts.
right of you on the river bank you can see the academy.

my constructicons have returned to our, temporary base, right on scheule.
they were worth the time we spent bulding them in these caverns.
-doesn't this remind you of the gladitorial comabts in ancient rome?
-maybe it would, if i knew what you were talking about.
-we will accompany them back to their headquarters, to make certain noble optimus prime keeps his word.
-now, the autobot computer, teletraan i, is just beyond this cavern ceiling.
it seems that there's been a lot of counterfeit american 20s showing up all over munich.
well, they can't think that i am some part of some kind of a ring.
i told amanda you're the best man in germany to help her.
it took us at least 45 minutes to drive out here and a half an hour to find you..
counterfeit plates were designed by hitler's regime as a means of destroying the economies of the enemy.
if a set of those plates has surfaced now, and if we get our hands on them....
you just said that we couldn't leave germany, and here we are still in germany.
come on, we left word at the hotel where we could be reached.
his contacts were probably here in tegernsee or here in bad tolz.
yeah, but how are we gonna find out who they are?
you insinuated into this enterprise with the assurance that any authorities would be handled.
i have deflected every investigation that looked like it was coming near you.
now, i know you may not agree with me, but it could've happened to anybody.
and i don't want her to think i'm just over here having a high-heel good time.
mueller has a cousin who runs a sawmill on the outskirts of munich, place called solln.
now, my information, which is very inside says that he and this cousin have been joined at the hip for the last six months.
if i check in late, he's liable to call out the troops and blow the deal.
okay, well, uh, tell him you got a good lead but fill in the details later.
all he does is sit around all day babbling about some seven foot monster.
yeah, and the only other clue we've got are those mops, stuffed in their mouths.
the boys made their rounds last night and here is the collection.
yeah, and it would've been double if it wasn't for this devastating tragic turn of events.
i have the utmost regard for the chief, and his department.
as i've said, he's conducting a massive search for the monster right now.
i want this thing found and i want this thing killed!
the mayor has notified the governor and he's prepared to give us all the assistance we need.
clancy, you will do as you're told or you'll find yourself walking a beat in the city dump!

now you don't understand the seriousness of this situation here, boy!
how dare you discuss my son's life or death like this.
all he does is sit around all day babbling about some seven foot monster.
yeah, and the only other clue we've got are those mops, stuffed in their mouths.
we think it's a crime to let that property go to waste as a dump.
you are aware that would place our new toxic waste dump only 20 feet from the reservoir for the entire area.
i have the utmost regard for the chief, and his department.

here, among the towering skyscrapers, civilization is guided by men of progress and the wonders of technology.
but for all this industrial advancement, there is a price to pay.

boss says if he doesn't want to cooperate, we should make love to him.
we think it's a crime to let that property go to waste as a dump.
you are aware, of course, that that would place our new toxic chemical dump just 20 feet from the reservoir for the entire area.

our story takes place at the tromaville health club where a young man named melvin furd works.
melvin's entire life, in fact entire being was changed by toxic chemical waste.

all we are interested in your opinion of lieutenant, , but now it is a matter of internal control.
i know he would be very careful to respect the rules ,
whittaker unless you tell me, can you arrange for retention of evidence.
the problem is that captain boyd gave the whole case internal control.
a find in the way of internal control can have fatal consequences.
if you got lucky once, does not mean that he'll be the second time.
for example, what i found that lymon and coe were under investigation and before the armory opljaèkana, sluèajan was just a guess.

well, this envelope contains some very important papers, and i'd like not to have to keep it in my suite unguarded.
well, we have safe-deposit boxes here for the convenience of our guests.
mr. carrington, steven asked me to tell you that adam phoned.
he'll be back from istanbul soon, and the job has been done.
i want you to know how sorry i am about this.
but i'm sure that it's going to work out for the three of you.
i mean, if you think it's necessary, you can call in other specialists from anywhere in the world.
obviously that's exactly the procedure we'd follow if we had to.
but all that can be done is what we're already doing.
maintaining her temperature, keeping her well hydrated and making sure that she keeps breathing adequately.
i was wondering what time you'd like me to tell the pilot to be standing by for us.
he has to be back here by 9 tonight in order to take henderson to fort worth.
look, i really don't feel like going, listening to a lot of boring banker's talk and having to gossip with their equally boring wives.
look, alexis, colbyco might be prepared to thumb its corporate nose at stillman banking money.
do you make a habit of listening in on other people's conversations?
oh, look, dex, i came out here a while ago to get some air.
has scarlett changed her mind about fun and games on the porch of mama's sky-top plantation?
when someone calls my bluff, i guess i throw in my hand.
blake, i had a dream last night about a girl i knew a long time ago.
six of us had gone out boating one day on a lake.
and suddenly there was a storm and the old boat turned over.
two of us couldn't swim and the others were heading back to shore, even though we were screaming for help.
it's rough watching a child go through something like that, i know.
just watching her, it reminded me of all of the people that i've loved and lost.
do you think that now the crisis is over, i can hold her?
well, it is only 48 hours, and she still is in the incubator.
i'll place 40.000 on albert in the third race in milano.

when he is told to think of ball-costumes for the king and his ministers he creates a plan.
at midnight when the festivities are at their climax the huge hall doors open and eight mammoth gorillas enter the room.
they are chained to each other and cause fear amongst the audience
of course the king and his ministers are in these costumes created by the jester.
you may now think, i had written these letters and arranged... that she was seen as guilty.
sure as a friend i knew many details of their life, but i was innocent.
at midnight when the festivities are at their climax the huge hall doors open and eight mammoth gorillas enter the room.
they are chained to each other and cause fear amongst the audience
"hop-frog" climbs down the chandelier rope and fixes the chains of the gorillas onto a clamp.
the next instant they are tugged in the air and dangle on the rope

because of detraction of an unknown i got closer to this woman.

if you don't mind, ahmed, i'm lust going over my notes for this press statement.
if you are tying to avoid a conversation with me, that is a vey poor excuse.
there is not a word there that you have not studied to the core by now.
besides, the subject of beautiful women is not exactly anathema to you.
i would líke to make ít clear, however, that although thís deal has been made wíth a foreígn government, ít ís ín no sense a polítícal deal.
it ís, rather than that, for the good of the entíre world.
after all, you're gonna be working vey closely with him when we get back home.
when we get back home, the man i'm looking forward to working closely with is not eric grayson.
besides, you really wouldn't want me with you in hollywood with all those pretty, bikinied morsels dying to seduce you.
alexis, i stopped sleeping around with morsels, bikinied or otherwise, the day i fell in love with you.
well, i am going to have to finish up business in l.a. as fast as i can and come flying back to you with some vey old-fashioned thoughts.
like a man and a woman belonging only to each other.
you are here, young lady, only because my wife is pregnant.
and as for what you call attraction to me, you'd better forget it, right now.
i've been looking for you because i got off the phone to a newspaper in bismarck.
and i found out there is an institution there for the criminally insane.
and when i saw that photo of grayson and i confronted her with it...
blake, do you remember when i missed that meeting with you at the capitol because of the note trading thing?
and she wanted to go back and find you and your father, and ask him to forgive her.
so finally one night she said, yes, she'd go to denver.
and you used to work closely with him from time to time.
did you ever meet a man who once worked for my father named matthew blaisdel?
you know, i have to give my mother credit for one thing.
she tried to warn me about peter and what she termed, "his lack of love for children."
you got as much media coverage as a head of state.
but now that you're back, i hope we can concentrate on party business.
i don't know them, but i respect their right not to have their name dragged through this kind of dirt.
so you make whatever excuse you have to do to save your hide, but i'm resigning as party chairman as we speak.
because this deal is a natural, it's a once in a lifetime thing.
and nothing and no one is gonna screw it up for me.
this is your bedroom, and my bedroom and sitting room are there.
the connecting door will remain locked from my side unless i have a specific reason for unlocking it.
you are in the mood for champagne, even though it is morning here.
oh, i'm always in the mood for champagne, rashid, particularly when i see an old friend again.
i didn't do it, i tell you, i didn't do it.
...the men at the hotel gave a very good description of you.
and so you left with the spoils of victory in the shape of that battered hat, and a most unimpeachable christmas goose.
both of which i would willingly have returned to their rightful owners, mr. holmes, but the truth is, i didn't know how.
i discussed the matter with the good lady, and we decided that i would bring both the goose and the hat to you, mr. holmes, seeing as how even the slightest of problems is of interest to you in your particular line of occupation.
i hope you don't think i'm wasting your time, mr. holmes.
the countess of morcar is offering a thousand pounds for the return of the blue carbuncle.
inspector bradstreet of b division is in charge of the case, and has arrested mr. john horner, a plumber, age 36, who protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
circumstantial evidence was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes.
horner, who showed signs of intense emotion during the proceedings, faded away at the conclusion and was carried from the court.
i suppose that homely as it looks, that thing has some deadly story linked to it that is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.
no, no, no, no, it is just one of those whimsical little instance that will occur when you have four million people jostling each other within the space of a few square miles.
he had foresight, but less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate an evil influence, probably drink.
this may account also for the fact that his wife has ceased to love him.
he's middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
it is also highly improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.
ah, here is the foresight, these securers are never sold upon hats.
if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take precaution against the wind.
the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been cut recently, and that he anoints it with lime-cream, can all to be gathered by an inspection of the lower part of the lining, watson.
witness the moisture, obviously a free perspirer, therefore, not in the best of training.
when i see a man with a week's accumulation of dust upon his hat, and his wife has allowed him to go out in such a state,
i fear that he has been unfortunate enough to lose his wife's affections.
just a minute, just a minute, how do you deduce that there is no gas laid on in his house?
one tallow candle stain, or even two, might come by chance;
well, what of it, man, has it come back to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?
no, no sir, no sir, but see, see what the wife found in its crop.
so, now, we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and to ascertaining what part he had to play in this little mystery.
found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat.
well, i'm sure he will keep an eye on the evening papers, for the poor man, the loss was a heavy one.
oh, peterson, uh, just nip down to the advertising agency and have this put in all the evening papers.
it's a bonny thing, just see how it glints and sparkles.
of course, it is a nucleus and focus of crime, every good stone is.
there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
who would think that so pretty a toy could be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?
i would have advertised its loss but shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were.
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.
it would have been of little use to anyone had we not done so.
but we have another goose upon the sideboard there, which i presume will answer your purpose equally well.
of course, we have kept the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, if you so wish.
it might be useful to me as relics of my adventure, but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjectamembra of my old acquaintance could possibly be to me.
- i shall confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon your sideboard.
i would be interested to know where the other bird came from.
you see, i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown bird.
it would be of great interest to me to know precisely how it came into your possession.
that day, sir, i had finished work early and left the museum in the afternoon.
i had a little business to attend to before calling in at the alpha public house.
several of us who work in the museum frequent that establishment, and this year our good host,
mr. windigate, had instigated a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence each week, we were to receive a bird at christmas.
needs must, mr. windigate, and at this season of the year more than ever, we must not deprive those we love, or even those to whom we are married.
and so, if you will set aside this impressive peace offering,
it really is of no matter, but i fail to see why you should get so warm over a trifle.
warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as i am.
when i pay good money for a good article that should be an end of it;
but it's where are the geese, who have you sold them to, how much will you take for them?
you would think those were the only geese in the world, the amount of fuss that's made over them.
well, i can assure you that i have no connection with anybody else who's made inquiries.
i know that you are trying to find out the whereabouts of some geese sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to our friend, mr. breckinridge, over there.
who in turn, sold them to mr. windigate, of the alpha public house.
and what a wretched little shrimp it is, to be sure, there's enough blood in him for felony.
i have almost every link in the chain, ryder, you need tell me very little.
now tell me, how came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market?
tell me the truth, now, for that is your only hope of safety.
there was nowhere in the hotel where it would be safe.
so, i went out, as if on some commission, and made for my sister's house to think things over.
i went into the back yard where she kept the geese, smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.
i remember that my stomach wasn't gonna stop feeling like a bag of ferrets till i found somewhere to hide the stone for a while, when suddenly, i looked at the geese, which was hissing and huddling in the corner of the yard.
my sister had told me that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present.
i picked out one of the birds, a fine thick one with a gray head.
i ran as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge;
but he had sold the lot, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.
i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.
maybe i am committing a felony, but i may be saving a soul.
holmes, i cannot contemplate eating while john horner is still on remand.
do you suppose that bradstreet or one of his colleagues might still be at their desks?
i'm a lucky man, a wife and kids like i've got, means as good as a king.
so, it's the doll for the girl, and the boat for the boy, right?
last night i was on my way home from a little, uh, celebration.
well, at this time of the year some of us commissionairs meet to -
i was a constable about to apprehend him for the breaking of the window.
and so you left with the spoils of victory in the shape of that battered hat, and a most unimpeachable christmas goose.
inspector bradstreet of b division is in charge of the case, and has arrested mr. john horner, a plumber, age 36, who protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
circumstantial evidence was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes.
but there are points in connection with it which are not devoid of interest, even of instruction.
i suppose that homely as it looks, that thing has some deadly story linked to it that is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.
and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the past three years, although now he has fallen upon evil days.
he had foresight, but less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate an evil influence, probably drink.
he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect, and now he leads a sedentary life, is out of training entirely.
he's middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.
if this man could afford so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.
if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take precaution against the wind.
but as you see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, a weakening nature.
witness the moisture, obviously a free perspirer, therefore, not in the best of training.
but his - his wife, you said she had ceased to love him.
one tallow candle stain, or even two, might come by chance;
but when i see, watson, no less than five, he never got candle stains from a gas jet, watson.
the stone came from the goose, the goose came from mr. henry baker, the gentleman with the shabby hat and all the other characteristics.
so, now, we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and to ascertaining what part he had to play in this little mystery.
found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat.
mr. henry baker can have same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b, baker street, clear and concise.
i've been on the straight for years, ever since i married jenny.
if you don't, and when the judge hears about your previous conviction, you might never see your pretty wife again.
in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue instead of ruby red.
in spite of its youth, it already has a sinister history.
there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.
i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.
but we have another goose upon the sideboard there, which i presume will answer your purpose equally well.
it is about the same weight, and perfectly fresh, as you can see.
i would be interested to know where the other bird came from.
you see, i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown bird.
i had a little business to attend to before calling in at the alpha public house.
several of us who work in the museum frequent that establishment, and this year our good host,
mr. windigate, had instigated a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence each week, we were to receive a bird at christmas.
there we are, mr. baker, a very fine bird, as promised.
and so, if you will set aside this impressive peace offering,
i shall fortify myself for the fray with a large glass of whiskey, and a pint of your most excellent beer.
i want to believe you, john, i do, really, but i can't argue with what the police is saying.
but they're only saying that cause i was there on the day.
warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as i am.
when i pay good money for a good article that should be an end of it;
but it's where are the geese, who have you sold them to, how much will you take for them?

inspector bradstreet of b division is in charge of the case, and has arrested mr. john horner, a plumber, age 36, who protested his innocence in the strongest terms.
circumstantial evidence was so strong that the case has been referred to the assizes.
but there are points in connection with it which are not devoid of interest, even of instruction.
i suppose that homely as it looks, that thing has some deadly story linked to it that is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime.
and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the past three years, although now he has fallen upon evil days.
he had foresight, but less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate an evil influence, probably drink.
he has, however, retained some degree of self-respect, and now he leads a sedentary life, is out of training entirely.
he's middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining.
if this man could afford so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world.
if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take precaution against the wind.
but as you see that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace it, a weakening nature.
witness the moisture, obviously a free perspirer, therefore, not in the best of training.
but his - his wife, you said she had ceased to love him.
one tallow candle stain, or even two, might come by chance;
but when i see, watson, no less than five, he never got candle stains from a gas jet, watson.
the stone came from the goose, the goose came from mr. henry baker, the gentleman with the shabby hat and all the other characteristics.
so, now, we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and to ascertaining what part he had to play in this little mystery.
found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat.
mr. henry baker can have same by applying at 6:30 this evening at 221b, baker street, clear and concise.
i've been on the straight for years, ever since i married jenny.
if you don't, and when the judge hears about your previous conviction, you might never see your pretty wife again.
in the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed.
it was found in the banks of the amoy river in southern china, and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue instead of ruby red.
in spite of its youth, it already has a sinister history.
there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.
i did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them.
but we have another goose upon the sideboard there, which i presume will answer your purpose equally well.
it is about the same weight, and perfectly fresh, as you can see.
i would be interested to know where the other bird came from.
you see, i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown bird.
i had a little business to attend to before calling in at the alpha public house.
several of us who work in the museum frequent that establishment, and this year our good host,
mr. windigate, had instigated a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence each week, we were to receive a bird at christmas.
there we are, mr. baker, a very fine bird, as promised.
and so, if you will set aside this impressive peace offering,
i shall fortify myself for the fray with a large glass of whiskey, and a pint of your most excellent beer.
i want to believe you, john, i do, really, but i can't argue with what the police is saying.
but they're only saying that cause i was there on the day.
warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as i am.
when i pay good money for a good article that should be an end of it;
but it's where are the geese, who have you sold them to, how much will you take for them?
you would think those were the only geese in the world, the amount of fuss that's made over them.
what, do you think i wouldn't know, me, who's been handling fowl since i was a nipper?
i'll tell you, all the birds that went to the alpha were town bred.
now then, mr. cocksure, you see these here books here, well, this is a list of all the folk what i buy off.
now, on this page is all me country folk, and these on this side in red ink are all me town suppliers.
excuse me, but i could not help overhearing the conversation you had just now with that salesman.
i think i can be of assistance to you in this matter.
i can hardly explain to you my interest in the matter.
then i suggest that we carry on this conversation in rather more comfort.
you knew from local gossip that horner had been concerned in some such matter before.
so what did you do, you made some small job in milady's room, you and your confederate cusack.
i thought it was best to get away with the stone as quick as i could, for i didn't know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room.
there was nowhere in the hotel where it would be safe.
i remember that my stomach wasn't gonna stop feeling like a bag of ferrets till i found somewhere to hide the stone for a while, when suddenly, i looked at the geese, which was hissing and huddling in the corner of the yard.
my sister had told me that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present.
i picked out one of the birds, a fine thick one with a gray head.
i pushed the stone down its throat as far as my finger could reach.
maybe i am committing a felony, but i may be saving a soul.
send him to jail now, you make him a jailbird for life.
i'm a lucky man, a wife and kids like i've got, means as good as a king.
so, it's the doll for the girl, and the boat for the boy, right?
last night i was on my way home from a little, uh, celebration.
well, at this time of the year some of us commissionairs meet to -
i was a constable about to apprehend him for the breaking of the window.

the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been cut recently.

but we have another goose upon the sideboard there, which i presume will answer your purpose equally well.

i shall confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon your sideboard.
i would be interested to know where the other bird came from.

now, on this page is all me country folk, and these on this side in red ink are all me town suppliers.
i know that you are trying to find out the whereabouts of some geese sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to our friend, mr. breckinridge, over there.
who in turn, sold them to mr. windigate, of the alpha public house.
and what a wretched little shrimp it is, to be sure, there's enough blood in him for felony.
i have almost every link in the chain, ryder, you need tell me very little.
think of my father, think of my mother, it would break their hearts.
i mean, i never went wrong before, i never will again.
there was nowhere in the hotel where it would be safe.
so, i went out, as if on some commission, and made for my sister's house to think things over.
i went into the back yard where she kept the geese.
smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.
i remember that my stomach wasn't gonna stop feeling like a bag of ferrets till i found somewhere to hide the stone for a while.
when suddenly, i looked at the geese, which was hissing and huddling in the corner of the yard.
my sister had told me that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present.
i picked out one of the birds, a fine thick one with a gray head.
i did what she said, mr. holmes, and i carried the bird to my pal, we got a knife, and we opened it up, my heart turned to water.
there was no sign of the stone, and i knew some terrible mistake must have occurred.
i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.
maybe i am committing a felony, but i may be saving a soul.
holmes, i cannot contemplate eating while john horner is still on remand.
do you suppose that bradstreet or one of his colleagues might still be at their desks?
i didn't do it, i tell you, i didn't do it.
...the men at the hotel gave a very good description of you.
and so you left with the spoils of victory in the shape of that battered hat, and a most unimpeachable christmas goose.
both of which i would willingly have returned to their rightful owners, mr. holmes, but the truth is, i didn't know how.
i discussed the matter with the good lady, and we decided that i would bring both the goose and the hat to you, mr. holmes, seeing as how even the slightest of problems is of interest to you in your particular line of occupation.
i hope you don't think i'm wasting your time, mr. holmes.

he had foresight, but less now than formerly, pointing to a moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his fortunes, seems to indicate an evil influence, probably drink.
this may account also for the fact that his wife has ceased to love him.
he's middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream.
it is also highly improbable that he has gas laid on in his house.
ah, here is the foresight, these securers are never sold upon hats.
if this man ordered one, it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his way to take precaution against the wind.
the further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is grizzled, that it has been cut recently, and that he anoints it with lime-cream, can all to be gathered by an inspection of the lower part of the lining, watson.
witness the moisture, obviously a free perspirer, therefore, not in the best of training.
when i see a man with a week's accumulation of dust upon his hat, and his wife has allowed him to go out in such a state,
i fear that he has been unfortunate enough to lose his wife's affections.
just a minute, just a minute, how do you deduce that there is no gas laid on in his house?
one tallow candle stain, or even two, might come by chance;
well, what of it, man, has it come back to life and flapped off through the kitchen window?
no, no sir, no sir, but see, see what the wife found in its crop.
so, now, we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman, and to ascertaining what part he had to play in this little mystery.
found at the corner of goodge street, a goose and a black felt hat.
well, i'm sure he will keep an eye on the evening papers, for the poor man, the loss was a heavy one.
oh, peterson, uh, just nip down to the advertising agency and have this put in all the evening papers.
it's a bonny thing, just see how it glints and sparkles.
of course, it is a nucleus and focus of crime, every good stone is.
there have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallized charcoal.
who would think that so pretty a toy could be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?
i would have advertised its loss but shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were.
i had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird.
it would have been of little use to anyone had we not done so.
but we have another goose upon the sideboard there, which i presume will answer your purpose equally well.
of course, we have kept the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of your own bird, if you so wish.
it might be useful to me as relics of my adventure, but beyond that i can hardly see what use the disjectamembra of my old acquaintance could possibly be to me.
- i shall confine my attentions to the excellent bird which i perceive upon your sideboard.
i would be interested to know where the other bird came from.
you see, i am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and i have seldom seen a better grown bird.
it would be of great interest to me to know precisely how it came into your possession.
that day, sir, i had finished work early and left the museum in the afternoon.
i had a little business to attend to before calling in at the alpha public house.
several of us who work in the museum frequent that establishment, and this year our good host,
mr. windigate, had instigated a goose club, by which, on consideration of some few pence each week, we were to receive a bird at christmas.
needs must, mr. windigate, and at this season of the year more than ever, we must not deprive those we love, or even those to whom we are married.
and so, if you will set aside this impressive peace offering,
it really is of no matter, but i fail to see why you should get so warm over a trifle.
warm, you'd be as warm if you were as pestered as i am.
when i pay good money for a good article that should be an end of it;
but it's where are the geese, who have you sold them to, how much will you take for them?
you would think those were the only geese in the world, the amount of fuss that's made over them.
well, i can assure you that i have no connection with anybody else who's made inquiries.
i know that you are trying to find out the whereabouts of some geese sold by mrs. oakshott, of brixton road, to our friend, mr. breckinridge, over there.
who in turn, sold them to mr. windigate, of the alpha public house.
and what a wretched little shrimp it is, to be sure, there's enough blood in him for felony.
i have almost every link in the chain, ryder, you need tell me very little.
now tell me, how came the stone into the goose, and how came the goose into the open market?
tell me the truth, now, for that is your only hope of safety.
there was nowhere in the hotel where it would be safe.
so, i went out, as if on some commission, and made for my sister's house to think things over.
i went into the back yard where she kept the geese, smoked a pipe, and wondered what it would be best to do.
i remember that my stomach wasn't gonna stop feeling like a bag of ferrets till i found somewhere to hide the stone for a while, when suddenly, i looked at the geese, which was hissing and huddling in the corner of the yard.
my sister had told me that i might have the pick of her geese for a christmas present.
i picked out one of the birds, a fine thick one with a gray head.
i ran as hard as my feet would carry me to this man breckinridge;
but he had sold the lot, and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone.
i am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies.
maybe i am committing a felony, but i may be saving a soul.
holmes, i cannot contemplate eating while john horner is still on remand.
do you suppose that bradstreet or one of his colleagues might still be at their desks?
and i'm gonna have to re-examine all the evidence in the case because somewhere there is something we've overlooked.
who saw steven at the hotel that night and turned him in so he could testify against you?
it seems that everyone wants a statement from you, blake, about denver-carrington being back in business again with the help of dominique deveraux.
i guess it's time for a smile and some thank you's are in order.
my problem is that carrington one is drying up, and the other two fields are a long way from being moneymakers.
so, what i need right now is a source of ready capital.
if i'm gonna make a reasonable bid, yes, i'm gonna need quite a bit more.
i'm sorry, blake, but deveraux one here has dried up too.
the only people that did like him were the ladies, because he was good looking.
and a good-looking tennis pro is a natural for giving lessons on the court and in the sack.
your motto here at colbyco should be, "we do it right."
the company condo is delightful, from the furnishings down to the chambermaids.
tell me this then, what can colbyco offer that denver-carrington can't?
well, let's just say that colbyco's position is a solid one.
so not only does denver-carrington have a solid line of credit in order to buy the flatlands field-
but in exchange for this, you'll let me in on the south china sea deal.
so i'm gonna say this to you right in front of blake.
i'm very sorry about your interpretation of my behaviour the last time we met.
and if indeed i did appear to be acting in an untoward way, please accept my apology along with this small token.
i recently sold most of my jewellery except for my wedding ring.
why didn't you tell me you were negotiating with him for that field?
because i know how you feel about him and i didn't want to upset you.
i only promised that you wouldn't have to see him again.
well, he showed up here unexpectedly, if you hadn't come home two hours before you were supposed to, you would not have seen him again.
colbyco is my company, and you no longer work for it.
i have a contract and i'll continue working for the company until the board cancels it.
and it would also save us a lot of time figuring out who are our friends were and who they weren't.
but the world, the real world, is a lot more complicated than that.
what i have to know is, can l count on you for support, for trust?
or are you gonna keep on challenging me and doubting me in all of this?
-further below ground, underneath the generating machine is a vast cavern being dug out by the slave gangs.
it is intended for some other machinery of the masters' own design.
i don't know what kind of a reputation you're trying to make for yourself.
but if you're trying to impress, you're going a funny way about it.
he's noticed you have a mind of your own, all right.
i wonder if he, like me, suspects there may be a defect in your capping?
well, it was one of those cradles of nuclear physics in the 20th century.
now the masters use it as a training ground for the power elite.
a kind of intellectual equivalent of the games, where the best brains are selected for the city.
i was sent there by julius in the hope that i would qualify.
i have no doubt of your loyalty, will, or of your desire to serve me and my colleagues.
i have no doubt the fundamental requirements of the capping process have been achieved in you, else your behaviour would be more that of a vagrant.
but humans are the closest relatives we masters have found in space.
i've got so much information for you to take back to julius.
the tiny size of the human brain and the incredible shortness of the human lifespan.
an early cybernetic form of life was born, and with it the possibility of a human interstellar civilisation as great and glittering, perhaps, as our own.
we are preparing to send back to trion the most appealing artefacts and organisms of the human earth.
perhaps you would like to see some of the selections we have made.
your mind must be pure and free from evil whilst you offer service to your master.
the funny thing is, boll, my master likes me just the way i am.
if you confess, the slave master does have it in his power to forgive you.
well, if he is convinced that you are sincere, he may find use for you as a member of the guard.
but what chance have i of seeing her alive on trion?
and the thought of her pleasing the masters there, does that do nothing to assuage your pain?
1 know that you rebelled against the imposition of the cap.
1 know why you travelled all the way from england to the white mountain rejoinder julius and the free men.
[s if possible, you wonder, that even now fritz may be down in the cellar at the city laying the fuse from a magazine of powder kegs which will blast open the bowels of the reactor, cut off the power to all us poor coggies,
and crack the dome of the city to poison all masters with human air?
well, it turns out that the masters don't really run the show here after all.
those taller pyramids over there link to the pool of fire.
to begin with, he thought he was being summoned himself because of the good relationship he'd established with me.
but when it turned out to be me the cognosc wanted, he wasn't very happy.
but the one thing i got really clear is that coggy doesn't even like the masters.
the idea of us having a go at them appealed to him, even if we don't stand a cat in hell's chance of winning.
and if so, is he going to tell us which ones first?
the cognosc will do what is right, and will guide us in our decisions.
his demand for more energy has made a huge increase in the need for cooling water.
to get more volumes filled, they've decided to bypass the filters.
this equipment is intended to reconstitute the atmosphere here, to make it compatible with masters' needs.
it will mean the total annihilation of the human race, with the exception of those few specimens selected to survive in glass houses, like a human zoo.
because your civilised ancestors were threatening the peace of space, remember?
well, even if that was true then, that certainly isn't the case now.
see the state the masters are in now, just because i'm depriving them of a little power?
they have no experience of darkness, because they come from a world with three suns.
he thought it was wrong, but that he's in a minority here.
he said he was going to seek wiser counsel from the great brain of space.
one of our brethren claims that the cognosc summoned his slave to an audience.
i want to know what really happened at that meeting, and i want you to mobilise the guards and arrest this slave.
if they discover you've killed him, all hell will break loose.
that's precisely why we can't waste any time getting out of here.
i used to think fritz was such a pain, but he's been quite fantastic.
yeah, he's certainly made a most useful assessment of the mechanics of the city.
clearly, a real cap gives off some sort of a signal which ours do not.
in the city, my master was suspicious that i might not be capped, or at least that i might not have been capped properly.
some even run away from good homes to join the circus.
if they show a talent he can use, he'll allow them to stay.
then after the final performance in geneva, we shall go together to the ruined palace.
(whispering) but i must ask you to keep it a secret from the others.
(stifling sneeze) i glad we've been... able to do business with you.
and we have been delighted to have you here with us.
now i must go and supervise my rabble and get the show on the road.
i will send casimir to the black caravan to sort out some accommodation for you.
and what will happen when we don't show up for the performance?
ali, the black guards, the whole town will be after us.
and that means that it will be poisonous to all of us... (all exclaiming) ...to all our animals and plants.
this is the news we are taking back to the free men in the mountain.
we must go as far as we can and as fast as possible before they find out what's happened.
come on, i can hear the river, the road'll run beside it.
if it's the same tripod, the one that's been following us, why hasn't it taken us before now?
maybe it wants to know what we'll do or where we'll go.
and, well, two and a half extra pairs of hands would be a great help.
and of course, with the six girls to marry off and only the one of them spoken for...
but because you've been hurt, you throw it all back in their faces.
now, is this how your eloise would have wanted you to behave?
and though these partings grieve us, the memory of your friendship stays, and this will never leave us.
we wish you joy, we wish you health, pray in your hearts receive us.
in england and in parts of france, where my cousin and i met jean-paul, young people are capped only when they've made a journey and visited other places.
three days ago, we heard about your festival and decided to come here.
my colleague tells me a good family gave you shelter, and you betrayed their trust.
he insists you return to his headquarters for questioning by his superiors.
if you tell what you know, this girl, this eloise who serves the tripods, she can be found.
she is capped, of course, but so will you be, soon.
if you tell nothing, the tripods will make you a vagrant.
a man who makes such as these would be totally wasted with a destroyed brain.
your fool of a cousin tells you to leave home and you obey.
you meet a french boy you have never seen before and you take his word.
some are chosen for their beauty, others for their strength and speed.
we believe that within this city only the young and strong can survive.
it is surprising, but no accident, that many of our great celebrations, capping day, which we all enjoyed yesterday, and say, september's harvest festival, stand so close together in our calendar.
for nature and the tripods are the two essentials for the continuation and well-being of mankind.
consider the unthinkable barbarity of deliberately killing other human beings and how it must have been in the dark days before the tripods came.
for centuries, aggression dominated man's activities, ruining his every endeavor, and in particular, making impossible any true partnership with nature, such as we now enjoy in our more enlightened times.
perhaps one day i'll find a way of getting back at them.
to do that, you have to make sure you're never capped.
if you're on the run and want a boat, you've come to the right man.
we're a couple of crew light and i can put in a word.
do we put in to any ports before we reach africa?
now, how do you think we get our supplies and cargo?
this handful on deck will not sail a ship like this to africa.
and you have no authority to take on crew in any french port.
you will discharge your cargo and take on board the supplies for which you are scheduled.
if you do not leave the port on the next tide,
you'll never get past the guards above, so this is the way you must go.
the water is not very deep, but you must keep low because there is always one guard on watch.
in a fever, it is not possible to control the tongue.
you were determined not to speak and said so aloud in english.
you saw paris, what it must've been like when men lived there.
if the tripods could beat the people who built paris, well, what's the point of a few men in some mountains hundreds of kilometres away, kidding themselves they're free?
so, when the year shall be young, and the sun and moon are equal, they shall be married.
i announce the day to be the spring equinox of the year to come.
i may be humble, but i can see life must have been much easier, more exciting and that ordinary people must have had skills we can't even dream of.
history teaches, and archaeology proves simply that man's skills, as you call them, were employed entirely in warfare and exploitation, and that the ordinary people, so-called, approved them thoroughly.
he say's he'll do it after the final study period tonight.
then you can inform him he's forfeited his chance of selection.
so you see, if you drop a stone into a pond, the waves spread out from the point of impact.
what the ancestors discovered was that there are waves in light, just as there are waves in water.
but the great difference between water waves and light waves is their speed.
if you drop a rock into the narrowest part of our lake, it takes the first wave about six seconds to reach the other side.
now, once the ancestors understood that, they found that they could use light to do some very remarkable things.
and some of those will be the subject of our next lesson.
a chance to look closely at tripod technology in their own city?
oh, i wish my old limbs would give me such a chance.
through the miracle of the cap, which is given to us all as we cross the threshold into adult life, the violence of our emotions is held in check and all youthful thoughts of rebellion are taken away.
today, the tripod comes amongst us once again to perform that miracle on our daughter brigitte and our sons philippe and jack.
so under my leadership, we are trying to let our heads rule our hearts.
what we are attempting now is to find out the tripods' weaknesses.
that's why we need young men like you, to be taken as champions into the tripod city.
to discover the secrets of their power and to bring those secrets back to us.
well, we could prove that they are not gods, as the capped believe.
we could show they are just machines with men inside them.
then surely we can convince more of the capped that they've been fooled.
i wish a solution to the problem could be found that way.
now, not only did they look more like the human brain in form, they began to be superior in performance.
what we believe then happened was that the artificial intelligences became discontented with the illogical behaviour and the violence of their human creators.
what we have to do now is to recover control over our own destiny, which our ancestors had forfeited by their own stupidity.
free friends, this meal is to celebrate the selection of our candidates for the games.
i must try to stem what i know will be a flood of disappointment from one who has trained so hard.
and whose athletic achievements have been so great that he must have felt himself to be an automatic choice.
then finally, we come to the last athlete to be chosen.
in the lightweight division of the boxing, we shall be represented by will parker.
don't worry, kate, it'll all have grown back before we leave.
mark and henry will provide an escort for the third pair, will and fritz.
but it's his boat, and he knows the river and he knows the black guards, so you do as he says.
you'll see the river in daylight, follow it downstream and you'll come to the ancient city of basel.
he has a great interest in all the sciences, as the ancestors called them.
i think, from what i've heard, that you really have nothing to fear.
in my opinion, the games are a symptom of our decadence.
you've only to jump five or six metres and they make you a hero.
still proud to be able to tell you that he... sacrificed his life to the service of the tripods.
it is an honour to have known of such a man.
this feast has been sumptuously prepared to celebrate the marriage of johann and gretel.
let us also dedicate it to the greater glorification of our lords and masters, the tripods!
we captured one a couple of days ago, but during the night, an accomplice released him from the pit.
no sign of any strangers in bachara during the last couple of days, i suppose, krummel?
for a whole year, we have given up our lives to become fit in mind and body, for one purpose only, to compete in the games for the supreme prize, the chance of serving the tripods in the city of gold.
please, this man goetz has already put us in danger of being too late.
but if you win the championship, i shall never see you again.
i know it's an honour to serve the tripods in their city but...
today is the day of champions and once again i ask you to join with me in dedicating our best endeavours to the service of the tripods.
first events of the morning are the finals of the sprints, beginning with the men's 100 metres.
i could find somewhere to live near here, where i can see the river and watch the movements of the tripods.
observe the materials they bring to the city, the things they need.
renata comes from those lands to the east once called napier.
only the second girl from that country to receive the honour of service to the tripods.
she's very beautiful, but i can't say that i've seen her.
in the city, the desire to serve the masters transcends all.
i wish to serve the masters to the best of my ability.
i know i can do much better in here than in the slave camp.
it's not the privileges i'm after, except to serve the masters.
it might be as well to give the boy a trial.
i don't want to upset the guards by appearing to encourage defection.
he only wants to serve the masters at a higher level.
this place was built by the ancestors to produce a power called electricity.
it's called a fission reactor, and it was once capable of supplying electric power to much of northern europe.
not even hitler may he rest in peace, would have known.
you know what are the agricultural innovations introduced in the xix century?
at her age, i washed, i ironed and helped my mother.
...but she, all she does is wreck the house and wets her bed every night.
it's just not right, it isn't for someone to come and kill you!
i mean, look, a girl like me, living alone with so many expensive objects...
not even hitler may he rest in peace, would have known.

now, cover 1 unfortunately will give the russians a fairly specific area to photograph from their satellites.
covers 2 and 3 pinpoint exactly where our anti-ballistic missiles will be at any given time.
i want you to wear that ring because it's beautiful, so you wear it.
and when you're wearing it, you're gonna think of me and i really want you to think of me.
i think it's really exciting, but i wish you'd told me you were going.
i didn't know there was another ghiberti in italy until i got the phone call.
i like security and i happened to find it in a numbered swiss bank account.
now, you're free to feel as morally superior to me as it pleases you just as long as you pay me in cash.
you're gonna find him on the roof of that phony mail truck walking off with the third sheet of the pliofilm.
he is gonna have the whole ball of wax unless we stop him right now.
when you came to my apartment tonight, why didn't you tell me who you were?
maybe my tender ego was bruised because you didn't recognise me.
and i don't like the way they humiliated me in that courtroom.
so go ahead and shout it from the rooftops if you really want to.
you walked out on me the other day in my father's house before i could say eveything that i felt.
then you hung up on me when i tried to continue the conversation.
i won't press charges if you refuse to mary adam and go back to paris.
you're not going to tell adam the real reason for this and neither will i.
and i guess i should've realised that any kind of decency would have been wasted.
of course, you're going back to paris to that frenchman who kicked you around and treated you like dirt.
it's lust that my instructor back in new york gave me exercises that need a man's help.
for instance, in order to do one of them, i need a strong, balancing hand right here in the small of my back.
i intend to get danny back, with or without your agreement.
so if we have to go back to court again, we go.
what i do want is to be a real mother to my son.
and i intend to have him raised by a real man.
now, of this ten, my ownership position entitles me to 4.7 million.
now, that team is worth 50 million at least, and you know it.
twenty-five years of my life and they're tying to tell me it was all for nothing.
blake, banks can foreclose on a company, but they can't on a man.
miss deveraux, i still don't know who you are or what you want, and i don't really care.
i have to go and i'll tell my secretay that you're leaving.
yes, mrs. colby, but mr. dexter's on hís way up to see you.
harold, how many times have i told you not to send anybody up unless you've announced them first?
i really do have to go, but i'll tell you what.
how would you like to be my escort at the wedding tonight?
it all so exciting, mrs. colby, about your daughter getting married this afternoon.
and i'm sure her wedding will be just as beautiful as mr. and mrs. carrington's was.
well, your matron of honour has to get dressed, but i wanted to stop by and give you this.
oh, could it be the same shiny penny i gave you
you have the right to speak with an attorney and have the attorney present for your questioning.
if you so desire and can't afford one, an attorney will be...
if i can hit the right circuits, if it still works,
i think i can cut the gas supply to their sacrificial fire.
something must've happened to the master for him to be using kamelion.
he certainly went to a great deal of trouble to get him back.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
(michael) between you and me, bonnie... i can think of at least 10 different ways... i'd rather be spending my day off.
the auctioneer tells me that the stones alone should fetch about $3 million... the proceeds of which have already been earmarked to fund our various charities.
so you see why i wanted you two here with me.
hey, look, all i'm saying is, you know, you can't be too careful.
just when you least expect it, some punk pops up out of the woodwork... and points a finger at you.
your partner was shot under mysterious circumstances... and picked up before he got his cut.
which gives you even more reason for wanting to become someone else... in case he ever gets out and comes looking for you.
a small price to be born again without having to listen to a lot of sermons.
of course, that includes a new id, passport, credit cards, and all the other... little necessities of modern-day life.
hey, kltt, let's take him in and see what he can tell us, huh?
this is great. i mean, this is just what we needed, the man who never was.
you told me yourself it was more important for you to love him... than it was for him to love you.
maybe you suspected he didn't love you as much... and that he was only using you.
i'm sorry about that, michael, but i fail to see how that postpones our work.
well, whoever did it left her lying alone in the street.
it stands for either you walk out of here right now... or i call security and they bounce you out.
take a little picture of this and trace it, will you?
what better way to get us in tight with the men who caused stacy's accident?
and if we play our cards right, we might even draw out the car that hit her.
he told me he didn't have anything to do with her accident.
they'd had dinner earlier that evening... and then he was called out of town.
totally illegal to drive in this country by all civilized standards.
yeah, well, no one ever accused these guys of being civilized.
i turned off all of his functions except the homing signal.
i figured that would lead us to where taylor is keeping the dagger dx.
`cause the whole time you`re working it`s just your arms are holding you up.
it is not like some of the bar routines where you can hang down for a while.
- this is all upper body strength, it`s all arms so far so good
tell him what you are telling me about the kind of focus you have to have.
hi l`ve bought us cheeseburgers i thought you might be hungry.
actually my mother is on a veggie kick and l`ve been dying for a burger...
maybe he`s using you for an excuse not to face them.
don`t let him be your excuse for undoing all the wonderful work you`ve done.
yeah, maybe you`re the only one who got anything out of me being racked up
you`ve finally found a boyfriend you couldn`t run away from you
and you`re throwing a roadblock up in my way, because you make those turkeys think ... i can`t do something because l`m handicapped too.
let me tell you something pal l`m more than just the parts of my body that don`t work.
ritchie came home and said -tell him to forget what happened
tell him he`d better be on his toes because deke larson thinks he can beat him
lt`s always easier telling the other person to get along without the crutch.
oh come on, don`t you think you have a right to be scared.
you sure have a way of kicking out a guys crutch.
alright now l`ve got it kicked out, why don`t you go get some sleep.
well he`s got a chance now to do the same thing and you`re stealing that from him... because of your pride
you think at your age he needs to have the toughest father on the block?
i want to apologise for what i said earlier lt wasn`t true.
yeah it was, you are the first boy who couldn`t run away from me.
yeah well if that`s what he needs l`m the last person in the world to hold up as a shining example...
because i never amounted to a hill of beans, l`m just working stiff who never made it
and mr. melrose, and francine, and fred fielder and, gosh, don't get me started.
i love the cinema so much, i could talk you right into the ground.
someone hit my car twice in the parking lot and drove away.
you know how a thing like that can make your mind a total blank.
i put it in a place that no one would find it if i were to lose my wallet.
but i would be sure to be able to find it if i needed it.
but if my wallet should fall into the wrong hands, it wouldn't...
ha, you see, it's right there on the back of my checkbook.
i know, but i'm feeling kind of strange about this one.
a lot of people would like to get their hands on that material.
you see, a man hit my car, not once, but twice, and then he drove away.
i didn't get his name or his license number or his insurance company...
you know, i have such terrible, terrible luck with my home movies.
well, at least it took your mind off raul for a minute, huh?
i saw the whole thing, you know, if you, uh, need a witness.
she was parked here and this guy came in and hit her.
you're upset, but you'll feel better once you've talked to scotty.
i will feel better when i have every bit of film he has taken.
twice a year, we grind out a couple of documentaries on the romance of earthworms, and that's it.
i know, but people are supposed to believe that the cover is real.
now, look we have got couriers, technicians, double agents people who are known within the intelligence community.
if they can be connected with iff, our cover is blown.
of course i see that, why do you think i gave you the cassette?
look, you'll talk to scotty, he'll understand, everything will be all right.
look, lee, i know that film is very important to you and you are playing a wonderful director.
but philip and jamie and my mother are home and those men have my registration with my address on it.
i don't know how you can say that my mother should know me better than that.
i mean, you never can tell who's the type for what.
how about that, me in the middle of a shootout with feds running all over the place?
it's a good thing you told them what happened to me.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
and we have all lost men... entire operations, smuggling networks, profit centers.
and most of us, in our dealings with these men... have received a personal message of farewell from their leader, col. smith.
that will cost you two miles into town, and two miles back.
but i'll be easy on you, i'll give you 32 minutes.
the guy who comes in last has got to do extra running.
you know, hannibal, i hate to admit it... but i thought face was beginning to look good.
we'll get your family back for you so don't fall apart.
now let me talk to one of those sieazebaiis, i know is standing next to you.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
and most of us, in our dealings with these men... have received a personal message of farewell from their leader, col. smith.
so we all agreed to do something about mr. smith and his friends.
they said i had one hour to leave... and they'd kill me if i said a word.
look, you seem like a semi-nice girl... under all that greed and makeup.
mr. kyle, the people who work for me been asking what's going on.
they wanna know why they can't do their work at this end of the place?
if he isn't too sick, he'll try to spring his friends, then we'll have all four.
would you stick your stomach out so i can get a shot at that moon you got?
next time you think you wanna take somebody out, pal... don't just get yourself a good squad... get yourself a team.
i can't thank you people enough for saving my wife and child.
in jordan road and yau ma tei, there was shooting incident by cops last night.
when patrol car was checking a vehicle, a cop shot three times.
as a result, i was fooled like a monkey by them.
this is the right does for the right disease you know?
if you can take up some study, i think that may help your promotion.
study, it took me 12 years... to finish my primary school.
if i have to get along... with a real decent one, i'd rather be dead.
you will never know... how it is to have a girl in your arms.
then i'll have to follow you and catch people all the time.
cops have to catch people, if not, might as well be a watchman.
i would say the same thing, why don't you go for someone else?
they are either going back to their wives... or for entertainment.
armies in lebanon... agreed to carry out the decisions of a negotiation on wednesday... which was held in a resort area in switzerland.
commander will resume his supervision, and carry out the six-point settlement to stop the war...
hope you would watch out, for a man walking around with a little girl.
also, three of our men in this troop, are nominated for promotion to c.l.d.
if you had told everything earlier, you won't be in such a mess.
to handle this sort of people, no need to use violence.
kit, when i was a new hand, i was like you.
as a result, i was fooled like a monkey by them.
what's your take on all these rumors we've been hearing about vampires?
if vampires existed, don't you think we would've found them by now?
i understand that he is under the impression that there is a vast conspiracy of vampires.
now, you've got to look at the psychiatric underpinnings of a belief like that.
if you believe in the legends, he was born in ancient sumeria.
nobody really knows the specifics of his origin, but we do know this.
when i was under the fang, there used to be talk about some kind of vampire final solution.
but i could never figure out why they'd want to destroy their food source.
it hasn't been diluted by a hundred generations of selective mutation.
we get his blood, we can boost daystar's viral efficacy to 100%.
the weakest link in the vampire chain of command has always been their familiars.
since the vampires can't go out in the daylight, they get the humans to do all their dirty work.
i must've heard hundreds of you rodents make the same claim.
each one of them have tasted the end of my sword.
"now, nome king, having never tried to be good, was very bad indeed."
"having decided to conquer the land of oz and to destroy the emerald city... "
i'm going to watch you day after day as the thirst keeps building and building.
and then, when you can't stand it anymore i'm gonna bring the little girl in here for you to feed on.
i think i'vve managed to cultivvate a workable strain of the daystar vvirus.
as a precaution, i transmitted the genetic sequence to caulder in case our main stock was destroyed.
in order for it to achievve maximum lethality, you're gonna need to interfuse it with drake's blood.
now, if it works, evvery vvampire in the immediate vvicinity should die almost instantly.
it's being pumped through the building's air conditioning system, you cock-juggling thundercunt!
which means the fat lady should be singing right about now!
they let the air out of my bicycle tyre, threw away the valves and broke up my basket!
young man, re-direct your steps and hasten away from this place, where sin lurks whichever way you turn!
if you just let me test my method in practise, it will bring benefits not just to your cooperative, but to everyone.
- chairman, we can't afford any experiments, let alone where milk's concerned!
- but why, the boy'll give you a lift there this afternoon, won't he?
i keep telling blazena to spruce it up at least in front, but no way...
i told you not to give her beer when she's sitting in the sun!
as you've given her beer while she was out in the sun, you go on listening to her.
i wouldn't be able to carry it and i've got a bad arm, remember how i tripped once and fell in front of the store?
and i had to carry it around in a plaster cast all?
i'm sorry, ev, but try to see my position - the harves?
s the main worry and i can't cope with everything on my own.
s true, otherwise i wouldn't be telling you, if it were not true!
don't you know it, his father's a big fish in the regional council!
- we had it last week, we always have minced meat!
- you shut up and eat up, you've been nibbling at it the whole evening!
i told you i had to fix something up in the interest of the cooperative.
- was it in the interest of the cooperative when you dragged him into the wood?
- just you wait, i'll die, you'll lose my pension and you'll start pining for me.
- why're you yelling, nobody's doing you any harm, you're not going to... again...
hey, bartender, you gonna shoot the shit all night, or do you wanna get me another drink?
hey, tom, would you get a load of this little heinie?
you're the first girl tom ever brought home that used it.
yeah, well, sometimes it helps a guy out if you don't make it so easy.
these clothes are worth more than you make in a year.
i can see working with you two is gonna be a real dream.
how do you figure on handling all these guys and their motorcycles?
you start killing bombers, we're gonna be in worse shape than we're already in.
if he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye.
if he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye
yes, he loves his whiskey he loves his rock 'n' rye.
you know it takes ten bottles to make that fool get high.
come down a back alley, 10:00 at night carrying a bunch of guns,
i don't figure you're here to give the battery a new coat of paint.
i just can't seem to figure out how to do it right the way you do it.
you know, i can't figure out how you work out the rhymes and the melodies and you make it all come out.
the famous sorels sure put a lot of money into that bus, huh?
listen, cody, i didn't know you had a thing with ellen in the old days.
you guys got a big job to do, we're trying to get where we're going.
now, let us through, or you wanna come to some kind of financial arrangement?
i'm gonna take her back to the hotel so she can get some rest.
this whole thing started 'cause i had to do a gig in this shit hole.
she comes back to town, tells you and everybody else it doesn't mean a goddamn...
yeah and the worst part is she runs off with that creep billy fish.
you should do a little more work for me when you get a taste of what that money'll bring you.
then you'll realize i'm the one with the brains around here and you'll start treating me a bit nicer.
yeah, and not one of them's got a pot to piss in.
i never should have let myself get talked into this dumb benefit.
it's been a couple of years since i've had any trouble out of you.
hey, ed, i just came home to visit my big sister.
yeah, he belongs in jail with all the other juvenile delinquents.

but if it's got wheels i can drive it and i can fix it.
that's funny, i just got out a couple of months ago.
you're the first girl tom ever brought home that used it.
yeah, well, sometimes it helps a guy out if you don't make it so easy.
these clothes are worth more than you make in a year.
i can see working with you two is gonna be a real dream.
yes, he loves his whiskey he loves his rock 'n' rye
you know it takes ten bottles to make that fool get high
come down a back alley, 10:00 at night carrying a bunch of guns,
i don't figure you're here to give the battery a new coat of paint.
look, cody, we've had our differences, but it looks like we got it made now, huh?
we'll just zoom along here for a couple of hours, then we're home and dry.

they busted me a couple of years ago, threw my ass right in jail 'cause i wouldn't pay them off.
you know, i can't figure out how you work out the rhymes and the melodies and you make it all come out.
somebody else writes the songs, billy buys them or steals them,
you know, some of you guys got some cute little asses.
be a real shame if i had to blow them off!
you know, you got a real funny way of saying thanks when someone saves your ass.
why don't you go sit with your pal billy over there.
i'm gonna take her back to the hotel so she can get some rest.
this whole thing started 'cause i had to do a gig in this shit hole.
yeah and the worst part is she runs off with that creep billy fish.
you know, tom, i didn't ask you to go out and get ellen aim because she looks great on stage.
you know you play rough, cody, but you do a good job.
you should do a little more work for me when you get a taste of what that money'll bring you.
then you'll realize i'm the one with the brains around here and you'll start treating me a bit nicer.
you know, nobody ever had a hold on me the way you did.
you think you can ride into any town and kidnap anybody you want?
now, get the hell out of town and leave these people alone.
# lying in your bed on a saturday night sweating buckets and it's not even hot
# but your brain has got the message and it's sending it out
# you'd better rev it up and put it to use
# and i don't know how i ever thought that i could make it all alone
# even if you don't have anywhere to go you go down on the pedal, ready to roll
# and your speed is all you'll ever need all you'll ever need to know
# stalking in the shadows by the light of the moon
# it's like a prison and the night is a cell
# i don't know where i ever got the bright idea that i was cool
# so alone and independent but i'm depending on you now
# and you'll always be the only thing that i just can't be without
# and i'm out for you tonight i'm coming out for you tonight
# you don't get by on pride # lt'll run over you
# but since you let me down i'm hard to be around
you're the first girl tom ever brought home that used it.
sometimes it helps a guy out if you don't make it so easy.
i tell you to do something, you do it, no more, no less.
and if you start dragging your ass, i'm sending you home.
butch, i buy and sell people more valuable than you every day.
it's hard to figure out what's more pathetic, the way you talk or dress.
# he don't wear no hat, and, lord, he don't wear no shoes
# he don't wear no hat, and, lord, he don't wear no shoes
# if he likes your baby, you can kiss your baby goodbye
# cos the girls all love him like a schoolboy loves his pie
# i've been around the world and every man bleeds the same
# but when the lights are dim you never know who's to blame
# but when the lights are dim i'm not the only guilty one
# i don't want no scars to show i don't want no one to know
# ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
# ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
i want to nail his head to the sidewalk under the marquee that says "ellen aim".
and just to prove to you i'm gonna be a nice guy,
# no more timing each tear that falls from my eyes
# i'm not hiding the remedy to cure this old heart of mine
i'm not the kind of guy that will carry any guitars around for you.
but if you ever need me for something, i'll be there.
# his body's flowing in the jewels alive and the earth below is starting to shake
# but i don't see any angels in the city i don't hear any holy choirs sing
# he's got the fire of a prince in his eyes and the thunder of a drum in his ears
# i've got a dream about a boy on a star lookin' down upon the rim of the world
# he's there all alone and dreamin' of someone like me
# i'm not an angel but at least i'm a girl
# i've got a dream when the darkness is over, we'll be lyin' in the rays of the sun
# but it's only a dream and tonight is for real
# tonight is what it means to be young before you know it, it's gone
# say a prayer in the darkness for the magic to come
# no matter what it seems tonight is what it means to be young
# tonight is what it means to be young before you know it, it's gone
# tonight is what it means to be young before you know it, it's gone
# i've got a dream when the darkness is over, we'll be lyin' in the rays of the sun
# but it's only a dream and tonight is for real
# you'll never know what it means but you'll know how it feels
# stop your cryin', hold on tonight before you know it, it's gone tonight
# tonight is what it means to be young tonight is what it means to be young
# say a prayer in the darkness for the magic to come
# cos no matter what it seems tonight is what it means to be young
# talking about stealing the show when they're all letting go
# take a look at the witch, see the twitch in her eye, tell me what did she feel
but then she was only repeating what mrs lipton had told her.
i deplore gossip, of course, but i suppose it's inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and bearing should form a source of idle talk in a village the size of iping.
all he gets to do is eat roast beef from a tube.
so all you lonely guys out there, this film is for you.
it's for guys like that guy, chin loo fung in canton, china.
he's got 14 married brothers and sisters, yet still eats alone in a chinese restaurant four nights a week.
she was nuts about me and asked me to move right in with her.
every day at 5:30, she'd have bathed, perfumed, put on a sexy nightie... and be waiting alone in a big bed just for me.
that's the good thing about living in a city like new york.
at least nobody i knew was gonna see me like this.
this morning i had to brush my hair with my toothbrush.
i cleaned it out really good so i feel more comfortable.
i'd gotten some furniture, but the big news was the phone.
i had to give them a $500 deposit and a sperm sample, but they finally put it in.
it's like, most of these guys are just here for one thing.
i guess i want to meet someone i can talk to, just get to know.
i think i may even say, without undue modesty, that i am becoming somewhat of an expert on poop.
and i can assure you that that poop did not come from this dog!
i was just noticing that book you're reading, mayor of casterbridge.
that's really a coincidence because i did my final paper... on thomas hardy my senior year in college.
there were three suicides in manhattan late last night, all characterized as lonely guys.
two of the men were found dead in their west side apartments.
i go to get a haircut, they charge me like four bucks, which is the same amount of money they would charge anybody to come in.
but say a guy like michael landon goes into the shop.
yeah, but they don't charge you by how much hair you've got.
they're paid to make it look good with what you've got.
besides, when you see a guy with his hair swooped over, you know he's doing it to cover up something.
yeah, if a guy has a lot of hair, he's not gonna swoop it over.
you can't have a stable relationship with a person like that.
it's nice of you to lie, but i can see how you feel about each other.
okay, but that doesn't mean i don't need you in my life too.
you want to know the place i'll have in your life?
you'll have a beautiful wife, great kids, lovely home, and i'll be your bachelor friend who you feel you have to invite to your dinner party.
but iris has run out of single women to fix me up with, so she wracks her brain and comes up with this widow... who's 15 years older than me, overweight with rotten teeth.
iris, i guess no man knows for sure what he's capable of.
there might be circumstances in which i might lie or steal... or, who knows, even kill.
but there's one thing i know in my heart i could never do.
as long as i live, i could never, never hurt you.
when i first wake up, i get that shock of who i am.
and i really don't like to do that more than once a day.
whatever feelings of pain you might have, i want to share them with you.
you think you're the only one who's afraid of being hurt?
# when life was just empty rooms # # for company i talked to the moon #
# i danced along to my own song # # that no one could hear #
# when nights were silent and dark # # i'd lie in shadows, stare at the stars #
# the quiet voice that lifted my heart # # was always so clear # # it told me # # the chance for love comes without warning # # so don't stop looking for it # # yeah, love comes without warning #
# so be ready for love # # yours are the eyes # # i have spent my life looking for # # if they're not telling lies # # you were looking for me #

in a moderate price range, you can't expect anything too beautiful, but a lonely guy should watch out for the depressing.
a river view is great... as long as you're above the river.
this morning i had to brush my hair with my toothbrush.
i cleaned it out really good so i feel more comfortable.
so i was really glad when warren invited me over to his place for a little party.
- # i want a list of part-time lovers... # - warren, how's it going?
i got them at the lonely guy store at 81st and lexington.
when i first saw them it seemed like a weird idea, but it turns out they're a lot of fun.
it's like, most of these guys are just here for one thing.
i guess i want to meet someone i can talk to, just get to know.
i think i may even say, without undue modesty, that i am becoming somewhat of an expert on poop.
and i can assure you that that poop did not come from this dog!
there were three suicides in manhattan late last night, all characterized as lonely guys.
two of the men were found dead in their west side apartments.
when i was in high school, i went to a movie theater with a girl.
i was sitting there, and about 20 minutes into the picture, i slowly put my arm around her.
so when my father gave me a "c" in english, i didn't understand.
he told me it was because he had to treat me like all the other kids, but i really thought he was being much tougher on me... sorry, larry.
i go to get a haircut, they charge me like four bucks, which is the same amount of money they would charge anybody to come in.
but say a guy like michael landon goes into the shop.
yeah, but they don't charge you by how much hair you've got.
they're paid to make it look good with what you've got.
besides, i think when you see a guy with his hair swooped over, you know he's doing it to cover up something.
yeah, if a guy has a lot of hair, he's not gonna swoop it over.
i can't go to the movie with you tomorrow night... because i decided to end it all.
my life just seems so empty and meaningless... that i can't see any point in going on with it.
you can't have a stable relationship with a person like that.
it's nice of you both to lie, but i can see how you feel about each other.
okay, but that doesn't mean i don't need you in my life too.
you want to know the place i'll have in your life?
you'll have a beautiful wife, great kids, lovely home, and i'll be your bachelor friend who you feel you have to invite to your dinner party.
but iris has run out of single women to fix me up with, so she wracks her brain and comes up with this widow... who's 15 years older than me, overweight with rotten teeth.
it seems i've ended up being hurt... in every relationship i've ever had.
iris, i guess no man knows for sure what he's capable of.
there might be circumstances in which i might lie or steal... or, who knows, even kill.
but there's one thing i know in my heart i could never do.
when i first wake up, i get that shock of who i am.
and i really don't like to do that more than once a day.
[merv] i wonder if the european feelings are as strong as the americans?
[woman with european accent] vell, shpeaking for myself, i know that the vealth or fame or social position... have absolutely nothink to do vith whether or not i'm attracted to a man.
i was afraid of getting involved with you because... i couldn't face the possibility of losing you.
how do you think i feel now that i found out... you're not only a great guy, but that... you're the best goddamn lover in the world?
iris, do you think you're the only one who's afraid of falling in love?
do you think you're the only one who's afraid of being hurt?
# 'cause one lonely guy # # might change the world # # for one lonely girl # # and life would be so sweet # # if only she could meet # # one lonely guy # # one lonely #

so all you lonely guys out there, this film is for you.
it's for guys like that guy, chin loo fung in canton, china.
while he's happy that cable tv has been installed in his area, he'd really just like to meet a nice girl with attractive lip lace.
and it's for larry hubbard... [larry hubbard] hey, that's me, fifth one down.
the best part was, i'd met this gorgeous ballet dancer named daniele.
she was nuts about me and asked me to move right in with her.
but that's the good thing about living in a big city like new york.
at least nobody i knew was going to see me like this.
'cause from now on, that apartment's gonna be your best friend.
a lot of lonely guys, just to get off the street, tend to grab the first thing... that looks better than a borneo death cell.
"do you ever put substances up your nose or any other open bodily passage?
is there anyone in your acquaintance who has a sexually communicable disease?"
well, i'd gotten some furniture, but the big news was the phone.
i had to give them a $500 deposit and a sperm sample, but they finally put it in.
and if you like to play fetch, don't get a fast dog.
fast dogs like to show off, and they don't care about your stick.
they love to get in bed and nuzzle right up to you.
the only problem is, they miss their mother and they howl all night, and you have to pretend that you're a basset too... and howl with him 'til he goes back to sleep.
i think i'm beginning to know what kind of poop goes with each dog.
i think i may even say, without undue modesty, that i am becoming somewhat of an expert on poop.
i was just noticing that book you're reading, mayor of casterbridge.
that's really a coincidence because i did my final paper... on thomas hardy my senior year in college.
[man on radio] ... with a 20% chance of rain, clearing in the afternoon.
there were three suicides in manhattan late last night, all characterized as lonely guys.
two of the men were found dead in their west side apartments.
both traveling salesmen, who came home from the road after two weeks... and found that their large, beautiful fern plants were dead.
but say a guy like michael landon goes into the shop.
they would charge him $4, yet he's got 100 times more hair than i do.
yeah, if a guy has a lot of hair, he's not gonna swoop it over.
you know, the guys that always keep their hair... are the guys that have no use for it at all.
the only time you ever see you hair fall out... is after you shower and you wash your hair.
you mean, if i'd never washed my hair, i'd have a full head of hair?
it's nice of you both to lie, but i can see how you feel about each other.
okay, but that doesn't mean i don't need you in my life too.
you want to know the place i'll have in your life?
you'll have a beautiful wife, great kids, lovely home, and i'll be your bachelor friend who you feel you have to invite to your dinner party.

but there's one thing i know in my heart i could never do.
as long as i live, i could never, never hurt you.
we went back to my place and talked for two and a half hours about everything.
we found out we'd voted for exactly the same people in the last nine elections.
i don't like to wake up more than once a day.
when i first wake up, i get that shock of who i am.
[man] mr. hubbard, where did you get the idea... of writing a book about lonely guys?
i realized that everybody's a lonely guy at one time or another.
# everybody loves my baby # [merv] gosh, i hate to interrupt.
this has been all so incredibly fascinating... and entertaining and instructive.
i figured it might give me a chance to get away from everyone i knew.
of course, in the first three hours, i met my accountant, my plumber, my postman;
i guess he was looking for more girls to add to his collection.
he waved me over, but i just wasn't interested in meeting other women.
whatever feelings of pain you might have, i want to share them with you.
you think you're the only one who's afraid of being hurt?
# there's one lonely girl # # saturday night # # nothin' to do # # and there's one lonely guy # # all by himself # # at a table for two # # and it's sad #

so, all you lonely guys out there, this film is for you.
it's for guys like that guy, chin loo fung, in canton, china.
the best part was, i'd met this gorgeous bahet dancer named danielle.
she was nuts about me and asked me to move in with her.
from now on, that apartmenfs gonna be your best friend, if not your only friend.
a lot of guys, just to get off the street, tend to grab the first thing they see that looks better than a borneo death cell.
do you ever wear loud jackets or get phone calls after midnight?
do you go to discos or dine with people who want to be in show business?
do you know anyone who has ever had a sexually communicable infectious disease?
no dogs, no children, no foreign friends, no loud jackets, no late phone calls, no snovv business dinners, no substances in bodily orifices, no stones albums no acquaintance with sexually communicable diseases, but uncle harry once got a rash after an affair with a waitress
it's like most of these guys are just here for one thing.
i guess i want to meet someone i can talk to, just get to know.
the only problem is, they miss their mother and howl all night.
you have to pretend you're a basset too and howl till he goes back to sleep.
there were three suicides in manhattan late last night, all characterised as lonely guys.

you can't have a stable relationship with a person like that.
it's nice of you to lie, but i can see how you feel about each other.
ok, but that doesn't mean i don't need you in my life.
you want to know the place i'll have in your life?
when you think about it, it's just one every five years.
and jerry was an alcoholic and michael was a compulsive gambler and fred was a vvomaniser.
it seems i've ended up being hurt in every relationship i've ever had.
iris, i guess no man knows for sure what he's capable of.
there might be circumstances in which i might lie, or steal, or who knows, even kill.
but there's one thing i know in my heart i could never do.
we went to my place and talked for two and a half hours about everything.
we'd voted for exactly the same people in the last nine elections.
i don't like to wake up more than once, 'cause when i first wake up, i get that shock of who i am and everything.
i really don't like to do that more than once a day.
see, i was afraid of getting involved with you because i couldn't face the possibility of losing you.
how do you think i feel now that i know you're not only a great guy but the...best goddamn lover in the world?
i had to get out of town for a while, so i booked myself on one of those cruises.
it might be a chance to get away from everyone i knew.
he'd just broken up with verna and frieda and i guess he was looking for more girls to add to his collection.
he waved me over, but i just wasn't interested in meeting other women.
iris, do you think you're the only one who's afraid of falling in love?
do you think you're the only one who's afraid of being hurt?
by exposing his secret agreement with the princess he plans to usurp the throne
if we expose him, he will surely die as a traitor
you should have thought before you ran off it's too late, i can't change it now
a person in love is useless you must leave here now and you can never return
please let me stay, i want to follow you for the rest of my life
i was led astray by a man and then cast off like a piece of rubbish
look, sheng was plotting with the barbarians to rule our land
listen to me, he used you all to further his plan you're all rebels too
well, i heard that sally got mad at burt because she heard he was doing another movie with loni.
so burt, to make up for it, had someone paint a portrait of sally.
no doubt you know molecular physics, but let me put the elementary facts to you as if you didn't, to make my meaning clearer.
any schoolboy knows that if an object neither reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light,
a transparent thing becomes practically invisible in a medium of the same refractive index.
if i put this piece of common glass into water thus, it almost vanishes, because light passing from water to glass is only slightly affected.
it is almost as invisible as a jet of gas in air for the same reason.
if i were to smash the glass and beat it into a powder, it would become much more visible in the air.
now do you begin to understand what's been occupying my time?
the whole fabric of man except the red of his blood and the dark pigment of his hair is made up of transparent, colourless tissue.
you and i, professor hobbema, are as transparent as a sheet of glass.
but... if a man were made of glass he would still be visible.
he was a stupid man, the victim of his own foolishness.
the current cant required my attendance at his funeral, but i really felt as if it were not my affair at all.
you'll be sorry if you make any attempt to hamper or trick me.
to have worked for years, to have planned and plotted and then to have every conceivable sort of silly creature sent to cross me...
(male narrator) in 1972, a crack commando unit... was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government... they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them... maybe you can hire the a-team.
remember, whenever you get caught in a jam... pass the ball off.
don't always go for that fancy passing through a man's legs, all right?
you know, somebody thinks it's good business to make the a-team look bad.
these suckers gonna look bad when i get through with them.
well, look, murdock, technically you're not... on the run with the rest of us.
that's the whole reason i have to come in here... and scam you out every time.
it hasn't been that long that i've forgotten how smith thinks.
trap or no trap... they'll show up to set the record straight.
well, somebody is awful anxious... to put you out of business, captain.
well, i didn't think anybody could stand up to the a-team.
i am as much a member of the a-team as you are... and my name was not in that paper.
now, did you hear hannibal... introduce me as a member of the a-team?
one, i want you to lose your newly acquired desire... to own captain winnetka's wild west show.
and two, it is not wise to try to impersonate the a-team.
i knew the minute i laid eyes on that cahoot... he was walking on the wrong side of the law.
what does drug smuggling have to do with a wild west show?
if he can't get it... he'll do anything to stop you... from playing overseas in europe.
that way, he can book one of his rock groups into your open play dates.
boy, hannibal, i hope you got this timed right down to the last second.
'cause if you don't, we're going to get caught... right between col. lynch and mason.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
tell payne and simms i want it done by tomorrow night.
i'm shipping out a load of parts at the end of the week... and i want it chopped and ready to go.
this wouldn't have happened if not for your so-called fast car... that can't catch nothing when the chips are down.
all it is, is just a piece of junk you use to pick up the girls.
buy a car from mr. friendly, drive it around for a couple of weeks... and then while you're taking the little lady to lunch....
he steals them back and chops them up for auto parts.
everything is dropped except the victor job as of right now.
security's gonna be extra tight and the cops will check everything.
believe me, if i knew cindy was your lady... i never would've even looked at her.
the last thing i want is to get caught messing with the boss's girl.
i mean, it's especially understandable to someone like me who's experiencing... his own personal... sorrow and despair... but check it out, man.
best way to deal with this... is not to think of the source of pain as such.
wish i was sunning on the banks of the nile right now.
these clowns thought they could muscle into our operation, mr. v.
when i get finished with your boss, mr. un-friendly, i'm gonna take care of you.
what we want to know is, what is tony victor up to?
holloway's funeral's today... and the da who's coming hard down on victor is gonna be there.
victor's not crazy enough to try and take out a da at the judge's funeral.
he used to watch over the van when it was afraid and alone.
like i said, crazy man, i don't talk to no plants.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
we happen to be a division of the federal government... working in conjunction with the department of health services... which gives us jurisdiction over any and all state institutions.
so please be careful before coughing up the word "pound" like that.
now, we got to let denham know that we're taking care of business here.
yeah, i'm sure his goons will pass that bit of data along to him.
i don't come here to hear that your boys got their beanies handed to them.
i come here so you can tell me that building isn't coming down anymore.
you do, but meanwhile... i get to drive by and see the walls come tumbling down.
every day i have my driver swing out of our way to take a peek... and you know what i see, carl?
i'm sure he'll be pleased to have it returned to him.
i wonder, would it be possible for me... to hand it over to him personally, do you think?
yeah, but the question is, what's he got to do with denham?
why put the pressure on mickey to keep from putting his high-rise up?
whatever his reason... i don't think we wanna get in his way.
crazy tommy t hits a wall head on and there's nothing left but a pile of bricks.
you probably slide away on a roller board... by the time he's finished working on your knee caps.
i thought we were caught up in a jurisdictional dispute between hardhats.
in about a minute, i and my three friends... are gonna unleash on you your worst nightmare.
you're gonna wish the earth opened up underneath your feet... and swallowed you whole.
i am telling you, the mere presence of a dog... would have helped you locate the deceased more quickly.
and i just happen to represent a few highly available dogs... and i'd be glad to arrange their services for you in the future.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
i got the cops hanging all over me... and forget about getting a reference from my last employer.
now, these guys... who took the car, are they the same ones who stole the car before?
he brings in stolen cars from out of state... and then he sells them off his lot.
buy a car from mr. friendly, drive it around for a couple of weeks... and then while you're taking the little lady to lunch...
but sam, if we do that, all those other orders go into overtime.
everything is dropped except the victor job as of right now.
i mean, it's especially understandable to someone like me who's experiencing... his own personal... sorrow and despair... but check it out, man.
best way to deal with this... is not to think of the source of pain as such.
i want to know who you work for and why you're here.
if you want us to tell you what you need to know before you bury us... you've been eating too many nut rolls, fellow.
when i get finished with your boss, mr. un-friendly, i'm gonna take care of you.
what we want to know is, what is tony victor up to?
holloway's funeral's today... and the da who's coming hard down on victor is gonna be there.
victor's not crazy enough to try and take out a da at the judge's funeral.
it makes my day when we put guys like tony v. and friendly in the slammer.
yeah, i wouldn't want to buy no used car from that fool.
a nitroglycerin compound, two wires, an electrical outlet, one drop of soup... and... "open sesame."
[ electrical sparking, loud explosion ] - [ dillard screaming ]
how did you know that undercover agent zucotti was shot in the back of the head?
to the best of my recollection, that information was not passed out by the media.
that he was just blowing smoke, trying to cop a plea... on an important dope supplier.
and when bramlette told you that he'd seen ruiz kill a cop in the everglades, did you still think he was just "blowing smoke"?
you got moss on a damn tree that's supposed to tell us where the road is at.
can i help it if the moss doesn't know which side of the tree to grow on?
boy, i'm getting damn tired of feeling like i'm in a pinball machine.
first we're sitting in a bar having a nice, friendly beer, and then a couple of yahoos drag us out into the swamp and then get us lost.
hell, i can remember when my grandaddy used to deliver liquor in here during prohibition.
and i can't hardly make a living just fishing and guiding.
all right, we're gonna get into position at night... and take it down as the plane lands.
now, it's gonna be y'all's job here to cover the front, all right?
your honor, if the court pleases, our witness, mr. bramlette, will be here any minute.
we'd like to ask for a short continuance until this afternoon.

since i played lucky last night and didn't get blown to hell,
i'll go around that end of the house, 'cause i know where the trip wires of the claymores are.
and the guns we're using will rip through this old house from stem to stern.
so you've got to cover this front and don't let anybody get inside.
once, he got a load in by having his mule ladies... dress up like nuns.
he even had one of'em killed because they were holding out on him.
that's why you're still in this office, gifford, and not punkin' with the brothers up in steel city.
you know, laundering' money can still get you a few years.
anyway, manny always wanted to be exciting, so he got into racing.
laid out a hundred grand for a boat, found a crew from who-knows-where...

hey, pump some of that into you, and you know the true meaning of being and nothingness.
oh, you two girls aren't gonna have any problem passing' my class this semester.
burglary and theft, i do not do, because i don't have the guts to do.
now you may tell me what i can do for you.
maybe the guy just left his wallet elsewhere and blamed it on her.
don't accuse anybody unless you see it with your own two eyes.
now i have some questions for you that you must answer.
when you were the major pimp on sunset boulevard 18 years ago, did you know a gloria?
what if she really tries to steal and can't find any money?
then she'll know we've taken precautions, and her feelings will be hurt.
oh, the dog of the store around the corner just had four puppies!
what do the puppies have to do with my car accident?
he said it sounded like the girl you brought home last night.
even if it were true, it still has nothing to do with us.
you're saying... that you'll only hang out with sylvia if she's poor and helpless?
now that you've found out that she's the count's daughter, you don't want to be friends with her anymore?
you are not bad when will you be able to deliver
wait, i got to ask you you don't trust me or something?
let's don't argue about this just make sure the money's legal
thomas mentioned to me you mum and my dad are very close
secondly, if sylvia wants to know why i come for her
it's better for her to come with me to meet my client
wait, i got to ask you you don't trust me or something?
you hire me and you hire another gang to find the girl
the last one said there are 2 in front of him
the one in the middle said there are no worms next to him
the last one said there are 2 in front of him
the one in the middle said there are no worms next to him
if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have a job at all!

now i have some questions for you that you must answer.

before he died, he begged the countess to find you and your mother, so his evil brother mondale would not inherit his fortunes.
for your own safety, i did not want to tell my reasons for looking for you.
do you know then that this is when she needs help the most.
don't you want her and her mother to have a better life?
that explains why i've made a complete fool of myself tonight.
i am very much honored to have the pleasure of so many guests here tonight.
if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have a job at all!

don't you want her and her mother to have a better life?
we'll take out most of the money and just leave a little.
if she takes it, it'll be a small price to pay to find out about her.
mom can't part with uncle chan and uncle chan won't leave.
tell him you're marrying sylvia and you need him at the wedding.
if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have a job at all!
without a job, what right do you have to stay in spain?

and if i needed to get down to get a pen on the ground, a pen to write you letters with, that i would never send you,
i would keep an eye on my back, afraid of being attacked.
i wanted to kiss your face the first i saw you.
and he seduced you, just like he did with everyone who came to see me,
i can't believe that you will let me end like this.
why did you give me this filthy boat as a present?
i want to be with you, but i don't want you to protect me.
you have to forgive him, for all that is about to happen.
i think i would like it better if you took off her ring.
i know i should like it, it's more exciting if you have it on, but...
well, at least it's warm, confortable, it's not too badly off.
of course, if you wanted to leave you could have done so just then.
one sides for the best fuel the competitions got, and the other's for bobby's formula 2 super racing fuel.
oh, in the middle of the race, you kick in bobby's formula 2.
you mean that story about that wild family nobody knew about?
oh yeah, the ones who lived in the bomb range and ate anyone who came through.
i tell ya, i have seen better roads on a motor cross course admiral.
yeah, we'd be late if we went all the way back now.
it's too hot and it's too green and full of things that wanna bite your ass just for the hell of it.
typical paranoia of a person alienated from his primitary roots by too much urbanization in other words, typical paranoia of a black man.
his mama must have been attacked, by a cement mixer or something.
rachel, you say it was your brother, who gave you that?
what would you do, if sue caught you staring at me like that?
i'd tell her to go mind his own business, because this thing is bigger than the both of us.

in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
i'm afraid he's getting an infection... and then he'll get a fever, then we're in trouble.
we gotta find some place isolated, out of the way, off the highway.
...didn't meet up with richie and me because you are looking at two dead shots.
listen, pilgrim, you better put the first one right in the old keyhole with luke... or you can forget about locking the door.
if they have a wounded man with them, colonel... there are only two places where they can secure medical supplies.
river view hospital, and the ranger station off mill basin road.
of course, they may try to contact murdock at the v.a. hospital.
put a surveillance team on the hospital... but don't let them move in on murdock and scare them away.
they think as one, feel as one... and act as one.
but with a wounded man in their midst, they cease to be that.
me and this crazy man got the same kind of blood.
you remember that time when they gave me some of his blood?
it's not gonna make you crazy, b.a. it'll just make you mellow.
you can even room with me at the v.a. i'll have them bring in an extra bunk... and you and i can watch the walls melt.
and i don't see any state seals or shipping dates on any of these.
mr. moran, you're not buying this on the black market, are you?
so it doesn't matter what the risk is, now, does it?
and, like you said, the worst that could happen is i go to prison.
not exactly my idea of a little fun in the sun... but the hours are regular, the food's plentiful... and there's plenty of starch in the shirts.
besides, people very seldom look at what's right under their nose.
i just can't believe... that one of the a-team would just walk in here... and take that medical kit out... literally while we were standing around watching, colonel.
if i've learned anything about the a-team, captain, it's to expect the unexpected.
you sure you won't change your mind and stay for lunch?
you see, we're having... pickled zucchini skins salad... with tapioca pudding stuffed with coconut flakes... and topped with a stewed prune.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
we gotta find some place isolated, out of the way, off the highway.
we can lay him down, keep him still, make him comfortable.
...didn't meet up with richie and me because you are looking at two dead shots.

river view hospital, and the ranger station off mill basin road.
of course, they may try to contact murdock at the v.a. hospital.
but with a wounded man in their midst, they cease to be that.
the good of the unit becomes the good of an individual.
worst that can happen is if he hears things he don't see... and rhyme his words just like me.
hannibal: [narrating] i'm all for the rhyming word... but sometimes actions speak louder.
and i don't see any state seals or shipping dates on any of these.
mr. moran, you're not buying this on the black market, are you?
and, like you said, the worst that could happen is i go to prison.
not exactly my idea of a little fun in the sun... but the hours are regular, the food's plentiful... and there's plenty of starch in the shirts.
he'll die if we don't get him to a hospital and get that wound cleaned out.
i'll go back to the ranger station... to try and find face and tawnia, get those medical supplies.
do you think the patient is going to make it, doctor?
how you ever gonna make it in the outside world... if you keep making a fool of yourself?
[ln foreign accent] i used to love visitors, colonel. i really do.
you sure you won't change your mind and stay for lunch?
but sir, we can't stop the plane whenever someone gets terrified.
don't get on a plane and then refuse to leave the ground.
well, it won't do any good to try another plane, it wasn't the plane, he'll just get off again.
well, we're just going to have to drive it, that's all.
i don't think we're going to get the very same car.
but i can rent you a model just like the one you had before, sir.
come in, no bets, you guys are going to love this.
the girls here spend so much time with a guy that...
well, this whole thing must seem kinda strange to you, huh?
you realize that i can't see you even though you can see me.
oh, well, we are not allowed to see the customers out of here.
what if you see them, do you go home with them?
yeah, but you can really see them if you want too, can't you.
i mean you can go home with them, if you want to, all these places say that.
and he heard her trying to run to the high way.
he caught her, dragged her back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,
but sir, we can't stop the plane whenever someone gets terrified.

and he heard her trying to run to the high way.
he caught her, dragged her back to the trailer, and tied her to the stove,
he's been living with anne and me ever since you disappeared.
we didn't know what else to do, so we just kept him.
[ woman ] sir, we can't stop the plane every time somebody gets terrified.
[ walt ] you don't get on a plane and then refuse to leave the ground.
all the cars we have here are 'birds, olds, chevies or whatever.
i'm not even sure i can locate the same car you had before.
uh, i purchased it in-in the mail... a long time ago.
you bought a picture of a vacant lot in the mail?
and then he'd wait, uh, before he said "texas"... till everybody thought that... he meant —
he would wait before he said "texas" till everybody thought — after everybody thought he was talking about paris, france.
[ hunter ] dad, if a guy put a baby down... traveled at the speed of light for an hou —
if he traveled at the speed of light... he would — he would come back in an hour.
well, this whole thing must seem kind of strange to you, huh?
you realize that i can't see you even though you can see me?
yeah, but you can really see 'em if you want to, can't you?
i mean, you can go home with 'em if you want to.
and he — he loved her more than... he ever felt possible.
he couldn't stand being away from her, uh, during the day when he went to work.
he started thinking that she was seeing other men on the sly.
he'd come home from work and accuse her of... spending the day with somebody else.
and then one night — one night she told him that she was pregnant.
she was about three or four months' pregnant... and he didn't even know.
he was convinced that she loved him now because she was carrying his child.
and he was going to dedicate himself to making a home for her.
he knew she had to be stopped, or she'd leave him forever.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle... so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stuffing a sock into it... and inching her way out of the bed... and into the night.
he caught her one night when the sock fell out... and he heard her trying to run to the highway.
anne kept sending' me pictures of him... until i asked her to stop.
i couldn't stand the... pain... of seeing him grow up and missing' it.
i used to make up long speeches to you after you left.
i used to talk to you all the time... even though i was alone.
well, gee, trav, maybe you wanna get cleaned up... you know, take a shower or something?
um, i think i'll go back into town and get you some new clothes.
he's been living with anne and me ever since you disappeared.
we didn't know what else to do, so we just kept him.
all the cars we have here are 'birds, olds, chevies or whatever.
i'm not even sure i can locate the same car you had before.

you realize that i can't see you even though you can see me?
oh, well, we're not allowed to see the customers out here.
[ travis on speaker ] where do you see them then?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see 'em ifyou want to, can't you?
and he... he loved her more than... he ever felt possible.
he couldn't stand being away from her, uh, during the day when he went to work.

- he would introduce mama as the girl he met in paris.
and then he'd wait, uh, before he said "texas"... till everybody thought that... he meant -
dad, if a guy put a baby down... traveled at the speed of light for an hou -
if he traveled at the speed of light... he would - he would come back in an hour.
yeah, but you can really see 'em if you want to, can't you?
i mean, you can go home with 'em if you want to.
and he - he loved her more than... he ever felt possible.
he couldn't stand being away from her, uh, during the day when he went to work.
he started thinking that she was seeing other men on the sly.
he'd come home from work and accuse her of... spending the day with somebody else.
and then one night - one night she told him that she was pregnant.
she was about three or four months' pregnant... and he didn't even know.
he was convinced that she loved him now because she was carrying his child.
and he was going to dedicate himself to making a home for her.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle... so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stuffing a sock into it... and inching her way out of the bed... and into the night.
he caught her one night when the sock fell out... and he heard her trying to run to the highway.
he caught her, dragged her back to the trailer... and tied her to the stove with his belt.
he ran through the flames... toward the only two people he loved... but they were gone.
his arms were burning, and he threw himself outside and - and rolled on the wet ground.
anne kept sending' me pictures of him... until i asked her to stop.
i couldn't stand the... pain... of seeing him grow up and missing' it.
i used to make up long speeches to you after you left.
i used to talk to you all the time... even though i was alone.
when i get you home, i'll get you settled and then you can do whatever you want.
but sir, we can't stop the plane whenever someone gets terrified.
my brother left something in the car, we are hoping we can search the car and find it.
oh, well, i'll just contact the lost and found department for you, if that's ok sir.
i can get you a job at the airport doing that.
do you want to trade these new boots for those old boots?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see them if you want too, can't you.
so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell, by stuffing a sock into it.
i wish you get to the point, 'cause i'd like to see my brother.
all right sir, but first i would like to ask you something.
i purchased it, in the mail, ... a long time ago.
you bought a picture of a vacant lot in the mail?
i can get you a job in the airport doing that.
you want to trade these new boots for those old boots?
after what happened between you and jane, she decided hunter should be with us.
she said she couldn't be a mother to him any more.
standing on the very head of my mother, which is now on god's green earth, which everybody who wasn't born in a fucking sewer ought to know and understand to the very marrow of their bones!
they will invade you in your beds, they will snatch you from your hot tubs, they will pluck you right out of your fancy sports cars!
dad, if a guy put a baby down, traveled at the speed of light for an hour.
if he traveled at the speed of light, he would ... he would come back in an hour, he would be an hour older.
well, this whole thing must seem kind of strange to you, huh?
you realize that i can't see you, even though you can see me.
oh well, we are not allowed to see the customers out of here.
when do you see them, do you ... do you go home with them?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see them if you want to, can't you?
and then one night, one night, she told him she was pregnant.
she was about three or fourth month pregnant, and he didn't even know.
he was convinced that she love him now, because she was carrying his child.
and he was going to dedicated himself to making a home for her.
this time when he came home late at night, she wasn't worried about him, or jealous, she was just enraged.
she accused him of holding her captive, by making her have a baby.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle, so he could hear it at night if she tried to get out bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stucking a sock into it and inched her away out bed and into the night.
he caught her one night, when the sock fell out and he heard her trying to run out to the highway.
he caught her, dragged her back to the trailer and tied her to the stove with his belt.
i used to make up long speeches to you after you left.
i used to talk to you all the time, even though i was alone.
gee, anne and i, we sort of gave up on you.
we actually — [ chuckles ] we thought you were dead, boy.
well, gee, trav, maybe you wanna get cleaned up... you know, take a shower or something?
um, i think i'll go back into town and get you some new clothes.
[ woman on p.a. ] austin will arrive at any minute.
i don't understand why you have to have the very same caryou had before.
he, uh — he would introduce mama as the girl he met in paris.
and then he'd wait, uh, before he said "texas"... till everybody thought that... he meant —
then under the water, a volcano went — [ imitates explosion ]
and the hot lava hit the water and formed rock to make land.
if he traveled at the speed of light... he would — he would come back in an hour.
he would be an hour older, but the little baby would be a very old man.
oh, well, we're not allowed to see the customers out here.
[ travis on speaker ] where do you see them then?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see 'em ifyou want to, can't you?
and together they turned evervthing into a kind of an adventure... and she liked that.
just an ordinary trip down to the grocery store was... full of adventure.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle... so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stuffing a sock into it... and inching her way out ofthe bed... and into the night.
he caught her one night when the sock fell out... and he heard her trying to run to the highway.
he caught her, dragged her back to the trailer... and tied her to the stove with his belt.
he ran through the flames... toward the only two people he loved... but they were gone.
his arms were burning, and he threw himself outside and — and rolled on the wet ground.
i wanted to see him so bad that i didn't even dare imagine him anymore.
anne kept sending' me pictures of him... until i asked her to stop.
i didn't want to use him to fill all my emptiness.
well, he needs you now, jane... and he wants to see you.
sir, we can't stop the plane every time somebody gets terrified.
you don't get on a plane and then refuse to leave the ground.
he would introduce mama as the girl he met in paris.
and then he'd wait, uh, before he said "texas"... till everybody thought that... he meant...
well, this whole thing must seem kind of strange to you, huh?
you realize that i can't see you even though you can see me?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see 'em ifyou want to, can't you?
and he... he loved her more than... he ever felt possible.
he couldn't stand being away from her, uh, during the day when he went to work.
he started thinking that she was seeing other men on the sly.
he'd come home from work and accuse her of... spending the day with somebody else.
and then one night... one night she told him that she was pregnant.
she was about three or four months' pregnant... and he didn't even know.
he was convinced that she loved him now because she was carrying his child.
and he was going to dedicate himself to making a home for her.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle... so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stuffing a sock into it... and inching her way out ofthe bed... and into the night.
he caught her one night when the sock fell out... and he heard her trying to run to the highway.

his arms were burning, and he threw himself outside and... and rolled on the wet ground.
anne kept sending' me pictures of him... until i asked her to stop.
i couldn't stand the... pain... of seeing him grow up and missing' it.
i used to make up long speeches to you after you left.
i used to talk to you all the time... even though i was alone.
when i get you home, i'll get you settled and then you can do whatever you want.
but sir, we can't stop the plane whenever someone gets terrified.
my brother left something in the car, we are hoping we can search the car and find it.
oh, well, i'll just contact the lost and found department for you, if that's ok sir.
i can get you a job at the airport doing that.
do you want to trade these new boots for those old boots?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see them if you want too, can't you.
so he could hear at night if she tried to get out of bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell, by stuffing a sock into it.
i wish you get to the point, 'cause i'd like to see my brother.
all right sir, but first i would like to ask you something.
i purchased it, in the mail, ... a long time ago.
you bought a picture of a vacant lot in the mail?
he's uh ... he would introduce mama as the girl he met in paris.
then he'd waited uh ... before he said "texas" till everybody thought that ... he meant ... he would wait before he said "texas" till everybody thought ... after everyone thought he was talking about paris, france.
after what happened between you and jane, she decided hunter should be with us.
she said she couldn't be a mother to him any more.
standing on the very head of my mother, which is now on god's green earth, which everybody who wasn't born in a fucking sewer ought to know and understand to the very marrow of their bones!
they will invade you in your beds, they will snatch you from your hot tubs, they will pluck you right out of your fancy sports cars!
dad, if a guy put a baby down, traveled at the speed of light for an hour.
if he traveled at the speed of light, he would ... he would come back in an hour, he would be an hour older.
well, this whole thing must seem kind of strange to you, huh?
you realize that i can't see you, even though you can see me.
oh well, we are not allowed to see the customers out of here.
when do you see them, do you ... do you go home with them?
we're not allowed to have any outside relationships with the customers.
yeah, but you can really see them if you want to, can't you?
and then one night, one night, she told him she was pregnant.
she was about three or fourth month pregnant, and he didn't even know.
he was convinced that she love him now, because she was carrying his child.
and he was going to dedicated himself to making a home for her.
this time when he came home late at night, she wasn't worried about him, or jealous, she was just enraged.
she accused him of holding her captive, by making her have a baby.
so he tied a cowbell to her ankle, so he could hear it at night if she tried to get out bed.
but she learned how to muffle the bell by stucking a sock into it and inched her away out bed and into the night.

because you rescued miss minmay the pr department told me to pardon you.
but any further disobedience of orders will lead to strict punishments.
look, hayase even though you graduated top of the class from the academy you're also a woman.
even if what a man does is wrong, it's sometimes important to pretend he's right.
i am a mobile fortress that has endured... 120,000 cycles since my creation.
in my many battles, i have not learned much of the "culture" of protoculture.
that's when they created the giants who only knew how to fight?
but when the giants' fighting became too intense and they realized at last, their mistake sought to start over with men and women in co-existence.
effectively september 11, 11:00am, u.n. spacy sdf-1 macross and the zentradi 425th bodol fleet have agreed to peace.
and now, as a result of investigating this alien city we have found that the aliens who build it were the descendants of a highly advanced interstellar civilization called protoculture that prospered over 500,000 years ago.
they are split into two forces, the males and the females and have been fighting each other for over 500,000 years.
i thought we were forbidden to receive the protoculture's broadcasting until the operation succeeds.
so, our song-writers on macross are writing wonderful lyrics to this melody right now.
and i wish to broadcast this song to the universe so that we can negotiate for peace with the meltrandi and establish a warless, peaceful world.
even if i sing that song there's no possible way we could win with such a thing!
if we're going to die anyway, just stay here with me.

if the media ever find out about this, it would be the end of her career!
the senior officers aren't going to excuse your behavior this time.
when the bell tolls at the midnight hour the magic will disappear.
at the top of the stairs is a pair of glass slippers.
eventually the men and women were able to reproduce themselves on their own.
the males separated to become the zentradi and the females became the meltrandi.
and now, as a result of investigating this alien city we have found that the aliens who build it were the descendants of a highly advanced interstellar civilization called protoculture that prospered over 500,000 years ago.
originally, we humans, the zentradi and their enemy the meltrandi all had the same genetic structure as the protoculture's.
by utilizing the protoculture's genetic engineering techniques it is possible to change zentradi back into humans.
these three gentlemen sitting with us now are the zentradi soldiers you have just seen.
and i wish to broadcast this song to the universe so that we can negotiate for peace with the meltrandi and establish a warless, peaceful world.
we can take this first step toward peace because of countless sacrifices people have made in the past.
now, hoping for a reunion of joyful tears lynn minmay waits for some special people.
chief operator of our forces, commander hayase and valkyrie skull squadron pilot lieutenant ichijo.
a boy will be unhappy all his life if he chooses the wrong job.
what i mean is that he would probably do a lot better if he chose another line of work.
the men and women separated and were able to reproduce themselves on their own. then the war between them began.
that's when they created the giants who knew nothing but fighting?
please observe. it is possible to change the zentradi back into human size.
these three gentlemen sitting with us now are the zentradi soldiers you have just seen.
they are a warrior race that knows nothing of culture. 000 years.
i thought we were forbidden to receive the protoculture's broadcasting until the operation succeeds.

would i end up in tears? everything will end up shattered.
the light of eternity will lure me away. anyway i like.
you know, in pr you learn that 95 percent of the battle is appearance.
no matter how you feel inside, you should not let the outside go.
would you like to figure it out after i take you to lunch?
i'd love to, krystle, but danny's got a 3:00 doctor's appointment.
now i want you all to get ready for a wonderful surprise party that i'm having for dex and me.
mother, who else but you would plan her own surprise party?
darling, the surprise isn't for me, it's for you and steven.
you see, dex and i are going to take a little holiday.
amanda, i know you think that i betrayed you, but i didn't.
now, you may not have had my name, but you've had my love, and i've been involved in your life all of your life.
but don't push me too far, because there's a limit, even to a mother's love.
by the way, you may have been divorced from blake carrington when you had me, but carrington was still your name and it was the name you gave me, and it's the name i intend to use just like your other children.
could you at least have made up some story about that name on her birth certificate?
amanda is like her mother, alexis, impossible to stop when she puts her mind to something.
and if it isn't her trial, it's her life or it's her business.
you have a wife and you have a son, steven, and we are tired of being after-thoughts in your life.
you're the only one who can get close enough to him to get that confession i need.
blake carrington, are you insinuating that i should crawl into bed with him?
the exact nature of this compound is classified but it is essentially a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.
we employ the double-blind method of administering the compound, which is to say that neither you nor we know who has received the clear dose and who has not.

now, i explained that to you, charlie, at least i tried.
to try to persuade you to sanction them both, expunge them, wipe them from the face of the earth.
andrew mcgee and his daughter constitute the greatest threat that's confronted this nation.
what happens when she becomes adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes and becomes, for 20 months, the most powerful force in the human body?
suppose we have a child here who some day is capable of creating a nuclear explosion simply by the power of her will.
suppose there is a little girl out there somewhere today, this morning, who has within her, lying dormant at present,
the power some day to crack the very planet in two, like a china plate in a shooting gallery.
so they can figure out just what makes her able to do what she can do.
i think they want to use her to reactivate the lot six programme.
after what you did at the farm, i think they're gonna stay pretty far away.
if they still wanna capture us, they're gonna have to figure out a different way to do it.
i've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.
i know you may not believe this but i've actually begun to think of you as my own daughter.
all of us here are interested in that and we want to see how far you can take it.
i'll tell you this, charlie, you'll be doing this great country of ours a big favour if you cooperate.
can it be that bad, what they want you to do?
i mean, if just by doing it, you can get to see your old man.
that men at the airport, those men at the farm, i killed them, i burned them up.
yeah, but the way you told it, it sounded like self-defence.
he went out of here in a hell of a rush.
he also left the door open and your firestarter just walked out.
did you know that the shop has a small compound on the island of maui, hawaii?
how would it be if i sent you there for the immediate future?
they said if i did what they wanted, they'd let me see my father.
how did i know they were gonna be so damn stubborn?
perhaps herman would like to see her blow up a country before he gives in.
i'm scientifically rational enough not to form an opinion based on two experiments.
john the friendly orderly will make her happy cos he's the only one who can.
when john feels that she has reached the moment of her greatest happiness, he will strike her across the bridge of the nose, breaking it explosively, and sending bone fragments into her brain.
you contact the helicopter and let him take us as far as the army plane.
there has to be a refuelling stop between here and hawaii.
first thing, when you finish reading this, flush it down the toilet, ok?
second thing, if everything goes the way i'm planning, we're gonna be out of here tonight.
my daddy's found a way for us to get out of here.
i'm supposed to meet him at the stables at 8.00 tonight.
the exact nature of this compound is classified but it is essentially a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.
we employ the double-blind method of administering the compound, which is to say that neither you nor we know who has received the clear dose and who has not.
honey, i know, but it's not right for them to keep coming after us, either.
now, i explained that to you, charlie, at least i tried.
to try to persuade you to sanction them both, expunge them, wipe them from the face of the earth.
andrew mcgee and his daughter constitute the greatest threat that's confronted this nation.
what happens when she becomes adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes and becomes, for 20 months, the most powerful force in the human body?
suppose we have a child here who some day is capable of creating a nuclear explosion simply by the power of her will.
suppose there is a little girl out there somewhere today, this morning, who has within her, lying dormant at present,
the power some day to crack the very planet in two, like a china plate in a shooting gallery.
so they can figure out just what makes her able to do what she can do.
i think they want to use her to reactivate the lot six programme.
after what you did at the farm, i think they're gonna stay pretty far away.
if they still wanna capture us, they're gonna have to figure out a different way to do it.
i've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time.
i know you may not believe this but i've actually begun to think of you as my own daughter.

well, we're gonna have to find some place to stay for a while.
i don't know if anybody'll believe us, but if we send letters to the important newspapers maybe the shop will have to lay off.

'cause i was thinking about your grandfather not five minutes ago.

andy, i think you ought to call the police, turn yourself in.
yes, yes, that's what they wanna do, they wanna kill you.
kill you like they did mommy and take me away, i won't let it happen, i won't.
i love you more than anything in the world, no matter what happens.
i got some tall apologizing to do, there's a line of cars coming up the road.
reel in some of the slack out of the line, real slow, come on in, a little more, reel it in, reel it, reel it.

they're miniature enclosed worlds where animals and plants become transformed into new species with extraordinary speed.
if you wanted to pick a really remote desert islan cut off from the rest of the world, you might well choose this one.
over there, about the same distance, is madagascar, and if you sailed in that direction, you wouldn't hit much until you got to the coast of australia 4,000 miles away.
the island is the tip of an extinct submarine volcano that rises 15,000 feet from the bottom of the indian ocean and is capped with coral rock.
when it finally rose above the surface of the sea about 50,000 years ago, it was lifeless, but now, a mere 50,000 years later, well, just look.
frigate birds, thousands of them, circle above one end of the island.
they've come from all over the indian ocean, even from india itself 2,000 miles away, to nest on this particular island in the mangroves.
the white-headed birds among them are immatures, and there are two different species of them, one bigger than the other.
the males inflate their scarlet throat pouches to show that the site is taken, and to attract the female.
when she arrives, he persuades her to stay with ecstatic shakes of his head.
noddies nest not on aldabra but on a neighbouring atoll, building platforms of seaweed in the pisonia trees, and beneath, on the open coral sand, two million sooty terns lay their eggs.
their vast numbers are an indication of the richness of the surrounding sea.
all a pair of sooty terns seek from it are a few square inches of dry land on which to place their single egg, and an absence of cats, rats and all other egg-stealers and chick-eaters that plague nesting sites on the mainland.
such security is important to these terns, for not only do they lay their eggs exposed and unprotected on the ground, but their young remain flightless for several weeks after hatching and a hungry cat could cause havoc among them.
so terns find it well worthwhile, for the sake of such security, to fly hundreds of miles to this island.
the plants that grow on remote islands like aldabra... how do they get here?
nuts like this can float in the sea for up to four months.
this one is dead but here is one that's alive and still sprouting
the green stem springing from the top, a white rootlet striking down underneath.
under natural conditions, coconuts establish themselves at the head of the beach.
the time and place to find it is at night among the coconut groves.
it travelled here as a larva in the same way as the coconuts, floating in the surface waters.
one or two in a million were washed up on the beach and crawled ashore to live on land among the coconuts, feeding on them.
it's almost the only creature here likely to give you a painful bite, so it needs tackling with care.
there it cuts down young nuts with its pincers, and returns to the ground to feed on the soft white coconut flesh.
crabs as a group are sea-living creatures and breathe in water by means of gills.
to breathe in air, the coconut crab has developed large pouches within its shell that have moist linings and can act as simple lungs.
but when it breeds, it has to return to the sea.
there it releases its eggs and sperm into the water at high tide, so that its larvae will circulate through the sea, and may be washed up on some new island.
one exceptional land animal made the voyage to aldabra as an adult:
if one on the coast of mainland africa, grazing among the mangroves, were swept out to sea, it might survive long enough to be carried by currents to the islands of the indian ocean, and later to spread among them.
that, almost certainly, is how ancestors of the aldabran giant tortoise reached here.
it's not a very hospitable place for animals like tortoises that feed on land-living plants.
the coral rock which forms the substance of the island erodes into a honeycomb of wickedly sharp blades and spikes.
any creature moving over it has to step with care if it's not to cut itself badly.
here and there, the rock forms deep pits into which tortoises sometimes tumble.
when that happens, there is no escape, and the trapped animals, even if they survive the fall, die from starvation
quite apart from such traps, the island is a harsh, taxing place in which to live.
the tropical sun, beating down on the animals, threatens to bake them alive inside their shells, and the remains of casualties are common.
so as the day heats up, the tortoises head determinedly for the few trees that can provide shade.
here and there on some beaches grow low, windswept guettarda trees.
by noon, the ground beneath their branches is packed with refugees from the sun, waiting for the temperature to fall so that they can search for edible leaves.
many that came here for relief are near the end of their strength.
some are unable to drag themselves out of the mud, and so die of starvation.
their staple food is vegetation and they crop the grass right down to the rootstock.
but as island animals everywhere tend to do, they've broadened their taste in food to include almost anything that is edible, including the carcasses of their dead companions.
flesh is too nutritious to be allowed to rot and go to waste in this land where there is so little to eat.
50,000 years, which is the time, apparently, that aldabra has been above the sea, is not a very long time in terms of evolution.
nonetheless, 50,000 years of isolation on the island has brought changes to many plants and animals that live here.
they've begun to take on their own character, so now they differ slightly both from the ancestors which colonised the island and from their nearest relations elsewhere in the world.
these aldabran sedges bear their flowers and develop their seeds close to the rootstock where the jaws of the hungry tortoises can't reach them.
the changes that take place in an island species are not always directly useful like that.
but some island plants are spectacularly different from their nearest relatives.
very, very rarely, extraordinary double nuts like this are washed up on the shores of the coral islands of the indian ocean.
people believed that their kernels could be made into irresistible love potions and that their shells, when turned into a cup, would render the most powerful poison harmless.
a single nut like this was literally worth a king's ransom.
it wasn't until the 18th century that people discovered that the palms that produced these nuts grew in one tiny group of islands in the seychelles, some 700 miles from aldabra.
the largest surviving group of these trees stands on the little island of praslin.
once again, it's an island original, slightly different in colour from others in neighbouring islands.
the female flowers start as small reddish buds, no bigger than a man's fist, but they will develop into the biggest seed produced by any plant.
it takes seven years for the nuts to develop, and when they are mature, they are so large and so heavy that almost the only way of opening them is with a saw.
inside, you can see how very different they are from coconuts.
not only do they have two lobes to them, but the nut itself is full solid with flesh.
flesh that is so heavy that these mature nuts won't float in sea water.
the aldabran ibis breed among themselves and feed on small shore creatures.
land crabs are far too big to be eaten, but they have to be pecked to clear them out of the way.
several species of aldabran birds have developed slight variations that make them unique.
the kestrel here is slightly smaller than the madagascar species, but otherwise the same.
the aldabran sunbird, however, is a little darker than its african relations.
but perhaps the most dramatic and certainly the most endearing quality brought to some of the birds of aldabra by isolation is this.
so some birds that reach such islands by air have given up flying.
their wing muscles have dwindled and they can't fly even if they wanted to.
it was so tame that european sailors were able to kill it with clubs.
they called it the dodo, and in less than 200 years after finding it, they'd exterminated it.
grazing alongside the dodo in mauritius, and living in other islands in the indian ocean as well, were giant tortoises.
they, too, were taken for food by seamen and were exterminated.
but aldabra is so remote that few ships come near it, and here alone, the tortoises have survived.
it seems likely that the african ancestors of these creatures were of a normal size, and that these tortoises became giants as a consequence of living on islands.
isolation may have had another effect on the tortoises as well.
when african tortoises are threatened, they behave in the same way as this baby aldabran tortoise.
they first pull in their head, and then they pull after it their heavily armoured front legs so that nothing sticks out and they're comparatively safe from their enemies.
but when the aldabran tortoise grows up, its proportions change, as this one's have done.
this one is now so big that these huge legs won't fit into this space, so that whatever it does, something sticks out.
it's a fair bet that if there was a hyena on the island, it would make a meal of the giant tortoise.
it may be that a large animal with big reserves of fat is better able to survive bad seasons when there's little to eat.
it may even be that with no predators on the island, these long-lived creatures just go on growing, but it is not a phenomenon that is restricted to tortoises.
all you need is the carcass of a goat, preferably decayed and smelly, and the scent will attract them from miles around.
it used to be thought that these very big ones were entirely scavengers, relying on what carrion they could find, but now we know that actually they are active killers.
they attack and kill goats, young buffalo, and even on occasion, man.
the reason that i can stand here with relative safety is that their eyesight is not very good, they are almost deaf, and they rely on their senses, primarily on that big yellow tongue which flicks out and tastes the air.
so, from that point of view, there is no reason why they shouldn't grow big.
and the fact is that there is a positive advantage in growing big, because the big ones are getting the bigger share of the food.
not only that, but we now know that these big ones eat small ones.
that perhaps is a reason why, in the isolation of their island, these kings of komodo have grown so huge.
the hawaiian islands, lying in the eastern pacific, are all volcanic, and the biggest and newest of them is still erupting.
torrents of basaltic lava erupting from vents 10,000 feet up on the mountain sometimes flow for many miles down the volcano's flanks.
some vents produce vast quantities of granular ash which builds up around them into cones.
plants have a better chance of getting root on such material, and within a century or so, the ash slopes may be covered with green.
these high islands collect moisture-laden clouds, and on the windward side, rain falls very heavily indeed.
streams flowing down the mountainside cut through the layers of loosely compacted ash, eroding deep valleys.
so, unlike a coral atoll, which is a plain platform of coral, sand and rock only a few feet high, these immense volcanic islands of hawaii offered their colonists a great variety of habitat from high cold slopes of ash on the summits
to well-watered valleys, hot, lush and humid, near sea level, from new, naked basalt to long-established forest growing on ancient lava flows.
to exploit them, the animal colonists changed not into just one new form, but into a multitude.
this bird, the palila, is one of a large family of closely related hawaiian birds, the honeycreepers.
their ancestors were probably finch-like birds that were swept here, perhaps by a freak storm many thousands of years ago.
once here, they developed into over 30 different species, each with its own diet and habitat.
the palila lives largely on seeds and has the short, powerful beak needed to open and crack them.
the 'amakihi, while there's no doubt that it and the palila are related, has a slender beak, suited to picking up small insects and sipping nectar from shallow flowers.
so the 'apapane not only has a longer beak to suit its almost exclusive diet of nectar, but a conspicuous red head.
the 'akohekohe lives on a mixed diet of insects and nectar, and has developed a little crest of white feathers at the base of its beak.
the 'i'iwi is scarlet and has a particularly long curved bill that allows it to probe deep into trumpet-shaped flowers such as giant lobelias and bananas.
and perhaps most engaging of all, the akiapolaau, with a splendid dual-purpose beak, the lower mandible pick-like to chip away bark to find insects, and an upper mandible elongated into a probe with which to winkle them out.
it seems that soon after the islands' formation, one or at most two species of drosophila reached the islands, and they found the same situation as the honeycreepers found, a lot of vacant niches.
and so they evolved to fill them, and they are now drosophila, the larvae of which feed on fruit or rotting leaves or fungi, or bark or even spiders' eggs.
but now the situation becomes more complex because in hawaii, there are lava flows like this, and such lava flows often isolate patches of ancient forest like that over there, and in one small patch of forest,
there may well be one particular species of drosophila that occurs nowhere else.
it risks being blown out to sea, and this extraordinary bug never takes to the air.
its wings are tiny, and used only for flirting in courtship.
the twig caterpillar doesn't, like most twig caterpillars elsewhere, feed on leaves, but has become a carnivore.
it detected the fly with tiny hairs on its back en
they trigger the caterpillar to arch backwards and pounce on whatever touched it.
so isolation, by restricting the kinds of creature that reached hawaii, allows those that did great freedom to develop into different and unexpected forms.
the last of the really big canoes must have disappeared about 100 years ago, but still, in the remoter parts of the pacific, people remembered the techniques that were used to sail them, and still practise the skills needed to build them
this particular canoe, which is very big for modern times, was built on the tiny island of ribono in kiribati the islands that used to be called the gilberts.
it is only about 50 feet long, enormous for today, but only half the size of the old canoes, and still the people are prepared to sail on journeys of up to 1,000 miles in it.
the techniques for building it are those that were used for the old canoes.
clumps are teased out, rolled and twisted so that each fibre binds with its neighbours.
it is a repetitious job, but a skilled one if the string is going to be strong, and it is taken on by the women and the old people.
hundreds of yards will be needed to build a big canoe.
it's used not only for lashing one spar to another but for sewing together the planks that form the sides of the big canoes.
the pandanus tree produces strap-like leaves, which, when dried and split, provide ribbons that are woven into strong and durable mats to serve as sails.
so if you have the necessary knowledge and skill, even a small atoll can provide all the materials to build an ocean-going canoe.
but the huge canoes carried women and children, and were loaded with plants and animals, with every intention of founding new colonies.
the polynesian navigators had and have the most astonishing powers of observation by which they find their way.
a particular kind of bird during one season of the year will always travel in a certain direction.
some birds are ocean-goers, others seldom travel far from their nesting grounds, so spotting one can indicate that there's land close by, and following it may take you there.
distant islands can be detected by their effect on the ripples on the surface of the sea.
tall islands trail clouds of characteristic shape like smoke from a chimney blown by the wind, and since they are so high in the sky, they can be recognised and identified long before the island is visible.
they reached the tahitian islands, in the centre of the ocean, over 2,000 years ago.
they sailed so far eastward that they reached easter island, three-quarters of the way to the coast of south america.
on the flanks of the great volcano that built their island, they set up huge images whose enigmatic faces have haunted the european imagination ever since they were discovered by westerners two centuries ago.
the heyday of the easter island culture seems to have been passed long before europeans arrived, for many statues were overturned and some lay half-finished and abandoned where they had been carved in the quarries.
the group that landed here, ancestors of the maori, arrived about 1,500 years ago.
the land they discovered must have been a great surprise to them, for it was very different from the tropical island from which they had come.
not only that, but the forests were far richer in animals and plants than any island they had yet discovered.
that was because these islands had a very different origin and history.
fragments of a great supercontinent of which australia, antarctica and south america had been a part.
in consequence, they had on them many more different kinds of animals than other more recent islands.
it might look like a lizard, but it's a more ancient creature than that, more closely related to the early dinosaurs than it is to the modern family of lizards.
once creatures like it must have swarmed over that great supercontinent, but new zealand split away from the supercontinent before the great expansion of the early mammals which ultimately led to the extinction of most of the early reptiles.
flightless, living in burrows, with feathers so long and loose they look like shaggy fur, and running quietly across the forest floor at night in search of food, this odd animal could be considered a kind of bird equivalent of a mammal.
indeed, the kiwi does play that role in these islands where originally there were no land mammals of any kind.
it has, however, retained that characteristic possession of the bird, a beak and it uses it to collect worms, plunging it deep into the earth to smell for them as a mammal does.
the ancestors of the kiwi were flightless before new zealand was isolated, for the kiwi is a ratite.
other members of that family of ancient flightless birds still survive on other fragments of the great supercontinent.
there's the ostrich in africa, the rhea in south america and the emu in australia.
all those are bigger than the kiwi, but the kiwi once had a cousin living here in new zealand that was bigger than the lot of them.
it was probably the tallest bird that has ever existed, the moa.
its bones have been found in great numbers here in new zealand.
often in between the ribs have been found piles of polished pebbles.
they were the stones from the gizzard with which the moa ground up its food, and from the vegetable remains, we know that it ate fruit, twigs and the leaves of trees.
there were a dozen or so different species of moa of varying sizes.
the maori not only reduced the number of moa by hunting, they also burnt down the forests on which the moas depended.
and so, by the time the europeans arrived here in the 18th century, the last of the moas had been extinct for some 200 years.
but in the millions of years that have passed since new zealand was isolated as islands, many more modern creatures have arrived here.
they've got here, as they've managed to get to islands all over the world, by flying.
since it's been here, it's probably changed its habits a good deal, for it's taken up life in the cold, high mountains where it feeds on berries and roots, buds and insects.
it has also, with that adaptability of diet characteristic of islanders, become a general scavenger, and will even feed on carrion like a crow or small vulture.
there are no ground-living leaf-eating mammals on the island, so this has become a kind of parrot-equivalent of a rabbit.
it's extremely nervous, nocturnal, and it lives on vegetation, but it shows those two characteristics of island-living creatures.
when their islands are invaded by outsiders, they often have no defence.
the kakapo's troubles started when the polynesians first came to new zealand.
they brought a kind of rat which may have preyed upon the nestling kakapo, and the polynesians themselves hunted it.
the real catastrophe came when europeans arrived, because they brought with them those two merciless killers, the stoat and the cat
to give them some chance of survival, they've been taken to a small offshore island that has been cleared of cats.
elsewhere, these domestic pets that were brought here to catch mice in houses have run wild in the forests, and prey on native birds which have not acquired the right reflexes to save themselves from its attacks.
rabbits were also imported to provide meat and fur, and to put to good use, as the importers must have thought, the abundant grass that was going to waste.
and red deer were released in the mountains to provide hunters with sport.
yet these seemingly harmless vegetarians had a catastrophic effect on the native animals.
they grazed so effectively that they destroyed the trees and bushes.
it's unique to these islands, it's flightless, and has virtually no defence against invaders.
at the beginning of this century, it was thought to be extinct.
they are unlikely to spread, for their habitat elsewhere has been destroyed, and there is the greatest difficulty in getting them to breed in captivity.
so, unless man is prepared to change his attitude and become an active protector as he has done here in new zealand, those strange specialised islanders are doomed to the fate of the first island-living creature that man exterminated
some like those tough international travellers over there, the gannets, just come here for lodging.
they, like the frigates and the boobies of aldabra, the noddies and the terns of a thousand tropical atolls, find their food, not on the islands where they come to nest, but in the surrounding seas,
they're miniature enclosed worlds where animals and plants become transformed into new species with extraordinary speed.
if you wanted to pick a really remote desert island cut off from the rest of the world, you might well choose this one.
over there, about the same distance, is madagascar, and if you sailed in that direction, you wouldn't hit anything much until you got to the coast of australia 4,000 miles away.
the island itself is the tip of an extinct submarine volcano that rises 15,000 feet from the bottom of the indian ocean and is capped with coral rock.
when it finally rose above the surface of the sea about 50,000 years ago, it was of course lifeless, but now, a mere 50,000 years later, well, just look.
frigate birds, thousands of them, circle above one end of the island.
they've come from all over the indian ocean, even from the shores of india itself 2000 miles away, to nest on this particular island in the mangroves.
the white-headed birds among them are immatures, and there are two different species of them, one bigger than the other.
the males inflate their scarlet throat pouches to show other cruising birds that the site is taken, and to attract the female.
when she arrives, he persuades her to stay with ecstatic shakes of his head.
noddies nest not on aldabra but on a neighbouring atoll, building platforms of seaweed in the pisonia trees, and beneath, on the open coral sand, two million sooty terns lay their eggs.
their vast numbers are an indication of the richness of the surrounding sea.
all a pair of sooty terns seek from it are a few square inches of dry land on which to place their single egg, and an absence of cats, rats and all other egg-stealers and chick-eaters that so often plague nesting sites on the mainland.
such security is specially important to these terns, for not only do they lay their eggs exposed and unprotected on the ground, but their young remain flightless for several weeks after hatching and a hungry cat could cause havoc among them.
so terns find it well worthwhile, for the sake of such security, to fly hundreds of miles to this island.
the plants that grow on remote islands like aldabra... how do they get here?
nuts like this can float in the sea for up to four months.
this one is already dead but here is one that's very much alive and still sprouting
the green stem springing from the top, a white rootlet striking down underneath.
under natural conditions, such coconuts establish themselves at the head of the beach.
the time and place to find it is at night among the coconut groves.
it travelled here as a larva in much the same way as the coconuts, floating in the surface waters.
one or two in a million were washed up on the beach and crawled ashore to take up life on land among the coconuts, and indeed, feeding on them.
it's almost the only creature here likely to give you a painful bite, so it needs tackling with care.
there it cuts down the young nuts with its huge pincers, and returns to the ground to feed on the soft white coconut flesh.
crabs as a group are sea-living creatures and breathe in water by means of gills.
to breathe in air, the coconut crab has developed large pouches within its shell that have moist linings and can therefor act as simple lungs.
but when it breeds, it has to return to the sea.
there it releases its eggs and sperm into the water at high tide, so that its larvae will circulate once more through the sea, and may be washed up on some new island.
one exceptional land animal made the voyage to aldabra as an adult:
if one on the coast of mainland africa, grazing perhaps among the mangroves, were swept out to sea, it might well survive long enough to be carried by currents to the islands of the indian ocean, and later to spread among them.
and that, almost certainly, is how the ancestors of the aldabran giant tortoise reached here.
it's not however a very hospitable place for animals like tortoises that feed on land-living plants.
the coral rock which forms the substance of the island erodes into a honeycomb of wickedly sharp blades and spikes.
any creature moving over it has to step with care if it's not to cut itself badly.
here and there, the rock forms deep pits into which tortoises sometimes tumble.
when that happens, there is no escape,and the trapped animals, even if they survive the fall, die from starvation
quite apart from such traps, the island is a harsh, taxing place in which to live.
the tropical sun, beating down on the animals, threatens to bake them alive inside their shells, and the remains of casualties are common.
so as the day heats up, the tortoises head determinedly for the few trees that can provide shade.
here and there on some beaches grow low, windswept guettarda trees.
by noon, the ground beneath their branches is packed with refugees from the sun, waiting for the temperature to fall a little so that they can return to search for a few edible leaves.
many that came here for relief are near the end of their strength.
some are unable to drag themselves out of the mud, and so die of starvation.
their staple food is vegetation and they crop the grass right down to the rootstock.
but as island animals everywhere tend to do, they've broadened their taste in food to include almost anything that is remotely edible, including the carcasses of their dead companions.
flesh is too nutritious to be allowed to rot and go to waste in this land where there is so little to eat.
50,000 years, which is the time, apparently, that aldabra has been above the sea, is not a very long time in terms of evolution.
nonetheless, 50,000 years of isolation on the island has brought changes to many of the plants and animals that live here.
they've begun to take on their own character, so that now they are slightly differ both from the ancestors which originally colonised the island and from their nearest relations anywhere else in the world.
and now, these aldabran sedges bear their flowers and develop their seeds very close to the rootstock where the jaws of the hungry tortoises can't reach them.
the changes that take place in an island species are not always directly useful like that.
but some island plants are spectacularly different from their nearest relatives.
very, very rarely, extraordinary double nuts like this are washed up on the shores of the coral islands of the indian ocean.
people believed that their kernels could be made into absolutely irresistible love potions and that their shells, when turned into a cup, would render even the most powerful poison absolutely harmless.
and so a single nut like this was literally worth a king's ransom.
it wasn't until the 18th century that people discovered that the palms that produced these nuts grew in just one tiny group of islands in the seychelles, some 700 miles from aldabra.
the largest surviving group of these trees stands on the little island of praslin.
once again, it's an island original, slightly different in colour from others in it's kind in neighbouring islands.
the female flowers start as small reddish buds, no bigger than a man's fist, but they will eventually develop into the biggest seed produced by any plant.
it takes seven years for the nuts to develop, and when they are mature, they are so large and so heavy that almost the only way of opening them is with a saw.
inside, you can see how very different they are from coconuts.
not only do they have two lobes to them, but the nut itself is full solid with flesh.
flesh that is so heavy that these mature nuts won't float in sea water.
the aldabran ibis are residents, breeding among themselves and feeding on small shore creatures.
land crabs are far too big to be eaten, but they have to be pecked to clear them out of the way.
several species of aldabran birds have developed slight variations that make them unique.
the kestrel here is slightly smaller than the madagascar species, but otherwise the same.
the aldabran sunbird, however, is a little darker than its african relations.
but perhaps the most dramatic and certainly the most endearing quality brought to some of the birds of aldabra by isolation is this.
so some birds that reach such islands by air have now given up flying.
their wing muscles have dwindled and they can't fly even if they wanted to.
it was so tame that european sailors were able to kill it with clubs without any difficulty.
they called it the dodo, and in less than 200 years after finding it, they'd exterminated it.
grazing alongside the dodo in mauritius, and living in other islands in the indian ocean as well, were giant tortoises.
they, too, were taken for food by seamen and they too were eventually exterminated.
but aldabra is so remote that few ships come anyway near it, and here alone, the tortoises have survived.
it seems likely that the african ancestors of these creatures were of a normal size, and that these tortoises became giants as a consequence of living on islands.
isolation may have had another effect on the tortoises as well.
when african tortoises are threatened, they behave in the same way as this baby aldabran tortoise does.
that is to say, they first pull in their head, and then they pull after it their heavily armoured front legs so that nothing sticks out and they're comparatively safe from their enemies.
but when the aldabran tortoise grows up, its proportions change, as this one's have done.
this one is now so big that these huge legs won't fit into this space, here, so that whatever it does, something sticks out.
it's a fair bet that if there was let say, a hyena on the island, it would make a meal of the giant tortoise.
it may be that a large animal with big reserves of fat is better able to survive really bad seasons when there's little to eat.
it may even be that with no predators on the island, these long-lived creatures just go on growing, but it is not a phenomenon that is restricted to tortoises.
all you need is the carcass of a goat, preferably someone decayed and smelly, and the scent will attract them from miles around.
it used to be thought that these very big ones were entirely scavengers, relying on what carrion they could find, but now we know that actually they are active killers.

the reason that i can stand here with relative safety is that their eyesight is not very good, they are almost deaf, and they rely on their senses, primarily on that big yellow tongue which flicks out and tastes the air.
so, from that point of view, there is no reason why they shouldn't grow big.
and the fact is that there is a positive advantage in growing big, because, as you can see, the big ones are getting the bigger share of the food.
not only that, but we now know that these big ones actually eat small ones.
so that perhaps is a reason why, in the isolation of their island, these kings of komodo have grown so huge.
big ones like this can weigh up to 100 pounds and grow to over nine feet long.
komodo is not, like aldabra, a coral atoll growing on the drowned tip of a submarine volcano, but the eroded remains of one that stood many thousands of feet above sea level.
torrents of basaltic lava erupting from vents 10,000 feet up on the mountain sometimes flow for many miles down the volcano's flanks.
when, eventually, they cool and solidify, they become vast slopes of black naked rock.
plants have a better chance of getting root on such material, and within a century or so, the ash slopes may be covered with green.
these high islands collect moisture-laden clouds, and on the windward side, rain falls very heavily indeed.
streams flowing down the mountainside cut through the layers of loosely compacted ash, eroding deep valleys.
so, unlike a coral atoll, which is a plain platform of coral, sand and rock only a few feet high, these immense volcanic islands of hawaii offered their colonists a great variety of habitats from high cold slopes of ash on the summits
to well-watered valleys, hot, lush and humid, near sea level, from new, naked basalt to long-established forest growing on ancient lava flows.
to exploit them, the animal colonists changed not into just one new form, but into a multitude.
this bird, the palila, is one of a large family of closely related hawaiian birds the honeycreepers.
their ancestors were probably finch-like birds that were swept here, perhaps by a freak storm many thousands of years ago.
once here, they developed into over 30 different species, each with its own diet and habitat.
the palila lives largely on seeds and has the kind of short, powerful beak needed to open and crack them.
these enable the male and female to identify one another so they don't interbreed with their near cousins, and the species becomes increasingly distinct.
so the 'apapane not only has a longer beak to suit its almost exclusive diet of nectar, but a conspicuous red head.
the 'akohekohe lives on a mixed diet of insects and nectar, and has developed a little crest of white feathers at the base of its beak.
the 'i'iwi is scarlet and has a particularly long curved bill that allows it to probe deep into trumpet-shaped flowers such as giant lobelias and bananas.
look how dexterously it uses the two halves of its beak for these different purposes.
the situation amongst hawaii's insects is even more extreme than it is among its birds.
in north america, for example, there are about 200 species, but here in these relatively tiny islands of hawaii, there are at least 800.
it seems that soon after the islands' formation, one or at most two species of drosophila reached the islands, and they found the same situation as the honeycreepers found, a lot of vacant niches.
and so they evolved to fill them, and they are now drosophila, the larvae of which feed on fruit or rotting leaves or fungi, or bark or even spiders' eggs.
but now the situation become more complex because in hawaii, there are lava flows like this, and such lava flows often isolate patches of ancient forest like that over there, and in one small patch of forest, there may well be one particular
this cranefly's taste for fruit is typical of its family, but other insects have changed their feeding habits.
this flightless bug has adopted the hunting techniques of the mantis which never naturally reached the island.
it detected the fly with tiny hairs on its back end
they trigger the caterpillar to arch backwards and pounce on whatever touched it.
they not only paddled dugout canoes, but sailed immense ocean-going double canoes that could carry several hundred passengers, and that tradition survives still in many parts of the pacific.
the last of the really big canoes must have disappeared about 100 years ago, but still, in the remoter parts of the pacific, people remembered the techniques that were used to sail them, and still practise the skills necessary to build them
this particular canoe, which is very big for modern times, was built on the tiny island of ribono in kiribati the islands that used to be called the gilberts.
it is only about 50 feet long, enormous for today, but only half the size of the old canoes, and still the people are perfectly prepared to sail on journeys of up to 1,000 miles in it.
it is a repetitious job, but a very skilled one if the string is going to be strong, and it is taken on by the women and the old people.
many hundreds of yards will be needed to build a big canoe.
it's used not only for lashing one spar to another but for sewing together the planks that form the sides of the big canoes.
the pandanus tree produces strap-like leaves, which, when dried and split, provide flat ribbons that are woven into strong and durable mats to serve as sails.
for a long time, europeans, so proud of their own navigating skills, maintained that the polynesian voyages were accidental, made when fishing canoes were blown off course.
but the huge canoes carried women and children, and were loaded with plants and animals, clearly with every intention of founding new colonies.
the polynesian navigators had and have the most astonishing powers of observation by which they find their way.
a particular kind of bird during one season of the year will always be travelling in a certain direction.
some birds are ocean-goers, others seldom travel far from their nesting grounds, so spotting one can indicate that there's land close by, and following it may take you there.
distant islands can be detected by their effect on the ripples on the surface of the sea.
tall islands trail clouds of characteristic shape like smoke from a chimney blown by the wind, and since they are so high in the sky, they can be recognised and identified long before the island itself is visible.
using such techniques as well as observing the sun and the stars, the pattern of the winds, and feeling through the rudder the movements of swells and currents, the polynesians colonised island after island.
they sailed so far eastward that eventually they reached easter island, three-quarters of the way to the coast of south america.
those that settled here seem to have been more isolated than most, and, like so many other islanders, they developed their own individual culture.
but the most extraordinary voyage of all is that which took them across 4,000 miles of open ocean, south to new zealand.
the group that landed here, ancestors of the maori, arrived about 1,500 years ago.
in the south island stood great mountain ranges covered with snow and ice that the maori can never have seen before.
not only that, but the forests were far far richer in animals and plants than any island they had yet discovered.
that was because these islands had a very different origin and history.
they were neither flat coral atolls nor were they the tips of volcanoes that had risen above the surface of the pacific in comparatively recent geological time.
and indeed, the kiwi does play that role in these islands where originally there were no land mammals of any kind.
it has, however, retained that characteristic possession of the bird, a beak and it uses it to collect worms, plunging it deep into the earth to smell for them as a mammal does.
the ancestors of the kiwi were flightless before new zealand was isolated, for the kiwi is a ratite.
other members of that family of ancient flightless birds still survive on other fragments of the great supercontinent.
there's the ostrich in africa, the rhea in south america and the emu in australia.
of course, all those are very much bigger than the kiwi, but the kiwi once had a cousin living here in new zealand that was bigger than the lot of them.
in fact it was probably the tallest bird that has ever existed, the moa.
its bones have been found in great numbers here in new zealand.
and often in between the ribs have been found piles of polished pebbles.
they were the stones from the gizzard with which the moa ground up its food, and from the vegetable remains, among those, we know that it ate fruit, twigs and the leaves of trees.
this is the mummified head and neck of one of the smaller species of moa, and it suggests, because many necks have been found attached to heads, that the maori had so much moa meat that they could afford to throw away sections like this.
the maori not only reduced the number of moa by hunting, they also burnt down the forests on which the moas depended.
and so, by the time the europeans arrived here in the 18th century, the last of the moas had been extinct for some 200 years.
but in the millions of years that have passed since new zealand was isolated as islands,many more modern creatures have arrived here.
its ancestors came, doubtless, from that great parrot homeland, australia, 1,000 miles away.
since it's been here, it's probably changed its habits a good deal, for it's taken up life in the cold, high mountains where it feeds on berries and roots, buds and insects.
it has also, with that adaptability of diet characteristic of islanders, become a general scavenger, and will even feed on carrion like a crow or small vulture.
one parrot, here, however, has been changed extremely by island life.
it's extremely nervous, nocturnal, and it lives on vegetation, but it shows those two characteristics of island-living creatures.
it has lost its powers of flight, so its only defence is to freeze motionless as it's doing now.
the kakapo's troubles started when the polynesians first came to new zealand.
they brought a kind of rat which may have preyed upon the nestling kakapo, and the polynesians themselves hunted it.
very rapidly, its numbers diminished until today there are not more than 60 individual kakapo left.
to give them some chance of survival, they've been collected and released on a small offshore island that has been cleared of cats.
and red deer were released in the mountains to provide hunters with sport.
yet even these seemingly harmless vegetarians had a catastrophic effect on the native animals.
it's become a giant, for it's a rail, like the one in aldabra, and by far the biggest of its family.
it's unique to these islands, it's flightless, and has virtually no defence against invaders.
at the beginning of this century, it was thought to be extinct.
then, after no one had seen a living takahe for over 50 years, a small population was discovered in a remote valley in south island.
so, unless man is prepared to change his attitude and become an active protector as he has done here in new zealand those strange specialised islanders are doomed to the fate of the first island-living creature that man exterminated and become as dead as the dodo.
but of course, not all the creatures that you find on islands necessarily spend all their time there.
some like those tough international travellers over there, the gannets, just come here for lodging.
they, like the frigates and the boobies of aldabra, the noddies and the terns of a thousand tropical atolls, find their food, not on the islands where they come to nest, but in the surrounding seas,and that is the vast and complex community
resistance leaders suffered a great setback with the capture and execution... of several high-ranking leaders in the mato grosso battalion.
here at home, our guerrillas claimed a major victory on the ground fighting... in the sangre de cristo mountains... between taos and albuquerque, new mexico.
casualties were said to be light in skirmishes along the santa fe trail... as a number of alien outposts were overrun and destroyed.
and this week, the freedom network awards it's medal of valor... to marilyn mcgeorge... a housewife from biloxi, mississippi.
she spotted the visitor patrol boat, vargan, off the gulf coast... rammed it with her husband's fishing boat, sinking both vessels.
mrs. mcgeorge was later found clinging to debris... and was rescued.
now you can mold a star-child to your own genetic design.
although i can't say i understand what all this is about.
half the world is poison to us because of the red dust.
yet, elizabeth, who's half human, half like us, seems to be immune.
what do you mean, another van of children got through the border?
why is it that we continue to let a band of vigilantes... make a mockery of the laws of this city?
i see the visitors came looking for the three we mopped up.
they were under the misguided notion that by destroying the building... they could eradicate the beliefs that built it.
she's growing, getting stronger... and more like us than one of them.
it means that every policeman in los angeles will be out looking for her.
no matter what your friendships and confused loyalties, i still value you.
i care for you far too much to want to find your body... among the others in the wreckage.

i'm howard k. smith, and this is the state of the war tonight.
in athens, the cradle of democracy was once again shaken... as the visitors took command of that city.
as has been the case throughout the world... the visitors declared martial law... and began rounding up suspected opposition leaders.
at this hour, the fate of gregory cannis, the head of the pan-hellenic resistance... remains unknown.
on this side of the atlantic, the news is much brighter... as resistance efforts in cities and towns across the nation continue to grow.
in miami, tampa, and key west... residents fought the invaders to a standstill... thanks in large part to this woman, janet weinberg... a computer programmer from daytona beach.
i was under the impression that i had a position of trust around here.
you do... as long as you keep out of what doesn't concern you.
it's time you took a good hard look at where your loyalties are.
i run things around here as i see fit... and i don't have to explain my actions to anybody.

you got to be more careful, there's a war going on.
i thought we were supposed to have faith in each other.
that's a very interesting choice of words... for someone about to undergo the conversion process.
did you think your age and status would exempt you from torture?
i think bates is cooperating somehow with diana in erecting this force field.

well, now that i'm walking again, i have a few things to catch up on at la mirage.
you're a working woman now, kystle, you tell him how it is.
and of course, our response is that denver-carrington is not political.
we're going in to that part of the far east to find oil, a potential source of energy this county needs badly.
of course i'm not disagreeing with you that claudia shouldn't be left on her own in peru.
what i am disagreeing with is who should be with the poor, troubled girl who's obviously at the end of her rope.
she did the totally illogical thing of rushing off in the middle of the night on a wild iourney without telling her husband.
and you are being totally illogical too in thinking you're the one who can give her the help that she needs.
now you wanna ditch eveything and fly off like some sort of a playboy.
hey, you know, it's funny how you can say that word and still smile.
"the first couple of months are gonna be the trickiest, so you've got to get a lot of rest."
well, he said to take it easy and not to go to hong kong.
i'm gonna let my legal department handle that hong kong deal.
or better yet, i'll have the hong kong people come here.
darling, i couldn't be alone in this house if i wanted to be.
you have to go, i know how important this deal is to you.
but you will follow my advice and go to the local police tomorrow.
oh, sure. i mean, i don't really know what else to do anyway.
both miss kendall and i reported some of our luggage was missing.
now, how long does it take you people to find those things?
perhaps if you'll allow me to enter, you will find out.
it has been said that the two great cuisines of the civilised world are chinese and italian.
if i were to speculate, i would say that you were here doing business for your government.
except from what i understand, you were exiled from your county by that same government after you pocketed the money you got from my company.
it's given me a chance to put a lot of things into perspective.
in fact, i'm gonna act on one of them as soon as we get back to denver.
and don't, i repeat, don't let alexis in on any of this.
rashíd ahmed ís claímíng that he's the representatíve of the government of these chína sea leases.
i said all i have to say, to go on would be futile.
i lust want you to think vey hard, adam, before you make the biggest mistake of your life.
i thought this was to be a private meeting, a private deal.
miss kendall is here because i've had other private deals with you before and lived to regret them.
and what i have to say is too important to put off.
what's important is that i can see for myself it's true.
i'm just kinda going along with it to shut vera up.
she wants to start a family to have something to do.
i stole them off the front of a parade last night, coach.
at this very moment there are 26 tuba players marching right into the river.
well, i've had women get depressed when they left me, but i've never had one that went...
charm like yours is a hard thing to live without all right.
correct me if i'm wrong, but you just called me human for the first time.
i guess i just needed a little time to think about it.
boy, did i have a spectacular time basking up the old florida sunshine.
i'll tell you. i really got my head screwed on straight, too.
no more getting caught up in the irritations of day-to-day life... i'm just the kinda guy...
yeah, i stood on many a wind-swept beach and felt a oneness... felt...a...
she wants to start a family to have something to do.
poor norm's been shooting blanks for the last couple of months.
she's been locked up in a mental home for three months.
i was not locked up. i could come and go at will.
sorry, i just think maybe you ought to hear the guy out.
sammy, the way i see it is it can't do any harm and psychiatry has come a long way since "the snake pit" age.
i must say, he does appear to have the whitewood nose, at least from this angle.
my dear archie, the same claim could be made... for half the bastard sons of rutherford county.
uh, my name indeed is reggie whitewood, but, uh, as fate would have it... there are a number of similarities, uh, with my own background... and that of your long-lost, beloved cousin.
mr. chalmers here, uh, brilliant detective that he is... uh, caught scent of me in the states.
in cases such as yours- long-lost relatives returning and so forth- legal verification of identity often drags on for years through the courts.
but the documentation provided by mr. chalmers here... is absolutely the most irrefutable proof of claim i have ever seen.
well, i- if you'll excuse me... it was a very... dry journey from london.
i think i shall, uh, go and rest a bit before dinner.
my dear girl... each of these weapons is authentic, in perfect condition... and has been in this family for generations.
i look after them myself and would appreciate it if you would leave your hands off them.
once this is over, i'm taking mr. steele back to los angeles.
once this is over, harry and i are going to the south of france.
you certainly seem to be enjoying your role as the new duke... in spite of the fact that it could get you killed.
yes, but we agreed to play along until we got to the bottom of this.
you know, laura, as we lay there huddled together... just millimeters from death...
i began to think of all the things i've left undone in my life.
listen to this. "if my son reginald should become deceased before his investiture as duke...
"the entire estate shall be divided equally among my surviving relatives:
"or until 20 years from the date of my death... whichever comes first. "
that means, if reggie hadn't been found... 20 years would have to pass before the cousins received a nickel.
and when the chandelier came down, the only one... who didn't come out of her room immediately was gwen.
because at that time, she was likely taking the secret staircase to her room... where we found her up to her neck in a bubble bath.
- we'll smoke her out, harry- just like the old days, huh?
- sorry, daniel... but the thought of playing decoy to a desperate heiress doesn't appeal to me somehow.
a closer look at those documents will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt... that i am not reginald whitewood.
forgive me, your grace... but i don't understand your insistence on denying the obvious.
nothing to worry about, harry- a small ceremony... to make your accession to the dukedom official.
daniel, i am going to london to extricate myself from this scheme, period.
mr. chalmers here, uh, brilliant detective that he is... uh, caught scent of me in the states.
and naturally he was quite devastated to find that actually i am another reggie altogether.
an ex-military man, mr. bloggs loves complete order and cannot restrain himself from personally imposing it... upon our many gardens here at rutherford castle.
bloggs, perhaps you could explain to the ladies exactly- what it is you're doing with this plot.
it's not as if it's the first time you've pulled something like this.
if you're referring to my occasional side trips, laura, i can explain-
do you really think he would have let me bring him over here if in his heart...
- he weren't willing to go through with this little scheme?
miss holt, harry is one of a kind, a true artist.
the only reason he hasn't painted himself out of your life is that... the two of you have yet to experience the... ultimate moment.
yes, but we agreed to play along until we got to the bottom of this.
just as long as we understand when the game is over.
"the entire estate shall be divided equally among my surviving relatives:
"angus whitewood, archie whitewood, gwen whitewood... and the foundation to save the sussex speckled blue butterfly. "
but why is the killer so damned insistent on my being reggie?
i mean, wouldn't it be easier not to deal with me at all?
that means, if reggie hadn't been found... 20 years would have to pass before the cousins received a nickel.
and for any of those people to collect, they had to find reggie and then have reggie die.
your studies at sandhurst included extensive courses... in chemistry and biology, hence your knowledge of poisons.
then why didn't i put the poison in the port i brought him- or better yet, why not in all the drinks?
- sorry, daniel... but the thought of playing decoy to a desperate heiress doesn't appeal to me somehow.
in that case, i shall have to do it on my own.
forgive me, your grace... but i don't understand your insistence on denying the obvious.
now i've spent the past two hours poring over every word... every nuance of these documents.
they used a large sized press machine to make the counterfeit money.
your father didn't come back after he left for work... and then you received this letter?
you are changing my simple little mystery into something unforgivably crass.
no, i'm turning your dull, little book into an all-time hit picture.
are you saying you don't want a piece of the action?
i only want to determine my legal rights... to prevent that movie producer from debasing my novel.
i loved your book, mrs. fletcher, which is more than i can say for the screenplay.
jerry and the writer did a wonderful job of trashing your story.
just because the almighty gave people a taste for lobsters... doesn't mean that he gave lobsters a taste for being boiled alive.
i'm sorry, mr. lydecker, but i'm going to do whatever i have to do... to stop this picture being made.
we were in the ladies' wardrobe going over the costume changes.
heard the sirens, went outside, saw the police car in front of the soundstage.
i was so tense when i got home from the studio.
i thought a couple of drinks would make me feel better.
and the way he sees it, you didn't like what lydecker was doing to your book.
you had the opportunity, and you were caught leaving the scene of the crime.
i have absolutely no intention of trying to help you solve this murder.
i'm going back home to maine tomorrow on the noon plane.
on the first day of shooting, a party scene, someone put real vodka into her glass as a joke.
she turned bright red and accused me of trying to ruin her scene.
[scoffs] well, i admit it sounds rather provocative out of context...
miss finch, what did she say to you yesterday... when you suggested that she phonejerry lydecker instead of coming to see him on the set?
he can get you anything you want at warners, fox, paramount... anywhere... except for the studio where your picture's being made.
on account of your arrest, you've been banned from the lot as a disruptive influence.
well, norman, i want you to look into eve crystal's medical records,
allan gebhart's battle with alcohol and drugs, ross haley's financial status... and marta quintessa's relationship with jerry lydecker.
i want you to know that i just came from seeing some rushes.
it's so exciting to see my book come alive, and you are absolutely wonderful.
i have been known to weep buckets over a verse in a greeting card.
i cry over greeting cards too, especially when they say "happy birthday."
the top-grossing picture this week is about sex-crazed teenagers on a cruise.
and, uh, eve's studio has asked her to do a picture about sex-crazed teenagers on safari.
so he took the button and removed the fingerprints from the urn... and left the same way that he'd come in.
there's still time to tell your story to lieutenant hernandez, eve.
that would explain why you wore one from a scene that hadn't been shot yet... and that never will be shot.
jerry told me he wanted to drop scott from the film.
i just ran to the car and drove here in my costume.
well, that's why ross haley couldn't find your costume in your dressing room closet.
it was only later that i started thinking about what you were drinking that night.
i'm no expert, but even i know that real drinkers don't mix scotch whiskey with diet cola.
then i remembered marta saying... that someone put vodka in your glass in a party scene, and it caused you to turn bright red.
well, there is a certain oral medication that diabetics use that could've caused that.
you knew somebody would come to tell you about mr. lydecker, and you knew that you had to have an alibi.
i thought i could make it look as though i'd been drinking alone for hours... so no one would ever suspect.
you are changing my simple little mystery into something unforgivably crass.
no, i'm turning your dull, little book into an all-time hit picture.
are you saying you don't want a piece of the action?
i only want to determine my legal rights... to prevent that movie producer from debasing my novel.
that's why i had to do a page one rewrite on your script.
you cut out every line that required acting skills, so you could get your little playmate on the screen.
she's a wild female animal... who will do anything for the boy that she loves.
but-but, why does he want to do it in a cemetery?
i'm turning your dull, little book into an all-time hit picture.
but, surely, that's why you bought it was because it was a best seller.
well, it so happens that my name and my reputation are attached to that title.
now, i don't want to seem disagreeable, but i do believe that i have a right to protect my interests.
you can't stop me from doing whatever i want to your story.
just because the almighty gave people a taste for lobsters... doesn't mean that he gave lobsters a taste for being boiled alive.

i have absolutely no intention of trying to help you solve this murder.
i'm going back home to maine tomorrow on the noon plane.
get rid of the car, and you have too much smoke over there, not enough here.
on the first day of shooting, a party scene, someone put real vodka into her glass as a joke.
she said, "i promise you, mr. lydecker, that i will do whatever i have to do to stop you from making this picture. "
[scoffs] well, i admit it sounds rather provocative out of context...
miss finch, what did she say to you yesterday... when you suggested that she phonejerry lydecker instead of coming to see him on the set?
she said, " what i must do cannot be done on the telephone."
to throw off the real killer... and to give you a chance to do your thing.
having someone accuse me of murder in front of all those people was a ploy?
and, frankly,j.b., you've been upgraded from a good suspect to the prime suspect.
the d.a. thinks that he can get a conviction based on that evidence.
he can get you anything you want at warners, fox, paramount... anywhere... except for the studio where your picture's being made.
on account of your arrest, you've been banned from the lot as a disruptive influence.

a polar windstorm came up suddenly and skyfire and i were separated.
i circled half the globe searching for him, but he was gone.
here is kobra panther 2 i hear you miro, come in.
here is kobra panther 2 i hear you miro, come in.
some unknown, unexplained force is lifting objects into the air some weighing over one hundred kilograms and which are immediately fired into space.
first it happened with a cart of local carrier marko pivac.
i invited you, holm not only because you are excelling in cybernetic and electronics.
but also because you are one of our most skilled and reliable people.
i'm afraid, even though i walked around almost half of the world.
i even have read a lot of newspapers and various sorts of literature.
as president of the board of supervisors... it's my duty to make this announcement.
both mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk... have been shot and killed.
i fully realize that... a person who stands for what i stand for - an activist, gay activist - becomes the target or the potential target... for somebody who is insecure, terrified, afraid... or very disturbed themselves.
knowing that i could be assassinated at any moment or any time...
i met harvey like most people met harvey, i think - in his camera store.
um, i'd been living in the city about a year and a half, i guess, and - maybe not even that long - and went into the camera store - someone recommended it - to have my film developed... and was greeted by this raving maniac.
i had a miscarriage... and i was astounded that - that i'd had -
'75 or '76 i had a miscarriage, and i was astounded.
i felt like someone of worth, you know... and, uh, some respect - the teacher thing.
and if i was in fact feminine, or if i was in fact, you know - didn't always speak in a certain syntax, or if i said, you know...
[narrator] at first, harvey bernard milk... showed few signs he would make history.
born may 22, 1930... the second son of middle-class jewish parents... he grew up in woodmere, long island.
harvey milk had marched in antiwar demonstrations... burned his bankamericard in protest... and emigrated to san francisco.
he and lover scott smith settled down... and opened a camera store on castro street... in a quiet old neighborhood soon to become known as "the castro."
in 1973 he tried to make it official... by running for the board of supervisors, san francisco's city council.
to many, harvey milk seemed more like a joke than a candidate.
well, first time i heard of harvey... was uh... one of these, uh...
conventions at the labor council... and, uh, we're voting on who we're going to support.
in 1975, neighborhood activists like harvey milk... found a strong supporter in their new mayor, george moscone.
moscone had campaigned on the conviction... that a city is enriched by more than downtown development.
[moscone on microphone] ... to make our city work once again.
as the new mayor, moscone showed respect... for his city's many neighborhoods, cultures, and peoples.
my late father was a guard at san quentin... and who i was visiting one day and who showed to me... and then explained the function of the, the death chamber.
and it just seemed inconceivable to me, though i was pretty young at the time... that in this society that i had been trained to believe... was the most effective and efficient of all societies... that the only way we could deal with violent crime... would be to do the ultimate ourselves... and that's to governmentally sanction the taking of another person's life.
[narrator] moscone and his allies, including harvey milk... set about designing a plan... for neighborhood people to run the city they lived in.
the plan, called "district elections"... would allow candidates for supervisor, such as harvey milk... to run from districts rather than the city at large.
they had this crazy idea that they're gonna change the form of government... the way we elect our, uh, officials in this town.
there was one meeting, it was supposed to be... behind this guy harvey milk's camera store.
and so i went to the meeting, and i kinda thought...
"what the hell am i doin' here with all these fruits and kooks?"
[narrator] the voters of san francisco decided... to give the district elections plan a try.
in the castro, a new kind of politics was taking shape.
there's just too many candidates, the vote is split all over the place... and there's too many things happening nobody knows about.
[woman] there are at least seven candidates with a shot at capturing... the heart of the city, district no. 5.
the liberal vote is split between three main candidates and many lesser ones.
one main is terence hallinan... an attorney with endorsements from democrats and labor.
i think when it comes to a matter of who came first, that's fairly easily provable.
i don't think anyone ever heard of harvey milk until he ran for office in 1973.
any single neighborhood issue or city issue for the last five years... you found harvey milk taking a stand - one way or the other, but taking a stand.
[woman] every candidate claims to know of polls... showing him the winner or running strong... but the one candidate who seems to run best of all has very low visibility.
when he decided to run for supervisor, he did call me... and i went in to meet with him... and we just hit it off instantly.
that very first day, he asked me if i would run his campaign.
one day i was in there in the campaign headquarters... and i'm looking around at this motley group of people.
it was a lot of fun, but give me a break!
he'd run in our neighborhood, and anything goes in our neighborhood.
but when you get out, you know, you kind of have to kind of blend in.
and i looked at anne, and here she was, you know... like a big dyke, with the motorcycle clothes on.
and then there's john with his three-piece suit... and there's little mike - michael wong... who harvey always called his lotus blossom... and a couple of old ladies that would be in there too, bless their hearts.
everything happened in this long, dingy camera store - everything from "save the whales" to "get elected."
[kronenberg] we had volunteers... in all different shapes and sizes... from medora payne-size... up to 70-year-old women who wanted to be doing something.
he rode up on his - not his motorcycle, my motorcycle.
they all got off the bikes then... and harvey was just encircled with people.
i mean, the feeling there was just one of such total joy.
and it was more than just, you know, a candidate winning.
it was the fact that all of these lesbians and gay men throughout san francisco... who had felt like they'd had no voice before... now had someone who represented them.
[ammiano] you just feel so good for milk... but feeling good for milk, you were feeling good for yourself.
what does this mean, your election, your activity now... on the board of supervisors in san francisco?
does that mean, as many straights are concerned... that maybe the gays are taking over san francisco?
and i was impressed on the spot, and it made a good story.
it's as if he knew."you came here with an attitude that i was just... a homosexual with a camera store, and i'll show you!"
this will be the first time in many years that we've seen... so many relatively new faces on the san francisco board of supervisors.
and this is probably because it's the first time in a long time... that supervisors have been elected by district instead of citywide.
but then we got the first taste of the new politics.
someone suggested the board vote again to make it unanimous for feinstein... but newcomers milk and silver refused.
they stuck to their votes for lau, to cheers from their supporters.
and just about everyone at city hall today was agreeing on one thing:
they may be a lot of things, but they probably won't be dull.
[der] it was interesting to see that harvey... did not vote for dianne feinstein to be president... and it really shocked many of us in the audience, because -
[narrator] lost in the hubbub... over the rise of california's first publicly gay official... was the election of dan white... another kind of neighborhood populist.
[man] dan white has worked and lived virtually all his 31 years... in this southeastern section of san francisco.
[man] clean-cut, respectful to his elders... and seemingly possessed of small-town values.
when was the last time you heard a san francisco politician... talk about setting up neighborhood athletic teams?
[white] and then, when we get the best team... we will challenge, say, harvey milk's district to a game of softball... where they have champs out there.
in a sense you could say it's old-fashioned... but it's old-fashioned values that built this country.
[man] dan white says nobody's gonna ignore his corner of the city anymore.
[narrator] dan white and harvey milk... became symbols of the new district election system.
milk's victory sparked euphoria among his supporters... and a sense of something new arriving at city hall.
he wanted to meet carter, and he thought that was very important.
and i think he even brought a photographer along... even though carter didn't want to be photographed with a gay person.
and ruth carter stapleton was - you know, the evangel - evangelical sister - was carrying on a mission on gays.
she told harvey that she could convert him... and that, even though he was jewish, if he gave himself to jesus christ... that his homosexuality would disappear or something.
and he made a couple of very wry comments... and one of them was that -
on the citywide level, i think it's vital... that the minorities... the traditional, ethnic minorities... and the gays and the feminists link together.
and possibly the rank-and-file union - not the union leaders, the rank-and-file - link together to form a very solid, strong coalition... so that we can influence the total direction of the city.
[narrator] as supervisor, harvey milk had the political skills... to advance the issues that neighborhood people cared about:
rent control, limiting high-rise development... public transportation, and the rights of senior citizens.
anytime he'd make a speech about anything, i agreed with him.
so then i thought he was a great man... because i agreed with what he talked about.
harvey said that if anyone solved... the dog shit problem in this city... that they could be elected mayor.
and so he started, in the first month of being in city hall... to come up with some kind of ordinance to take care of dog shit.
and he knew that the pooper-scooper ordinance... along with a few other things, would really give him good press.
he was a master at figuring out... what would get him covered in the newspaper.
and so the day of his press conference for the pooper-scooper ordinance... he went out early and planted some shit on the lawn... so that after his press conference he knew... just where he was gonna stand that he would step in it.
[man] supervisor milk took to the grassy lawn... at duboce park this afternoon to publicize the new law.
under the ordinance, dog lovers who don't clean up can be fined.
i think what needs to happen is what happened in new york:
that people use their own ingenuity, their own ideas, their own concepts.
some people are using their pie tins... some people are using the wall street journal... and other people are using doggie-doo's and shovels.
harvey milk's stand on which voting machine... the city should purchase was a critical role.
at that time, george moscone favored votomatic... and harvey really was quite vocal.
and he said the city should go with votomatic... because non-english-speaking citizens... particularly those who are elderly, who have experienced discrimination... can exercise their right to vote in the most accessible manner.
he locked heads with quentin kopp... and dianne feinstein over the issue.
he knew that it was the right machine... and he didn't have to call any one of us and say...
"gee, i want to remind you folks that i'm doing you this great favor... and i want you to be indebted to me."
[narrator] the issue closest to harvey milk's heart... was a gay rights bill for san francisco.
with the gay rights ordinance in san francisco, the main focus is... is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay... who, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes... prevents them from being fired.
in the bay area, there are hundreds and hundreds of gay doctors... most of who are closeted because of fear of loss of jobs.
in san francisco, they can "come out"... and not have to worry about their jobs.
you can have someone that's a transvestite - a man that for his sexual, um, kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it... loves to dress up as a woman.
if he is a qualified teacher, he can go into any school... or he can go into any business, and they can't refuse him.
we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco... and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
they want to bring their sin out of the closet... and parade it on the street... and be called respectable, decent, natural people.
briggs mounted a campaign... for proposition 6, a statewide measure... to deny homosexuals their jobs in public schools.
now, what proposition 6 is really all about... is the right of parents to determine... who will be teaching their children.
[narrator] proposition 6 brought the issue of homosexuality... into the homes of millions of californians... and it thrust harvey milk into a statewide spotlight.
there are already laws on the books to protect our children.
everybody from superintendent of schools wilson riles... to jerry brown to newspaper editors across the state agree... that indeed we have the laws to protect our children.
i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught... by heterosexual teachers... in a fiercely heterosexual society... with television ads and newspaper ads - fiercely heterosexual.
and i ended being his cochair... of the united fund to fight the briggs initiative.
and that began our association, which over those months... when proposition 6 came into being, became a real close association.
and i got to know him on a level that i had never anticipated.
[woman] nobody took harvey milk very seriously... when he first ran for the san francisco board of supervisors in 1973... but last year milk won election to the board of supervisors... where he's the first openly gay city official in the united states.
and representing the bay area committee against the briggs initiative... is sally gearheart - a lesbian, a former high school teacher... and now a speech professor at san francisco state university.
[gearhart] i remember that just before that debate... we had had a lot of talk, harvey and i, about how we would dress... and we had agreed that the image to project was sort of "mama and papa u.s.a.":
the fact is, at least 95% of the people are heterosexual.
if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out, you know what?
no, i was saying we cannot prevent child molestation... so let's cut our odds down and take out... the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group.
[gearhart] why take out the homosexual group when it's more, you know -
sometimes i think what we were faced with in proposition 6... was not so much a conflict of values... as two sets of fears.
the incredible fears that the gay community had, all of us... that here we were, being stomped on... by what was turning out to be the moral majority.
i mean, our very lives were being, you know, threatened - the ways that we live, what our lifestyle is - and our reaction was extreme, and it should have been extreme.
but then when you get into the other person's shoes... you figure that there was a lot of fear on the part of the fundamentalists as well.
i mean, when you've lived your entire life... believing in a certain social structure... believing in certain sex roles... believing in the ways that men and women should relate to each other... believing in the family... you know, believing in what god -
what you believe god says should be the way... human beings should relate within the family structure... and all of a sudden, there are these "perverts" out here... saying there are ways to live that are different from that... and that furthermore it's great and beautiful and true and good -
we were so pessimistic - or at least i was, and a lot of other people were - that we thought we might even lose san francisco.
[woman] the bulk of briggs' support lies in southern california... so his appearance here was more symbolic than functional.
he called san francisco the "moral garbage dump of the nation."
if they're gonna lead such an open life of homosexuality... that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them... those people are gonna be in danger of being removed from their job.
so even though he was a buffoon, and even though he was ludicrous... he was also - at least the people who advised him - were brilliant... because they picked on this particular issue: children!
um, it would be hard for me... if we're talking about schools, to go along with you.
no. 6 would force local school districts... to fire any teacher that was gay... or who believed that gay people have rights like other people.
and we're concerned that that would be a real attack... on human rights for everybody.
i think a lot of people are gonna realize they have to make an ultimate decision.
the decision is to go back in their closet real good... slam the door tight - which some will do - or burst down those closet doors once and for all... and stand up and start to fight.
because if we learn from history that the struggle goes on... eventually we will win.
and all the president has to do is - or the governor - is to turn the pages of history a little faster.
one month before the election, the polls predicted a close vote.
many people had come to believe... the briggs initiative would violate constitutional rights.
a surprising array of political figures... including former governor ronald reagan... and supervisor dan white... went on record against the proposition.
[woman] president carter spent less than an hour... at this downtown sacramento rally.
ford and reagan have already come out against it, so i think it's perfectly safe.
also, i want to ask everybody to vote against proposition 6.
and who had been the man who had carried the banner for gay people, you know?
who had been the man who had fought all along... in his politics on the board of supervisors... but particularly during the 6 campaign?
[milk on microphone] to the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition 6... and now we owe them something.
we owe them to continue the education campaign that took place.
we must destroy the myths, once and for all shatter them.
we must continue to speak out... and most importantly... most importantly, every gay person... must come out.
my wife and my supporters worked awfully hard... so that i would be elected.
and it was a major decision, as you can all understand, on friday... that i had to come - to arrive at.
but since that time, people unknown to me... plus my family and friends, uh... have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office... that they supported me to stay in office.
[narrator] mayor moscone learned from the city attorney... that dan white could not take back his resignation.
and certainly harvey was courageous in that stance... because no one else was doin' it.
and there were other supervisors on the board who felt just as strongly... but they weren't going to get involved in that.
[man] moscone started to get word from his coalition... of neighborhood groups and ethnic voters.
most of the problems of the people here tonight... were that they were not consulted - they might have helped - and the fact that they weren't even given the dignity... of his concern bothered them.
the issue is what's fair, right, and just for the people of district 8.
[man] white was at city hall with his group of backers:
some citizens, firemen... and a delegation representing large real estate firms.
i'm overwhelmed at your support, that you would take time out... to come down here on a friday at this time... to show not only me but the people of my district... and the people of san francisco... that you approve of the way i'm conducting myself.
[narrator] but then dan white and the shambles of his political career... were upstaged by chaos of an entirely different order.
the city learned of the murder-suicide... of some 900 people... most of them san franciscans.
i was flying up to seattle to visit my folks... and it's really -
i think it was the first time i had seen them since our talk about coming out.
and so i screamed, and i came back up van ness avenue... and i remember thinking, "people are going about their business in an ordinary way.
how dare they go about their business in an ordinary way!
and i knew it was milk because i knew how tall he was.
and they hadn't covered part of his feet or something, and i -
so we drove directly from the airport to city hall... and there were maybe 75 people there.
and i remember thinking, "my god, is this all that anybody cared?" you know.
market street runs in a straight line out to the castro area.
and as we turned the corner... there were people... as wide as this wide street, as far as you could see.
[kronenberg] thousands and thousands of people... and that feeling of such loss.
having lost someone who was so important - and some thing.
i don't know if you call it "expressing your grief" or what it was... but being with all those people, and... it's nighttime in san francisco, and a bunch of strangers around you... and you feel as safe as you do in your own home.
and there was this black man on the corner of - whatever
i think that all of us at that time... were in such a, a, a state of shock, you know, that -
i don't know if it was numbed or we were anesthetized.
certainly i was angry... but it seemed appropriate to do this... peaceful, kind of internalized thing... out of some kind of respect for the enormity of what happened.
it was one of the most eloquent expressions... of a community's response to violence that i've ever seen.
i think we sent a message to the nation that night... about what our immediate response was.
not violence... but a certain respect for harvey... and a deep - a deep regret and feeling of tragedy about it... because moscone had been our friend as well.
[hartmann] and then going down to city hall... that tremendous expanse of people.
and i turned to john and i said, "harvey would have loved this!"
harvey milk's ashes were scattered into the pacific by his friends.
[man] today we went looking for clues to why white would kill the mayor... who refused to reappoint him to his post... and a supervisor who opposed him politically.
i sort of developed this sense of doom... that justice was not going to prevail... because the jury selection process... excluded gay people... minority residents, and anyone who may have had... a political point of view that would be different from dan white.
and i don't want to knock the jury system... because i do believe in the jury system... but once you knock all these people out... what does that leave you with?
we had turned this over to be taken care of... to a system that was actually in many ways responsible for these assassinations.
so there's this little feeling in your stomach when you get afraid and you think...
detailing the facts of the crime... the state spent three days proving that dan white committed the murders.
white's own lawyers had already admitted this in their opening statement.
and then i just got all flushed and hot... and i shot him.
now, if dan white wants to save himself from the death penalty... he's going to have to prove that he didn't plan to kill anyone that day.
prosecutors say he did premeditate the murders... because on that day he put his gun on... and he put a bunch of extra bullets into his pocket.
then he got into city hall here by climbing in this window... knowing he couldn't get his gun past the metal detector in the main entrance.
prosecutors say this shows he was planning to do something suspicious.
white's lawyer claims it's common for people... to try to get into city hall this way... that dan white was only carrying a gun to protect himself... and that other supervisors, including feinstein... have carried guns for protection.
but if he was only trying to protect himself that day... why did he put all those extra bullets into his pocket?
it will be interesting to see how the defense tries to explain that.
well, i didn't mention "with permits"... but i did say that other supervisors and perhaps other city hall personnel... do carry firearms presently and have carried them in the past, yeah.
do you know if the other people who do carry weapons... also carry ten extra rounds in their pocket?
i think ex-police officers... and certainly police officers, on or off duty... carry extra ammunition, yes.
and that is also why you say he reloaded after shooting mayor moscone.
i firmly believe that there's... something for us good that will come out of this.
[narrator] white's lawyers introduced the testimony of five psychiatrists... to prove that he acted while in a state of severe depression... induced in part by consuming too much junk food.
you do expect surprises... and to be ready and open-minded for surprises - the shocking fact that he did this... and you might also have the shocking fact... that there was some extenuating circumstances... or some reason why he was innocent.
so you're ready for that kind of possibility, but i thought he might get the chair.
i remember rushing out of the courtroom... and the news was on line, waiting for the verdict.
i remember thinking to myself, "try to look like you're not so shocked."
yes, the jury has found dan white guilty of voluntary manslaughter... in the killings of both george moscone and harvey milk.
that's a verdict that carries two, three, or four years on each of those counts.
he also could receive two years each... for using a gun in the commission of the crime.
[man] and once again to repeat... that is the verdicts that white's attorney, doug schmidt, had asked the jury to return.
[man #2] dan white could now receive anywhere from four to 12 years in prison... with a possibility of parole after -
[man #1] we have received word that a demonstration has been called... for 8:00 this evening in front of city hall... to protest the dan white verdict.
[man] by about 11:20, things had gone from good to bad... to good and to very bad.
there's a narrow perimeter of shaky policemen... on my left over here in front of city hall.
behind them, and sometimes in the midst of them, are the demonstrators.
every once in a while, a demonstrator, a protestor, will come out of the crowd... throw a piece of burning material into a police car, and start it on fire.
i think it's gonna set, uh, back... the, uh, fight for human rights a great deal.
and i must tell you that if persons are arrested... for the crimes that have been committed tonight... my office is gonna prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
if you remember, the violence that started all this... was dan white's violence.
i feel that the jury was violent this afternoon... by treating dan white in a way that nobody's ever gonna believe... they would have treated a black person or a gay person... or someone who did not fit dan's type image.
i was right with 'em in saying i - you know...
"there is no justice here today... and anything that we do is absolutely fine."
"you know, it's not important to be civil in american society.
and it's not important to honor other people's right... as long as you are white... and you uphold certain white, middle-class values... because you're gonna get away with murder.
i think he would have been guilty of murder... and been in san quentin the rest of his life.
but sad to say, i think there's a lot of people in this world... that still think if you kill a gay... you're doin' a service to society.
[narrator] dan white was released from prison on january 7, 1984.
he served 5 1/2 years... and received no psychiatric treatment in prison.
[milk] somewheres in des moines or san antonio... there's a young gay person... who all of a sudden realizes that she or he is gay... knows that if their parents find out... they'll be tossed out of the house.
the classmates would taunt the child... and the anita bryants and john briggs are doing their bit on tv.
and you've got to elect gay people... so that that young child, and the thousands upon thousands... like that child... know that there's hope for a better world... there's hope for a better tomorrow.
without hope, not only gays, but those blacks... and the asians... and the disabled, the seniors - the "us's."
san francisco's mayor george moscone... and supervisor harvey milk... were assassinated in city hall.
harvey milk had served only 11 months on san francisco's board of supervisors... but he had already come to represent something far greater than his office.
[man on tape] this is to be played only in the event... of my death by assassination.
i fully realize that... a person who stands for what i stand for - an activist, gay activist - becomes the target or the potential target... for somebody who is insecure, terrified, afraid... or very disturbed themselves.
almost everything was done in the eyes of the gay movement.
i met harvey like most people met harvey, i think - in his camera store.
um, i'd been living in the city about a year and a half, i guess, and - maybe not even that long - and went into the camera store - someone recommended it - to have my film developed... and was greeted by this raving maniac.
he was screaming and - i don't even know what the issue was... but he was screaming and shouting at someone in the camera store... and i
'75 or '76 i had a miscarriage, and i was astounded.
i mean, it's a - it's a devastating physical experience... as well as a mental experience.
one level was his sense of humor, which i liked, you know.
and you know, making fun of things that sometimes were very heavy... which was how i was brought up.
born may 22, 1930... the second son of middle-class jewish parents... he grew up in woodmere, long island.
the little kid with the big ears became, in high school... an ordinary student, a practical joker, and a regular guy.
then he began a career as a stock analyst on wall street.
what was not on the resume... was his homosexuality... which harvey milk had known about since he was 14.
when he dubbed himself "the mayor of castro street," the idea stuck.
in 1973 he tried to make it official... by running for the board of supervisors, san francisco's city council.
to many, harvey milk seemed more like a joke than a candidate.
well, first time i heard of harvey... was uh... one of these, uh...
and then we found out that, uh... he got coors beer out of all of the gay bars in san francisco.
and this coors beer boycott... which labor's been trying to do throughout the united states... especially in san francisco, a labor town... uh, really hadn't been too successful.
but in each race he garnered more and more votes... enough to establish himself as a broker for his neighborhood... and the growing gay community.
in 1975, neighborhood activists like harvey milk... found a strong supporter in their new mayor, george moscone.
as the new mayor, moscone showed respect... for his city's many neighborhoods, cultures, and peoples.
my late father was a guard at san quentin... and who i was visiting one day and who showed to me... and then explained the function of the, the death chamber.
and it just seemed inconceivable to me, though i was pretty young at the time... that in this society that i had been trained to believe... was the most effective and efficient of all societies... that the only way we could deal with violent crime... would be to do the ultimate ourselves... and that's to governmentally sanction the taking of another person's life.
[narrator] moscone and his allies, including harvey milk... set about designing a plan... for neighborhood people to run the city they lived in.
the plan, called "district elections"... would allow candidates for supervisor, such as harvey milk... to run from districts rather than the city at large.
they had this crazy idea that they're gonna change the form of government... the way we elect our, uh, officials in this town.
there was one meeting, it was supposed to be... behind this guy harvey milk's camera store.
and so i went to the meeting, and i kinda thought...
each summer, harvey milk helped organize the castro street fair... where the neighborhood celebrated its very existence.
[man singing] when we're out there dancing on the floor, darlin'
there's just too many candidates, the vote is split all over the place... and there's too many things happening nobody knows about.
[woman] there are at least seven candidates with a shot at capturing... the heart of the city, district no. 5.
the liberal vote is split between three main candidates and many lesser ones.
one main is terence hallinan... an attorney with endorsements from democrats and labor.
i think when it comes to a matter of who came first, that's fairly easily provable.
i don't think anyone ever heard of harvey milk until he ran for office in 1973.
any single neighborhood issue or city issue for the last five years... you found harvey milk taking a stand - one way or the other, but taking a stand.
[woman] every candidate claims to know of polls... showing him the winner or running strong... but the one candidate who seems to run best of all has very low visibility.
when he decided to run for supervisor, he did call me... and i went in to meet with him... and we just hit it off instantly.
that very first day, he asked me if i would run his campaign.
one day i was in there in the campaign headquarters... and i'm looking around at this motley group of people.
it was a lot of fun, but give me a break!
he'd run in our neighborhood, and anything goes in our neighborhood.
but when you get out, you know, you kind of have to kind of blend in.
and i looked at anne, and here she was, you know... like a big dyke, with the motorcycle clothes on.
and then there's john with his three-piece suit... and there's little mike - michael wong... who harvey always called his lotus blossom... and a couple of old ladies that would be in there too, bless their hearts.
everything happened in this long, dingy camera store - everything from "save the whales" to "get elected."
[kronenberg] we had volunteers... in all different shapes and sizes... from medora payne-size... up to 70-year-old women who wanted to be doing something.
he rode up on his - not his motorcycle, my motorcycle.
they all got off the bikes then... and harvey was just encircled with people.
i mean, the feeling there was just one of such total joy.
and it was more than just, you know, a candidate winning.
it was the fact that all of these lesbians and gay men throughout san francisco... who had felt like they'd had no voice before... now had someone who represented them.
[ammiano] you just feel so good for milk... but feeling good for milk, you were feeling good for yourself.
what does this mean, your election, your activity now... on the board of supervisors in san francisco?
does that mean, as many straights are concerned... that maybe the gays are taking over san francisco?
and i was impressed on the spot, and it made a good story.
it's as if he knew. "you came here with an attitude that i was just... a homosexual with a camera store, and i'll show you!"
this will be the first time in many years that we've seen... so many relatively new faces on the san francisco board of supervisors.
and this is probably because it's the first time in a long time... that supervisors have been elected by district instead of citywide.
but then we got the first taste of the new politics.
someone suggested the board vote again to make it unanimous for feinstein... but newcomers milk and silver refused.
they stuck to their votes for lau, to cheers from their supporters.
and just about everyone at city hall today was agreeing on one thing:
they may be a lot of things, but they probably won't be dull.
[der] it was interesting to see that harvey... did not vote for dianne feinstein to be president... and it really shocked many of us in the audience, because -
[narrator] lost in the hubbub... over the rise of california's first publicly gay official... was the election of dan white... another kind of neighborhood populist.
[man] dan white has worked and lived virtually all his 31 years... in this southeastern section of san francisco.
[man] clean-cut, respectful to his elders... and seemingly possessed of small-town values.
when was the last time you heard a san francisco politician... talk about setting up neighborhood athletic teams?
[white] and then, when we get the best team... we will challenge, say, harvey milk's district to a game of softball... where they have champs out there.
in a sense you could say it's old-fashioned... but it's old-fashioned values that built this country.
[man] dan white says nobody's gonna ignore his corner of the city anymore.
[narrator] dan white and harvey milk... became symbols of the new district election system.
milk's victory sparked euphoria among his supporters... and a sense of something new arriving at city hall.
he wanted to meet carter, and he thought that was very important.
and i think he even brought a photographer along... even though carter didn't want to be photographed with a gay person.
and ruth carter stapleton was - you know, the evangel - evangelical sister - was carrying on a mission on gays.
she told harvey that she could convert him... and that, even though he was jewish, if he gave himself to jesus christ... that his homosexuality would disappear or something.
and he made a couple of very wry comments... and one of them was that -
on the citywide level, i think it's vital... that the minorities... the traditional, ethnic minorities... and the gays and the feminists link together.
and possibly the rank-and-file union - not the union leaders, the rank-and-file - link together to form a very solid, strong coalition... so that we can influence the total direction of the city.
[narrator] as supervisor, harvey milk had the political skills... to advance the issues that neighborhood people cared about:
rent control, limiting high-rise development... public transportation, and the rights of senior citizens.
anytime he'd make a speech about anything, i agreed with him.
so then i thought he was a great man... because i agreed with what he talked about.
harvey said that if anyone solved... the dog shit problem in this city... that they could be elected mayor.
and so he started, in the first month of being in city hall... to come up with some kind of ordinance to take care of dog shit.
and he knew that the pooper-scooper ordinance... along with a few other things, would really give him good press.
he was a master at figuring out... what would get him covered in the newspaper.
and so the day of his press conference for the pooper-scooper ordinance... he went out early and planted some shit on the lawn... so that after his press conference he knew... just where he was gonna stand that he would step in it.
[man] supervisor milk took to the grassy lawn... at duboce park this afternoon to publicize the new law.
under the ordinance, dog lovers who don't clean up can be fined.
i think what needs to happen is what happened in new york:
that people use their own ingenuity, their own ideas, their own concepts.
some people are using their pie tins... some people are using the wall street journal... and other people are using doggie-doo's and shovels.
harvey milk's stand on which voting machine... the city should purchase was a critical role.
at that time, george moscone favored votomatic... and harvey really was quite vocal.
and he said the city should go with votomatic... because non-english-speaking citizens... particularly those who are elderly, who have experienced discrimination... can exercise their right to vote in the most accessible manner.
he locked heads with quentin kopp... and dianne feinstein over the issue.
he knew that it was the right machine... and he didn't have to call any one of us and say...
"gee, i want to remind you folks that i'm doing you this great favor... and i want you to be indebted to me."
[narrator] the issue closest to harvey milk's heart... was a gay rights bill for san francisco.
with the gay rights ordinance in san francisco, the main focus is... is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay... who, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes... prevents them from being fired.
in the bay area, there are hundreds and hundreds of gay doctors... most of who are closeted because of fear of loss of jobs.
in san francisco, they can "come out"... and not have to worry about their jobs.
you can have someone that's a transvestite - a man that for his sexual, um, kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it... loves to dress up as a woman.
if he is a qualified teacher, he can go into any school... or he can go into any business, and they can't refuse him.
we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco... and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
they want to bring their sin out of the closet... and parade it on the street... and be called respectable, decent, natural people.
briggs mounted a campaign... for proposition 6, a statewide measure... to deny homosexuals their jobs in public schools.
now, what proposition 6 is really all about... is the right of parents to determine... who will be teaching their children.
[narrator] proposition 6 brought the issue of homosexuality... into the homes of millions of californians... and it thrust harvey milk into a statewide spotlight.
there are already laws on the books to protect our children.
everybody from superintendent of schools wilson riles... to jerry brown to newspaper editors across the state agree... that indeed we have the laws to protect our children.
i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught... by heterosexual teachers... in a fiercely heterosexual society... with television ads and newspaper ads - fiercely heterosexual.
and i ended being his cochair... of the united fund to fight the briggs initiative.
and that began our association, which over those months... when proposition 6 came into being, became a real close association.
and i got to know him on a level that i had never anticipated.
[woman] nobody took harvey milk very seriously... when he first ran for the san francisco board of supervisors in 1973... but last year milk won election to the board of supervisors... where he's the first openly gay city official in the united states.
and representing the bay area committee against the briggs initiative... is sally gearheart - a lesbian, a former high school teacher... and now a speech professor at san francisco state university.
[gearhart] i remember that just before that debate... we had had a lot of talk, harvey and i, about how we would dress... and we had agreed that the image to project was sort of "mama and papa u.s.a.":
the fact is, at least 95% of the people are heterosexual.
if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out, you know what?
no, i was saying we cannot prevent child molestation... so let's cut our odds down and take out... the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group.
[gearhart] why take out the homosexual group when it's more, you know -
sometimes i think what we were faced with in proposition 6... was not so much a conflict of values... as two sets of fears.
the incredible fears that the gay community had, all of us... that here we were, being stomped on... by what was turning out to be the moral majority.
i mean, our very lives were being, you know, threatened - the ways that we live, what our lifestyle is - and our reaction was extreme, and it should have been extreme.
but then when you get into the other person's shoes... you figure that there was a lot of fear on the part of the fundamentalists as well.
i mean, when you've lived your entire life... believing in a certain social structure... believing in certain sex roles... believing in the ways that men and women should relate to each other... believing in the family... you know, believing in what god -
what you believe god says should be the way... human beings should relate within the family structure... and all of a sudden, there are these "perverts" out here... saying there are ways to live that are different from that... and that furthermore it's great and beautiful and true and good -
we were so pessimistic - or at least i was, and a lot of other people were - that we thought we might even lose san francisco.
[woman] the bulk of briggs' support lies in southern california... so his appearance here was more symbolic than functional.
he called san francisco the "moral garbage dump of the nation."
if they're gonna lead such an open life of homosexuality... that they want a 21 -gun salute every time somebody goes by them... those people are gonna be in danger of being removed from their job.
so even though he was a buffoon, and even though he was ludicrous... he was also - at least the people who advised him - were brilliant... because they picked on this particular issue: children!
um, it would be hard for me... if we're talking about schools, to go along with you.
no. 6 would force local school districts... to fire any teacher that was gay... or who believed that gay people have rights like other people.
and we're concerned that that would be a real attack... on human rights for everybody.
i think a lot of people are gonna realize they have to make an ultimate decision.
the decision is to go back in their closet real good... slam the door tight - which some will do - or burst down those closet doors once and for all... and stand up and start to fight.
because if we learn from history that the struggle goes on... eventually we will win.
and all the president has to do is - or the governor - is to turn the pages of history a little faster.
one month before the election, the polls predicted a close vote.
many people had come to believe... the briggs initiative would violate constitutional rights.
a surprising array of political figures... including former governor ronald reagan... and supervisor dan white... went on record against the proposition.
[woman] president carter spent less than an hour... at this downtown sacramento rally.
ford and reagan have already come out against it, so i think it's perfectly safe.
also, i want to ask everybody to vote against proposition 6.
and who had been the man who had carried the banner for gay people, you know?
who had been the man who had fought all along... in his politics on the board of supervisors... but particularly during the 6 campaign?
[milk on microphone] to the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition 6... and now we owe them something.
we owe them to continue the education campaign that took place.
we must destroy the myths, once and for all shatter them.
we must continue to speak out... and most importantly... most importantly, every gay person... must come out.
my wife and my supporters worked awfully hard... so that i would be elected.
and it was a major decision, as you can all understand, on friday... that i had to come - to arrive at.
but since that time, people unknown to me... plus my family and friends, uh... have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office... that they supported me to stay in office.
[narrator] mayor moscone learned from the city attorney... that dan white could not take back his resignation.
and certainly harvey was courageous in that stance... because no one else was doin' it.
and there were other supervisors on the board who felt just as strongly... but they weren't going to get involved in that.
[man] moscone started to get word from his coalition... of neighborhood groups and ethnic voters.
most of the problems of the people here tonight... were that they were not consulted - they might have helped - and the fact that they weren't even given the dignity... of his concern bothered them.
the issue is what's fair, right, and just for the people of district 8.
[man] white was at city hall with his group of backers:
some citizens, firemen... and a delegation representing large real estate firms.
i'm overwhelmed at your support, that you would take time out... to come down here on a friday at this time... to show not only me but the people of my district... and the people of san francisco... that you approve of the way i'm conducting myself.
[narrator] but then dan white and the shambles of his political career... were upstaged by chaos of an entirely different order.
the city learned of the murder-suicide... of some 900 people... most of them san franciscans.
i was flying up to seattle to visit my folks... and it's really -
i think it was the first time i had seen them since our talk about coming out.
and so i screamed, and i came back up van ness avenue... and i remember thinking, "people are going about their business in an ordinary way.
how dare they go about their business in an ordinary way!
and i knew it was milk because i knew how tall he was.
and they hadn't covered part of his feet or something, and i -
so we drove directly from the airport to city hall... and there were maybe 75 people there.
and i remember thinking, "my god, is this all that anybody cared?" you know.
market street runs in a straight line out to the castro area.
and as we turned the corner... there were people... as wide as this wide street, as far as you could see.
[kronenberg] thousands and thousands of people... and that feeling of such loss.
having lost someone who was so important - and some thing.
i don't know if you call it "expressing your grief" or what it was... but being with all those people, and... it's nighttime in san francisco, and a bunch of strangers around you... and you feel as safe as you do in your own home.
and there was this black man on the corner of - whatever
i think that all of us at that time... were in such a, a, a state of shock, you know, that -
i don't know if it was numbed or we were anesthetized.
certainly i was angry... but it seemed appropriate to do this... peaceful, kind of internalized thing... out of some kind of respect for the enormity of what happened.
it was one of the most eloquent expressions... of a community's response to violence that i've ever seen.
i think we sent a message to the nation that night... about what our immediate response was.
not violence... but a certain respect for harvey... and a deep - a deep regret and feeling of tragedy about it... because moscone had been our friend as well.
[hartmann] and then going down to city hall... that tremendous expanse of people.
and i turned to john and i said, "harvey would have loved this!"
harvey milk's ashes were scattered into the pacific by his friends.
[man] today we went looking for clues to why white would kill the mayor... who refused to reappoint him to his post... and a supervisor who opposed him politically.
i sort of developed this sense of doom... that justice was not going to prevail... because the jury selection process... excluded gay people... minority residents, and anyone who may have had... a political point of view that would be different from dan white.
and i don't want to knock the jury system... because i do believe in the jury system... but once you knock all these people out... what does that leave you with?
we had turned this over to be taken care of... to a system that was actually in many ways responsible for these assassinations.
so there's this little feeling in your stomach when you get afraid and you think...
detailing the facts of the crime... the state spent three days proving that dan white committed the murders.
white's own lawyers had already admitted this in their opening statement.
and then i just got all flushed and hot... and i shot him.
now, if dan white wants to save himself from the death penalty... he's going to have to prove that he didn't plan to kill anyone that day.
prosecutors say he did premeditate the murders... because on that day he put his gun on... and he put a bunch of extra bullets into his pocket.
then he got into city hall here by climbing in this window... knowing he couldn't get his gun past the metal detector in the main entrance.
prosecutors say this shows he was planning to do something suspicious.
white's lawyer claims it's common for people... to try to get into city hall this way... that dan white was only carrying a gun to protect himself... and that other supervisors, including feinstein... have carried guns for protection.
but if he was only trying to protect himself that day... why did he put all those extra bullets into his pocket?
it will be interesting to see how the defense tries to explain that.
well, i didn't mention "with permits"... but i did say that other supervisors and perhaps other city hall personnel... do carry firearms presently and have carried them in the past, yeah.
do you know if the other people who do carry weapons... also carry ten extra rounds in their pocket?
i think ex-police officers... and certainly police officers, on or off duty... carry extra ammunition, yes.
and that is also why you say he reloaded after shooting mayor moscone.
i firmly believe that there's... something for us good that will come out of this.
[narrator] white's lawyers introduced the testimony of five psychiatrists... to prove that he acted while in a state of severe depression... induced in part by consuming too much junk food.
you do expect surprises... and to be ready and open-minded for surprises - the shocking fact that he did this... and you might also have the shocking fact... that there was some extenuating circumstances... or some reason why he was innocent.
so you're ready for that kind of possibility, but i thought he might get the chair.
i remember rushing out of the courtroom... and the news was on line, waiting for the verdict.
i remember thinking to myself, "try to look like you're not so shocked."
yes, the jury has found dan white guilty of voluntary manslaughter... in the killings of both george moscone and harvey milk.
that's a verdict that carries two, three, or four years on each of those counts.
he also could receive two years each... for using a gun in the commission of the crime.
[man] and once again to repeat... that is the verdicts that white's attorney, doug schmidt, had asked the jury to return.
[man #2] dan white could now receive anywhere from four to 12 years in prison... with a possibility of parole after -
[man #1] we have received word that a demonstration has been called... for 8:00 this evening in front of city hall... to protest the dan white verdict.
[man] by about 11:20, things had gone from good to bad... to good and to very bad.
there's a narrow perimeter of shaky policemen... on my left over here in front of city hall.
behind them, and sometimes in the midst of them, are the demonstrators.
every once in a while, a demonstrator, a protestor, will come out of the crowd... throw a piece of burning material into a police car, and start it on fire.
i think it's gonna set, uh, back... the, uh, fight for human rights a great deal.
and i must tell you that if persons are arrested... for the crimes that have been committed tonight... my office is gonna prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
if you remember, the violence that started all this... was dan white's violence.
i feel that the jury was violent this afternoon... by treating dan white in a way that nobody's ever gonna believe... they would have treated a black person or a gay person... or someone who did not fit dan's type image.
i was right with 'em in saying i - you know...
"there is no justice here today... and anything that we do is absolutely fine."
"you know, it's not important to be civil in american society.
and it's not important to honor other people's right... as long as you are white... and you uphold certain white, middle-class values... because you're gonna get away with murder.
i think he would have been guilty of murder... and been in san quentin the rest of his life.
but sad to say, i think there's a lot of people in this world... that still think if you kill a gay... you're doin' a service to society.
[narrator] dan white was released from prison on january 7, 1984.
he served 5 1/2 years... and received no psychiatric treatment in prison.
[milk] somewheres in des moines or san antonio... there's a young gay person... who all of a sudden realizes that she or he is gay... knows that if their parents find out... they'll be tossed out of the house.
the classmates would taunt the child... and the anita bryants and john briggs are doing their bit on tv.
and you've got to elect gay people... so that that young child, and the thousands upon thousands... like that child... know that there's hope for a better world... there's hope for a better tomorrow.
without hope, not only gays, but those blacks... and the asians... and the disabled, the seniors - the "us's."
i fully realize that... a person who stands for what i stand for... an activist, gay activist... becomes the target or the potential target... for somebody who is insecure, terrified, afraid... or very disturbed themselves.
knowing that i could be assassinated at any moment or any time...
i met harvey like most people met harvey, i think... in his camera store.
um, i'd been living in the city about a year and a half, i guess, and... maybe not even that long...
[narrator] at first, harvey bernard milk... showed few signs he would make history.
born may 22, 1930... the second son of middle-class jewish parents... he grew up in woodmere, long island.
harvey milk had marched in antiwar demonstrations... burned his bankamericard in protest... and emigrated to san francisco.
he and lover scott smith settled down... and opened a camera store on castro street... in a quiet old neighborhood soon to become known as "the castro."
in 1973 he tried to make it official... by running for the board of supervisors, san francisco's city council.
to many, harvey milk seemed more like a joke than a candidate.
well, first time i heard of harvey... was uh... one of these, uh...
conventions at the labor council... and, uh, we're voting on who we're going to support.
in 1975, neighborhood activists like harvey milk... found a strong supporter in their new mayor, george moscone.
moscone had campaigned on the conviction... that a city is enriched by more than downtown development.
my late father was a guard at san quentin... and who i was visiting one day and who showed to me... and then explained the function of the, the death chamber.
and it just seemed inconceivable to me, though i was pretty young at the time... that in this society that i had been trained to believe... was the most effective and efficient of all societies... that the only way we could deal with violent crime... would be to do the ultimate ourselves... and that's to governmentally sanction the taking of another person's life.
[narrator] moscone and his allies, including harvey milk... set about designing a plan... for neighborhood people to run the city they lived in.
the plan, called "district elections"... would allow candidates for supervisor, such as harvey milk... to run from districts rather than the city at large.
they had this crazy idea that they're gonna change the form of government... the way we elect our, uh, officials in this town.
there was one meeting, it was supposed to be... behind this guy harvey milk's camera store.
and so i went to the meeting, and i kinda thought...
"what the hell am i doin' here with all these fruits and kooks?"
each summer, harvey milk helped organize the castro street fair... where the neighborhood celebrated its very existence.
[man singing] when we're out there dancing on the floor, darlin'
there's just too many candidates, the vote is split all over the place... and there's too many things happening nobody knows about.
[woman] there are at least seven candidates with a shot at capturing... the heart of the city, district no. 5.
the liberal vote is split between three main candidates and many lesser ones.
one main is terence hallinan... an attorney with endorsements from democrats and labor.
i think when it comes to a matter of who came first, that's fairly easily provable.
i don't think anyone ever heard of harvey milk until he ran for office in 1973.
he did have temper fits... where he would just be like a little kid sometimes... for no good reason except that he was probably exhausted.
getting involved in that campaign was so special... especially after the number of campaigns that i had been through... with the democratic party... and the normal type of politicians and the normal kind of campaigns.
here he's trying to run, you know, in a very big district.
he'd run in our neighborhood, and anything goes in our neighborhood.
but when you get out, you know, you kind of have to kind of blend in.
and i looked at anne, and here she was, you know... like a big dyke, with the motorcycle clothes on.
and then there's john with his three-piece suit... and there's little mike...
michael wong... who harvey always called his lotus blossom... and a couple of old ladies that would be in there too, bless their hearts.
everything happened in this long, dingy camera store... everything from "save the whales" to "get elected."
[kronenberg] we had volunteers... in all different shapes and sizes... from medora payne-size... up to 70-year-old women who wanted to be doing something.
they all got off the bikes then... and harvey was just encircled with people.
i mean, the feeling there was just one of such total joy.
and it was more than just, you know, a candidate winning.
it was the fact that all of these lesbians and gay men throughout san francisco... who had felt like they'd had no voice before... now had someone who represented them.
we can't really see too much... but it looks and sounds to you and to me like new year's eve... on market street, a place called alfie's.
and the reason for all this merriment... and gaiety, if you'll pardon the pun... is the man standing to my right... the first gay supervisor elected in san francisco.
does that mean, as many straights are concerned... that maybe the gays are taking over san francisco?
are you going to be a supervisor for all the people?
he was much more impressive than just that kind of image.
this will be the first time in many years that we've seen... so many relatively new faces on the san francisco board of supervisors.
and this is probably because it's the first time in a long time... that supervisors have been elected by district instead of citywide.
harvey milk, a homosexual... the first avowed women's rights advocate, carol ruth silver... the first chinese-american, attorney gordon lau... the first black woman, ella hill hutch... and dan white, a city fireman who gave up his job to take his seat.
someone suggested the board vote again to make it unanimous for feinstein... but newcomers milk and silver refused.
they stuck to their votes for lau, to cheers from their supporters.
and just about everyone at city hall today was agreeing on one thing:
they may be a lot of things, but they probably won't be dull.
here was this gay supervisor... who really didn't have to do it... and maybe even might be committing political suicide... and yet he was standing up for what he believed... and making a very strong statement."
and it was clear what harvey milk represented on that board.
he was different from the conservative majority on the board of supervisors.
[narrator] lost in the hubbub... over the rise of california's first publicly gay official... was the election of dan white... another kind of neighborhood populist.
a lot of the ladies here are getting their hair done.
[man] clean-cut, respectful to his elders... and seemingly possessed of small-town values.
when was the last time you heard a san francisco politician... talk about setting up neighborhood athletic teams?
[white] and then, when we get the best team... we will challenge, say, harvey milk's district to a game of softball... where they have champs out there.
if you see someone in trouble, you go to help 'em out.
[man] dan white says nobody's gonna ignore his corner of the city anymore.
he wanted to meet carter, and he thought that was very important.
and i think he even brought a photographer along... even though carter didn't want to be photographed with a gay person.
and ruth carter stapleton was... you know, the evangel... evangelical sister... was carrying on a mission on gays.
she told harvey that she could convert him... and that, even though he was jewish, if he gave himself to jesus christ... that his homosexuality would disappear or something.
and he made a couple of very wry comments... and one of them was that...
i think they shook hands, and he said, "i'm surprised you shook my hand."
and possibly the rank-and-file union... not the union leaders, the rank-and-file... link together to form a very solid, strong coalition... so that we can influence the total direction of the city.
[narrator] as supervisor, harvey milk had the political skills... to advance the issues that neighborhood people cared about:
rent control, limiting high-rise development... public transportation, and the rights of senior citizens.
and the biggest crime in this city is the fact... that there's some government elected officials... who don't care about senior citizens.
you start listening to him and getting involved with him... 'cause, gee, this is the kind of guy that is gonna talk about you.
harvey said that if anyone solved... the dog shit problem in this city... that they could be elected mayor.
and so he started, in the first month of being in city hall... to come up with some kind of ordinance to take care of dog shit.
and he knew that the pooper-scooper ordinance... along with a few other things, would really give him good press.
he was a master at figuring out... what would get him covered in the newspaper.
and so the day of his press conference for the pooper-scooper ordinance... he went out early and planted some shit on the lawn... so that after his press conference he knew... just where he was gonna stand that he would step in it.
[man] supervisor milk took to the grassy lawn... at duboce park this afternoon to publicize the new law.
under the ordinance, dog lovers who don't clean up can be fined.
i think what needs to happen is what happened in new york:
that people use their own ingenuity, their own ideas, their own concepts.
some people are using their pie tins... some people are using the wall street journal... and other people are using doggie-doo's and shovels.
[man] milk put his foot down to emphasize that the city... intends to enforce, and you guessed it...
at that time, george moscone favored votomatic... and harvey really was quite vocal.
and he said the city should go with votomatic... because non-english-speaking citizens... particularly those who are elderly, who have experienced discrimination... can exercise their right to vote in the most accessible manner.
he locked heads with quentin kopp... and dianne feinstein over the issue.
and i was tremendously impressed... because harvey never once called us and said...
"gee, i want to remind you folks that i'm doing you this great favor... and i want you to be indebted to me."
[narrator] the issue closest to harvey milk's heart... was a gay rights bill for san francisco.
with the gay rights ordinance in san francisco, the main focus is... is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay... who, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes... prevents them from being fired.
for example, you will see in this gay day parade... a group of at least 30 gay doctors.
[man] supervisor white says people are getting angry... and he believes that anger could lead to a backlash... that will wipe out all of the gains the gays have made thus far.
you can have someone that's a transvestite... a man that for his sexual, um, kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it... loves to dress up as a woman.
i was afraid someone was going to take a shot at him.
and harvey said, "it could happen any day, at any place, at any time... and i'm just not going to worry about it."
the people from all over the state and all over the country... for them to see 100,000... to 400,000 gay people and friends... marching through the downtown area... this is our city too...
they will go back to des moines, iowa... to richmond, minnesota, to santa cruz.
we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco... and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
they want to bring their sin out of the closet... and parade it on the street... and be called respectable, decent, natural people.
briggs mounted a campaign... for proposition 6, a statewide measure... to deny homosexuals their jobs in public schools.
now, what proposition 6 is really all about... is the right of parents to determine... who will be teaching their children.
[narrator] proposition 6 brought the issue of homosexuality... into the homes of millions of californians... and it thrust harvey milk into a statewide spotlight.
there are already laws on the books to protect our children.
everybody from superintendent of schools wilson riles... to jerry brown to newspaper editors across the state agree... that indeed we have the laws to protect our children.
i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught... by heterosexual teachers... in a fiercely heterosexual society... with television ads and newspaper ads...
harvey knew that he had to have... or that the gay community had to have... some kind of a repository for money... so that groups that were fighting the briggs initiative would have the... you know, could get funds to do the things that they had to do.
and i ended being his cochair... of the united fund to fight the briggs initiative.
and that began our association, which over those months... when proposition 6 came into being, became a real close association.
and i got to know him on a level that i had never anticipated.
[woman] nobody took harvey milk very seriously... when he first ran for the san francisco board of supervisors in 1973... but last year milk won election to the board of supervisors... where he's the first openly gay city official in the united states.
and representing the bay area committee against the briggs initiative... is sally gearheart... a lesbian, a former high school teacher... and now a speech professor at san francisco state university.
the fbi, the national council on family relations... the santa clara county child sexual abuse treatment center, and on and on and on...
sometimes i think what we were faced with in proposition 6... was not so much a conflict of values... as two sets of fears.
the incredible fears that the gay community had, all of us... that here we were, being stomped on... by what was turning out to be the moral majority.
i mean, our very lives were being, you know, threatened... the ways that we live, what our lifestyle is... and our reaction was extreme, and it should have been extreme.
but then when you get into the other person's shoes... you figure that there was a lot of fear on the part of the fundamentalists as well.
i mean, when you've lived your entire life... believing in a certain social structure... believing in certain sex roles... believing in the ways that men and women should relate to each other... believing in the family... you know, believing in what god... what you believe god says should be the way... human beings should relate within the family structure... and all of a sudden, there are these "perverts" out here... saying there are ways to live that are different from that... and that furthermore it's great and beautiful and true and good... then you're threatened.
every time that gay rights had been up for a vote... we had lost, around the country, usually by huge margins.
almost everyone thought we were going to lose, and lose badly.
[woman] the bulk of briggs' support lies in southern california... so his appearance here was more symbolic than functional.
he called san francisco the "moral garbage dump of the nation."
and we're concerned that that would be a real attack... on human rights for everybody.
how do you feel about the initiative, on what you do know?
- give some thought to it... because a lot of people will really be affected very badly by it.
[woman] it's also something where once you set up one kind of thing... to discriminate against one group of people... lots of times it makes it easier to discriminate... against other groups of people next time around.
if, by their silence and their doing nothing, briggs should win...
i think a lot of people are gonna realize they have to make an ultimate decision.
the decision is to go back in their closet real good... slam the door tight...
which some will do... or burst down those closet doors once and for all... and stand up and start to fight.
one month before the election, the polls predicted a close vote.
many people had come to believe... the briggs initiative would violate constitutional rights.
a surprising array of political figures... including former governor ronald reagan... and supervisor dan white... went on record against the proposition.
[woman] president carter spent less than an hour... at this downtown sacramento rally.
ford and reagan have already come out against it, so i think it's perfectly safe.
also, i want to ask everybody to vote against proposition 6.
we owe them to continue the education campaign that took place.
we must destroy the myths, once and for all shatter them.
unlike his flourishing counterpart, harvey milk... he was often frustrated by the job.
white had never learned to operate in city hall's atmosphere... of back scratching and compromise.
he didn't tell any of his fellow supervisors... nor did he tell any of his political supporters.
obviously, you know, if the time i spent to become elected... the time i spent down at the board, the hours, the many hours i've spent...
but since that time, people unknown to me... plus my family and friends, uh... have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office... that they supported me to stay in office.
[narrator] mayor moscone learned from the city attorney... that dan white could not take back his resignation.
and certainly harvey was courageous in that stance... because no one else was doin' it.
and there were other supervisors on the board who felt just as strongly... but they weren't going to get involved in that.
[man] moscone started to get word from his coalition... of neighborhood groups and ethnic voters.
most of the problems of the people here tonight... were that they were not consulted...
i think a 10-month supervisor can be excused for political naïveté.
i'm simply saying it may not have been the best way to go.
[man] white was at city hall with his group of backers:
some citizens, firemen... and a delegation representing large real estate firms.
i'm overwhelmed at your support, that you would take time out... to come down here on a friday at this time... to show not only me but the people of my district... and the people of san francisco... that you approve of the way i'm conducting myself.
[narrator] but then dan white and the shambles of his political career... were upstaged by chaos of an entirely different order.
to outsiders and even to some san franciscans... it must appear the city has gone a little insane.
just as everyone is beginning to come to grips... with the mindless murder-suicide of over 900 members... of the san francisco-based people's temple... word screams out over the radio, the television, the newspapers... that another tragedy is upon us.
as president of the board of supervisors... it's my duty to make this announcement.
both mayor moscone and supervisor harvey milk... have been shot and killed.
i was flying up to seattle to visit my folks... and it's really...
i think it was the first time i had seen them since our talk about coming out.
and so i screamed, and i came back up van ness avenue... and i remember thinking, "people are going about their business in an ordinary way.
how dare they go about their business in an ordinary way!
and i knew it was milk because i knew how tall he was.
and they hadn't covered part of his feet or something, and i...
so he said, "well, by now it's probably reached city hall."
so we drove directly from the airport to city hall... and there were maybe 75 people there.
so we then walked over to market street... which is two or three blocks away, and looked down it.
market street runs in a straight line out to the castro area.
and as we turned the corner... there were people... as wide as this wide street, as far as you could see.
[kronenberg] thousands and thousands of people... and that feeling of such loss.
[elliott] the combination of harvey being killed... and going down with all those people...
i don't know if you call it "expressing your grief" or what it was... but being with all those people, and... it's nighttime in san francisco, and a bunch of strangers around you... and you feel as safe as you do in your own home.
i don't know if it was numbed or we were anesthetized.
certainly i was angry... but it seemed appropriate to do this... peaceful, kind of internalized thing... out of some kind of respect for the enormity of what happened.
it was one of the most eloquent expressions... of a community's response to violence that i've ever seen.
i think we as lesbians and gay men... and all of the straight people who were marching with us that night... and there were thousands...
not violence... but a certain respect for harvey... and a deep... a deep regret and feeling of tragedy about it... because moscone had been our friend as well.
[hartmann] and then going down to city hall... that tremendous expanse of people.
and i turned to john and i said, "harvey would have loved this!"
when we kind of tried to get close to the stage... and i saw friends up there and i thought...
they really felt so moved that they came out to people... and said, "did you know that i'm gay?"
and, um, i was so touched by it... because that's what harvey had stood for... and it took his death for them to realize that...
and i don't want to knock the jury system... because i do believe in the jury system... but once you knock all these people out... what does that leave you with?
we had turned this over to be taken care of... to a system that was actually in many ways responsible for these assassinations.
white's own lawyers had already admitted this in their opening statement.
to prove its case... the prosecution played a tape of dan white's confession... but the tactic backfired.
and he was all smiles and stuff when i went in.
he knew i wasn't going to be reappointed and, uh... he just kind of smirked at me... as if to say, "too bad."
and then i just got all flushed and hot... and i shot him.
now, if dan white wants to save himself from the death penalty... he's going to have to prove that he didn't plan to kill anyone that day.
prosecutors say he did premeditate the murders... because on that day he put his gun on... and he put a bunch of extra bullets into his pocket.
then he got into city hall here by climbing in this window... knowing he couldn't get his gun past the metal detector in the main entrance.
prosecutors say this shows he was planning to do something suspicious.
white's lawyer claims it's common for people... to try to get into city hall this way... that dan white was only carrying a gun to protect himself... and that other supervisors, including feinstein... have carried guns for protection.
but if he was only trying to protect himself that day... why did he put all those extra bullets into his pocket?
it will be interesting to see how the defense tries to explain that.
well, i didn't mention "with permits"... but i did say that other supervisors and perhaps other city hall personnel... do carry firearms presently and have carried them in the past, yeah.
do you know if the other people who do carry weapons... also carry ten extra rounds in their pocket?
i think ex-police officers... and certainly police officers, on or off duty... carry extra ammunition, yes.
and that is also why you say he reloaded after shooting mayor moscone.
i firmly believe that there's... something for us good that will come out of this.
[narrator] white's lawyers introduced the testimony of five psychiatrists... to prove that he acted while in a state of severe depression... induced in part by consuming too much junk food.
you do expect surprises... and to be ready and open-minded for surprises... the shocking fact that he did this... and you might also have the shocking fact... that there was some extenuating circumstances... or some reason why he was innocent.
so you're ready for that kind of possibility, but i thought he might get the chair.
i remember rushing out of the courtroom... and the news was on line, waiting for the verdict.
i remember thinking to myself, "try to look like you're not so shocked."
yes, the jury has found dan white guilty of voluntary manslaughter... in the killings of both george moscone and harvey milk.
that's a verdict that carries two, three, or four years on each of those counts.
he also could receive two years each... for using a gun in the commission of the crime.
[man] and once again to repeat... that is the verdicts that white's attorney, doug schmidt, had asked the jury to return.
[man #2] dan white could now receive anywhere from four to 12 years in prison... with a possibility of parole after...
[man #1] we have received word that a demonstration has been called... for 8:00 this evening in front of city hall... to protest the dan white verdict.
[man] by about 11:20, things had gone from good to bad... to good and to very bad.
there's a narrow perimeter of shaky policemen... on my left over here in front of city hall.
behind them, and sometimes in the midst of them, are the demonstrators.
every once in a while, a demonstrator, a protestor, will come out of the crowd... throw a piece of burning material into a police car, and start it on fire.
i think it's gonna set, uh, back... the, uh, fight for human rights a great deal.
and i must tell you that if persons are arrested... for the crimes that have been committed tonight... my office is gonna prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
if you remember, the violence that started all this... was dan white's violence.
i feel that the jury was violent this afternoon... by treating dan white in a way that nobody's ever gonna believe... they would have treated a black person or a gay person... or someone who did not fit dan's type image.
"you know, it's not important to be civil in american society.
and it's not important to honor other people's right... as long as you are white... and you uphold certain white, middle-class values... because you're gonna get away with murder.
i think he would have been guilty of murder... and been in san quentin the rest of his life.
but sad to say, i think there's a lot of people in this world... that still think if you kill a gay... you're doin' a service to society.
[narrator] dan white was released from prison on january 7, 1984.
he served 5 1/2 years... and received no psychiatric treatment in prison.
[milk] somewheres in des moines or san antonio... there's a young gay person... who all of a sudden realizes that she or he is gay... knows that if their parents find out... they'll be tossed out of the house.
the classmates would taunt the child... and the anita bryants and john briggs are doing their bit on tv.
and you've got to elect gay people... so that that young child, and the thousands upon thousands... like that child... know that there's hope for a better world... there's hope for a better tomorrow.
without hope, not only gays, but those blacks... and the asians... and the disabled, the seniors...
i know that you cannot live on hope alone... but without it life is not worth living.
and you, and you, and you... have gotta give 'em hope.
i fully realize that... a person who stands for what i stand for... an activist, gay activist... becomes the target or the potential target... for somebody who is insecure, terrified, afraid... or very disturbed themselves.
knowing that i could be assassinated at any moment or any time...
i met harvey like most people met harvey, i think... in his camera store.
um, i'd been living in the city about a year and a half, i guess, and... maybe not even that long...
at first, harvey bernard milk... showed few signs he would make history.
born may 22, 1930... the second son of middle-class jewish parents... he grew up in woodmere, long island.
harvey milk had marched in antiwar demonstrations... burned his bankamericard in protest... and emigrated to san francisco.
he and lover scott smith settled down... and opened a camera store on castro street... in a quiet old neighborhood soon to become known as "the castro."
in 1973 he tried to make it official... by running for the board of supervisors, san francisco's city council.
to many, harvey milk seemed more like a joke than a candidate.
well, first time i heard of harvey... was uh... one of these, uh...
conventions at the labor council... and, uh, we're voting on who we're going to support.
in 1975, neighborhood activists like harvey milk... found a strong supporter in their new mayor, george moscone.
moscone had campaigned on the conviction... that a city is enriched by more than downtown development.
my late father was a guard at san quentin... and who i was visiting one day and who showed to me... and then explained the function of the, the death chamber.
and it just seemed inconceivable to me, though i was pretty young at the time... that in this society that i had been trained to believe... was the most effective and efficient of all societies... that the only way we could deal with violent crime... would be to do the ultimate ourselves... and that's to governmentally sanction the taking of another person's life.
moscone and his allies, including harvey milk... set about designing a plan... for neighborhood people to run the city they lived in.
the plan, called "district elections"... would allow candidates for supervisor, such as harvey milk... to run from districts rather than the city at large.
they had this crazy idea that they're gonna change the form of government... the way we elect our, uh, officials in this town.
there was one meeting, it was supposed to be... behind this guy harvey milk's camera store.
and so i went to the meeting, and i kinda thought...
"what the hell am i doin' here with all these fruits and kooks?"
in the castro, a new kind of politics was taking shape.
more and more men and women were arriving in san francisco every day... to take up the gay life.
harvey milk realized that the castro... was ready to elect its own representative to city hall.
in 1977, milk launched his fourth political campaign... this time for the board of supervisors... from the newly created district 5.
there are at least seven candidates with a shot at capturing... the heart of the city, district no. 5.
the liberal vote is split between three main candidates and many lesser ones.
i don't think anyone ever heard of harvey milk until he ran for office in 1973.
any single neighborhood issue or city issue for the last five years... you found harvey milk taking a stand...
when he decided to run for supervisor, he did call me... and i went in to meet with him... and we just hit it off instantly.
that very first day, he asked me if i would run his campaign.
one day i was in there in the campaign headquarters... and i'm looking around at this motley group of people.
it was a lot of fun, but give me a break!
he'd run in our neighborhood, and anything goes in our neighborhood.
but when you get out, you know, you kind of have to kind of blend in.
and i looked at anne, and here she was, you know... like a big dyke, with the motorcycle clothes on.
and then there's john with his three-piece suit... and there's little mike...
michael wong... who harvey always called his lotus blossom... and a couple of old ladies that would be in there too, bless their hearts.
and then people silk-screening on the side... and you could smell the ink and, you know, all this hubbub.
we had volunteers... in all different shapes and sizes... from medora payne-size... up to 70-year-old women who wanted to be doing something.
maybe they couldn't be walking precincts, but they wanted to do something for harvey.
i mean, the feeling there was just one of such total joy.
and it was more than just, you know, a candidate winning.
it was the fact that all of these lesbians and gay men throughout san francisco... who had felt like they'd had no voice before... now had someone who represented them.
you just feel so good for milk... but feeling good for milk, you were feeling good for yourself.
what does this mean, your election, your activity now... on the board of supervisors in san francisco?
does that mean, as many straights are concerned... that maybe the gays are taking over san francisco?
and i was impressed on the spot, and it made a good story.
it's as if he knew. "you came here with an attitude that i was just... a homosexual with a camera store, and i'll show you!"
this will be the first time in many years that we've seen... so many relatively new faces on the san francisco board of supervisors.
and this is probably because it's the first time in a long time... that supervisors have been elected by district instead of citywide.
but then we got the first taste of the new politics.
someone suggested the board vote again to make it unanimous for feinstein... but newcomers milk and silver refused.
they stuck to their votes for lau, to cheers from their supporters.
and just about everyone at city hall today was agreeing on one thing:
they may be a lot of things, but they probably won't be dull.
it was interesting to see that harvey... did not vote for dianne feinstein to be president... and it really shocked many of us in the audience, because...
lost in the hubbub... over the rise of california's first publicly gay official... was the election of dan white... another kind of neighborhood populist.
dan white has worked and lived virtually all his 31 years... in this southeastern section of san francisco.
a lot of the ladies here are getting their hair done.
clean-cut, respectful to his elders... and seemingly possessed of small-town values.
when was the last time you heard a san francisco politician... talk about setting up neighborhood athletic teams?
and then, when we get the best team... we will challenge, say, harvey milk's district to a game of softball... where they have champs out there.
if you see someone in trouble, you go to help 'em out.
dan white says nobody's gonna ignore his corner of the city anymore.
he wanted to meet carter, and he thought that was very important.
and i think he even brought a photographer along... even though carter didn't want to be photographed with a gay person.
and ruth carter stapleton was... you know, the evangel... evangelical sister... was carrying on a mission on gays.
she told harvey that she could convert him... and that, even though he was jewish, if he gave himself to jesus christ... that his homosexuality would disappear or something.
and he made a couple of very wry comments... and one of them was that...
i think they shook hands, and he said, "i'm surprised you shook my hand."
and possibly the rank-and-file union... not the union leaders, the rank-and-file... link together to form a very solid, strong coalition... so that we can influence the total direction of the city.
as supervisor, harvey milk had the political skills... to advance the issues that neighborhood people cared about:
rent control, limiting high-rise development... public transportation, and the rights of senior citizens.
and the biggest crime in this city is the fact... that there's some government elected officials... who don't care about senior citizens.
you start listening to him and getting involved with him... 'cause, gee, this is the kind of guy that is gonna talk about you.
harvey said that if anyone solved... the dog shit problem in this city... that they could be elected mayor.
and so he started, in the first month of being in city hall... to come up with some kind of ordinance to take care of dog shit.
and he knew that the pooper-scooper ordinance... along with a few other things, would really give him good press.
he was a master at figuring out... what would get him covered in the newspaper.
and so the day of his press conference for the pooper-scooper ordinance... he went out early and planted some shit on the lawn... so that after his press conference he knew... just where he was gonna stand that he would step in it.
supervisor milk took to the grassy lawn... at duboce park this afternoon to publicize the new law.
under the ordinance, dog lovers who don't clean up can be fined.
i think what needs to happen is what happened in new york:
that people use their own ingenuity, their own ideas, their own concepts.
some people are using their pie tins... some people are using the wall street journal... and other people are using doggie-doo's and shovels.
milk put his foot down to emphasize that the city... intends to enforce, and you guessed it...
at that time, george moscone favored votomatic... and harvey really was quite vocal.
and he said the city should go with votomatic... because non-english-speaking citizens... particularly those who are elderly, who have experienced discrimination... can exercise their right to vote in the most accessible manner.
he locked heads with quentin kopp... and dianne feinstein over the issue.
and i was tremendously impressed... because harvey never once called us and said...
"gee, i want to remind you folks that i'm doing you this great favor... and i want you to be indebted to me."
the issue closest to harvey milk's heart... was a gay rights bill for san francisco.
with the gay rights ordinance in san francisco, the main focus is... is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay... who, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes... prevents them from being fired.
for example, you will see in this gay day parade... a group of at least 30 gay doctors.
supervisor white says people are getting angry... and he believes that anger could lead to a backlash... that will wipe out all of the gains the gays have made thus far.
you can have someone that's a transvestite... a man that for his sexual, um, kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it... loves to dress up as a woman.
i was afraid someone was going to take a shot at him.
and harvey said, "it could happen any day, at any place, at any time... and i'm just not going to worry about it."
they will go back to des moines, iowa... to richmond, minnesota, to santa cruz.
they will go back and say, "my god... 300,000 gay people and their friends marching!
well, i see naked men walking around, naked women walking around... which, uh, doesn't bother me... as far as my personal standards of nudity or what... but it's not proper.
many people do not approve of outward displays of sexuality... be it heterosexuality or homosexuality.
now, what proposition 6 is really all about... is the right of parents to determine... who will be teaching their children.
we don't allow people who believe in practicing bestiality... to teach our children.
there are already laws on the books to protect our children.
everybody from superintendent of schools wilson riles... to jerry brown to newspaper editors across the state agree... that indeed we have the laws to protect our children.
harvey knew that he had to have... or that the gay community had to have... some kind of a repository for money... so that groups that were fighting the briggs initiative would have the... you know, could get funds to do the things that they had to do.
and i ended being his cochair... of the united fund to fight the briggs initiative.
and that began our association, which over those months... when proposition 6 came into being, became a real close association.
and i got to know him on a level that i had never anticipated.
nobody took harvey milk very seriously... when he first ran for the san francisco board of supervisors in 1973... but last year milk won election to the board of supervisors... where he's the first openly gay city official in the united states.
and representing the bay area committee against the briggs initiative... is sally gearheart... a lesbian, a former high school teacher... and now a speech professor at san francisco state university.
the fbi, the national council on family relations... the santa clara county child sexual abuse treatment center, and on and on and on...
sometimes i think what we were faced with in proposition 6... was not so much a conflict of values... as two sets of fears.
the incredible fears that the gay community had, all of us... that here we were, being stomped on... by what was turning out to be the moral majority.
i mean, our very lives were being, you know, threatened... the ways that we live, what our lifestyle is... and our reaction was extreme, and it should have been extreme.
but then when you get into the other person's shoes... you figure that there was a lot of fear on the part of the fundamentalists as well.
i mean, when you've lived your entire life... believing in a certain social structure... believing in certain sex roles... believing in the ways that men and women should relate to each other... believing in the family... you know, believing in what god... what you believe god says should be the way... human beings should relate within the family structure... and all of a sudden, there are these "perverts" out here... saying there are ways to live that are different from that... and that furthermore it's great and beautiful and true and good... then you're threatened.
every time that gay rights had been up for a vote... we had lost, around the country, usually by huge margins.
almost everyone thought we were going to lose, and lose badly.
the bulk of briggs' support lies in southern california... so his appearance here was more symbolic than functional.
he called san francisco the "moral garbage dump of the nation."
and we're concerned that that would be a real attack... on human rights for everybody.
how do you feel about the initiative, on what you do know?
- give some thought to it... because a lot of people will really be affected very badly by it.
it's also something where once you set up one kind of thing... to discriminate against one group of people... lots of times it makes it easier to discriminate... against other groups of people next time around.
if, by their silence and their doing nothing, briggs should win...
i think a lot of people are gonna realize they have to make an ultimate decision.
the decision is to go back in their closet real good... slam the door tight...
which some will do... or burst down those closet doors once and for all... and stand up and start to fight.
many people had come to believe... the briggs initiative would violate constitutional rights.
a surprising array of political figures... including former governor ronald reagan... and supervisor dan white... went on record against the proposition.
jerry brown whispered to him briefly... and he came back for one more word of advice for voters.
ford and reagan have already come out against it, so i think it's perfectly safe.
it must have been... for most lesbians and gay men, at least in the state of california.
because it wasn't plain... even up until the evening of the vote... that we were gonna win...
and who had been the man who had carried the banner for gay people, you know?
who had been the man who had fought all along... in his politics on the board of supervisors... but particularly during the 6 campaign?
we owe them to continue the education campaign that took place.
we must destroy the myths, once and for all shatter them.
we must continue to speak out... and most importantly... most importantly, every gay person... must come out.
as difficult as it is... you must tell your immediate family.
and once they realize that we are indeed their children... and we are indeed everywhere... every myth, every lie, every innuendo... will be destroyed once and for all.
and once... once you do... you will feel so much better.
my wife and my supporters worked awfully hard... so that i would be elected.
and it was a major decision, as you can all understand, on friday... that i had to come...
mayor moscone learned from the city attorney... that dan white could not take back his resignation.
it was up to the mayor to decide... who would get the district 8 seat.
most of the problems of the people here tonight... were that they were not consulted...
they might have helped... and the fact that they weren't even given the dignity... of his concern bothered them.
some citizens, firemen... and a delegation representing large real estate firms.
i'm overwhelmed at your support, that you would take time out... to come down here on a friday at this time... to show not only me but the people of my district... and the people of san francisco... that you approve of the way i'm conducting myself.
but then dan white and the shambles of his political career... were upstaged by chaos of an entirely different order.
the city learned of the murder-suicide... of some 900 people... most of them san franciscans.
i think it was the first time i had seen them since our talk about coming out.
i, um... got on the plane at 11:15 in san francisco.
i had the radio on... and the guy came on, and he said it with such a certitude.
sometimes you hear things on the news, and they're not gonna be true.
"i've always kind of thought this might happen"... and never dwelled on it, and here it was happening.
he was saying, "harvey milk and george moscone... were shot and killed by dan white."
i mean, you can think somebody's dead, but i mean, there...
and i knew it was milk because i knew how tall he was.
and they hadn't covered part of his feet or something, and i...
you know, you trip out on different things, and you think...
so we drove directly from the airport to city hall... and there were maybe 75 people there.
and i remember thinking, "my god, is this all that anybody cared?" you know.
market street runs in a straight line out to the castro area.
and as we turned the corner... there were people... as wide as this wide street, as far as you could see.
i don't know if you call it "expressing your grief" or what it was... but being with all those people, and... it's nighttime in san francisco, and a bunch of strangers around you... and you feel as safe as you do in your own home.
and there was this black man on the corner of... whatever...
i think that all of us at that time... were in such a, a, a state of shock, you know, that...
i don't know if it was numbed or we were anesthetized.
certainly i was angry... but it seemed appropriate to do this... peaceful, kind of internalized thing... out of some kind of respect for the enormity of what happened.
it was one of the most eloquent expressions... of a community's response to violence that i've ever seen.
i think we sent a message to the nation that night... about what our immediate response was.
not violence... but a certain respect for harvey... and a deep... a deep regret and feeling of tragedy about it... because moscone had been our friend as well.
and then going down to city hall... that tremendous expanse of people.
and i turned to john and i said, "harvey would have loved this!"
harvey milk's ashes were scattered into the pacific by his friends.
today we went looking for clues to why white would kill the mayor... who refused to reappoint him to his post... and a supervisor who opposed him politically.
i sort of developed this sense of doom... that justice was not going to prevail... because the jury selection process... excluded gay people... minority residents, and anyone who may have had... a political point of view that would be different from dan white.
and i don't want to knock the jury system... because i do believe in the jury system... but once you knock all these people out... what does that leave you with?
we had turned this over to be taken care of... to a system that was actually in many ways responsible for these assassinations.
so there's this little feeling in your stomach when you get afraid and you think...
detailing the facts of the crime... the state spent three days proving that dan white committed the murders.
white's own lawyers had already admitted this in their opening statement.
and he was all smiles and stuff when i went in.
he knew i wasn't going to be reappointed and, uh... he just kind of smirked at me... as if to say, "too bad."
now, if dan white wants to save himself from the death penalty... he's going to have to prove that he didn't plan to kill anyone that day.
prosecutors say he did premeditate the murders... because on that day he put his gun on... and he put a bunch of extra bullets into his pocket.
then he got into city hall here by climbing in this window... knowing he couldn't get his gun past the metal detector in the main entrance.
prosecutors say this shows he was planning to do something suspicious.
white's lawyer claims it's common for people... to try to get into city hall this way... that dan white was only carrying a gun to protect himself... and that other supervisors, including feinstein... have carried guns for protection.
but if he was only trying to protect himself that day... why did he put all those extra bullets into his pocket?
it will be interesting to see how the defense tries to explain that.
you told the jury that... although he had the gun with him, the .38... he had no intention of shooting anyone at city hall, correct?
do you know if the other people who do carry weapons... also carry ten extra rounds in their pocket?
i think ex-police officers... and certainly police officers, on or off duty... carry extra ammunition, yes.
i firmly believe that there's... something for us good that will come out of this.
white's lawyers introduced the testimony of five psychiatrists... to prove that he acted while in a state of severe depression... induced in part by consuming too much junk food.
you do expect surprises... and to be ready and open-minded for surprises... the shocking fact that he did this... and you might also have the shocking fact... that there was some extenuating circumstances... or some reason why he was innocent.
so you're ready for that kind of possibility, but i thought he might get the chair.
i remember rushing out of the courtroom... and the news was on line, waiting for the verdict.
i remember thinking to myself, "try to look like you're not so shocked."
yes, the jury has found dan white guilty of voluntary manslaughter... in the killings of both george moscone and harvey milk.
that's a verdict that carries two, three, or four years on each of those counts.
he also could receive two years each... for using a gun in the commission of the crime.
and once again to repeat... that is the verdicts that white's attorney, doug schmidt, had asked the jury to return.
dan white could now receive anywhere from four to 12 years in prison... with a possibility of parole after...
we have received word that a demonstration has been called... for 8:00 this evening in front of city hall... to protest the dan white verdict.
there's a narrow perimeter of shaky policemen... on my left over here in front of city hall.
behind them, and sometimes in the midst of them, are the demonstrators.
what we have tonight is a... a mob out of control, and i think it's a tragedy.
i think it's gonna set, uh, back... the, uh, fight for human rights a great deal.
and i must tell you that if persons are arrested... for the crimes that have been committed tonight... my office is gonna prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
if you remember, the violence that started all this... was dan white's violence.
i feel that the jury was violent this afternoon... by treating dan white in a way that nobody's ever gonna believe... they would have treated a black person or a gay person... or someone who did not fit dan's type image.
they were saying that the spirit of dan white... with all of its pettiness, all of its meanness... and all of its violence right below the surface is okay... and in so doing were very violently attacking... the memory of george moscone and harvey milk.
"you know, it's not important to be civil in american society.
and it's not important to honor other people's right... as long as you are white... and you uphold certain white, middle-class values... because you're gonna get away with murder.
i think he would have been guilty of murder... and been in san quentin the rest of his life.
but sad to say, i think there's a lot of people in this world... that still think if you kill a gay... you're doin' a service to society.
somewheres in des moines or san antonio... there's a young gay person... who all of a sudden realizes that she or he is gay... knows that if their parents find out... they'll be tossed out of the house.
the classmates would taunt the child... and the anita bryants and john briggs are doing their bit on tv.
"homosexual elected in san francisco"... and there are two new options.
one option is to go to california or stay in san antonio and fight.
san francisco's mayor george moscone... and supervisor harvey milk... were assassinated in city hall.
harvey milk had served only 11 months on san francisco's board of supervisors... but he had already come to represent something far greater than his office.
[man on tape] this is to be played only in the event... of my death by assassination.
i fully realize that... a person who stands for what i stand for - an activist, gay activist - becomes the target or the potential target... for somebody who is insecure, terrified, afraid... or very disturbed themselves.
almost everything was done in the eyes of the gay movement.
i met harvey like most people met harvey, i think - in his camera store.
um, i'd been living in the city about a year and a half, i guess, and - maybe not even that long - and went into the camera store - someone recommended it - to have my film developed... and was greeted by this raving maniac.
he was screaming and - i don't even know what the issue was... but he was screaming and shouting at someone in the camera store... and i
'75 or '76 i had a miscarriage, and i was astounded.
i mean, it's a - it's a devastating physical experience... as well as a mental experience.
one level was his sense of humor, which i liked, you know.
and you know, making fun of things that sometimes were very heavy... which was how i was brought up.
born may 22, 1930... the second son of middle-class jewish parents... he grew up in woodmere, long island.
the little kid with the big ears became, in high school... an ordinary student, a practical joker, and a regular guy.
then he began a career as a stock analyst on wall street.
what was not on the resume... was his homosexuality... which harvey milk had known about since he was 14.
when he dubbed himself "the mayor of castro street," the idea stuck.
in 1973 he tried to make it official... by running for the board of supervisors, san francisco's city council.
to many, harvey milk seemed more like a joke than a candidate.
well, first time i heard of harvey... was uh... one of these, uh...
and then we found out that, uh... he got coors beer out of all of the gay bars in san francisco.
and this coors beer boycott... which labor's been trying to do throughout the united states... especially in san francisco, a labor town... uh, really hadn't been too successful.
but in each race he garnered more and more votes... enough to establish himself as a broker for his neighborhood... and the growing gay community.
in 1975, neighborhood activists like harvey milk... found a strong supporter in their new mayor, george moscone.
as the new mayor, moscone showed respect... for his city's many neighborhoods, cultures, and peoples.
my late father was a guard at san quentin... and who i was visiting one day and who showed to me... and then explained the function of the, the death chamber.
and it just seemed inconceivable to me, though i was pretty young at the time... that in this society that i had been trained to believe... was the most effective and efficient of all societies... that the only way we could deal with violent crime... would be to do the ultimate ourselves... and that's to governmentally sanction the taking of another person's life.
[narrator] moscone and his allies, including harvey milk... set about designing a plan... for neighborhood people to run the city they lived in.
the plan, called "district elections"... would allow candidates for supervisor, such as harvey milk... to run from districts rather than the city at large.
they had this crazy idea that they're gonna change the form of government... the way we elect our, uh, officials in this town.
there was one meeting, it was supposed to be... behind this guy harvey milk's camera store.
and so i went to the meeting, and i kinda thought...
each summer, harvey milk helped organize the castro street fair... where the neighborhood celebrated its very existence.
[man singing] when we're out there dancing on the floor, darlin'
there's just too many candidates, the vote is split all over the place... and there's too many things happening nobody knows about.
[woman] there are at least seven candidates with a shot at capturing... the heart of the city, district no. 5.
the liberal vote is split between three main candidates and many lesser ones.
one main is terence hallinan... an attorney with endorsements from democrats and labor.
i think when it comes to a matter of who came first, that's fairly easily provable.
i don't think anyone ever heard of harvey milk until he ran for office in 1973.
any single neighborhood issue or city issue for the last five years... you found harvey milk taking a stand - one way or the other, but taking a stand.
[woman] every candidate claims to know of polls... showing him the winner or running strong... but the one candidate who seems to run best of all has very low visibility.
when he decided to run for supervisor, he did call me... and i went in to meet with him... and we just hit it off instantly.
that very first day, he asked me if i would run his campaign.
one day i was in there in the campaign headquarters... and i'm looking around at this motley group of people.
it was a lot of fun, but give me a break!
he'd run in our neighborhood, and anything goes in our neighborhood.
but when you get out, you know, you kind of have to kind of blend in.
and i looked at anne, and here she was, you know... like a big dyke, with the motorcycle clothes on.
and then there's john with his three-piece suit... and there's little mike - michael wong... who harvey always called his lotus blossom... and a couple of old ladies that would be in there too, bless their hearts.
everything happened in this long, dingy camera store - everything from "save the whales" to "get elected."
[kronenberg] we had volunteers... in all different shapes and sizes... from medora payne-size... up to 70-year-old women who wanted to be doing something.
he rode up on his - not his motorcycle, my motorcycle.
they all got off the bikes then... and harvey was just encircled with people.
i mean, the feeling there was just one of such total joy.
and it was more than just, you know, a candidate winning.
it was the fact that all of these lesbians and gay men throughout san francisco... who had felt like they'd had no voice before... now had someone who represented them.
[ammiano] you just feel so good for milk... but feeling good for milk, you were feeling good for yourself.
what does this mean, your election, your activity now... on the board of supervisors in san francisco?
does that mean, as many straights are concerned... that maybe the gays are taking over san francisco?
and i was impressed on the spot, and it made a good story.
it's as if he knew. "you came here with an attitude that i was just... a homosexual with a camera store, and i'll show you!"
this will be the first time in many years that we've seen... so many relatively new faces on the san francisco board of supervisors.
and this is probably because it's the first time in a long time... that supervisors have been elected by district instead of citywide.
but then we got the first taste of the new politics.
someone suggested the board vote again to make it unanimous for feinstein... but newcomers milk and silver refused.
they stuck to their votes for lau, to cheers from their supporters.
and just about everyone at city hall today was agreeing on one thing:
they may be a lot of things, but they probably won't be dull.
[der] it was interesting to see that harvey... did not vote for dianne feinstein to be president... and it really shocked many of us in the audience, because -
[narrator] lost in the hubbub... over the rise of california's first publicly gay official... was the election of dan white... another kind of neighborhood populist.
[man] dan white has worked and lived virtually all his 31 years... in this southeastern section of san francisco.
[man] clean-cut, respectful to his elders... and seemingly possessed of small-town values.
when was the last time you heard a san francisco politician... talk about setting up neighborhood athletic teams?
[white] and then, when we get the best team... we will challenge, say, harvey milk's district to a game of softball... where they have champs out there.
in a sense you could say it's old-fashioned... but it's old-fashioned values that built this country.
[man] dan white says nobody's gonna ignore his corner of the city anymore.
[narrator] dan white and harvey milk... became symbols of the new district election system.
milk's victory sparked euphoria among his supporters... and a sense of something new arriving at city hall.
he wanted to meet carter, and he thought that was very important.
and i think he even brought a photographer along... even though carter didn't want to be photographed with a gay person.
and ruth carter stapleton was - you know, the evangel - evangelical sister - was carrying on a mission on gays.
she told harvey that she could convert him... and that, even though he was jewish, if he gave himself to jesus christ... that his homosexuality would disappear or something.
and he made a couple of very wry comments... and one of them was that -
on the citywide level, i think it's vital... that the minorities... the traditional, ethnic minorities... and the gays and the feminists link together.
and possibly the rank-and-file union - not the union leaders, the rank-and-file - link together to form a very solid, strong coalition... so that we can influence the total direction of the city.
[narrator] as supervisor, harvey milk had the political skills... to advance the issues that neighborhood people cared about:
rent control, limiting high-rise development... public transportation, and the rights of senior citizens.
anytime he'd make a speech about anything, i agreed with him.
so then i thought he was a great man... because i agreed with what he talked about.
harvey said that if anyone solved... the dog shit problem in this city... that they could be elected mayor.
and so he started, in the first month of being in city hall... to come up with some kind of ordinance to take care of dog shit.
and he knew that the pooper-scooper ordinance... along with a few other things, would really give him good press.
he was a master at figuring out... what would get him covered in the newspaper.
and so the day of his press conference for the pooper-scooper ordinance... he went out early and planted some shit on the lawn... so that after his press conference he knew... just where he was gonna stand that he would step in it.
[man] supervisor milk took to the grassy lawn... at duboce park this afternoon to publicize the new law.
under the ordinance, dog lovers who don't clean up can be fined.
i think what needs to happen is what happened in new york:
that people use their own ingenuity, their own ideas, their own concepts.
some people are using their pie tins... some people are using the wall street journal... and other people are using doggie-doo's and shovels.
harvey milk's stand on which voting machine... the city should purchase was a critical role.
at that time, george moscone favored votomatic... and harvey really was quite vocal.
and he said the city should go with votomatic... because non-english-speaking citizens... particularly those who are elderly, who have experienced discrimination... can exercise their right to vote in the most accessible manner.
he locked heads with quentin kopp... and dianne feinstein over the issue.
he knew that it was the right machine... and he didn't have to call any one of us and say...
"gee, i want to remind you folks that i'm doing you this great favor... and i want you to be indebted to me."
[narrator] the issue closest to harvey milk's heart... was a gay rights bill for san francisco.
with the gay rights ordinance in san francisco, the main focus is... is to prevent the people who are already employed who are gay... who, if they want to come out and break down the stereotypes... prevents them from being fired.
in the bay area, there are hundreds and hundreds of gay doctors... most of who are closeted because of fear of loss of jobs.
in san francisco, they can "come out"... and not have to worry about their jobs.
you can have someone that's a transvestite - a man that for his sexual, um, kicks or orientation, whatever you want to call it... loves to dress up as a woman.
if he is a qualified teacher, he can go into any school... or he can go into any business, and they can't refuse him.
we wouldn't allow it for any other parade in san francisco... and it should not be allowed for the gay parade.
they want to bring their sin out of the closet... and parade it on the street... and be called respectable, decent, natural people.
briggs mounted a campaign... for proposition 6, a statewide measure... to deny homosexuals their jobs in public schools.
now, what proposition 6 is really all about... is the right of parents to determine... who will be teaching their children.
[narrator] proposition 6 brought the issue of homosexuality... into the homes of millions of californians... and it thrust harvey milk into a statewide spotlight.
there are already laws on the books to protect our children.
everybody from superintendent of schools wilson riles... to jerry brown to newspaper editors across the state agree... that indeed we have the laws to protect our children.
i was born of heterosexual parents, i was taught... by heterosexual teachers... in a fiercely heterosexual society... with television ads and newspaper ads - fiercely heterosexual.
and i ended being his cochair... of the united fund to fight the briggs initiative.
and that began our association, which over those months... when proposition 6 came into being, became a real close association.
and i got to know him on a level that i had never anticipated.
[woman] nobody took harvey milk very seriously... when he first ran for the san francisco board of supervisors in 1973... but last year milk won election to the board of supervisors... where he's the first openly gay city official in the united states.
and representing the bay area committee against the briggs initiative... is sally gearheart - a lesbian, a former high school teacher... and now a speech professor at san francisco state university.
[gearhart] i remember that just before that debate... we had had a lot of talk, harvey and i, about how we would dress... and we had agreed that the image to project was sort of "mama and papa u.s.a.":
the fact is, at least 95% of the people are heterosexual.
if we took heterosexuals out and homosexuals out, you know what?
no, i was saying we cannot prevent child molestation... so let's cut our odds down and take out... the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group.
[gearhart] why take out the homosexual group when it's more, you know -
sometimes i think what we were faced with in proposition 6... was not so much a conflict of values... as two sets of fears.
the incredible fears that the gay community had, all of us... that here we were, being stomped on... by what was turning out to be the moral majority.
i mean, our very lives were being, you know, threatened - the ways that we live, what our lifestyle is - and our reaction was extreme, and it should have been extreme.
but then when you get into the other person's shoes... you figure that there was a lot of fear on the part of the fundamentalists as well.
i mean, when you've lived your entire life... believing in a certain social structure... believing in certain sex roles... believing in the ways that men and women should relate to each other... believing in the family... you know, believing in what god -
what you believe god says should be the way... human beings should relate within the family structure... and all of a sudden, there are these "perverts" out here... saying there are ways to live that are different from that... and that furthermore it's great and beautiful and true and good -
we were so pessimistic - or at least i was, and a lot of other people were - that we thought we might even lose san francisco.
[woman] the bulk of briggs' support lies in southern california... so his appearance here was more symbolic than functional.
he called san francisco the "moral garbage dump of the nation."
if they're gonna lead such an open life of homosexuality... that they want a 21 -gun salute every time somebody goes by them... those people are gonna be in danger of being removed from their job.
so even though he was a buffoon, and even though he was ludicrous... he was also - at least the people who advised him - were brilliant... because they picked on this particular issue: children!
um, it would be hard for me... if we're talking about schools, to go along with you.
no. 6 would force local school districts... to fire any teacher that was gay... or who believed that gay people have rights like other people.
and we're concerned that that would be a real attack... on human rights for everybody.
i think a lot of people are gonna realize they have to make an ultimate decision.
the decision is to go back in their closet real good... slam the door tight - which some will do - or burst down those closet doors once and for all... and stand up and start to fight.
because if we learn from history that the struggle goes on... eventually we will win.
and all the president has to do is - or the governor - is to turn the pages of history a little faster.
one month before the election, the polls predicted a close vote.
many people had come to believe... the briggs initiative would violate constitutional rights.
a surprising array of political figures... including former governor ronald reagan... and supervisor dan white... went on record against the proposition.
[woman] president carter spent less than an hour... at this downtown sacramento rally.
ford and reagan have already come out against it, so i think it's perfectly safe.
also, i want to ask everybody to vote against proposition 6.
and who had been the man who had carried the banner for gay people, you know?
who had been the man who had fought all along... in his politics on the board of supervisors... but particularly during the 6 campaign?
[milk on microphone] to the gay community all over this state... my message to you is... so far a lot of people joined us and rejected proposition 6... and now we owe them something.
we owe them to continue the education campaign that took place.
we must destroy the myths, once and for all shatter them.
we must continue to speak out... and most importantly... most importantly, every gay person... must come out.
my wife and my supporters worked awfully hard... so that i would be elected.
and it was a major decision, as you can all understand, on friday... that i had to come - to arrive at.
but since that time, people unknown to me... plus my family and friends, uh... have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office... that they supported me to stay in office.
[narrator] mayor moscone learned from the city attorney... that dan white could not take back his resignation.
and certainly harvey was courageous in that stance... because no one else was doin' it.
and there were other supervisors on the board who felt just as strongly... but they weren't going to get involved in that.
[man] moscone started to get word from his coalition... of neighborhood groups and ethnic voters.
most of the problems of the people here tonight... were that they were not consulted - they might have helped - and the fact that they weren't even given the dignity... of his concern bothered them.
the issue is what's fair, right, and just for the people of district 8.
[man] white was at city hall with his group of backers:
some citizens, firemen... and a delegation representing large real estate firms.
i'm overwhelmed at your support, that you would take time out... to come down here on a friday at this time... to show not only me but the people of my district... and the people of san francisco... that you approve of the way i'm conducting myself.
[narrator] but then dan white and the shambles of his political career... were upstaged by chaos of an entirely different order.
the city learned of the murder-suicide... of some 900 people... most of them san franciscans.
i was flying up to seattle to visit my folks... and it's really -
i think it was the first time i had seen them since our talk about coming out.
and so i screamed, and i came back up van ness avenue... and i remember thinking, "people are going about their business in an ordinary way.
how dare they go about their business in an ordinary way!
and i knew it was milk because i knew how tall he was.
and they hadn't covered part of his feet or something, and i -
so we drove directly from the airport to city hall... and there were maybe 75 people there.
and i remember thinking, "my god, is this all that anybody cared?" you know.
market street runs in a straight line out to the castro area.
and as we turned the corner... there were people... as wide as this wide street, as far as you could see.
[kronenberg] thousands and thousands of people... and that feeling of such loss.
having lost someone who was so important - and some thing.
i don't know if you call it "expressing your grief" or what it was... but being with all those people, and... it's nighttime in san francisco, and a bunch of strangers around you... and you feel as safe as you do in your own home.
and there was this black man on the corner of - whatever
i think that all of us at that time... were in such a, a, a state of shock, you know, that -
i don't know if it was numbed or we were anesthetized.
certainly i was angry... but it seemed appropriate to do this... peaceful, kind of internalized thing... out of some kind of respect for the enormity of what happened.
it was one of the most eloquent expressions... of a community's response to violence that i've ever seen.
i think we sent a message to the nation that night... about what our immediate response was.
not violence... but a certain respect for harvey... and a deep - a deep regret and feeling of tragedy about it... because moscone had been our friend as well.
[hartmann] and then going down to city hall... that tremendous expanse of people.
and i turned to john and i said, "harvey would have loved this!"
harvey milk's ashes were scattered into the pacific by his friends.
[man] today we went looking for clues to why white would kill the mayor... who refused to reappoint him to his post... and a supervisor who opposed him politically.
i sort of developed this sense of doom... that justice was not going to prevail... because the jury selection process... excluded gay people... minority residents, and anyone who may have had... a political point of view that would be different from dan white.
and i don't want to knock the jury system... because i do believe in the jury system... but once you knock all these people out... what does that leave you with?
we had turned this over to be taken care of... to a system that was actually in many ways responsible for these assassinations.
so there's this little feeling in your stomach when you get afraid and you think...
detailing the facts of the crime... the state spent three days proving that dan white committed the murders.
white's own lawyers had already admitted this in their opening statement.
and then i just got all flushed and hot... and i shot him.
now, if dan white wants to save himself from the death penalty... he's going to have to prove that he didn't plan to kill anyone that day.
prosecutors say he did premeditate the murders... because on that day he put his gun on... and he put a bunch of extra bullets into his pocket.
then he got into city hall here by climbing in this window... knowing he couldn't get his gun past the metal detector in the main entrance.
prosecutors say this shows he was planning to do something suspicious.
white's lawyer claims it's common for people... to try to get into city hall this way... that dan white was only carrying a gun to protect himself... and that other supervisors, including feinstein... have carried guns for protection.
but if he was only trying to protect himself that day... why did he put all those extra bullets into his pocket?
it will be interesting to see how the defense tries to explain that.
well, i didn't mention "with permits"... but i did say that other supervisors and perhaps other city hall personnel... do carry firearms presently and have carried them in the past, yeah.
do you know if the other people who do carry weapons... also carry ten extra rounds in their pocket?
i think ex-police officers... and certainly police officers, on or off duty... carry extra ammunition, yes.
and that is also why you say he reloaded after shooting mayor moscone.
i firmly believe that there's... something for us good that will come out of this.
[narrator] white's lawyers introduced the testimony of five psychiatrists... to prove that he acted while in a state of severe depression... induced in part by consuming too much junk food.
you do expect surprises... and to be ready and open-minded for surprises - the shocking fact that he did this... and you might also have the shocking fact... that there was some extenuating circumstances... or some reason why he was innocent.
so you're ready for that kind of possibility, but i thought he might get the chair.
i remember rushing out of the courtroom... and the news was on line, waiting for the verdict.
i remember thinking to myself, "try to look like you're not so shocked."
yes, the jury has found dan white guilty of voluntary manslaughter... in the killings of both george moscone and harvey milk.
that's a verdict that carries two, three, or four years on each of those counts.
he also could receive two years each... for using a gun in the commission of the crime.
[man] and once again to repeat... that is the verdicts that white's attorney, doug schmidt, had asked the jury to return.
[man #2] dan white could now receive anywhere from four to 12 years in prison... with a possibility of parole after -
[man #1] we have received word that a demonstration has been called... for 8:00 this evening in front of city hall... to protest the dan white verdict.
[man] by about 11:20, things had gone from good to bad... to good and to very bad.
there's a narrow perimeter of shaky policemen... on my left over here in front of city hall.
behind them, and sometimes in the midst of them, are the demonstrators.
every once in a while, a demonstrator, a protestor, will come out of the crowd... throw a piece of burning material into a police car, and start it on fire.
i think it's gonna set, uh, back... the, uh, fight for human rights a great deal.
and i must tell you that if persons are arrested... for the crimes that have been committed tonight... my office is gonna prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.
if you remember, the violence that started all this... was dan white's violence.
i feel that the jury was violent this afternoon... by treating dan white in a way that nobody's ever gonna believe... they would have treated a black person or a gay person... or someone who did not fit dan's type image.
i was right with 'em in saying i - you know...
"there is no justice here today... and anything that we do is absolutely fine."
"you know, it's not important to be civil in american society.
and it's not important to honor other people's right... as long as you are white... and you uphold certain white, middle-class values... because you're gonna get away with murder.
i think he would have been guilty of murder... and been in san quentin the rest of his life.
but sad to say, i think there's a lot of people in this world... that still think if you kill a gay... you're doin' a service to society.
[narrator] dan white was released from prison on january 7, 1984.
he served 5 1/2 years... and received no psychiatric treatment in prison.
[milk] somewheres in des moines or san antonio... there's a young gay person... who all of a sudden realizes that she or he is gay... knows that if their parents find out... they'll be tossed out of the house.
the classmates would taunt the child... and the anita bryants and john briggs are doing their bit on tv.
and you've got to elect gay people... so that that young child, and the thousands upon thousands... like that child... know that there's hope for a better world... there's hope for a better tomorrow.
without hope, not only gays, but those blacks... and the asians... and the disabled, the seniors - the "us's."
even worse than that drunken scum philby and burgess, and that wretched maclean.
but it was last week that you killed yourself, at the dinner, when you kissed the minister on the mouth.
the funeral yesterday of sir philip kimberly, once head of the british secret service, the s.i.s., has brought sharp, quick reactions from america's c.i.a.
and other intelligence sources to whom he was a familiar figure and one of a long line of british traitors.
in spite of repeated american warnings to british intelligence that two of ther top embassy officials were passing secrets to the k.g.b., nothing happened until...
a recent visitor to moscow was mr. tom driberg on the right, who went there to meet one of the missing diplomats, guy burgess.
knight of the golden fleece and hero of the soviet union.
and the only foreigner to hold the rank of lieutenant general in the k.g.b.
it's our belief that in the last hours before you made your escape from englad, you stole it and hid it.
your intention was always to bargain with it, if things became difficult for you here.
at which time you will telex to unblock the money in his swiss account.
i know you didn't work for the money, but all the same, one million francs.
'consenting adults', would've saved vassall and maclean, and burgess too, of course.
not that i think he wouldn't have done it even with a hedgehog.
i also heard news of the loss of your fine vicuna coat, from the sergeant at the door.
news of your grievous loss, milroy, has spread down these corridors of power.
or shall we forget your fine vicuna coat and the cup final tickets?
meanwhile i suppose the news of your other loss, that of the defector kuzminsky has not been spread so wide nor so far as that of your fine vicuna coat.
i gave him a cigarette and the 'times', and i left him to arrange accomo...
as a matter of fact, i had to wash my hands.
while you were washing your hands, he'd washed his hand of you and taken your vicuna coat with him.
he'll get a good price for the tickets and for the coat too.
the exchange of monies and items for sale can be made in switzerland.
i'll be needing british passport, safe conduct, and proof that money is there, before documents can be examined.
you've wasted many millions more pounds in last ten years in search for these documents.
but if you do not agree my price, there are four, maybe more, major powers, be very interested.
all have trusted agent at same time in pay of russia.
why didn't you wait at the home office so that we could bargain in comfort?
but since i cut loose yesterday, i have spoiled those plans, so now they will try to use you to force me back.
if they do take you, you'll be in moscow by midnight.
as you see, we're preparing for one of our big sundays, the ascension into heaven.
i feel we ought to be more dramatically reminded of the descent into here.
i presume you got the report about the woman seeing our russian on the bus.
he wouldn't have been on the bus if scaith had held on to him.
it might be the police, but more likely it's the russians.
penny, do you mean you're speaking to me from your apartment?
take her to the kitchen, give her a cup of tea, some of your nice anchovy toast.
i'll call when i'm ready to have a chat with her.
only this time not for five million dollars, but for five millions pounds.
- they wanna close the camp for the rest of my session.
- since my group arrived there a few days ago... there've been two suspicious accidents.
now, nobody's been hurt, you see, but the management feels that... well, maybe somebody in my group is responsible- pulling pranks or something.
- i'm sorry, gentlemen, but if you don't know the law of the land...
miss zugsmith of the equal rights commission will be happy to elaborate.
well, kelsey took it all so personal, i figure i had to give him a chance... to keep the session going, and since he's paying ya-
what makes you think someone from the current group is behind all this?
this group comes in, and a couple of days later we got two suspicious accidents?
only people here at the camp could have arranged such a thing.
do you think he only invited them here so he could take a crack at them one by one?
that would explain his desperation to keep the camp session going.
well, the police are blaming kelsey's death on the batting machine.
i mean, your program could be in for some deadly publicity.
i'm no stool pigeon, mrs. kelsey... but where i come from, people stand up for their teammates.
so why shouldn't i just call up the police and tell 'em what i know?
i may be guilty of adultery, miss boggs, but not murder.
sam and i broke off our marriage... because we were too much alike- strong willed, hot tempered.
sure, i hated old ralph's guts for the first few years after i had to move to florida.
trying to scrape together a new practice isn't exactly a cakewalk.
ralph made out better than all of us, and chubby took advantage of him.

whoever put his foot in next wasn't gonna get it out.
it could be someone is trying to kill off all the reunion members.

i doubt he could pick that ball up if it came with a handle.
laura, i don't know what you're up to, but i've worked very hard to improve my swing... and i've no intention of going down to ignominious defeat with the bat on my shoulder.
take a look at the top of your bat, dimaggio, and don't make it look obvious.
- since my group arrived there a few days ago... there've been two suspicious accidents.
now, nobody's been hurt, you see, but the management feels that... well, maybe somebody in my group is responsible- pulling pranks or something.
- i'm sorry, gentlemen, but if you don't know the law of the land...
miss zugsmith of the equal rights commission will be happy to elaborate.
well, kelsey took it all so personal, i figure i had to give him a chance... to keep the session going, and since he's paying ya-
what makes you think someone from the current group is behind all this?
this group comes in, and a couple of days later we got two suspicious accidents?
only people here at the camp could have arranged such a thing.
do you think he only invited them here so he could take a crack at them one by one?
that would explain his desperation to keep the camp session going.
well, the police are blaming kelsey's death on the batting machine.
i mean, your program could be in for some deadly publicity.
i'm no stool pigeon, mrs. kelsey... but where i come from, people stand up for their teammates.
so why shouldn't i just call up the police and tell 'em what i know?
i may be guilty of adultery, miss boggs, but not murder.
sam and i broke off our marriage... because we were too much alike- strong willed, hot tempered.
sure, i hated old ralph's guts for the first few years after i had to move to florida.
trying to scrape together a new practice isn't exactly a cakewalk.
ralph made out better than all of us, and chubby took advantage of him.

chris made that barbara got all attention, encouraging her dialog with romain and disengaging to start another with her mother, skillfully including peter.
she created a kind of partition, dividing the table into 2 bubbles cut from each other where chris could navigate in and out at will.
a sort of duel started, with no obvious hostility and no staring at each other.
then romain took over, laid down the law and chris stopped talking.
she knew giving herself is just an image and the gift is just an image, too.
she'd studied the means by which the gift is made, called "a promise?
she'd get her talking to romain, then start a conversation with her mother, bringing peter in.
she managed to put up a sort of barrier, separating the table in two, she being the only person who could pass freely on both sides.
romain would have won, had chris not found an unexpected ally.
lined up in a big uniform and... we cast off the moorings.
as the moon shone over the rooftops, vines and lemon trees, thousands of jellyfish were floating in.
they quietly invaded the bay, like a good chorus, waiting in the wings, before curtain-up.
these events left no mark on her, other than two scars:
one on her right shoulder, and one on her left breast.

is she showing you capital gains to make you liquidate your holdings?
it's all very well to be witty, but you don't understand.
it makes me almost grateful the amount of experience you've had with women.
i think by now your curiosity is satisfied, your inexplicable lusts sated.
what would happen if i went down in an aeroplane over south america and was taken captive by a tribe of huge women who made me their sex slave.
forced by high priestess bettina and her handmaidens to satisfy them day after day after day.
you're a one-woman man and every woman loves and respects that.
don't live your life in deference to what some beer-swilling swine think.
you see... when the polar ice caps on mars were melted away, gigantic nazca ca_ings in the ground were revealed.
and apparently... those were drawn by aliens who visited the solar system long ago.
i just felt i should tell you about all of this since you are in charge of it.
i knew i needed you to understand the gravity of the situation so you could help.
it's "j.s. project", in other words, the logo for the jupiter solarization project.
the le_ side represents jupiter and the right side represents the sun.
however, for those living in the outer planets, there are severe energy problems.
that is because these planets are much farther away from the sun than earth and venus are.
the energy jupiter gets from the sun is barely 1l27 of what earth gets.
they depend on nuclear fusion for much of their energy and this makes energy costs quite high.
jupiter will not take kindly to this treatment, and if an error is made in calculations, jupiter might explode.
in our j.s. project, we intend to get nuclear fusion from the nucleus of jupiter.
you will all return to earth on the next flight out.
unfortunately, we do not have the right to prosecute civilians from earth.
i would hate to lose eiji for even an hour at this point, but i'll make a special exception for you.
i just ordered him to move his investigation to the red spot on jupiter.
just then, maria's parenb were killed in a crash on their way to earth.
torn bemeen her love for me and her hatred of outer space, maria returned to earth.
chief, why don't you try asking the chairman to change the schedule a little?
i'm going on record, chief, we can't delay the j.s. project any longer.
the only remaining mystery is that transmission it tried to send us.
i'll pour into deciphering it as much i can while on the moon's computer center.
it is believed that the black hole spins at super speeds.
jupiter is only 1l50th the size of the black hole, but presently with the j.s. project, we're conducting experiments to produce a slow reaction nuclear fusion.
if we change it to a rapid reaction, jupiter will explode.
if we control the rate and size of this explosion well, we can guide jupiter to hit the black hole at the center of its spinning.
if this happens, we can at least slightly alter the course of the black hole.
i think we can prevent it from colliding with the sun.
if we keep at this rate, there's no telling how many hundreds of people will die.
yes, but if we're successful, we can at least save 18 billion lives.
but i have never told any of my followers to destroy.
ours is a church that encourages prese_ation of nature's beauty and joy in life.
you think it's important to fight in order to postpone your demise.
but i wish to stay here with all the other doomed inhabitanb of earth, upii_ing them and singing to them until we all die.
the planet jupiter has been my friend since i was a child.
i have to take care of it, so i can't die.
i wanted to make it the new center of our solar system.
and now, ironically, i have to destroy that hope with my own hands.
if i just had more time, i could have solved it... what a pity.
the remains of the first contact bemeen aliens and the human race is going to be destroyed with jupiter.
now that jupiter is gone, this asteroid's path will likely be changed.
i'm not sure if i'll ever be able to visit your grave again...
and i want to be proud of that until i die.

yet there were years that went by, it seemed like no time at all, because you're not doing anything.
there were two things i couldn't get out of my mind.
they already told me i'd be a gimp the rest of my life.
don't worry, with one leg a little shy, you're gonna take giant steps.
just long enough so he can get the idea out of his mind.

the synagogue sent these out if you wanted to relocate your loved ones.
the bodies of philip stein maximilian bercovicz, patrick goldberg were already spoken for.

the first was thomas finney, undersecretary of commerce who fell to his death from his 15th floor office a month ago.
if he has no worries, why has he retreated to his place on long island?
he's preparing his attack on the questions he will be asked by the committee.
gentlemen, i deny all of these rumors and allegations against my organization.
our hands have always been and will continue to remain clean.
we don't give a good fart about the socialist workers and their movements.
we want you out of the factory so we can get the furnaces working again.

with your permission, i'ii take these flowers to my missis before they wilt.
the other kids got the same idea, so they wanted to change their beds.
you got 30, 40 screaming babies jumping from one bed to another...
just long enough so he can get the idea out of his mind.
if you can't stand being away from him, put yourself there too.
ladies and gents, i drink to the demise of fat moe's speakeasy.
who the hell wants to drink here legally anyway, am i right?
you said that to me once before, a iong time ago.
my mind was never as clear as it was at that moment.
i've been trying for months to get a hungarian engineer to the netherlands.
he wants to leave and would do well in our factory.
but i can't get a work permit for him, so i need a passport.
the way things work in this bloody country, i need an existing name.
one day, he was going on and said something he shouldn't have.
my father was dying and he said "i hope he kicks the bucket tonight."
i'll be in indonesia for a couple of weeks to check out some files.
if you need help, go to my friend at the ministry of war, colonel snijder.
take a scorpion: it's almost more a mechanical device than a living being.
you never see them, but you know they can hide under any rock.
but gene shoemaker likes to make up his mind for himself.
(shoemaker) it was a path that i personally traveled in small steps.
oh, why has steven been called as a witness against me?
if he had something to say, why didn't he come tell me?
i'm gonna have to find enough money to get our other fields operational before our cash flow dries up.
and the mortgage, which alexis holds on this house, is due the day after tomorrow.
man a new turn in the much publicised murder trial of wealthy denver businesswoman alexis colby.
this afternoon her son, steven carrington, has been called by the prosecution and speculation runs high regarding the testimony that this surprise witness will offer against his mother.
cunningham, what the hell do you mean calling my brother a surprise witness for the prosecution?
mr. carrington, you'll conduct yourself in here during this recess with the same decorum and respect for the bench that i demand in my courtroom.
now this information contained facts which were never disclosed publicly, facts which only someone present that night could know.
the state wants to know from steven carrington exactly what he saw.
hasn't the defendant continually promised you authority in colbyco only to snatch it away?
constantly undermining your position, ignoring your advice, overriding your opinion, in short, humiliating you?
that is, if there's still room for a good friend who has some ready cash to spend.
i'll keep you in mind when the next big one comes along, hal.
but i don't want you to think that this is my way of asking if i can stay with you, folks, for the next few days.
hal, how would you like to stay with us for the next few days?
he happens to have a sizeable amount of money, and i might need him.
besides, as he said, it's only for a couple of days.
also, i'm gonna take the jury to your building and have them judge for themselves whether anyone standing on your terrace could be identified from the street.
adam, there's only one person that you can call to the stand to win this case.
mrs. colby, i cannot caution you strongly enough against this perilous decision to defend yourself.
i urge you, take advantage of this opportunity to reconsider and appoint a new attorney.
this is the cape you intended to wear to the party that night.
this is the cape steven carrington described, or is it not?
if any one of you still has the slightest doubt as to her guilt,
i ask only that you recall the heart-wrenching testimony of her son
stone me for the sins that i have committed, and i'll stand before you and say, "l took my chances."
but i beg you, do not condemn me for a crime that i did not commit.
i wish i had been the best kid there ever was.
i just wish... now i could tell them how i feel.

there are thousands of planets in this area alone... where they can hide.
is it a lack of ships, commander... or a lack of resolve?
you will do exactly as i say until we reach zagora.
i've taken the precaution of reprogramming the vid... so that if anyone tampers with the water on board... this ship will self-destruct.
there still must be plenty of it to waste on fields like that.
not when you consider it's the only source of water left in the galaxy.
is that because you consider yourself so charming that this galaxy couldn't survive without you?
or is it simply because you're too stupid to realize just how close to dying you really are?
there still must be plenty of it to waste on fields like that.
not when you consider it's the only source of water left in the galaxy.

but the brutal decepticons were driven by a single goal, total domination.
they set out to destroy the peace-loving autobots, and a war between the forces of good and evil raged across cybertron, devastating all in its path; draining the planet's once-rich sources of energy.
the autobots, on the verge of extinction, battled valiantly to survive.
-there's not enough energy in these conductors to last a quartex.
north side of cybertron's blacker than the inside of a drive shaft.
-unless a new supply of energy is found, nobody is going to win this war.
now it's merely a matter of time, until optimus prime admits defeat.
-the autobots would have lost eons ago, if i'd been calling the shots.
devastating all in it's path draining the planet's once rich sources of energy.
the autobots on the verge of extinction battled valiantly to survive.
all side of cybertron's is blacker than the inside of a drive shaft.
unless a new supply of energy is found, nobody is going to win this war.
every once in a while, it feels great to win the game, doesn't it?
right now, i feel like i can tackle the toughest case in the books.
he's just about your age, and, uh, he'd been savin' up his money for his first car, and i just knew that this was the one that he deserved.
on the other hand, i think that there is a car over at the other end of the lot that you should see first.
there's an international criminal named cameron zachary who has dozens of operatives working for him.
they've pirated secrets from governments, companies, and individuals the world over.
yeah, but i'm the only bait that can draw him out in the open.
i've never been a quitter, i'm not going to start now.
if you get separated from kltt for any reason whatsoever, press it.
it overrides all his programs and brings him to your rescue, wherever you are.
tell me anything you know about triple-m that might help me.
michael, i really think-- l'll tell you what, just give me the original bear.
a person who loved toys would have collected them all her life.
then, tonight, i made a point of telling her i was going back to the factory.
people so often turn out not to be what they seem.
how can you tell who to trust and who not to?
i'm talkin' about cameron zachary and how you set me up to get killed.
you know, i was really beginning to like you a lot.
i wanted a chance to get out, to live life on the edge.
so when cameron zachary came along, i saw my brass ring.
i'm going to make sure i hurt you as much as you hurt tanya.
i'm surprised you'll have the time, since you're in such a hurry to leave town.
devon, i'm really sorry about that, but i've been on the road for 16 days.
as luck would have it you're less than an hour away from the twin cities civic auditorium.
we had gone to high school together, even sung a little.
he was putting together his 47th band and looking for someone to sing with.
stevie's already been hyping me to this guy paul block, the group's manager.
told him that i'm an expatriate who's been performing in new zealand and australia for the last 5 years.
before i joined the academy, i used to sing all the time.
i even had a record company interested in a demo i made.
he didn't think he needed any protection, and now he's dead.
and here you are, all of a sudden taking' his place with his band and his woman.
i didn't think i could, but i finally found a way.
you see, as long as i know you're out there, that i can run into you.
but you got to admit, it's an ingenious way to transmit a message.
to anyone watching a rock video broadcast, it's just another rock 'n roll group.
but to someone who knows what he's looking for, it's a telegram.
all they have to do is record it and play it back, just like we did.
the convention hall has a closed-circuit system that can feed the action on stage through those big screen monitors.
we tap into that system and send the message through them.
if you succeed, you two can walk out of here afterwards.
but if you don't, if you try and warn him, there will be a man with a gun in the crowd.
broken pattern or not, this may be our only chance, devon.
you handle the dea, kitt will handle the code, and i'll handle barbara and paul.
there are a thousand songs that make me think of you.
but if i can't pick a thousand, see if you can remember this one.
it took me a really long time to get her away from that way of thinking,
it took me many years, and that`s why it was very hard for me to go into her room and find these books under her bed, knowing you had gotten them.
i don`t really think you know what`s wrong with your mom, or what i`ve paid to keep her at home instead of sending her away.
after you were born, she developed what`s called a post-partum psychosis.
i sacrifice my work, my pleasures, my friends, my whole life, to waiting daily for a rendezvous with odette.
my love is an illness that has reached the stage where it cannot be removed without destroying me.
i stuck my nose in one painting to see how it was done.
it was impossible to say if it was done with glue, with bronze, with paint, with rubies, with sunlight, or with pee-pee or with caca.
you've put substance in my life and grace in my heart.
thanks to you, the whole world is bathed in a mysterious light.
i had to go fall in love with her because she reminded me of a botticelli.
now i've decided to fall out of love with her, and i can't.
one by one, i look over all my loves... loves that others never had.
i tell myself... it'll be sad to leave all of that behind.
that evening at the theater, when baron de charlus introduced me to odette,
i thought she had a certain beauty, but a kind ofbeauty to which i was indifferent.
at least tell me what night it was, so i can remember what i was doing that evening.
and don't say you don't know who it was, because that's impossible.
earlier, in bagatelle park, all you did was talk to charlus.
you paid just as little attention to me as he did to his young portrait of muhammad.
thanks to you, the whole world is bathed in a mysterious light.
if you only knew how dry my life was before you.
how nice of you to drop in on your old friend.
everything about you is perfect -- what you wear, what you say, what you read, what you do.
i open up my own heart as if it were a display cabinet.
one by one, i look over all my loves... loves that others never had.

-that man, our tenant, petar markov jakovljevic, that tenant with three names is a mean and dangerous man.
police's been watching him for a long time they asked me what he is doing, who are his friends and who's visiting him...
-as soon as he comes back, we'll give him notice, he'll pack and leave...
-i told the same to inspector, but he said not to make fuss about it he said he's just suspicious for now.

-i'm walking down the street and i'm wondering who stole my 200 000 dinars
-no meat, no medications, no coffee, they don't have clear bulbs, only red ones...
-someone called him and told him not to do business with me because he can have problems, so he got scared.
-someone called my boss yesterday to warn him of me, what i do and whom i see he almost halted my trip to london.
-they went swimming just to get together and to make plans, he ordered them what to do...
-his mistress went to the airport and than straight to london...
-yes, an operator can make one mistake, but to do it a 100 times is impossible!
-listen,comrade,maybe you've got the wrong number but you've got the one you asked for.
-i'm going to get some vodka and you, if you can, make us a cheese pie.
-lock yourself in, tommorow i'll put bars on doors and windows.
-djura, sit down you're smart, djura, help him, advise him what to do.
-sit down djura, my brother, bad things are happening to me.
-of course, i know i didn't do anything and thought they're checking on me..
-once you've done time, you're never sure with yourself, even if i know i didn't do anything wrong, there's this crisis in the world they write a lot about it.
-ada island, 12:25, november 5th, i took this shot from the car cause i was too close.
-danica, what would you say when you see them walking and talking like this?
-don't say that, djura, everyone would say the same until they become familiar with the spy world they can make plans in front of you and you wouldn't know what are they saying...
-in this game, there is one sacred rule- everything is opposite from what you believe it is.
-if he burned it, he'd be suspicious river carries it on, i follow it i get into the river and i swim towards it...
-my ilija, you bathed in the river in this time of the year?
-i have for this kind of evidence i would jump into the frozen river!
-that evening they went to opera house scientist's mistress showed up, too..
-if they are betraying their wives, why wouldn't they betray their own country?
-as soon as they came in, i bought the ticket and followed them in.
-thay stayed till the end of the play so they don't cause suspicion they were sure no one will follow them to the opera
-they are not aware there are people ready to do everything, even to go the opera!
-at fields under kosmaj mountain, they exercise their military skills pretending to go pheasant hunting.
first of all the've practised shooting at moving targets secondly, they walked 15 miles which means they are trying to stay fit third-they are organized as a "troika"...
-and let him ruin the whole country and our nation, is it so?
-so, while he worked to pay for this house for you, for your education, he was smart!
-now, when he's working for the whole country and our nation, he's crazy!
-your father often had hard times in his life, he lived like a dog he worked hard, but they insulted and humiliated him...
maybe we weren't good parents, but you'll regret this when your father proves he was right!
-your father is a great man, i knew that all along but i didn't know you're so ungrateful and inhuman.
-he said about him "this country is not big enough for such a bandit"
-he didn't wrote to his own aunt for 20 years now just cause she lives on lenin's boulevard..
-she said "if our adress was churchill's or roosevelt's boulevard, he'd write twice a week"...
-it's a shame, everyone knows that and no one does anything about it...
-i know her for 20 years, even before she became reporter...
-yes, you were engaged but you left to paris for 5 days, found some whore and made her pregnant... ..with that idiot son of yours!
-haven't you said that our economy is on the verge of destruction?
-that our leaders took loans from the west, so they can lead luxurious life?
-that young people are asked for opinion only when they're blamed for some criminal actions?
-"everything could have been fixed during 1950s' with a big turnaround in our economy..."
-is it by accident you didn't write to your aunt for 20 years?
-and by accident, you gave your appartment keys to my daughter and encouraged her to emigrate?
...you're constantly provoking us, humiliating us, insulting us and djura is a nervous type...
let's have a cup of coffee you surely know, you've got that from your bosses before you moved in that i was in jail for 2 years i don't know if they mentioned djura, probably they have he was in jail too, for 4 years you see, they informed you right and i admit it whenever someone asks me, i say "yes, i adored him!
...they accuse him for crimes he didn't commit. some of it is true and i admit it but back than, i thought he's pure like virgin mary i was a young fool, i'd take a gun and fight,thinking that i fight for justice i needed sobbering up to stop and think about and to say to myself "the one who put you in jail wanted good for you"...
..and i'm very grateful for that today today i know exactly where i made a mistake...
i turned on the tape recorder, here, i turned it off.
-i know you had to take your father's and brother's side when you were young.
...and you tuned to the wrong side, where foreign agents just waited for you they are creating chaos in our country, stirred up by english and americans
-americans waited for you in paris and took you under their wing, right?
-to confess all of this to me... ..i'm telling you this as if you're my brother djura, confess it we'll sit in my car, i'll take you to police and you'll say " i did it...
"i'm guilty, i ate shit", exactly like i say it now, no begging... .."i ate shit, i did this and that, i was blind.."

-and you will confess everything to the police and they will think about it than we'll come back here, danica will make lunch, we'll invite djura, too he'll forgive you for beating you and you go back to paris to work, but on our side...
-and me - if they remember to give a public citation - good.
-i can't see myself objectively and it's not nice to be crazy, jakovljevic and not to be aware of that.
-i lived as a normal person for 60 years and suddenly i went crazy when i met you?
-when you saw that you can't kill me in a war, than you sent me to jail you didn't like the idea that we're all equal... ..and that there are no class differences between people...
-the war was hardly over and you're back already with your honestly earned capital, a thousand such before you and even more coming... ..who will try again to build castles and mansions to opress and destroy others again...

...they accuse him for crimes he didn't commit. some of it is true and i admit it but back than, i thought he's pure like virgin mary i was a young fool, i'd take a gun and fight,thinking that i fight for justice i needed sobbering up to stop and think about and to say to myself "the one who put you in jail wanted good for you"...
..and i'm very grateful for that today today i know exactly where i made a mistake...
i turned on the tape recorder, here, i turned it off.
-i know you had to take your father's and brother's side when you were young.
...and you tuned to the wrong side, where foreign agents just waited for you they are creating chaos in our country, stirred up by english and americans
-americans waited for you in paris and took you under their wing, right?
-to confess all of this to me... ..i'm telling you this as if you're my brother djura, confess it we'll sit in my car, i'll take you to police and you'll say " i did it...
"i'm guilty, i ate shit", exactly like i say it now, no begging... .."i ate shit, i did this and that, i was blind.."
-with lots of reasons, and to answer to no one i was always on the verge to kill someone, don't let it be you, i beg you!
-i don't want you to pay for all the others who humiliated me who tortured me, please don't let you be the one.
-and you will confess everything to the police and they will think about it than we'll come back here, danica will make lunch, we'll invite djura, too he'll forgive you for beating you and you go back to paris to work, but on our side...
-and me - if they remember to give a public citation - good.
-i can't see myself objectively and it's not nice to be crazy, jakovljevic and not to be aware of that.
-i lived as a normal person for 60 years and suddenly i went crazy when i met you?
-when you saw that you can't kill me in a war, than you sent me to jail you didn't like the idea that we're all equal... ..and that there are no class differences between people...
-the war was hardly over and you're back already with your honestly earned capital, a thousand such before you and even more coming... ..who will try again to build castles and mansions to opress and destroy others again...
i don't think you want to go to university if you want to be an astronaut
i'd like to find out all about the moon and all that
i want to be a jockey when i grow up, ya i want to be a jockey when i grow up
tony was already an apprentice at tommy gosling's racing stables in epsom when he left school at fifteen.
i was beaten a length and a half for third and i had a photo finish so i took it out the box and kept it as a souvenir
what would you do if you don't make it as a jockey?
at 21 he was 'doing the knowledge' 21 learning to be a london cabbie
i will be a cab driver and i know i will and i'm going to prove every person who think i can't be a cab driver wrong and i'm going to get that badge and put it right in their face
just to tell them how wrong they can be and how under estimated i am it's surprising who you pick-up, you see..
i once met kojak, i picked him up and warren mitchell or alf garnett, you know...
so he ends up saying "i want to go to langan's brasserie you know stratton street, langan's"
so half way there i said listen, i said "warren, it wouldn't...
i said "it wouldn't be you if you don't sort of..
come out with alf you know, i mean.. give us a..
i said "thanks warren, terrific mate. 1.18 118 so he gave me exactly 1.18 118 listen, i said "i know you're alf garnett and you're having trouble.." alf garnett
i said "but i want you to become warren mitchell now..
i think myself, a happy-go-lucky character and take as much as what any other person couldn't take in a normal job because it's a big world out there and everyone is a different character that i pick up
their attitudes... some of them like the city gents, the typical
i don't know how you've put up with me for so long sometimes i don't know how i stand him but what is it that you love about...
- i like his personality it doesn't matter who it is he don't change for nobody there's only one ambition really i want a baby son if i see my baby son that is my ambition fulfilled no one know that only you now
well.. academically, probably they've had more advantages over me either by the fact they've had prep schools from a very early age they've benefited by it which, you know, it tells obviously in this film
but as far as, you know, the stability and the backgrounds with their parents they've missed out on that
being in a prep school they're missing the love and the care of what every
eastender always gets you know, gives their children each time they come home from work and the parents, you know sometimes obviously are not going to be there cause they are away at prep school they're missing the love and affection you know, what they are craving for
when my kids are growing up, i want to see the change in them, all the time so i have my own memories of when they was a kid and how they were you know and what they were like
would everybody please sit round now and get on with their work?
i wore my brother's clothes for ten years these hand-me-down's are sort of going on my arms with holes on them
i've never had any opportunities to better myself because i was a kid
and i'm more stronger it happened that way i mean, i'm a more stronger person
i appreciate things more now and now i'm in a position through my job you know, to give my kids the life i never had like..
you just have to touch them... yeah, they.. well, they can get what they want, can't they?
if you've got to work for it and it's them that can just ask for money and get it and they can buy what they want
i'm not a politician so let them worry about what's coming for the next day all i understand is dogs, prices, girls, knowledge, roads, streets, squares and mum and dad and love that's all i understand that's all i want to understand
four and a half fifties, four and a half fifties, four and 501
i mean, i walk up there and i order the teas there could be eight people in front of me, i just go...
"can i have a tea please.. tea pleas" five times, "tea please.. tea please.."
it comes out like that obviously etiquette's etiquette so you've got to conduct yourself on these type of courses cause i think..
you're a bit smaller than most people you try and hit the ball hard you've got to just..
- too much mate.. too much no it ain't.. no it ain't.. no..
ton.. hit an eight it's definitely an eight - no that's too much club ken
great shot that's a great shot now i, am a young fella and i've come to you
i heard that you are a big successful taxi driver - you want advice?
- well, make a lot of money you know, have a good life
- son, look at me, i might be a successful business man
all the holidays in spain every year but son it's hard work out there mate
- you're not reaching me yet - not getting to you
i like it, i mean, i think of me self, you know
i can do that, i still want to have a go of it, i mean nothing for sort of fame or fortune or anything like that big hollywood and bright lights it's nothing like that, just a side line
i mean, i may be a happy-go-lucky type of fellow, which i am
i'm an eastender which the attitude is, "allo' mate, alright, how are ya?"
well, at the moment, i'm very happy driving a cab but..
my wife and i always considered owing our own pub so obviously, i think, within two or three years once i get financially straightened out
i'm going to have a go at being a publican and if i don't like it say, if i give it a go for a year or even six months if i don't like being a publican
i'm in a good position to say get rid of the pub and go back to taxi driving
when i.. when i rode at kempton in the same race as lester piggott
i was a naive, wet behind the ears, apprentice and the governor told me "you've got to ride son"
i'm part of it all my years, from seven, all my ambition is fulfilled in one moment when the longfellow comes out and i'm in with him, like in the same..
the starter is calling out to register the names and he'll sortta go like "piggott, draw, eight..
i eventually finished last tailed off obviously, but it didn't make any difference to me just to be part of it, be with the man himself
couldn't buy it, that was the proudest day of my whole life
- i was working at an insurance company at the time and i decided to go into teaching without any experience at all and i didn't think they'd allow somebody to walk off the street into a classroom
6 times 3 is 18, shared by 2 is 9, plus 7 is 16, so you put a 16 there 6318 29 716 16
bruce started teaching at tony's old school in the east end of london.
he lives in a local council flat within walking distance of the school.
they teach you to be reasonably well mannered but not too sniff on the poorer people
when we filmed him at 21, bruce was in his last year at oxford reading maths.
21 and you can show that this is irreducible then you do a transformation on this polynomial, x=t+2 x=t+2
- good, that's a nice way of doing it, particularly using eisenstein down here because his test is very powerful - yes
i didn't agree with the conservatives about what they're doing with the black people, you know racial policy
do you have to defend immigration to a lot of people in this area?
yes, i think you do but those who say "there are too many coming in" and so on
i think, really are uneducated about the whole question they should see the positive benefits that they are having in this country and see that as a result of all of this immigration they are not being denied opportunities it's not the fault of immigrants that there is unemployment
it's part of a political parties responsibility is to explain that and show people what is the more truthful way of representing the situation none of the parties seem to agree with me and i think if i had voted i'd have voted labour
i am about the only socialist in my village and i go into the pub and..
sort of expect to stand up and defend all socialist policies sort of, this is the village socialist no, village idiot, sorry
i just see their lack of opportunities for a lot of people, obviously, unemployment is a great feature in many people's lives and many family's lives and..
teaching children, sometimes you wonder what's going to happen to them?
it seems to me that the leader of the country at the moment should be one of the most unpopular person's in the country and yet she gets away with everything, um..
she.. as far as i can see has done lots of damage and yet..
nobody, nobody can oppose her my heart's desire is to see my daddy who is six thousand miles away 696
an education learning that authority can be bad and.. can be corrupt
well my girlfriend is in africa and i won't... don't think i'll have another chance of seeing her again
i'd rather not talk about it really well no in fact i don't really mean that
i don't mean i don't want to talk about it it's just i'd need quite a long time to think about it really
i think i'm a little old fashioned at three o' clock i'm going to come and pick you up from arts you'll only have one art lesson so if you're art teacher forgets at five to three 2:55
ask her to say we should be packing away and i'll come and get you
so there you were, you went to a posh preparatory school and a major public school and to oxford
and now, you're in a council flat teaching in this school in the eastend of london.
i certainly find it satisfying achieving successes there may come a time when i decide i can't do it and that's not necessarily a weakness that's..
that may be a strength that you realize you can't do it as well as you would wish
having god and christ i suppose that.. you try do that as best as posttible and let that lead your actions in life
does it sadden you when you meet people who don't believe in christianity?
yes, if they dismiss it casually, if they dismiss it as just being something..
"well we know about that, we got a bit about that at school and it doesn't really mean very much"
certainly you can observe somebody when they are seven and identify particular things which maybe are then always with them..
whatever else happen to them people possible say i am little to innocent at times or naive
i used to get worried about this and think perhaps i ought not to be taken in or deceived or..
i'm not talking about love now, i'm just talking about generally speaking but um..
well, i don't know i haven't given it a lot of thought because i'm very very cynical about it
but then, you know, you get a certain amount of faith restored in it well, i mean, i've got friends who've and their parents are happily married and so it does put faith back into you
they live in a small village near bath where rupert is a partner in a firm of solicitors.
i had seven years up in london i suppose it was fantastic but i just had enough it's a much slower way of life down here and i'd had enough of the rat race when i get married i'd like to have two children
i felt that we'd taken the decision to bring a child into this world and i feel that i wanted to bring him up, not somebody else
i thought it's my responsibility to start him off whether that will make a difference to how he turns out, i don't know
i left school when i was sixteen and went to paris 16 went to secretarial college and got a job
what made you decide to `leave school and go to paris?
i think eight is much too young 8 so we will definitely keep them at home
do you still want to send them in the private sector to school?
i think we will, yes but.. as i said not until they are thirteen 13
why do you choose the private sector opposed to the state?
and i'll probably have a lot worse that what i've been through now when you're a child you always think how nice it would be to be grown up and independent..
but there are times when i wish i was three again
it just seems a miracle to me that when i last saw you at twenty one you were..
21 nervous, you were chain smoking, you were uptight and now you seem happy.
no, i didn't know where i was going at twenty one 21
i mean, i suppose i thought i was reasonably happy at twenty one but i had no kind of direction, no..
there's no point in them staying together for me, because it was worse
i mean, the rides... it's worse if two people can't live together there's no point making themselves my father died three years ago it's very hard to describe to somebody how you just take the loss
it was in that very bad winter of '81 81 and we were literally snowed in and i couldn't get out and it was three weeks before thomas was born and..
and i wasn't allowed to fly, no airline would take me and the trains were blocked from the snow and so i couldn't get there
problem than anything else and it is hard to come to terms with
and it was really last year that it sunk in that he really wasn't around anymore
i mean, i don't want to just sit back and let it all whiz past
i mean, you don't know how long you've got your life for you know, you could get run over by a bus tomorrow so you've got to make the most of it while you've got it
he is now in america, an assistant professor at the university of wisconsin earning 30,000 dollars a year 3
the gas in these experiments is at a temperature comparable with that of the sun whereas in a power reactor it would be maybe 10 times thetemperatureof thesun and we're trying to induce that gas to fuse
after it took two and a half years to get that which was relatively quick
i went to work at the united kingdom atomic energy authorities cullum laboratory which is where they do fusion research and that is what i've been aiming to do throughout my p.h.d.
a good opportunity to go somewhere else where the research environment was a bit more vigorous so i came here in november of 1982, into a blizzard 198211
the university is substantially different from an english university for several reasons it's a much bigger university
oxford is full of people who really are trying to prove something, i suppose or be something a lot of people with social or intellectual pretensions you're less aware of that sort of thing here
on the other hand, the american system is much more like the comprehensive system
the best answer would be to say that i dont answer questions like that but..
it's what i said when i was seven and it's still the most sensible but i mean 7 what about them?
interested in that sort of thing and reading technical or scientific material for a long, long time
i was the only child my age in my village but i mangaged to spend my time talking to adults who were around
if one is wandering down a country lane there is an awful lot to look at in the world around you
i remember looking at various natural phenomena and being intrigued to try and understand what made them tick one time i was particularly wrapped up in how a particular cloud which was a very unusual shape you know, and how did that work?
and that was the sort of thing that made me want to go further into natural sciences
i think that if i'd been in a city i'd probably would've had more interaction with people and might have developed more..
it's an exciting place to be, there's a lot going on in terms of research, and other things but i really came here to do research but..
there are more opportunities and just a general feeling of more going on than i had previously this place is less hidebound, less bureaucratically tied down so it's much easier to go out and get things done than in england
even if you think in terms of seeing them once every two years
- that's not so many times, is it - you're thinking only about ten times and that's awful, when you think in those terms and realize... you really are in exile
in 21, some of the people were saying 21 that they felt it was immoral to emigrate immoral to leave.
do you have any feelings about that since you're the one whose left?
a really big issue for us at the moment is how we're going to manage to have kids and run two careers we don't want to miss out on the chance of having a significant career, and we don't want to miss out on the chance to have kids
and to be involved with them but in those early formative years, would you be happy for your children to be brought up by jackie and jackie not be able to give them her full attention?
i pay lip service to the idea of equal shares on this as well and it remains to be seen if i would actually live up to my intention there are several things, i think, to be said here
if we both work in academia, that will make life much easier because as things are at the moment in the states, if you have a computer at home you can come in to teach and to give office hours to your students
at times, yes whenever we have an argument she does have a tendency to explode, i suppose to get, no to get really miserable about it, and not..
we've only been married four years anything could happen we could easily drift apart there are so many pressures on people you just have to work at it and that's why it's important that you have the same ideas
that you want the same kind of life when we were in england, our big source of arguments was money we were always squabbling about money but that one, mercifully..
it seems to have gone away pretty well, we still disagree but it isn't a major source of rows
a person with one million pounds is not going to be much is not goint to be more unhappy than a person with two million pounds
i've never really been aiming for money and that's curiously enough why it was such a surprise that..
it really surprised me when i found that my standard of living mattered to me when i finished university and i found that i couldn't afford what i'd been able understood i could afford as a student
it suddenly caught up with me for the first time in my life that i really did care about how much moneyi was getting and it didn't ever occur to me that i would if i could change the world, i'd change it into a diamond
i'd like to think, i'm hoping that i might do at some stage but i don't really think that i've done anything that you can call a great success, i mean..
it would seem really ridiculous to any of my friends who watch this if i said
very disillusioning, you know, you don't feel you're getting anywhere and of course the money as well which, whatever the papers tell you, is abysmal
peter left his comprehensive school in liverpool and at 21 was studying history at london university 21 living in student digs the facts were that i'm particularly an intelligent person, just reasonably, i suppose
i'm not a genius, i just went to college on three reasonable a levels a and just didn't do very much work for three years, just did the bare minimum turned up to lectures, wrote a few essays
you get a degree for it and it was a joke really once carolyn stepford said she loved me
i don't want to be limited yet if you choose to have a family, then you also have a responsibility to children so you know...
it's a very difficult decision and although i think most liberated men would say that they too are involved in that decision
i think ultimately the responsibility still comes down on the woman's head is peter liberated?
well i think a lot of men such as peter like to think they're liberated and i'm not in any way..
saying that he's not but i think when it comes to the crunch you know, the absolute crunch... are you going to give up your job to look after these children?
then i think it more often than not that decision is made by the woman rather than the man
if you do have children, would you want them educated in the way that you've been educated?
i don't know how things have changed but basically you've still got this emphasis on just getting through exams you know, which isn't really education cause most of the stuff you come out of school with is absolutely useless
teach them more relevant things get them to think for themselves a bit more, which schools don't do enough
would you contemplate putting them into the private sector of education?
well, the principle is that the private schools help to keep the old class system going they're part of it, they perpetuate it so i'm certainly not going to be involved in that when i came through school at the end, perhaps of the..
well, lets say the ideals of the 60's were still there 60 even though it was the 70's 70 and, that one was always led to believe that there were golden opportunities but of course there aren't
and very much now, people of my generation are beginning to realize what perhaps sixteen-year-olds know, now at sixteen 16
i'm only just beginning to see that now at 27 27 that in fact, you know, there aren't..
it's a big problem, it caused a lot of discussion i think the workers do tend to take a few liberties as regards to strikes
i would like to think that democracy is here to stay perhaps we haven't got a full democracy, in fact, we problably haven't it's a..
it's a pretty good system are you surprised by the way england is being governed?
i'm not surprised with the people who govern us at the moment, no
i'm just hard to get.. you know i'm not the sort of person who can get charged up very quickly
i am really lazy, you know if i've got things to do i'd sooner make a cup of tea first and read the paper he always looks on the negative side of life before he looks on the positive
i mean, there is something quite exciting in being different in that it isn't as predictable you know, we're not along the same track all the time on the grass..
- we play international wrestling - yeah that's only in summertime though
it's just a local band, i was in till fairly recently you know, just played pubs and that, but it was very enjoyable
you know, when you get a good reaction from people it's just one of the best things you can have really
i know even now, i meant that if someone dropped me out in the sahara desert
i probably would have been happy more or less, if you get the point
i find it hard to express emotion most of the time though i'm getting on top of that more now, you know?
just the simple things to say to susan, i love you, something like that
his helplessness, i suppose there's the motherly instinct in me to pick him up, and cuddle him..
he's also very good looking, i think, but he doesn't agree with me and in the summer, he's got this cute little bum in shorts
i think it brought us closer together because we really got to know each other and relied on each other so much
i'd never been so relaxed in my life, i felt a lot more confident in myself just great fun really no pressures or worries, everything was forgotten
when we got to perth,' i was ready to fly home being together so much, it was hard but then we settled down and must have settled down really well because
i got pregnant and everything so something must have been going right
i think it's, now, why people like to get back to nature and like to feel that that they aren't living in the 20th century..
20 to me, it's just like an old dream that you wish could come true, you know living next to nature, like pioneers type of thing
i think this is the part we enjoyed the most because we really went out in the middle of nowhere where we had to carry our own petrol and our own water to do us for the 3 or 4 days we were out that way 34
while we were up in carnarvon, we went and stayed on a sheep station carnavon up there with our friend from melbourne, bruce and it was about a million acres, just under a million acres, the sheep station 100
i was gonna be a policeman but i thought how hard it would be to join in
i just haven't made up my mind yet, i was gonna be a phys-ed teacher but one of the teachers told me that you had to get up into university
at 21, paul was working as a junior partner 21 for a firm of bricklayers in melbourne
i'm not great at bricklaying, right but if i wasn't good enough and my boss didn't think i was good enough he would have never made me a junior partner
i went out on my own as a subcontracter not long after the last show then i started with a partner, i organized everything
i bought all the equipment because i didn't want to be dependent on someone else things didn't work out between the two of us, he was a bit lazy
if you're talking about employing other people, i'm not hard enough
i'm a little bit slow with working out things on the job not in particular the laying of the bricks but but i am a fairly slow thinker when you've got to work something out
put it this way, i hope he is better at school work than i was so, that he's got a choice you know, because really..
the education standard that i got, i didn't have a choice what does university mean?
paul started his school life at a children's home near london.
when he was eight he emigrated to australia with his father.
i was just very lazy at school you know, if you're lazy and you don't work at school, you suffer for it there needs to be a little more discipline if private schools are better..
you'd be far better off spending your money sending your kids there then getting a video, a new television..
yeah, i suppose... in a way i suppose he was always there, you know, i could always talk to him but it was different we were sort of..
we were, sort of, distant friends i mean, we always got on fairly well we didn't see much of each other
it messes up your own life it messes up the kids life, wife's life
i don't think half the people who get divorced even think about it properly
what mark has it left on you, the fact that you were brought up within a bad marriage?
the only thing i can say, that i think might have come from that is just my lack of confidence and being able to show my feelings, really, i suppose he is down on him self, he has this excuse where he says,
i don't know why it is, i get really frustrated with him
i want to ring his neck sometimes when he does it but, he's getting better
i have to push him out of the house sometimes,i think needs a bit of extra male companionship because he..
being a bricklayer, he only works with one fellow he doesen't, we don't have a social life with work type of thing well he doesn't because it's only just one person as well as himself
and his basketball, i think he really enjoys it but he doesn't really let on how much he enjoys it
i suppose you could see me now, when i was seven, in a way like i think it was pretty obvious that i wasn't going to be a doctor
and do you think it's true that we can see the man in the seven year old boy?
yes, yes it is because in that he was a very gentle and..
cared about other people and always been able to work his way talk his..
try to give an explanation for saying something he really doesn't want to do you know like, "what if i"
"didn't like to eat my greens" and all that sort of thing, i mean he always still does that, the "what if", you know "what if"
and you know he doesn't really want to do that so he's trying to talk himself out of it yeah.. yeah..
-we've got a lot more than we would have in england from what other people tell us but there again..
when it comes to work i don't sit down on my backside, i'll go and chase it so it's hard to say but i'd say, like in general, that.. but i've probably..
"oh, that's a typical result of the public school system" - yes
well, do you think there is any truth behind the ideas behind the program?
just because some sorts of people don't put that as high on their priorities as you know, have a smart car or something
i'm going to charter house charter house and after that trinity hall, cambridge
andrew went to charter house and read law at trinity hall, cambridge charter house and you can never be sure of leaving your children any worldly goods but at least you can be sure once you've given them a good education
that's something that no one can take away when i leave school, i'm going to the dragon school dragon school
i think for the majority they mix with the same as they were with a school
when they were 21, we asked them what they thought they would be doing at 28.
i think i'm pretty down to earth and i tend to be less extravagant then maybe some women are
when i go out, i don't buy lots of expensive dresses, i just buy one or two and i even let her pay for them
they spend their weekends in the sussex countryside where they are converting an old barn which they bought with financial help from their parents.
they plan to live in it permanently when they start a family
during a week they have a flat in london and jane has a full-time job as a secretary.
i think it's not a bad idea to pay for schools because if we didn't schools would be so nasty and crowded
well, i never really experienced the state system but i think you get a better level of education if you can go to a private school
do you think it's bad that people like you, opt out of the school system?
well, there are really two counter arguments first of all, there's the argument that people should have a choice if they've earned the money to spend it and there's the other argument that if we all went to the same sort of schools
those school would probably be better because those people who had influence would do their upmost to make sure they were better if they had to send their children there whereas they just look back and don't particularly care what happens in the state system
- i don't think much of the accents - neither do i
- neither do i - but it doesn't prevent me liking them
i think anyone who goes to really good school has had a leg-up but i mean, i wouldn't say i'd had been
unduly privileged if i'd missed exams at my school and had to go to a sort of grotty..
did in fact pursue, you know you know, each sentence ended up
"john is at westminster" "andrew is at charter house" and everything charter house it implied that we merely sailed through merely manifesting an intention that we had at the age of seven 7 it didn't show the sleepless nights, the sort of pouring over our books
you know, all of the sweat and toil that got us to universities it was presented as if it was just part of some indestructible birth rite and i thought that it was unfair that it didn't show having to do beastly jobs on the holidays, you know
to make ends meet and things it didn't give a very real..
yes, because i don't want to be tied down to the dourness of an everyday job
i want to have enough money so that i can indulge in the things that might interest me like collecting paintings
i do believe in an ordered and structured society you know we are not exactly alive for very long and we've each got our our own job to do and our own little position to be in
some people have.. a better time than others, but it.. you know..
but it doesn't matter that if you sweep the streets you're any less valuable than than someone who i running a huge corporation
well not everyone can be at the top as long as people are happy with what they are doing that's, i think, the greatest good that can be and this is what worries about these new sort of invidious class attitudes
i really don't see how someone's life can be a failure if i became a journalist and got sacked at 30 30 it's probably because i'd grown out of it or i'd changed so i was no longer suitable, i'd find something else which was
i'd find that i enjoyed and that my talents were suited to
i have been very lucky we pretend we've got swords and we makes the noises of swords fighting and when someone stabs us we go ahhhhh!
i think if you're healthy and have good friends you can get on perfectly well but everybody would like to be rich
neil was brought up in a liverpool suburb, went to comprehensive school and dropped out of aberdeen university after one term at 21 he was working as a casual labourer at a building site in london 21
i came to london and i contacted an agency for squatters and they were able to give me the address of somebody who was able to help people who were looking for accommodation in the london area and by the process of chasing people around i eventually managed to
i can't think of any time in my life when i ever did
i don't think i've been kicking against anything, i think i've been kicking in midair the whole of my life
last three years i've been unemployed but traveling quite a bit, mostly in britain and abroad once or twice but..
but not as extensively as i used to do thanks, shall i put the luggage in here?
for the last seven years neil has been moving around britain.
he spent the summer on a farm in north wales and when we found him he had just arrived in the western highlands of scotland.
do you think people like who live off the state are scrounging?
-no if the state didn't give us any money, it would probably just mean crime and i'm glad i don't have to steal to keep myself alive
i do it simply because i don't want to be without any money if the money runs out, well then for a few days, there is nowhere to go to that's all you can do
i simply have to find the warmest shed i can find
and have a big loud speaker in the motor coach and tell them where abouts we are and what we're going to do
and where the road is and all about that there's a lot more to do in the mountains than there would be in a suburb or a city centre what i found here, in fact, is you don't talk about the weather
because the weather is all around, everyone know it's been raining so you don't talk about the weather that makes good sense to me!
i'm not the sort of person who can go into a pub sit down with a drink and listen to the jukebox and talk a lot of rubbish a lot of people find that very relaxing but, if i'm going to talk to somebody
a, i have to be able to hear myself speaking and b, i have to talk about something that actually has a meaning
i'm not trying to denigrate the way most people relax but i can't do that, so i'm lost in a noisy pub
i found a much bigger course and i found it hard to settle into at first
i did make an application to oxford but i didn't get in well i think that's in the past now and that's..
i don't whether i would have been any happier at oxford it always had been a dream to get into oxford
i think because people had encouraged me and because i knew famous people having been to oxford
i don't think i went to a school of bright people if this was the case, i don't think i would have been so big headed
i know i went to university expecting to be something of a genius and found that wasn't the case at all
which is a good thing for me, it's very good that i didn't count that opinion, i don't think i was so much clever, i just think i was quite enthusiastic particularly when it came to o levels
so i was enthusiastic about the subjects i was studying and therefore with the help of good teaching i was able to get good results
maybe i went to the wrong university or maybe university life didn't suit me either way
i felt a very great need to get out of the system.
the real problem of becoming a success in the world is when you have to tackle yourself on the grass.. we play international wrestling yeah, that's only in summertime though yes, only when we can to go on the grass
being in set one, it's very very hard to keep up with the leaders
i've got a free hand but i've got nothing to do with myself so..
in the winter if you lived in the country it would just be all wet and there wouldn't be anything for miles around and you'd get soaked if you'd try to go out and there's no shelter anywhere except in your own house
but in winter you can go out on wet wintery days because you can always find somewhere to shelter because there's lots of places
i don't thin i've been typical of the environment in which i lived
force this kind of feeling upon somebody the most you can hope to achieve is
is the right to climb into a suburban train five or ten times a week and just stagger back for the weekend, the least is just unemployment
you come home, you plug into the tv set for the weekend and then you..
manage to get back to work on monday and it seems to me that this is just a slow path to..
to.. to total brainwashing and if you have a brainwashed society then you're heading towards doom there's no question about that
i mean, it'll be pretty tough to convince most people that what you have here, the way you live. the way you look is better than a suburban life well, i don't want to convince anybody, i know it is
see, what i look like, isn't necessarily what i feel like
i not claiming that i feel as though i'm in some sort of..
nirvana but but i'm claiming that if i lived in a bedset in suburbia, i'd be so miserable
i'd feel like cutting my throat and so, there is a slight difference when i go home
i don't think i was really taught any sort of policy of living at all by my parents this is probably the biggest mistake that i was just left to fend for myself in a world which they seem completely oblivious of
and i found even when i tried to discuss problems which were facing me in school my parents didn't seem to be aware of the nature of the problem
i think suddenly perhaps almost mutually, it dawned upon us that
we were all making mistakes and and also that some of the things we did couldn't be helped and i think now perhaps the greatest thing we achieved is we know when to say nothing and we know when to do nothing and we know when to be tolerant of each other
and that's a great thing that's really tremendous what i'd like most of all would be
would be to be able to to do something for my parents when they are older, to be there when..
i don't wish i hadn't said it because i said exactly what was going through my mind
i think i was very venomous and i think i had i been in an easier situation myself had i had less worries, myself at the time
i find it hard to believe that i was ever like that but there's the evidence
i wonder why i was like that i wonder what it was inside me that made me like that
i lived in a wonderful world where everything was sensation and i could be happy obviously but be miserable the next minute
i know at seven years old i was fascinated by everything around me the colors of things and things that were funny sounds that things made
i had, if you like, idiosyncratic views about things that other people hadn't even thought about
i remember i thought colored people had purple noses and green legs or something like that
the green nose and this sort of thing and i know that..
that they are still there that when you look at a human being there's more.. there's more to that person then..
but i don't think i'm the right sort of person to carry the responsibility for whatever it is i always thought, well, i'd love to be in
possibly even love to be in politics something like this but
i don't see anyway out, i've thought of everything i possibly could it seemed to me for a long time that getting a reliable job and a nice place to live would be the solution well, i haven't succeeded
i can't see any immediate future at all but here i am, i'm still
i have some prospects of work, i'm still applying for jobs, i haven't given up
i think, i think i'm lucky because i have met so many people
i've worked with people who have no future whatsoever for whom life is finished completely at fifty 50 and yet somehow they have to keep going and
i don't want it to seem that i'm complaining too much
as i've said, i sometimes can be found behaving in an erratic fashion
sometimes i can get very frustrated, very angry for no apparent reason, for a reason which won't be apparent to other people around me
kind words and it usually comes from somebody who has nothing to do with the medical profession which isn't to say that doctor's can't be very helpful
but really, the thing a sick person wants is to be away from doctors as soon as possible
i thought an awful lot about it actually and i still don't know but still i'm certain, if one were to survive in this world they'd have to believe in god
i don't think of god as a creature but i think of..
and that's, i think, how i see him in my life sometimes very benevolent sometimes, seemingly, needlessly unkind
if we come back in seven years, how would you like us to find you?
i'm just somebody with my own particular difficulties and my own particular obstacles to select and everybody else is doing exactly the same thing
if we did all love jeffery and all wanted to marry him
susan has been married four years and has a son of two.
her husband billy is a gas fitter and they live in a council house in the east end of london.
i think it's the same... you think, christ, what have i done?
it is a partnership marriage, yes we were married, i'd say obviously, young
i think if... but again you are generalizing, i mean if..
i would say on average 19 is probably too young 19
i've had a good time up till i was 24 24 and and i think that to get married young there must be things that you miss, you must miss that crucial stage of being yourself because the minute you get married, you're no longer
a single being you're a partnership and that should be the idea behind it if i could, i would have two girls and two boys - yeah, so would i
i mean i know that it's not possible to happy all of the time but as much of the time as was possible go through there, that's the nursery
-got any plans -oh, do me a favor at 21 jackie had moved into a new house 21 she has decided not to have any children basically, i would say because i am far too selfish
i think there is sill a lot of pressure put on young married couples to have children as though it was expected of them and i think it's all wrong, it's just a personal decision that everyone is entitled to make
and knowing what it does to your life i can fully understand someone who decides not to what would you do if you had lots of money about..
it was hard, first of all, when i gave up work from having a fairly high salary to nothing was hard but you get used to it whatever your circumstances are
you live in them, you get used to it, you cope, everybody does
i think before going to a grammar school, i just you know, comprehensive school it just seem more friendly, you know, and at the time it was but now now they are really different
-grammar schools are fantastic -if you say so we've heard that it doesn't scratch the bottom, why am i using wooden spoon please?
it was always in me to go there may come a time, perhaps later on when i regret not having..
we are talking about examination results really, that's what it boils down to and..
i didn't need them for the jobs i decided to do, so with this school, we do metal work and woodwork and the boys do cookery and we get a share of everything.. sort of thing most parents would want
every advantage they can get for their child, now whether you class going to grammar school as an advantage is dependent on you entire outlook if you don't class it as an advantage then you are not going to push that
i enjoyed myself my father recently go education, he never went to the local comprehensive but at the same time
i don't think he was too worried which way i was decided to go
umm.. no, no you can only have regrets about things if you're not happy with the way you are
you look at the old film and you see yourselves as seven, do you think you've changed?
no, i don't think i have really we're the same people as we were then
i was always chatty, jackie was always chatty and lynn was always the quieter one
but is that depressing or frightening to think 7 we're all set by the time we're seven and that's it?
i don't think one's set by that age, you progress but the overall character is there to come up
i think the basics are there yeah, the basics are there
but why is it that you three haven't changed so much do you think?
i think we all could have gone in whatever way we wanted to at the time within our capabilities, i mean we chose our own jobs
we were able to chose our own jobs quite freely if you've got a comfortable background then perhaps it can make life easy but i think you've also seen within this program that it doesn't always work that way
and what is it with yvonne that you fell in love with?
her nature, really it's always quite thoughtful except when she's laughing
when you decided to have the five, did you want to have them close together?
yeah because if you separated your kids and say one is fifteen and one is six 15 6 such an age gap that they could never get on they'd never grow up together, they won't know each other
do you see maybe your kids are going to be smarter than you are?
well, yeah there's a couple of them already that are gonna be smarter
i'll keep them on my side they say, "where's your father, then?"
you know, when your mum's out at work instead of your father
it's not a serious matter the serious point is whether you stay with somebody or you leave them
what would you like to give your children that you never had?
i mean, somebody else might think so yeah but i enjoy having a routine and i enjoyed knowing where i was going to be next and what i had to do next because that sort of relieved me from responsibilities
at 21 he was working in the freezer room of wall's sausages in london.
i couldn't stay there for that long, my mind would go dead how long have i been there?
about eight or nine years or something like that there's a lot of people i know there now when i first went there, i mean... it's getting to know people, now that i've been there so long, i know practically everybody who's in there
i feel okay just getting on with life just sort of keeping up but i know if i really wanted to i could get on it would only take a little spark in me to do it
i'm quite happy to stay there doesn't look like it's going to close down, so, i mean better the devil you know, isn't it
i don't need the hassle of being a charger or the manager or whatever
i had a dream when when all the world was on top of me and and everything was...
and i just about got out and everything flew in the air and it all landed on my head
see, i mean everybody's got the same start they've got that little bit of grey matter in their head and it depends how they use it and for what purpose
i've got what i want so there's nothing that anyone can give me that's going to make me any happier
i could save for months and then one day just go out and spend it and that's that i would feel quite happy about it
i wouldn't worry about getting the next penny if you don't plan anything, you'll never get by anyway you could have millions and you wouldn't know what to do with it if you just keep spending it, you have to know what you are spending
everybody's gotta get used to knowing colored people and colored people in turn have got to get used to being with white people
because if either side doesn't work properly then no side will work properly they're just the same as me aren't they?
i mean, do you think it's hard being a black man in english society today?
looking at some of the earlier films it would seem that you had a sad childhood.
you didn't have a dad and you didn't have a lot of material things.
no, i wouldn't really call that a sad life it's a different life to somebody with everything or thinks they have everything but i mean it doesn't matter if you've got everything, all of the material things in the world, i mean
you're not going to be happy anyway because you'll still want the next thing down the road
willie here has got the most incredible talent for putting the right car with the right person.
thomas here is looking for a good used car cheap, willie.
the happiest day of my life was when debbie married greg.
her first husband died in an automobile accident, and she always seemed
our neighbors heard the gunshot and they saw greg drive out of here very fast.
after they found debbie, the police picked him up at his...
there is nothing she could tell you that i haven't already told the police.
this is where he went off the road in his hurry to get out of here.
can you make me copies of these to send to the defense?
and i'll need a couple copies of the tire tracks, too, because i want to introduce them into evidence to corroborate the neighbor's testimony.
nobody knows where he came from, he has no visible means of support...
...the fan belt... and yet he's able to afford the services of m. barry aldridge, one of the most formidable criminal attorneys in the state.
well, would a murder be worth more than a burglary, for instance?
i mean, i'd hate to waste my time not investigating the penny ante stuff.
it seems to me there are a number of witnesses that can attest to your abusive behavior.
it doesn't matter whether i investigate this case or someone else does.
and by the way, the frosting on the cake is that i get to see your license revoked.
now, i really hope you have some other way of earning a living, mr. magnum, because your days as a private investigator are over.
i just keep thinking that there's something i haven't locked down, some loophole that aldridge will pull his client through and it'll be all my fault.
i couldn't concentrate yesterday, so i went for a walk down to queen emma street, and i'm just standing there, and i stood and i stared at that courthouse for the longest time.
i wasn't sure how i was going to get in to see the little girl or what i was going to say if i did see her.
but i knew i had to at least play it out.
the fact that he didn't kill her is simply an accident of timing.
i wish to god i had pictures of every time he beat her up.
this is a recording my granddaughter was making for my birthday.
i found it still in the tape recorder the next morning.
then my daughter's suicide is also recorded, establishing, of course, that at least this time, he was not responsible.
when i found debbie, i wiped her fingerprints off the gun, threw it into the trash compactor, and i called the police.
when you've built a case on overwhelming circumstantial evidence, you need to present every piece of that overwhelming circumstantial evidence.
i know the tire tracks aren't important by themselves, but they do corroborate the neighbor's testimony.
i would love to get rid of it, higgins, but i can't.
the guy who sold it to me won't take it back, and if i sell it as is, i'll lose money, so i guess i'll just have to take it to t.c. for another look.
you know better than to bring unsubstantiated tapes to the witness stand.
your honor, you didn't hear what was on the rest of the tape.
this is hardly the first time you've testified in a court of law.
you know better than to bring unsubstantiated tapes to the witness stand.
i'd think there'd be an exception made in this instance, given the fact that evidence has been destroyed.
even if we had the tape, it'd be hard to establish a foundation for its accuracy.
did you ever find yourself in a position where you decide to do the right thing, no matter how hard it is, and then you go and do it and something else happens, something entirely different than what you thought would happen,
and it turns out that that, in an odd sort of way, is probably more right than what you had in mind in the first place?
- could have hired 10 doormen for what this thing cost.
- well, at least we don't have to tip the machine at christmas.
- a little more rallentando here, 'cause it needs the time.
and just keep this steady, because i want to lay this in more.
if i was the sort of person who'd read that report...
i'd be the sort of person who'd have my wife followed by a detective in the first place.
- you know, a lot of people make an absolute killing in celebrity garbage.
[ clears throat ] well, mr. keller... the only assistance i need is for you to give me... any other copies of the report, so that i can destroy them... as i did the one you gave mr. robbins.
i don't know what sort of people you're used to dealing with here... but i-i do not have... a suspicious bone in my body.
you don't know about the man leaving your apartment at 1 :30?
we fall for these beautiful, young things... and we try to believe they're in love with us... when every morning, our shaving mirror yells, "they can't be."
if i could just have the other reports, it'd be fine.
actually, there was not much need at all to hire me in the first place... what with that fancy surveillance system you have in your building.
anybody steps into the hallway, it automatically turns on the videotape.
i bet you he found out that you and max used our apartment when he was out of town.
if i would have known what you two were going to do, i never would have let you in.
but, let's see what happens when we introduce electricity into the system.

i don't know if she's a real person, but she's hilary sandeman's wife.
only, i'm not family, and neither is my car, and neither are any of all those freedom-loving independent operators that you care about so deeply, trevor.
now, i'm gonna give you a chance to make it up, to me, to all those people that you've duped into believing in you, and to yourselves.
so, why don't we just visit a lawyer first thing monday morning and make this wonderful friendship legal?
oh, er... and just one other further item of mutual company expenditure.
we've got the food, we've got the goodies, and the odd drink or two, so don't you feel too sorry for us.
and anyway, hilary sandeman has promised all us christmas workers an extra four weeks' holiday in the caribbean as a means of compensation, so that can't be at all bad.
oh, no, we're gonna have a day away from all that.
i'm just gonna sit back, play you some very nice music, talk my head off, and tell you some of the worst jokes that you're ever likely to repeat.
on 261 we're bringing you the national news on the hour!
'this is the six o'clock news headlines with peter porter reporting.

and nancy in the front office has just come in to tell me that the lookalikes competition has captured her imagination again this week.
a man from paisley has just phoned in to say that his wife is the absolute double of richard nixon.
we'll believe anything that happens in paisley, but the rules are either a photograph sent up here to the station or why don't you just pop up and let nancy check you out in person?
and i can tell you that's a journey very, very well worth making?
'no less than eight christmas truces are in jeopardy around the world today, 'and intense diplomatic activity continues 'in an effort to reduce global tension.

'he said later, "we will have peace here at any price."
'mamie the giant panda is said to be comfortable and well at moscow zoo, 'shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed.'
just a little bucket seat way out there in the ocean.
there was a point, you see, when you'd be halfway between one ship and the other and the swell sometimes which put both ships out of sight, for 15, 20 seconds... and there you'd be, hanging beneath a bit of rope... and nothing all around you but angry water.
'it comes from the people who make minty crunch, 'so you know that it tastes good and minty, 'but it chews like a real chewy chew bar.
'it's a between-meal snack that comes in four big chocolate-covered fingers.
it's new party mix, the drink mixer for every taste, in tangy, tropical four-fruits or smoothie-tomato flavour.
yes, gin, vodka and bacardi taste new and exciting with party mix.
no, the rules are a wee bit hazy on that score.
now, look, this was taken in 1958 and everybody says i was bob hope's double.
my father says that he speaks for the whole of the ice-cream community, and my father asks if he can call you dicky.
my father says that ice cream is his life and he's called you dicky again.
now, you do your shopping elsewhere and you got the demolition treatment.
how long have you been locked up in that radio station of yours, mr bird?
'it was announced in moscow today 'that mamie the giant panda died in the night.
'earlier this week, zoo officials were rejoicing at mamie's confirmed pregnancy, 'but a spokesman said today that tests had revealed a serious stomach illness 'bearing similar symptoms to pregnancy.
'messages of condolence have been arriving at the moscow zoo 'from all over the world.

'but today we'll concentrate on the easy-to-make banana fritter, 'a very delicious hot sweet 'that'll make a change from leftover christmas pudding.'
i don't know if she's a real person, but she's hilary sandeman's wife.
'...baking the banana before frittering, but i don't hold with that.

welcome to the home of the class clown, the theater of suppressed laughter.
when you were in school, did you notice that simply because you weren't allowed to laugh, it made the laughing that much better.
that there was something about trying to hold it in that made you laugh even harder.
and it wasn't just in school, church was the same way.
in fact, church was even better because in church, there was the additional possibility of perhaps being stricken dead by an angry god.
well, catholic schools combined the two things, religion and the classroom, an extra challenge for the resourceful class clown.
now, class clowns probably had a lot of reasons for doing what they did, but for my part, i always enjoyed getting laughs because usually the person who laughed was the one who got in trouble.
i could whip a quick face on roger, hey roger, and then roger would be suddenly leaving the classroom, accused of having no self-control.
hey, i figured if i'm not gonna get an education, why should anybody else.
probably the best attention getter of all was the old reliable artificial fart under the arm.
it wasn't really a special skill, lots of people could do it, but class clowns could do it a little quicker, and a little louder.
and who else but the class clown would have his shirt specially made for easy access.
and i'm certainly not gonna be humping any haitian hemophiliac homosexual heroin addicts.
tell you one good thing about herpes though, finally the people from brooklyn have a disease they can mispronounce.
they gave me something here to, uh, bring to your attention.
this is, oh, i see, a message from the national pancake institute, and it says, "fuck waffles."
help me find some shoes i really like, help me also to find a nymphomaniac coke connection who owns a ferrari dealership.
don't let me catch vd from a female welder, don't let me catch vd from a male welder.
well, i always like to throw in one request that everyone else can get in on, too, you know?
so i say live and let live, that's my motto, live and let live.
anyone who can't go along with that, take him outside and shoot the motherfucker.
it's a simple philosophy, but it's always worked in our family.
that's the first thing i always looked for when i worked in an office, you know, the water cooler, little place to hang out in between periods of making believe i was working.
actually, it's just a little place for my stuff, you gotta have that, you gotta have a little place to put your stuff during the day, during the evening, whatever it is, don't ya?
that's the meaning of life, trying to find a place to keep your stuff.
that's all your house is, think of it, that's all your house is, it's a place to keep your stuff.
that's all your house is, it's a pile of stuff with a cover on it.
that's all your house is, it's a place to keep your stuff while you go out and get more stuff.
say you're gonna go to honolulu for two weeks, two weeks in honolulu, you gotta take two big bags of stuff.
you get to honolulu, you fly halfway across an ocean, and you get to honolulu, get in the hotel room and you put away your stuff, that's the first thing you do in a hotel room
but you put your stuff away, and you know that you're a long way from home, and you don't quite feel 100 percent at home, but you know that you must be okay because you do have some of your stuff with you.
and you begin to relax, you know, i feel okay, hey.
and you go over to maui, and you're really spread out now, you've got shit all over the world.
you've got stuff in the mainland, stuff in honolulu, you got stuff with you, supply lines are getting longer and harder to maintain.
but you get over there to maui and they give you a little place to sleep, you know, a little window sill and you put your stuff, because you don't have much stuff now, on the window sill.
you put your favorite stuff, your jumbo size visine, your trim nail clippers, your odor eaters 45-day guarantee, and your afrin 12-hour decongestant nasal spray.
money, keys, comb, wallet, lighter, hankie, pens, cigarettes, contraceptives, vaseline, whips, chains, whistles, dildoes and a book.
maybe a little dental floss, depending on who's on the other side of the island.
two weeks after they arrived at their new home, the dog showed up in dallas, texas.
by mistake, she had taken interstate 44 out of st. louis.
you put a necklace on a mouse, it goes right down to his waist.
they think it's a belt, what do they know, they're fucking mice, you know?
one of those dogs that just shakes and pisses all the time?
and you have to take him out for a pull, come on, you, come on, you asshole.
i had a little dog named tippy who, uh... well, it's just one of the dogs i had in my life.
that's what's great about dogs, they don't live too long and you can go and get another one.
but tippy was great and so nice, and one time, one time i fed tippy cracker jacks, cause that's what i was having.
hey, it sounded like a good meal to me, you know?
call into work, call into work around 11:00 o'clock, tell the boss you smoked some fruit loops and you're watching a movie, and you'll be in around 2:00 o'clock if you feel like it.
that's the way you gotta treat the boss, you can't take shit from a guy just because you work for him.
let him know you consider partying to be sort of a career of its own.
and you'd like an office right near the front so you can get the fuck out at 5:00 o'clock in a big, big hurry, you know what i mean, i ain't staying around here.
tell him what's happening, then ask him politely what his attitude is on monday and friday absenteeism.
tell him you don't need a two-martini lunch, but you gotta have a one-joint coffee break.
let him know you'd like to start next month, but you must be paid immediately.
then if you still don't have the job, point to the picture on his desk and say, who's the cunt?
but we have flame throwers, and what this indicates to me, it means that at some point, some person said to himself, gee, i sure would like to set those people on fire over there,
but i'm way too far away to get the job done.
if only i had something that would throw flame on them.
well, it might have ended right there, but he mentioned it to his friend, his friend who was good with tools.
and about a month later he was back, hey, quite a concept.
and of course, the army heard about it and they came around
well, actually, you'll go for a ride, i'll go for a drive.
the person who drives the car, they're the one who goes for a drive.
i mean, you haven't even gotten in this death machine yet and you almost died once.
what you need is a nice, long red light back about a mile and a half, cause you need a little time and space to get in your car, with a little style and grace.
cause sure as shit it's gonna come back and whoooot, whoa.
oh, and that hurts for about a year and a half, you know?
there are about 50 of those little pop top beer can rings all fused into one piece of metal, and this thing is never gonna move unless there's an atomic attack.
now we get in the car if we can and get going here.
well, we had one additional thing, you may have parked in this parking lot where you had full access to your car when you went into the shopping center, but now that you've been in there,
some asshole has parked right next to you, and you have about four degrees clearance now, and you gotta try and get in, and you're carrying 12 gifts and wearing a top hat.
and besides your back, getting in like this, you also risk serious ball injury from the steering wheel.
so far the worst thing that's happened is the flow through my femoral artery has been cut off for over 18 minutes.
first of all, there are some things that happen in the car, little embarrassments you suffer, but everyone knows about them.
uh, this is an example of what i mean, have you ever been driving someone else's car and they're in the car for some reason, you know what i mean?
now here's an embarrassing thing, this is really embarrassing, this will stay with you for several hundred miles.
you know those things you don't shake off right away, like when you almost got killed by the big tractor trailer truck, and you had to pull over for 20 minutes and not do anything but listen to your heart.
he said never mind will ya, my brother drives like this.
he goes a little bit further, comes to another red light, right through it.
they tell you to put them at 10:00 o'clock and 2:00 o'clock.
bullshit, i put mine at 9:45 and 2:17, gives me an extra half an hour to get to work, you know?
by the way, use everything on your car, you know what i mean?
it's yours, fuck it, you paid for the car, use everything, man.
flip your sun visor even on a cloudy day, who knows, flip it over here, flip it up and down, flip it on the side like the french people do.
flip the other one, even if no one is there, open the ash tray, push in the lighter even if you don't smoke, turn all the knobs, have a lot of fun.
now, a couple of things for the road like let's remember not to get behind anybody weird, or even somebody mildly weird.
you ever been behind a guy whose turn signal has been on for 80 miles?
and you say well, maybe he's just really cautious, you know?
i'm not gonna pull out now, he may go at any moment.
you know how you take care of those people, don't you?
slam on the brakes, let them plow right into you, man.
another kind of person you don't wanna get behind is anybody ssssslow.
boy, that's really good for your arteries when you get behind somebody really, really sloooow.
there are two classes of human beings to avoid in this category
the first one is, any woman whose head you can't see in the car at all.
even if you think you're a pretty cool customer, you know you get pissed sometimes.
don't you wish sometimes instead of having those cute little lights on the front of your car, you had 50 caliber machine guns mounted up there?
so everything is happening at once, radio, windshield, rain, traffic, everything going on, and you're just trying to get across town to take care of something, you know?
and you get over there and park the car, turn off the key and go inside, take care of the business, and you come out and you turn on the key, and the goddamn radio is this loud.
here's something you'll be doing tonight, this is one you do all the time, if you get in the car you're committed to do this following thing over and over.
when you're driving, you have to decide which car to get behind at the red light.
there's a block to go, there are three lanes to choose from, it's completely up to you to decide who's the really fast asshole in this group up ahead.
now, just a couple of things to remind you before i tow this trusty little thing back to the garage, a couple of things that go without saying, that's why i'm going to say them.
uh, first of all, when you're driving, let's all keep in mind, when you're driving and you come to the scene of an accident, for god sakes, slow down and try to find out what's going on.
and if you can't see enough, ask the policeman to bring the bodies over a little closer to your car.
that's what they're here for, to protect, to serve and to bring the bodies over a little closer to the car.
and the other thing which we've all heard a million times but it bears repeating, drinking and driving simply do not mix, so do your drinking early and get it out of the way, and then go driving.
tragedy struck the parade today as an open manhole claimed the lives of 1100 marchers, one at a time.
the food and drug administration announced this week the following consumer information:
baloney causes night blindness, tuti fruity ice cream causes homosexuality, and chicken a la provencal with truffles and white wine causes brain damage.
a man has barricaded himself inside of his house, however, he is not armed and no one is paying any attention to him.
when he woke, the room was full of smoke and he could not see.
the dog led him out of the room, down the hall, and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his death.
the winner was johnny downing with 1,829 strokes, just enough to beat larry powell, who lost any chance he might have had when he took a 312 on the final hole.
the nobel prize in mathematics has been awarded to a california professor who has discovered a new number.
a priest who has performed over 300 exorcisms was eaten today by a green boogie man.
in northern montana today, a woman was severely injured when she attempted to force breast feed a wild boar.
this morning on a busy downtown street corner, a dog exploded.
no one was killed, however 12 people were overcome by fur.
police estimate that 50 to 60 fleas also lost their lives in the blast.
let me ask you a personal question, have you ever been making out with someone and one of you has a snot that's whistling?
isn't it strange, it's the funniest feeling, cause just after the hatchet goes in, before you feel any pain, you feel this blast of cool air in the middle of your brain.
i love that, it feels so good, but you know, that's the only way i can attain it, and so i try not to get too hung up on it.
and what i'm wondering is, if you have rain dance practice, does it rain during practice?
and if it doesn't how do you know if you have it right?
and if it does, why bother with the goddamn dance in the first place?
why not, you know, you need a little water, call practice.
these are the kind of things i think of when i'm home alone and the television is broken.
you know the best thing about living right on the seashore, you only have assholes on three sides of you.
and i've been calling assholes a lot of years, you know?
and i've noticed one thing, the amount of an asshole a person is, is directly proportional to the distance they are away from you at the time you discover this flaw.
did you ever go the doctor's office waiting room and you sit down and it turns out to be one of those cushions that sounds like you farted?
don't you stand up right away, and then do it three times in a row?
it never has anything to say when i'm out at the rifle range.
but you let me get into the dentist's office waiting room, everyone is quiet, everyone is in pain, and everyone is reading.
then it starts in with complete sentences, we have no money for food, we're poor.
don't listen to my stomach, huh, it doesn't know what it's talking about.
well, that's what he says now, that he doesn't want to get sick.
you check that same guy in a half an hour and you know what he'll be saying, geez, i wish i would get sick and get it over with.
they'll clear a path to your home, cause don't nobody want no vomit on his pennant.
well, i'd like to do something called baseball and football, and it, uh... thank you, that's nice... because these two things are such a part of our lives, these two activities,
in baseball in the stands there's something of a picnic feeling, you know, emotions may run high but there's not that much unpleasantness.
in football in the stands, you can be sure that at least 27 times during the game you were capable of taking the life of a fellow human being, preferably a stranger.
and to sum this up, the object of the games, quite different, the object of the game in football is for the quarterback, otherwise known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault,
riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use the shotgun.
from norway, a look at a largely forgotten sport, underwater tobogganing.
from an elevator shaft in new york city, men's vertical frisbee.
it goes like this: "rat shit, bat shit, dirty old twat, 69 assholes tied in a knot, hooray, lizard shit, fuck."
now, i'm gonna do that again cause i know some of you like to memorize these things.
so perhaps it is not surprising that still most of this vast domain is still unexplored.
and in the geographical sense, the surface of the sea, the floor of the sea, is even more varied than the surface of the land.
the bottom of this immense valley seven miles below the surface is grooved by deep faults.
if mount everest rose from the bottom here, its summit would still be beneath 7,000 feet of water.
down at the very bottom, the water pressure is some seven tons per square inch, the temperature is close to freezing, and it's pitch-dark, for it is far beyond the reach of sunlight.
as we climb up out of the trench, we move onto a plain covered with reddish mud.
a few hills rise from it, but there are still some 20,000 feet of water above us.
travel eastwards over these plains for 1,000 miles, and we reach a range of fantastic mountains.
their summits are covered by a white deposit like snow, composed of the limestone skeletons of microscopic organisms that have drifted down from the surface waters.
they never reach the lower slopes, for the water pressure becomes so great they dissolve.
currents sweeping up from the south pile the sand into dunes 150 feet high which advance slowly across the sea floor as dunes do in a desert on land.
in places, the sand is littered with metallic lumps, some as big as cannon balls:
manganese that under these pressures has precipitated out from the salty water.
after a journey of 4,000 miles, we reach the biggest mountains of all.
these are the flanks of the great volcanic islands of hawaii.
their sides are far steeper than any mountain on land for they are never eroded by frost or by rivers armed with gravel.
they rise from the sea floor 15,000 feet to the surface and then continue for an almost equal height above it, so they can truly be reckoned the highest mountains in the world.
as we climb up their sides towards the surface, we return once more to light and to abundant life.
life began in sunlit waters like these some 3,000 million years ago, and creatures very similar to those ancient primeval organisms still flourish in shallow seas all over the world.
feather stars very like these waved their tentacles in the ancient seas long before any fish appeared, at a time when the land was still bare of life of any kind.
even older, indeed among the first of all living things, microscopic plants encased in shells of limestone.
they use sunshine to build, from simple chemicals in the sea water, their own tissue.
the animals of the plankton, all those that can't photosynthesise, sweep up the tiny plants and other edible particle in many different ways.
this one extends a forest of long tentacles in which smaller organisms get entangled.
creatures from many families of animals have representatives in this community.
some are permanent members, some only temporary, joining it when they are young larvae and drifting great distances before they grow up, change shape and settle down to a more static life.
instead of moving with the current, you stay fixed to the rocks and allow the currents to bring food to you.
that is the technique used by anemones and many other creatures.
some crabs also rely on the currents to bring them meals, and pluck them from the water with tiny pincers.
but the biggest of all filter-feeders propel themselves gently through the surface waters.
the water is channelled into its mouth by the blades on either side of its head, and then passes through filters in the slits in the sides of its throat.
the basking shark gathers the same sort of food in a similar way.
idling through the water, it filters over 1,000 tons of water every hour.
and even bigger still, in fact, the biggest of all fish:
others pick off morsels that get stuck in its tiny teeth in a mouth six feet wide.
it's an astonishing proof of how sustaining and how abundant the plankton must be.
and indeed, when one looks at them, it is not so much their danger that comes into your mind as their extraordinary beauty.
the way in which they are so perfectly streamlined, every curve of their body, every curve of their fins precisely matching the shape that is needed to glide through the water with the least struggle
but soon after they appeared, another group of fish established itself.
these have skeletons of bone, not gristle as the sharks have, and they have two swimming aids that the sharks lack:
swim bladders that give them buoyancy and paired fins that can twist in all directions and so give them great manoeuvrability in the water.
these bony fish are the ones which today dominate the seas.
dolphins and killer whales are descended from four-footed, land-living, air-breathing mammals that were flesh-eaters.
in the sea, they lost their limbs but not their taste for meat, nor their teeth.
indeed, one of the family that lives only in the ice-strewn waters of the
arctic has grown one of its teeth to an extraordinary length.
that is confirmed by the fact that very rarely indeed males have been glimpsed, as here, fencing with one another.
the best view that most of us can get for most of the time of most kinds of whales, is a brief glimpse as the animal comes to the surface to snatch a breath, but that's not the case with the beluga, these beautiful white whales.
we don't really know why they come here, nor what they do now that they are here.
maybe there is some kind of specially attractive food in these shallow waters, for sometimes they seem to deliberately to stir up the gravelly bottom of the bay.
perhaps there is valuable food for youngsters or nursing mothers, for many that come are females with babies a few months old, swimming skilfully in their mother's slipstream.
but whatever it is that they do here, they seem to be enjoying themselves hugely.
and they haven't lost their mammalian habit of communicating by sound.
so vocal are they that they are sometimes called sea canaries.
the most recent family to colonise the sea, also mammals, were descended from bear-like creatures.
the walrus and its cousin the seals are not so fully adapted to life in the sea as the whales, but they may haven't been there so long.
they haven't lost their feet as the whales have, nor do they spend all their lives in the water.
they come ashore to give birth and they often haul themselves out to rest.
indeed, there are more different groups of animals living in the sea than there are on land.
the oceans were the birthplace and the nursery of life, and they are still its main residence.
they must have good light, clear, unpolluted water and warmth, and they find those conditions in their very best in the tropics, particularly around the small islands that are the summits of submarine mountains.
there, they flourish so well that they grow outwards into the clear blue water, building on top of their own skeletons to form these wide, shallow lagoons.
if the jungle is the place on land where there are the greatest number and the greatest variety of life, then this, the coral reef, is surely the jungle of the sea.
the number, the variety, the sheer beauty of all these myriad fish, corals and anemones, is quite breathtaking.
of course, the tiny anemone-like creatures that build these fans and fronds of coral are themselves animals.
but within their tissues, there are tiny granules which are algae, plants, and it's they that harness the sunshine and use it to build living tissue.
others pick off little organisms and particles with the utmost delicacy.
the tides, surging in and out of the lagoon, bring in regular supplies of fresh oxygenated water and fresh food.
angler fish sit in the current waiting patiently, like all fishermen, for whatever turns up.
even such specialised fish as these exist on the reef in several different versions.
and the angler, perhaps to prevent a second fish arriving before it has digested the first, changes colour so that the lure vanishes.
in the reef, there are many species with many ways of life.
often, they share the shells they have commandeered as a home with anemones.
the anemones benefit by picking up bits of the crab's meal and give the crab in return a certain protection with their stinging tentacles.
this crab actually uses a particular kind of anemone as a weapon, wearing one on each claw like boxing gloves.
this one tries to put on a sponge like an overcoat.
the crab gets the camouflage and the sponge may benefit from the crab's crumbs.
crabs and their relations, the lobsters and shrimps, are found from top to bottom of the reef.
big ones like this lobster prowl openly through the coral branches.
little ones like the mantis shrimp are rather more cautious and build themselves tunnels.
if the coral reef is the equivalent of the jungle, than maybe these waving beds of kelp in the cold atlantic waters off the coast of norway are like the dark evergreen forests of the north, bitterly cold, dense and uniform, and swept by raging gales.
bleak though the kelp forest may seem, there are riches here, and elder duck know it.
they prefer to fish for mussels on an ebb tide when the water is low, but they ae such good swimmers that they can stay below water for a minute or more, and dive down to 50 feet below the surface.
the streaming current causes great problems to the fish of the kelp forest.
its young develop suckers at a very early age and sometimes fix themselves to their father, who ferries them off to deeper waters.
kelp grows in coastal waters all round the world, and in the seaweed forests of southern australia lives one of the most extravagantly camouflaged of all fish.
they're all part of the elaborate costume of the leafy seadragon.
the dragon is really a kind of a seahorse, as you can recognize if you disentangle its main body from all its extraordinary outgrowths.
over vast areas of the ocean floor, there is nothing but shifting wastes of sand.
it seems as lifeless as a desert on land in the heat of the day.
an occasional fish wanders over the rippled surface as though lost.
here and there, a sea urchin levers itself along, extracting what nutriment it can find from particles within the sand.
the goatfish looks for the same sort of thing, using sensitive barbels on its chin.
to build a home or a shelter in sand demands special techniques.
garden eels cement the grains together with mucus to form a tube in which they cling with their tails while collecting plankton with their mouths.
bulldozer shrimps and a goby cooperate to build a shared tunnel, using coral rubble to prop up the roof.
the floating pastures of plankton on which so many ocean-going fish depend must live in the surface waters within the reach of sunshine.
the coral lagoon and the kelp forests only flourish where good light reaches the bottom.
but light can't penetrate much beyond 350 feet, and most of the ocean floor lies far deeper that that.
even quite near the surface you often have to take your own light with you.
their batteries are little colonies of bacteria living in a pouch beneath the fish's eye that give off light as a by-product of their chemistry, and the fish turns its lights off and on by raising and lowering a flap of skin.
at greater depths, giant amphipods, primitive relatives of the horseshoe crabs, plod along the bottom.
almost all the creatures here feed on dead bodies that fall from above.
the eel-like hagfish, which have no jaws, knot themselves against the carcass to get a better hold.
bigger fish grip with their teeth and spin, tearing off strips of the flesh.
the smaller particles drifting down from the surface are collected by deep-sea stars and smaller fish.
it is here that all the nutrients produced by decay finally collect as ooze.
the very deepest parts of the ocean lie below the paths of currents, so the water is not only black and cold but almost still.
the weird tripod fish perches on its extended fins and its tail.
even in the deepest place of all, the mariana trench, seven miles down, there is life.
shrimps are slowly picking clean the skeleton of a fish that may have taken months to drift down to these still depths.
but at the surface of the sea, the water is never still.
storms whip it up into great waves which may travel for hundreds of miles before, eventually, they crash into the coasts.
the water in these waves doesn't travel far, but circulates more or less in the same place while the wave itself moves on.
they are created by the spin of the earth which gives the waters at the equator a westward drift, and by the sun which warms these equatorial waters and sends them away to the poles.
this produces vast ocean-wide eddies that replicate the whirlpools of tidal races, but do so on a scale that is thousands of miles across.
the northern has to swirl around the great triangle of india.
in the atlantic, the north-flowing current is called the gulf stream, and it encloses, in the centre of the ocean, as all these great whirlpools do, an area where the waters are almost still.
small fish shelter in its fronds and are closely disguised to match them, and swimming crabs clamber up and rest on top of the floating mats.
but the sargasso is one of the least fertile stretches of water in all the oceans.
between the gulf stream and the north american coast there are cores of cold sargasso water surrounded by warm circulating currents formed when the gulf stream meanders and nips off a segment of the sargasso, complete with its weed and populations of animals.
these warm core-rings, a hundred or so miles across, drift slowly down the coast until they lose their momentum and their warmth, break up and are swept away again by the gulf stream.
is realised, and where animals of all kinds above and below the water come to harvest it.
the warm water of the gulf stream is accompanied by steady warm breezes.
and just about here, it meets a cold current coming down from the arctic, and where the warm breezes meet the icy breath of the arctic, they shed their moisture and form these fogs.
and where the two currents meet, the waters churn and swirl, and bring up rich nutrients from the bottom of the sea.
now, it so happens that just off this coast there is an underwater plateau where the water is so shallow that the sun or the light can get almost always to the bottom, and so the floating plants of the sea are always within the range of light,
and they're fed eternally by these swirling currents bringing up nutrients.
so the plants flourish, and on them come great shoals of fish which breed and spawn in such numbers that at times the waters seem almost to boil with them.
these are capelin, a small fish related to the european smelt.
they feed on the plankton in the surface waters, and in may they gather in vast shoals to spawn.
some will do so offshore, but some go to extraordinary trouble to lay their eggs out of water where they will be safe from other hungry fish.
they pile up in banks, as solid as sand along the high-water mark.
having spawned, all the males and most of the females die.
with each upward lunge, the whale takes in tons of water and thousands of capelin.
with a mouthful in its jaws, it brings forward its tongue, squirts out surplus water through the filter plate that hang from its upperjaw and swallows the tiny fish.
the capelin, frightened by the circular curtain of bubbles, rush inwards and form a dense, confused shoal.
than the whale rises up in the middle, jaws agape, and engulfs the lot.
after a few short weeks, the spawning orgy of the capelin is over.
their bodies lie in vast drifts awaiting the processes of decay which will return their nutrients to the waters, but even before they disperse, other bodies appear:
hundreds of tons of them are despatched every year to japan where they are a much-prized food.
mackerel also come to the grand banks by the millions to feed on small plankton-feeding fish
during this century, man has fished so skilfully, so intensively, so unrelentingly, that he has begun to change the pattern of life in the sea.
some kinds of fish have been forced to change their habits, others have been driven close to the edge of extinction.
and this little port in newfoundland, close to what was once the richest of all seas, is now bringing in fewer and fewer catches, and modern fish-processing plants like that one are standing for much of the time, idle.
so man has changed the sea, just as he's changed almost every environment in the world.
so perhaps it is not surprising that still most of this vast domain is still unexplored.
and in the geographical sense, the surface of the sea, the floor of the sea, is even more varied than the surface of the land.
the bottom of this immense valley seven miles below the surface is grooved by deep faults.
if mount everest rose from the bottom, its summit would still be beneath 7,000 feet of water.
down at the very bottom, the water pressure is some seven tons per square inch, the temperature is close to freezing, and it's pitch-dark, for it is far beyond the reach of sunlight.
as we climb up out of the trench, we move onto a plain covered with reddish mud.
a few hills rise from it, but there are still some 20,000 feet of water above us.
travel eastwards over these plains for 1,000 miles, and we reach a range of fantastic mountains.
their summits are covered by a white deposit like snow, composed of the limestone skeletons of microscopic organisms that have drifted down from the surface.
before they reach the lower slopes, the water pressure becomes so great they dissolve.
currents sweeping up from the south pile the sand into dunes 150 feet high which advance slowly across the sea floor as dunes do in a desert on land.
in places, the sand is littered with metallic lumps, some as big as cannon balls:
manganese that under these pressures has precipitated out from the salty water.
after a journey of 4,000 miles, we reach the biggest mountains of all.
these are the flanks of the great volcanic islands of hawaii.
their sides are steeper than any mountain on land for they are never eroded by frost or by rivers armed with gravel.
they rise from the sea floor 15,000 feet to the surface and continue for an almost equal height above it, so they can truly be reckoned the highest mountains in the world.
as we climb up their sides towards the surface, we return once more to light and to abundant life.
life began in sunlit waters like these some 3,000 million years ago, and creatures very similar to those ancient primeval organisms still flourish in shallow seas all over the world.
feather stars like these waved their tentacles long before any fish appeared, at a time when the land was still bare of life of any kind.
even older, indeed among the first of all living things, microscopic plants encased in shells of limestone.
they use sunshine to build, from simple chemicals in the sea water, their own tissue.
the animals of the plankton, all those that can't photosynthesise, sweep up the tiny plants and other edible particle in many different ways.
this one extends a forest of long tentacles in which smaller organisms get entangled.
creatures from many families of animals have representatives in this community.
some are permanent members, some only temporary, joining it when they are young larvae and drifting great distances before they grow up, change shape and settle down to a more static life.
instead of moving with the current, you stay fixed to the rocks and allow the currents to bring food to you.
that is the technique used by anemones and many other creatures.
some crabs also rely on the currents to bring them meals, and pluck them from the water with tiny pincers.
but the biggest of all filter-feeders propel themselves gently through the surface waters.
the water is channelled into its mouth by the blades on the sides of its head, then passes through filters in the slits in the sides of its throat.
the basking shark gathers the same sort of food in a similar way.
idling through the water, it filters over 1,000 tons of water every hour.
and even bigger still, in fact, the biggest of all fish:
others pick off morsels that get stuck in its tiny teeth in a mouth six feet wide.
it's an astonishing proof of how sustaining and how abundant the plankton must be.
and indeed, when one looks at them, it is not so much their danger that comes into your mind as their extraordinary beauty.
they are so perfectly streamlined, every curve of their body, every curve of their fi precisely matching the shape that is needed to glide through the water with the least struggle
but soon after they appeared, another group of fish established itself.
these have skeletons of bone, not gristle as the sharks have, and they have two swimming aids that the sharks lack:
swim bladders that give them buoyancy and paired fins that can twist in all directions and so give them great manoeuvrability in the water.
these bony fish are the ones which today dominate the seas.
dolphins and killer whales are descended from four-footed, land-living, air-breathing mammals that were flesh-eaters.
in the sea, they lost their limbs but not their taste for meat, nor their teeth.
indeed, one of the family that lives only in the ice-strewn waters of the arctic has grown one of its teeth to an extraordinary length.
these are narwhals, and they are all males, for only the male produces the tusk, up to nine feet long.
no one knows for certain what purpose the tusk serves, but it seems likely that it is used in courtship.
that is confirmed by the fact that very rarely indeed males have been glimpsed, as here, fencing with one another.
the best view that most of us can get for most of the time of most kinds of whales is a brief glimpse as the animal comes to the surface to snatch a breath, but that's not the case with the beluga, these beautiful white whales.
up here in the canadian arctic, they come during those brief weeks when the ice goes away from these shores, and assemble in vast numbers in this bay.
maybe there is some kind of specially attractive food in these shallow waters, for they seem to stir up the gravelly bottom of the bay.
perhaps there is valuable food for youngsters or nursing mothers, for many that come are females with babies a few months old, swimming skilfully in their mother's slipstream.
whatever it is that they do here, they seem to be enjoying themselves hugely.
and they haven't lost their mammalian habit of communicating by sound.
so vocal are they that they are sometimes called sea canaries.
the most recent family to colonise the sea, also mammals, were descended from bear-like creatures.
the walrus and its cousin the seals are not so fully adapted to life in the sea as the whales, but they haven't been there so long.
they haven't lost their feet as the whales have, nor do they spend all their lives in the water.
so, in the 3,000 million years since living organisms first appeared in the sea, the oceans have acquired a population of immense diversity, from single-celled microscopic plants to advanced and complex highly intelligent mammals.
indeed, there are more different groups of animals living in the sea than there are on lan
some are soft and rubbery, others are hard and slightly flexible, like a horn but most are stony.
the organisms that build these structures, ton upon ton, occupy only the outer skin.
if the jungle is the place on land where there are the greatest number and the greatest variety of life, then this, the coral reef, is surely the jungle of the sea.
the number, the variety, the sheer beauty of all these myriad fish, corals and anemones, is quite breathtaking.
of course, the tiny anemone-like creatures that build these fans and fronds of coral are themselves animals.
but within their tissues, there are tiny granules which are algae, plants, and it's they that harness the sunshine and use it to build living tissue.
others pick off little organisms and particles with the utmost delicacy.
the tides, surging in and out of the lagoon, bring in regular supplies of fresh oxygenated water and fresh food.
angler fish sit in the current waiting patiently, like all fishermen, for whatever turns up.
even such specialised fish as these exist on the reef in several different versions.
and the angler, perhaps to prevent a second fish arriving before it has digested the first, changes colour so that the lure vanishes.
in the reef, there are many species with many ways of life.
often, they share the shells they have commandeered as a home with anemones.
the anemones benefit by picking up bits of the crab's meal and give the crab in return a certain protection with their stinging tentacles.
this crab actually uses a particular kind of anemone as a weapon, wearing one on each claw like boxing gloves.
this one tries to put on a sponge like an overcoat.
the crab gets the camouflage and the sponge may benefit from the crab's crumbs.
crabs and their relations, the lobsters and shrimps, are found from top to bottom of the reef.
big ones like this lobster prowl openly through the coral branches.
little ones like the mantis shrimp are rather more cautious and build themselves tunnels.
if the coral reef is the equivalent of the jungle, maybe these waving beds of kelp in the cold atlantic waters off the coast of norway are like the dark evergreen forests of the north, bitterly cold, dense and uniform, and swept by raging gales.
bleak though the kelp forest may seem, there are riches here, and elder duck know it.
they prefer to fish for mussels on an ebb tide when the water is low, but they can stay below water for a minute or more, and dive down to 50 feet below the surface.
the streaming current causes great problems to the fish of the kelp forest.
its young develop suckers at a very early age and sometimes fix themselves to their father, who ferries them off to deeper waters.
kelp grows in coastal waters all round the world, and in the seaweed forests of southern australia lives one of the most extravagantly camouflaged of all fish.

look, all i know is you're slaving away... in this grease trap, and you're not dancing.
you know, i still have franco's classes... and they're so important to me.
well, as long as you're standing there... you're wasting my time, and my time ain't cheap... so i suggest you clear out now.
if you want to take my class... your name goes on a waiting list.
step up to the front so all your friends can see
we're all backing you up 100 percent we know you practiced all week
treat you like a king in the heat of the night
romance to the moon if your timing is right get your back wet, all soaked in sweat
we're going to have a discussion now, but you're all welcome to stay.
and tracy knows where to reach you with tickets for our performance.
i used to trace these old dc comics, 'cause it was so boring.
that's where i figured out all the streaks and blurs and shit.
i'm gonna tell you what santa really put under my so-called tree
but in reality looked like nothing but a decorated pole to me
listen, bloat-o, with your big fat suit next time say no, don't send no substitute
because i asked you for a beat box and you know what i got?
'cause nobody gives a shit about a reindeer and hard times
you just jingle and jangle and hang out with the poor
if my son says he was dancing, that's what he was doing.
if you're gonna arrest people for dancing, maybe you're the one who needs advice... 'cause there are lots of worse things these kids could be doing.
sayin' one, two, three, four just let me know what you came here for
and just clap your hands, everybody and let me know that i'm not alone
a million-dollar gift only god would leave and yet you got killed for nothing at all
so after this, there'll be no more hard times no more bad times, and no more pain
no more chump change, none of that bull just movies, museums, and the hall of fame
so all you hip-hops, get on up and let's take it to the top where we belong
leeches and lices, and people got prices egomaniacs control the self-righteous
nothing is sacred, and nothing is pure so the revelation of death is our cure
look, all i know is you're slaving away... in this grease trap, and you're not dancing.
you know, i still have franco's classes... and they're so important to me.
well, as long as you're standing there... you're wasting my time, and my time ain't cheap... so i suggest you clear out now.
if you want to take my class... your name goes on a waiting list.
i won't blame you if you don't show up... 'cause it's gonna be real messy.
oh, yeah... and bring your girlfriend the dancer... 'cause you're gonna need a shoulder to cry on.
he's got some really great connections... and he can get us the chance.
he's really a nice guy, and he's trying to help us out.
they're just like you... up there in your tights, being told what to do.
we don't care if we don't step on our right foot.
today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.
ramon is afraid that this could be taken in the wrong direction
i want to die because for me, life in this way...is not worthy
i can understand if other tetraplegic could feel offended when i say life like this is not worthy
look, we will win heaven, because we have spent our whole lives in hell
i tape this image so the judges or politicians or whoever has to decide understand better...
besides, i don't think i'd be willing to take on two children, i have enough with my nephew
i saw you on tv the other day hmmm...see, now we are getting closer
no, i came because i want to be your friend ramon
if you want to be my friend, rosa, you should start by respecting my will
although i know he won't because...the last time we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms
but for what it's worth, i'd like to tell him i'm sorry
but then comes the next stroke and the next, and the next and no one can tell you when or how they are going to be
no one can tell what is going to be left of you if anything at all
when gené told me that a lawyer wanted my case there was something that influenced my decision and it was the fact that the lawyer suffered a degenerative disease
i thought that only someone in that condition could really understand mine
with the hope that you will come soon and give me a hand
for now, my nephew javi is helping me by copying them on his computer
but the doctors have limited me the use of the computer and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs
they assure me that i'll be able to walk again but they say that i shouldn't continue with your case
i reach the sea and keep flying until i can only see that endless line of water
and think, foolish me, that if you do the same from corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again
and we end up finding each other in some part of the planet
i identify with you when you mention the lack of freedom and privacy
i try to bear with it, mainly for my husband that takes care of me with much dedication
but at the same time, i refuse to fall into this inertia where i just can be grateful for what is given because i have no other choice but to accept it
i wish i'll be able to see you in a couple of months
and i keep my promise of helping you with the book
and now it is me the one that has to tell him
the demand of the tetraplegic ramon sampedro requesting the euthanasia was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form
the sentence says that the judicial process should have been started in corunna where he resides, and not in barcelona
many voices have been raised due to this case among them is priest's francisco de galdar tetraplegic like ramon
couldn't it be possible that what ramon is asking is for more love?
i would really like to talk to him and convince him that there are many reasons to keep on living
if i called you that then, now i call you strong and brave and kind and beautiful.
and i call an imbecile to those who can't see it
why does the church keep with such passion that posture of terror of death?
because it knows that it would lose a great amount of its customers if people lose their fear to the great beyond
now you tell him that moral issues are not resolved through polls
because most of the german people was also in favor of hitler
don't you think that what's really demagogic is to say "death with dignity"
why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and call things by its name, with all its rawness
ramon, do you feel alone because you are the only spanish to have requested euthanasia?
yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
when you need the help of someone else to die with dignity, then the state interferes with the freedom of the people and tells them that the life they are living is not theirs, that they can't make decisions about it
this, your honor, can only be done based on metaphysical beliefs, or religious
that you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do, if the judges decided against you
yes, rosa, but i already asked you to forgive me, right?
or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills like they used to do at the hospital?
- no one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
for me what counts is what people have in their heads, and you have nothing in yours
i will not be a slave of your ignorance anymore or of your prude conscience
you should know that the processes conducting to my death has been carefully divided in small actions that do not constitute a crime by themselves and have been executed by several friendly hands if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers
i would suggest that you cut their hands, because that is all that they contributed
i believe that living is a right not an obligation, as has been in my case forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years, 4 months and some days
after all this time i make a balance of the road traveled and i can't account for the happiness
only the time that passed against my will, during most of my life will be my ally from now on
only time and the evolution of consciences will decide one day if my request was reasonable or not.
and in the weightlessness of the bottom where dreams come true two wills come together to make a wish come true
your look and my look like an echo repeating, without words
in fact, i suspect it's not even going to be a contest.
no, i... i think that i can guarantee you that we're going to win.
if you want to take my class... your name goes on a waiting list.
if you want to talk to him, you talk to me.
i won't blame you if you don't show up... 'cause it's gonna be real messy.
oh, yeah... and bring your girlfriend the dancer... 'cause you're gonna need a shoulder to cry on.
i need longer legs, shorter legs, punk hair, no hair... i just need a whole new life.
well, if you need a whole new life, i know just the place.
it's not just kids dancing on a street corner for a nickel.
they put more heart and soul into their work... than any dancer i know.
he's got some really great connections... and he can get us the chance.
he's really a nice guy, and he's trying to help us out.
they're just like you-- up there in your tights, being told what to do.
we don't care if we don't step on our right foot.
this audition is for the biggest dance production in years... and there's no way they'll even consider you guys.
it just seems that franco has a lot more pull than i thought.

look, all i know is you're slaving away... in this grease trap, and you're not dancing.
you know, i still have franco's classes... and they're so important to me.
well, as long as you're standing there... you're wasting my time, and my time ain't cheap... so i suggest you clear out now.
if you want to take my class... your name goes on a waiting list.
i won't blame you if you don't show up... 'cause it's gonna be real messy.
oh, yeah... and bring your girlfriend the dancer... 'cause you're gonna need a shoulder to cry on.
he's got some really great connections... and he can get us the chance.
he's really a nice guy, and he's trying to help us out.
they're just like you... up there in your tights, being told what to do.
we don't care if we don't step on our right foot.
okay, roberto... would you, uh - would you send, uh -
call mr. stein at my publishers... to pick up that, uh, package that i gave you.
your honor... my client has been driven almost mad... because he has had to carry the most terrible secrets of all...
locked up inside his, uh, uh, breaking heart... and, uh, uh, beating mind.
now, you have read in the press... the reasons for the watergate affair.
today my client is going to reveal to you... the reasons behind the reasons.
instead, your honor, my client has had to suffer... lifelong personal punishment and, uh, torment... for what has been called, the, uh - [scoffs] good of the nation.
look, if the nation knew the real truth... why, i would be in the position of, uh, of de gaulle, for instance, because i -
"he awakens to a living nightmare of poverty, neglect and despair.
"for him, the american system is one that feeds his stomach... and starves his soul."
- tonight, ladies and gentlemen... he stands before you... nominated for president of the united states.
you can see why i believe deeply in the american dream.
it was nothing more than a convenient hook... upon which to hang my client's political body.
because before anybody in the world ever heard the word "watergate"... the nixon presidency was over.
ike had just dropped me like a, uh - that bastard son of a -
well, when the cameras came on, i was going to drop out of the race.
as a matter of fact, i had promised, uh, uh, uh, pat... that i was going to, uh -
pat, of course, is my, uh - [stammers] out of the race
as a matter of fact, i wrote it - well, i wrote it down.
and i, uh, i carried it around in my, uh, uh, uh, uh -
it was me who was really hamlet, and ike was the king!
i never even got to see all the rooms in the white house... untiljohnson became president.
resolved - resolved to win, period... because that is the american system.
you take either side - it doesn't even matter which one - and you go on the attack!
they told him, "there is no case against the president, period."
your honor, the impeachment process itself was simply the grandest cover-up of all.
the founding fathers caused the white house... to be built in a swamp in the first place, for christ's sake... and congress up on a goddamn hill!
the founding fathers were nothing more than a bunch of snotty english shits... who never trusted any elected president to begin with!
and then they listed the name of a, uh, committee... to contact.
so, well, l-i took some of my, uh, poker winnings and i flew out there... in my uniform, of course.
your honor, this young man, richard nixon... this boy from a poor family... a boy who never had a break, who never had a chance... he was just overwhelmed by these big men... on the committee of 100... because they showed him a vision... of the riches and power of this world... and he drank their words and their visions, he -
[giggling] he had a little sip of their whiskey too... this poor boy who couldn't drink.
well, you know, the big german shepherd dogs... they're howling all night, you know.
but it was way off, you know, in the, uh, in -
[stammering] your honor, i forgot to tell you about the whores.
now, look, these guys were not homos from westchester county or cambridge.
you know, this is not old money or "the better sort."
i mean, these guys were armenians and, uh, italians and irish.
well, because murray, he was the link to lansky... and ratner and, uh - and the mob and -
you see, what hiss and the kennedys, all those east coast pricks, never understood was... that i would be a winner because i was a loser.
but, see... goddamn c.i.a., they went and they told kennedy all about the - the track-two operation against castro... and then jack, he out-red-baited me by attacking castro... and that made me look soft.
i mean, they promised me that the invasion would - the "executive action" against castro... would take place before the election.
when eisenhower refused to meet with castro... when he came to this country before the election -
and then that son of a bitch castro... he went up there and he had lunch with the goddamn colored waiters... at the theresa hotel in harlem!
and then haldeman, he goes and calls martin luther king a nigger... on the teleph - [chuckles]
but the worst was, three days before the election... when i slipped and called for peace and surrender.
then my brother don's kid, he goes and runs off and joins... some dirty hippie commune.
then they have to get some investigator to wade through all that crap... drag him back by the ears, put him to work for-
i could have called on my political base like de gaulle.
i could have called out main street against wall street, but i didn't.
i did it for the little people, for maggie and jiggs... for my people... for all the failed ranchers and farmers - people just like my old man.
i did it for the goddamn cab drivers and the fuckin' grocery store clerks... and the cockroach capitalists and the traveling salesmen, i -
i used to love to sit in the lincoln study... with the fireplace going... and the air conditioning on.
i used to love to sit in there and think about...
i used to love to sit topside on the fantail of the sequoia.
down the potomac, back to the navy yard... sipping drinks with a friend... and talking geopolitics.
the colored found that out when it was too late, that it was the north, not the south -
they'll come after you the way they came after me, and that is what made me: their fear!
and remember this, roberto - i knew who i was: nobody.
all they knew was that they didn't want to be me.
it was the, um, committee of 100... and the china plan people that i, uh - l-i couldn't handle.
so that is the reason, your honor, that we had to invent deep throat... and use watergate to, uh... get out with a pardon... so that, uh -
deep throat is going to strike again, and you are going to get yours.
i made you, and i can break you... you slimy, two-faced... brown-nosed, ass-licking... kraut son of a bitch!
they gave that whoremaster the nobel prize... and me they called freak... madman, juke, callicak- [stammers]
look, they even said... that i stole the goddamn silverware out of the white house, for christ's sake!
the mad bomber theory was henry's idea in the first place... to scare the north vietnamese!
and that fat fuck... is walking around telling everybody that i'm nuts?
see, the hiss case was the key... because the hiss case proved that i could manage a crisis, that i could save the -
well, shit, i could save the committee if i - i could save the goddamn country-
your honor, i would like to talk for a minute, if i may... about the hiss case.
if alger hiss could look down his ivy league snoot... at the house un-american activities committee and get away with it... then huac was through, the committee was through -
because i told you about my mother... and the quakers and everything.
look, whittaker, i'm going to come over to see you -
the, uh, strain - it was because of the strain... that i had to, uh, get away.
so i went down to, uh, bebe's boat in key biscayne... and we talked about it down there, bebe and i... and that is where we decided that i should go after helen gahagan douglas... in the 1950 senate campaign in california.
but, see, chotiner and the committee... they already had the money coming in from florida and everywhere.
it's those same jackasses from usc - the usc rat-fuckers or whatever the hell they called themselves.
then they paid those students to throw the rotten eggs at her... and to plant the rumors that she was a red... to say that she wore pink panties -
oh, yes, and that her husband's real name was hesselstein or braun or-
* the reds, the reds, the reds, the reds the reds, the reds, the reds, the reds *
that's what the country believed then, and i believed it too.
there i am down in the sewer waiting for my turn... just like every-fucking-body else!
a slimy slug crawling toward the white house... down there in the swamp... where the goddamn founding fathers put the white house in the first fucking place.
and, you see, that's why they hated me - because they hate the ordinary american who lives down there... in the armpit of this country between new york and l.a.
and the tapes are just one more goddamn set of lies!
i had to do all the dirty work right from the beginning.
you sat up there and you said, "can't somebody do something about that castro fella?"
then i answered that goddamn ad... in that goddamn paper for congressman.
see, from that point on i couldn't even - i was not even able
searchlights of truth burning into each crisis in my miserable life.!
mother, do you remember when harold lay dying in arizona... and we fought together, you and i?
remember, you were by his bedside and i was out barking-arf, arf, arf, arf!
i was trying to bring in a little money to help out.
i mean, after the biggest landslide in american history in 1972.
and patman, he's saying, "why is all this money still coming in to the committee?"
and especially he wants to know, your honor... why all that money is coming in from, uh-from asia.
[stammering] that money was to be used, your honor... to re-elect nixon in '76.
you know, "stick with dick in '76" and all that shit, for christ's -
all right, the saigon government is sending back millions of dollars.
even i don't know what the hell he's talking about, for christ's sake.
okay, the saigon government is kicking back millions of dollars in u.s. aid.
- he carried the ball for me on the tapes... and he cut henry off at the pass in paris -
then thatjudas son of a bitch turned out to be a rockefeller traitor all the goddamn time!
the rockefeller guys were screwing me from the rear... and the china committee big boys had me by the nuts up front.
look, i had to be very cautious... because hunt and liddy and krogh and caulfield -
and those bastards, they know where the bodies are buried, see.
so i couldn't just go running in there and do any goddamn thing i wa -
a fortune in blood to be used to purchase a third term for my client?
i mean, your honor, the country would have boiled over... because this blood bribery meant the death of thousands of american boys.
i mean, for christ's sake, who the hell wants to go down in history... as a traitor who took bribes to keep a fucking war going?
[stammers] you understand then... why i had to lead the press and the congress to the tip of the wrong iceberg?
they said, "let dick nixon do it," and i did it!
they said they wouldn't buy a used car from me... but they gave me the biggest vote in american history.
now, you have read in the press... the reasons for the watergate affair.
today my client is going to reveal to you... the reasons behind the reasons.
he was a kind of a ione wolf too, you know.
as a matter of fact, he said to me once, he said...
then i came along later in the summer too... to work as a barker at the carnival there... at the, uh, uh, slippery gulch rodeo.
then, years later, that son of a bitch wrote that i was... a shill for a crooked card game!
but he is helped on his journey through life... by his father, by a gentle quaker mother... by a great football coach... courageous wife... and loyal children.
tonight, ladies and gentlemen... he stands before you... nominated for president of the united states.
your honor, the watergate was nothing more than a... misdemeanor copping a plea, a third-rate burglary.
it was nothing more than a convenient hook... upon which to hang my client's political body.
because before anybody in the world ever heard the word 'watergate'... the nixon presidency was over.
your honor, my client had faced, as you know... the acid test of six major crises.
well, when the cameras came on, i was going to... drop out of the race.
as a matter of fact, i had promised pat... that i was going to...
they told him, 'there is no case against the president, period.'
your honor, the impeachment process itself was... simply the grandest cover-up of all.
the founding fathers caused the white house... to be built in a swamp in the first place, for christ's sake... and congress up on a goddamn hill!
the founding fathers were nothing more than... a bunch of snotty english shits... who never trusted any elected president to begin with!
and then they listed the name of a committee... to contact.
so, well, l-i took some of my poker winnings and i... flew out there in my uniform, of course.
your honor, this young man, richard nixon... this boy from a poor family... a boy who never had a break, who never had a chance... he was just overwhelmed by these big men... on the committee of 100... because they showed him a vision... of the riches and power of this world... and he drank their words and their visions, he...
he had a little sip of their whiskey too... this poor boy who couldn't drink.
but then, when we all went to new york to... interview for some big time law firms...
i was a little out of my league, and i knew that.
but, see... goddamn c.i.a., they went and they told kennedy all about the... the track-two operation against castro... and then jack, he out-red-baited me by attacking castro... and that made me look soft.
i mean, they promised me that the invasion would... the 'executive action' against castro... would take place before the election.
when eisenhower refused to meet with castro... when he came to this country before the election...
and then that son of a bitch castro... he went up there and he had lunch with the goddamn... colored waiters... at the theresa hotel in harlem!
-then i got rattled... when the press got a hold of that howard hughes...
ioan to my brother... for that wacko scheme of his... to sell nixon burgers!
and then haldeman, he goes and calls martin luther king... a nigger on the teleph...
but the worst was, three days before the election... when i slipped and called for peace and surrender.
did you know that i had to put all my brothers under surveillance... because of that...
then my brother don's kid, he goes and runs off and joins... some dirty hippie commune.
i could have called on my political base like de gaulle.
i could have called out main street against wall street, but i didn't.
i did it for the little people, for maggie and jiggs... for my people for all... the failed ranchers and farmers people just like my old man.
i did it for the goddamn cab drivers and the fuckin'... grocery store clerks... and the cockroach capitalists and the traveling salesmen, i...
the colored found that out when it was too late... that it was the north, not the south...
they'll come after you the way they came after me, and that... is what made me:
well, the committee of 100 would not touch any... of them with a ten-foot pole.
but when it comes time to hide the bodies in the closet... oh, yeah, then they pick up the phone and they call chotiner.
'the two boys that you left with me... 'are very bad to me.
'their dog jim... 'is very old... 'and he will never talk or play with me.
deep throat is going to strike again... and you are going to get yours.
i made you, and i can break you... you slimy, two-faced... brown-nosed, ass-licking... kraut son of a bitch!
look, they even said... that i stole the goddamn silverware out of the white house... for christ's sake!
the mad bomber theory was henry's idea in the first place... to scare the north vietnamese!
see, the hiss case was the key... because the hiss case proved that i could manage a crisis... that i could save the...
well, shit, i could save the committee if l-i could... save the goddamn country...
your honor, i would like to talk for a minute, if i may... about the hiss case.
if alger hiss could look down his ivy league snoot... at the house un-american activities committee and get away with it... then huac was through, the committee was through...
i have ten days to prove that alger hiss is a high...
communist agent... in our state department... or else everybody is going to say that we've been... made into a laughingstock... by a clever psychopath named whittaker chambers... who has set the committee up to...
it was because of the strain... that i had to get away.
so i went down to bebe's boat in key biscayne... and we talked about it down there, bebe and i... and that is where we decided that i should go after...
but, see, chotiner and the committee... they already had the money coming in from florida and everywhere.
it's those same jackasses from usc... the usc rat-fuckers or whatever the hell they called themselves.
the reds, the reds, the reds, the reds the reds... the reds, the reds, the reds.
that's what the country believed then, and i believed it too.
the whole goddamn public mind is one great big... fat 'expletive deleted'... as far as the eastern establishment is concerned.
and, you see, that's why they hated me... because they hate the ordinary american... who lives down there in... the armpit of this country between new york and l.a.
i had to do all the dirty work... right from the beginning.
you sat up there and you said, 'can't somebody do... something about that castro fella?
'the great free markets of the pacific rim... 'are the american destiny.
'dick, you are going to be president of... the united states.
he said something in yiddish, and all those jerks... from miami laughed.
oh, then haldeman's father the old man... he whispered in my ear...
mother, do you remember when harold lay dying in arizona... and we fought together, you and i?
remember, you were by his bedside and i was... out barking-arf!
i mean, your honor, that money... was flooding into the committee to re-elect the president... after the president had already been re-elected... for christ's sake!
i mean, after the biggest landslide in american history in 1972.
and especially he wants to know, your honor... why all that money is coming in from-from asia.
that money was to be used, your honor... to re-elect nixon in '76.
you know, 'stick with dick in '76' and all that... shit, for christ's...
all right, the saigon government is sending back... millions of dollars.
even i don't know what the hell he's talking about... for christ's sake.
okay, the saigon government is kicking back... millions of dollars in u.s. aid.
i mean, millions for the bohemian grove guys... and billions for the mob... because of the... because of the... heroin.
your honor... ladies and gentlemen of the american jury... your hour has come.
the rockefeller guys were screwing me from the rear... and the china committee big boys had me by the nuts up front.
look, i had to be very cautious... because hunt and liddy and krogh and caulfield...
a fortune in blood to be used to purchase a... third term for my client?
i mean, your honor, the country would have boiled over... because this blood bribery meant the death of... thousands of american boys.
i mean, for christ's sake, who the hell wants to go down in history... as a traitor who took bribes to keep a fucking war going?
you understand then... why i had to lead the press and the congress to the... tip of the wrong iceberg?

the fat controller leaned out of the window to wave at edward and henry but the train was going so fast, his hat blew off and a goat ate it!
they never stopped till they came to the station at the end of the line.
knight rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
hey, as far as i'm concerned, this is all safety experts' hype.
i've been racing for five years without a bad spill, and all i need is my trusted helmet.
i've programmed kitt with details of the race and its participants.
so you can review everything on your way to the oakside racecourse.
i know the proceeds are going to charity here, but how did the foundation get involved in a tough sport like motorcycle racing?
well, you may not believe this, but devon happens to be quite a fan.
now, several of the racers from last june are again competing in this year's race.
i want you to find out if there's a murderer among them, michael.
come on, get up, or do i have to pull you up?
you're gonna have to pull me up, partner because, you see, i can't make it alone.
sure, if i want to take two years out of my life.
you stay away from racing that long, you might as well hang it up.
next thing i knew, he'd entered this race, like he was driven by speed demons.
you don't know how scared i was that something would happen to him again.
then you try and tell me that kelly's really the victim.
now you try and knock him out of the race yourself.
i'm larry huffman, we're expecting some exciting racing this afternoon with top riders like kelly travis, lee carstairs, and wade fontaine all here today.
and they are ready to go for the champagne, glory, and gold.
the top riders from across the country gathered here on a beautiful afternoon.
the temperature in the 80s, we've got a fast track, and we are set for some very exciting racing.
yes, and roger will be giving you a blow-by-blow while i race myself over to the finish line to give the lucky first-placer a great big victory kiss.
uh, no, darlena, i'm scheduled to be at the finish line.
out in front, down the long straightaway is kelly travis, number 25.
running in second spot, carstairs, as they fly over the giant jump, catapulting themselves into the stratosphere.
michael, i've been watching the race and have come to the conclusion that there's very little difference between motorcyclists and lemmings jumping off cliffs.
right now, i need your attention on something a little less hairy.
look, this is my show, buster, so don't tell me what to do.
i'm gonna go right down here on the line, so that i can be the first to see the winner.
too bad kelly had to forfeit his win because he had help.
well, i think he won far more than just a race yesterday.
yeah, i guess our little last minute entry didn't hurt too much.
no, as a matter of fact, i've had dozens of calls from promoters begging for kitt's services.
(male narrator) knight rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the iaw.
and what do you think i am, some kind of doctor?
there's no way, man, i'm not moving from here until the heat settles.
after all the trouble we went through to catch our little prize here.
it'd be a shame if julio didn't get to see it.
it seems there's an electrical storm between here and cedar city.
of course, it is possible that they could walk in here any minute.
i think dex prefers children at home, in bed and out of sight by 8.
dex is the one who prefers to be in bed by 8.
that ahmed would have signed a death-bed confession without even knowing about it.
"l, rashid ahmed, have falsely accused blake carrington of using his purchases of the south china sea oil leases as a cover-up for a munitions and arms deal.
well, like the rest of her children, you're going to have to learn to love alexis on her terms.
she's there when you need her, and that means a lot.
there was no ski instructor and you damn well know it.
within days of your arrival in switzerland, you went to a clinic where your pregnancy was confirmed.
mommy, i'm trying to please you, but i don't know what you want.
yesterday you told me to find something to do here in denver.
and today i'm suggesting that you return to the sorbonne and continue your education.
if you don't want to go to paris, then go to london.
as of 10:00 this evening, a record 18 inches of snow has fallen in less than seven hours.
the temperature is 15 degrees with a wind chill factor of minus ten degrees.
you're asking us to believe that you charmed a man like ahmed into signing this confession?
that's an honest question, mr. wales, and i'll give you and the world finance magazine an honest answer.
in your hands, you're holding a copy of the report prepared independently by the turkish authorities after a thorough investigation into rashid ahmed's death.
that report states that mr. ahmed's death was the result of an act of personal vengeance.
i would like to emphasise that the presence of my son and miss deveraux in istanbul at the time of mr. ahmed's death was strictly coincidental.
anticipating your questions, we chose to be as open and as honest as we could.
but when he got to the monastery to get fallon, he was alone.
i told you going to seattle would be a waste of time.
what strikes me most, miss olive, is that the human race has just got to bear its troubles.
why, that's what men say to keep women in the position they have made for them.
when i look at the world and at the state that men have brought it to,
i confess, i say to myself, "well, if women had fixed it this way,
there is a brutal element in the world which tramples down the feeble and treads down the weak.
i stand in a place of peace and beauty, and i look into a wilderness of poverty and ignorance and misery.
they are in my ears in the stillness of the night, and before my face in the visions of the darkness.
let us remember in our trials and discouragements, that if our lives are true, we walk with angels.
if we trust one another, if we are true and gentle and kind, those regal ideas that struggle for liberty will come forth and spread their wings to soar high.
you speak well, and no wonder, for you speak in a great cause.
"one of a race whose inheritance has been outrage and wrong.
"most of my life had been spent in battling those wrongs.
"and let you have a masculine world all to yourselves, and see how you like that!"'
what if i were to ask you to give up your parents, everything...
if you ask me, i think she cares as much for the rights of women as she does for the panama canal.
the only right of a woman she wants is to be able to climb up on something where men can look at her.
there are just so many who've fallen dead for want of it.
but miss verena ought to walk right up to the top.
she raises her voice a good deal in places around, like framingham and billerica.
it's as if she were gathering strength just to break over boston like a wave.
olive had six wonderful women staying in the house, two in a room.
in the evenings, we sat in the open windows and we talked.
night and day, i feel it here... as one feels a stain upon one's honor.
i know how it is for you, how exposed to men you are.
it is the greatest pleasure and privilege for me to welcome miss verena tarrant on her first appearance in new york.
some have called her a great prophetess, some a poetess, some a seer.
in the name of freedom, i ask you one simple question:
do you think any good can come to a society where women are treated as slaves?
just between you and me, young mr. burrage is in very thick with verena.
verena goes around lecturing how no one should ever get married.
but i think, in this case, she's beginning to change her mind.
but first they'll have to deal with olive, because she has not changed her mind about marriage.
let us be sea captains and see how we prove ourselves.
the especial genius of women, i believe to be intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency, electrical in movement.
we require the lid to be taken off the box in which we have been kept for centuries.
you say it is a very nice, comfortable, cozy box... with nice glass sides so that we can see out.
she is sure that i'm going to convert you, and that you're going to become a champion.
and that when you get to the top, it will all have been because of me.
well, it seems to me more decent to go straight to you for the information i intend to get.
if you won't tell me where you're staying, perhaps you'll ask miss tarrant herself to do so.
i need hardly say that whatever means we have are at the disposal of your movement.
you think i don't want everything we poor women can get?
and how can i be sure that afterwards you would still care so much about the question that has all our thoughts, hers and mine?
you think we're feigning interest only to get hold of her.
i dare say you don't like the idea of her marrying at all.
it would break up a friendship that has so much interest for you.
my plan is to keep you at home and have a good time with you there.
you seem to think that i control verena's actions and her desires, and that i'm jealous of any other relations she may possibly form.
i can only say your attitude illustrates the way that relations between women are still misunderstood and misinterpreted.
it is these attitudes we want to fight, with all our strength and all our life,
my son is gentle, he's good-natured, and he believes in your ideas.
miss tarrant would be, from every point of view, safer with him than with others.
one editor sent me back a manuscript, said my ideas were 300 years out of date.
but, doubtless some magazine of the 16th century would've been happy to print them.
and i hope you do succeed, even though all you want is to put us back.
you may denounce me by name if you like, only don't say anything about olive chancellor.
she's a fighting woman and she's not given me one inch of odds.
can't i make you see how much more natural it is, not to say agreeable, to give yourself to a man instead of to a movement or some morbid old maid.
don't you understand, it's not that he loves you, but that he hates our cause.
he wants to prove a man only has to whistle for a woman, for you to come running.
i can't speak for miss birdseye, but i don't wonder, mr. ransom.
if i did, i'd never stop, this being the age of miracles.
you should hear them up there in the house, getting ready for verena's great appearance at the music hall.
the music hall is a pretty big building, but i guess it's not so big as miss chancellor's ideas.
you've come to hear not the voice of one individual, however sweet, however harmonious, but the cry of all women, past, present and future.
and like the great william lloyd garrison said in his fight against slavery,
i say we will be as harsh as truth, as uncompromising as justice.
on this subject, we will not think or speak or write with moderation.
why, that's what men say to keep women in the position they have made for them.
the position of women is nothing but to make fools of men.
when i look at the world and at the state that men have brought it to,
i confess, i say to myself, "well, if women had fixed it this way,
there is a brutal element in the world which tramples down the feeble and treads down the weak.
i stand in a place of peace and beauty, and i look into a wilderness of poverty and ignorance and misery.
they are in my ears in the stillness of the night, and before my face in the visions of the darkness.
let us remember in our trials and discouragements, that if our lives are true, we walk with angels.
if we trust one another, if we are true and gentle and kind, those regal ideas that struggle for liberty will come forth and spread their wings to soar high.
you speak well, and no wonder, for you speak in a great cause.
"i feel i am something of a novice upon this platform.
"one of a race whose inheritance has been outrage and wrong.
"most of my life had been spent in battling those wrongs.
"but i did not feel as keenly as others that i had these rights in common with other women. "
"'then i wish i were god that i might kill every woman from eve down
"and let you have a masculine world all to yourselves, and see how you like that!"'
i am the child of reason, and as such, pure, perfect and without flaw.
i am the child of reason, and as such, pure, perfect and without flaw.
there are just so many who've fallen dead for want of it.
but miss verena ought to walk right up to the top.
she raises her voice a good deal in places around, like framingham and billerica.
it's as if she were gathering strength just to break over boston like a wave.
i thought what she wanted was a different inequality, simply to turn out the men altogether.
now mind, if you don't like what's in here, it isn't my fault.
olive had six wonderful women staying in the house, two in a room.
in the evenings, we sat in the open windows and we talked.
night and day, i feel it here... as one feels a stain upon one's honor.
i know how it is for you, how exposed to men you are.
some have called her a great prophetess, some a poetess, some a seer.
but i will confine myself to introducing her to you only as a young woman with an extraordinary awareness of the great question pertaining to the equality of women.
in the name of freedom, i ask you one simple question:
do you think any good can come to a society where women are treated as slaves?
just between you and me, young mr. burrage is in very thick with verena.
verena goes around lecturing how no one should ever get married.
but i think, in this case, she's beginning to change her mind.
but first they'll have to deal with olive, because she has not changed her mind about marriage.
let us be sea captains and see how we prove ourselves.
the especial genius of women, i believe to be intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency, electrical in movement.
we require the lid to be taken off the box in which we have been kept for centuries.
you say it is a very nice, comfortable, cozy box... with nice glass sides so that we can see out.
you strike me as men who are starving to death... while at home they have a cupboard full of bread and meat and wine.
or as blind, demented beings who let themselves be cast into a debtor's prison, while in their pockets they have the keys of vaults and treasure chests heaped up with gold and silver.
you think i don't want everything we poor women can get?
and how can i be sure that afterwards you would still care so much about the question that has all our thoughts, hers and mine?
it would break up a friendship that has so much interest for you.
then i'm to understand as your final word that you regard us as quite inferior?
you seem to think that i control verena's actions and her desires, and that i'm jealous of any other relations she may possibly form.
i can only say your attitude illustrates the way that relations between women are still misunderstood and misinterpreted.
my son is gentle, he's good-natured, and he believes in your ideas.
miss tarrant would be, from every point of view, safer with him than with others.
one editor sent me back a manuscript, said my ideas were 300 years out of date.
but, doubtless some magazine of the 16th century would've been happy to print them.
and i hope you do succeed, even though all you want is to put us back.
you may denounce me by name if you like, only don't say anything about olive chancellor.
don't you understand, it's not that he loves you, but that he hates our cause.
he wants to prove a man only has to whistle for a woman, for you to come running.
i can't speak for miss birdseye, but i don't wonder, mr. ransom.
if i did, i'd never stop, this being the age of miracles.
you should hear them up there in the house, getting ready for verena's great appearance at the music hall.
the music hall is a pretty big building, but i guess it's not so big as miss chancellor's ideas.
they think women the equal of men, and yet they're a lot more excited when a man joins than when a woman does.
what a pity it is that you can't say "damn. "
if you don't want me to appear in the musical, you'll have to kidnap me.
why sing in the music hall when you can sing for me?
i myself have not been lacking in a certain public notice.
and while we are waiting, you might be interested to hear the report...
you've come to hear not the voice of one individual, however sweet, however harmonious, but the cry of all women, past, present and future.
and like the great william lloyd garrison said in his fight against slavery,
i say we will be as harsh as truth, as uncompromising as justice.

with christmas only four months away, imagine that this desktop is a crowded shopping street on a busy saturday morning.
say, for instance, that this huge meringue filled with whipped cream is a young mother loaded with her groceries.
and perhaps this enormous, soggy, overripe tomato is a little girl, who doesn't realize what a dangerous place her ex{y:i}citing new world is.
and let's assume that this clingfilm parcel of mashed banana and jam is a deaf senior citizen

michael knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the iaw.
(interviewer) these are the weapons of a modern-day gladiator a participant in the most rugged sport.:
i've programmed kltt with details of the race and its participants.
so you can review everything on your way to the oakside racecourse.
i know the proceeds are going to charity here, but how did the foundation get involved in a tough sport like motorcycle racing?
well, you may not believe this, but devon happens to be quite a fan.
now, several of the racers from last june are again competing in this year's race.
i want you to find out if there's a murderer among them, michael.
i really don't care to dignify that with an answer, michael.
there's a guy walking on the track with the name fontaine on his jacket.
yeah, but kelly and danny duvall were supposed to be best friends.
hey, when you're competing, and you ride like kelly, anything goes.
come on, get up, or do i have to pull you up?
you're gonna have to pull me up, partner because, you see, i can't make it alone.
sure, if i want to take two years out of my life.
you stay away from racing that long, you might as well hang it up.
next thing i knew, he'd entered this race, like he was driven by speed demons.
you don't know how scared i was that something would happen to him again.
right before your accident last june, do you remember your front wheel jamming?
didn't anybody tell you it's bad luck to talk about accidents before a race?
and if kelly goes out on that racecourse, he's fair game.
and i'm not going to sit by and let somebody kill him.
hi, hotshot, come here, man, i've got a bone to pick with you.
oh, nothing like a good night's sleep to mellow you out, right?
i'm larry huffman, we're expecting some exciting racing this afternoon with top riders like kelly travis, lee carstairs, and wade fontaine all here today.
and they are ready to go for the champagne, glory, and gold.
the top riders from across the country gathered here on a beautiful afternoon.
the temperature in the 80s, we've got a fast track, and we are set for some very exciting racing.
yes, and roger will be giving you a blow-by-blow while i race myself over to the finish line to give the lucky first-placer a great big victory kiss.
uh, no, darlena, i'm scheduled to be at the finish line.
running in second spot, carstairs, as they fly over the giant jump, catapulting themselves into the stratosphere.
(kitt) michael, i've been watching the race and have come to the conclusion that there's very little difference between motorcyclists and iemmings jumping off cliffs.
bringing up the rear are mcnamer, hart and a big black car.
(kitt) michael, my sonar indicates that water is much deeper than it looks.
well, i think he won far more than just a race yesterday.
yeah, i guess our little last minute entry didn't hurt too much.
a great number of people, including his wife, are deeply concerned for his well-being.
there are governments who would use his knowledge for other purposes.
well, you've got lots to look forward to and a lot of time to look.
that's one of the reasons why i came with uncle klaus.
garthe hates me, but he's also very greedy for money and power.
whatever he's up to, it's much more than a personal vendetta.
the last time we met, i promised to take you to africa.
to the very prison in which i was forced to exist.
i love a man that can do two things at once.
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one that couldn't sleep tonight.
now all we need now is something that's conductive to electricity.
i think i will have the mattress wire for you in a moment.
it was my will that forced you to break me out of prison.
it was my brilliance that resurrected goliath, and it was my planning that captured michael knight.
in that case, you might as well know what i think about you and your destiny.
your destiny is to never have a woman who wants you for yourself.
to never have a man who respects you for what you are.
your destiny is death and if you don't believe me, just go take a good look in the mirror.
i remember when you were waiting outside my door, hungry for my touch, just because i looked like him.
why settle for a copy when you can have the original?
whoever killed your friend wasn't worried about your little narrow ass.
if they were, you'd be lyin' beside him in that meat wagon.
don't you think i know if i was some hot-shot from outta town that pulled inside here and you guys made a reservation mistake,
i'd be the first one to get a room, and i'd be upstairs relaxing right now!
well, excuse me, mr. foley, if i appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in detroit.
so, if you'll forgive me, i really must get back to work.
where the fuck do you guys get off arrestin' somebody for gettin' thrown out of a window?
we have six witnesses that say you broke in and started tearing' up the place, then jumped out the window!
but in detroit, cops are required to carry a firearm at all times.
well, if you wanna carry a gun, i suggest you go back there.
he says if you're out here investigating the tandino murder, you needn't bother coming back.
he tells me that if we inform him you are working on this case, he'll have you brought up on charges and fired.
axel, if it wasn't for victor maitland, i'd be waiting on tables!
it just so happens that the day mikey got killed, he showed up at my apartment with a bag of german bearer bonds.
oh, no, in beverly hills we just take whichever car's closest.
i remember you used to drive that crappy, blue chevy nova.
i'm gonna be in town until i find out who killed mikey.
and i'm very seriously considering going down to that warehouse where he worked and checkin' that place out.
yes, some people filter hot water through it and drink it.
yeah, i'm gonna take this home and filter hot water through it and drink it in the mornin'.
i suggest you call your wives, 'cause we're gonna be here all night.
we're gonna check the background of each and every crate in this section, starting with this one, right here!
now, these two officers were sitting outside wondering what i was doing.
i was in havin' a good time, i'm into things like that.
anyway, these guys waited outside, and the only reason that they came in was because they saw two suspicious-looking gentlemen, with bulges in their jackets, going into the place.
well, it turns out that these guys were gonna commit a robbery, sir.
and while we were there foley observed the two suspects casing the establishment.
and before we knew what was going on he'd already disarmed one of them.
it should be more natural, brother, it should flow out, like this:
"look man, i ain't fallin' for no banana in my tailpipe!"
tell victor that ramon, the fella he met about a week ago, tell him that ramon went to the clinic today and i found out that i have herpes symplex ten.
and i think victor should go check himself out with his physician to make sure everything is fine, before things start fallin' off on the man.
you know, victor, i know that you're into a lot of crooked shit.
and i have a pretty good idea that you had mikey killed.
ok, listen, everybody knows that victor maitland is a hot-shot art dealer, ok?
but i did some poking' around and art's not the only thing that he deals.
i went to his warehouse and i saw some guys unloading a crate that was filled with german bearer bonds.
now, my friend michael tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed in detroit.
maitland is paying someone so his guys can get the shipments out of customs before they get inspected.
maitland's guys get their hands on it, they take the drugs or the bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what's going on.
when you get there, you can give him his gun back.
the two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
you wouldn't, by any chance, know where foley's staying would you?
i have some information which just might be helpful for him.
axel, if this has anything to do with mikey, then i want to go check it out for myself.
i don't have time to stand here and argue with you.
ms. jeannette summers, the manager of mr. maitland's art gallery, accidentally discovered large quantities of a substance she suspected was cocaine in the art gallery's warehouse.
she immediately communicated her discovery to detective axel foley of the detroit police force.
detective foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint beverly hills-detroit investigation of narcotics trafficking.
detectives foley and rosewood, responding to ms. summers' report, proceeded to the warehouse, where rosewood did, in fact, discover approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
sergeant taggart here, was the first to arrive at the scene.
and having probable cause to believe a felony was in progress,
sergeant taggart joined rosewood, with detective foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
and in the course of defending ourselves, we shot several suspects, including mr. maitland.
it's understandable that you're distraught and looking for justice, not to mention revenge.
but isn't it just possible that you want it so much that you saw your killer in a man who bore a slight resemblance?
now i'll show you something that is going to blow your rocks off.
it's absolutely orgasmic and my most thing that i'm proud of.
the annihilator 2000 is a high-performance weapon that meets the demands of upper income urban survivalists.
the annihilator 2000 has the conveniences of a cellphone, fax and microwave oven.
the annihilator 2000 is constructed of aluminium alloy combined with polymer technology, totally resistant to corrosion.
a new generation in luxury personal weaponry, the annihilator 2000 is america's premier survival, home and travel security unit.
you know, a lot of nice things happen when you work at a nice place like wonder world, especially when your bosses are people like orrin sanderson and uncle dave thornton.
i don't think that uncle dave would mind if i said that this is the nicest thing yet.
and there's not a night that passes that i don't think about what the people of detroit owe ellis dewald.
and i'd like to say, when i see y'all give him this...
no, the barcode's going up, so it comes off this corner.
if it comes off this corner it should have ink on it.
when dewald took over he stuck me down here on what he calls park safety watch.
he thinks he took me out of the loop, but as long as i have a computer
god damn it, we spent a fucking year with our noses up dewald's ass!
we're this close to locking this up, and you piss all over us!
i figured you'd call uncle dave here, so we followed him.
i actually was a real cop once so i know how you assholes think, which is to say, slowly.
if i was some hotshot from out of town and you'd made a reservation mistake, i'd be the first to get a room.
i'm not some hotshot, i'm a small reporter from rolling stone, here to do an interview with michael jackson, that's gonna be in every major magazine.
i wanted to call it jackson is sitting on top of the world.
now i'll call it jackson can sit on top of the world
do you always treat visitors from out of town like this?
why didn't you say you were a police officer when you were arrested?
where do you get off arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
six witnesses say you started tearing up the place, then jumped out the window.
he says if you're here investigating the tandino murder, don't bother coming back.
if we inform him you are working on this case, he'll have you fired.
i didn't know whether he was trying to put the make on me.
i thought i'd take you there tonight, let him have a shot at you before i tore his head off.
tell him that ramon went to the clinic, and i found out that i have... herpes simplex 10.
i think victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.
i saw some guys in his warehouse unloading a crate of german bearer bonds.
michael tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
just because maitland invests in the same bonds doesn't mean he's a killer.
the man's not an investor, he's a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
the two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
but if you return to beverly hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.
detective foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint beverly hills-detroit investigation.
detectives foley and rosewood proceeded to the warehouse where rosewood discovered approximately 80 kilos of cocaine.
if i was some hotshot from out of town and you'd made a reservation mistake, i'd be the first to get a room.

guys, you didn't have to come to see me off, but i'm very moved.
bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
i'll never be able to repay you, but as a token of my appreciation, i want you to have this fine beverly palm robe.
each time you get in the shower, think about our friendship.

but not ln the beverly palm hotel cos there's no niggers allowed.
excuse me, mr foley, if i appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in detroit.
so, if you'll forgive me, i must get back to work.
why didn't you say you were a police officer when you were arrested?
where do you get off arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
he says if you're here investigating the tandino murder, don't bother coming back.
if we inform him you are working on this case, he'll have you fired.

it says here that by the time the average american is 50, he's got five pounds of undigested red meat in his bowels.
tell him that ramon went to the clinic, and i found out that i have... herpes simplex 10.

you know how much this little stunt is gonna cost this city?
you see i don't have any bit of it left, don't you!
where in the fuck did you get a truckload of cigarettes from anyway?
whoever killed your friend wasn't worried about your little narrow ass.
if they were, you'd be lyin' beside him in that meat wagon.
i'm a small reporter from rolling stone magazine, that's in town to do an exclusive interview with michael jackson that's gonna be picked up by every major magazine in the country!
i was gonna call the article "michael jackson ls sitting on top of the world,"
well, excuse me, mr. foley, if i appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in detroit.
so, if you'll forgive me, i really must get back to work.
do you wish to file charges against this officer for assault?
look, where i'm from, cops don't file charges against other cops.
well, if you wanna carry a gun, i suggest you go back there.
i really can't wait to get back there, if you wanna know the truth.
i went to the bathroom, the next thing i knew six guys threw me out a window.
inspector todd gave me a message for you, wanna hear it?
axel, if it wasn't for victor maitland, i'd be waiting on tables!
it just so happens that the day mikey got killed, he showed up at my apartment with a bag of german bearer bonds.
oh, no, in beverly hills we just take whichever car's closest.
i remember you used to drive that crappy, blue chevy nova.
no, i was just pokin' around i don't think he did nothin'.
axel, victor maitland is one of the top art dealers in the united states.
i do security checks all over the nation, and with the exception of cleveland, this place has the worst security in the nation!
i suggest you call your wives, 'cause we're gonna be here all night.
you know, i noticed you've been drinking a lot of coffee lately.
well, i think that's why you have a hard time relaxing.
i'm a fellow police officer, i know what it's like to be on a stakeout.
when i sent that food down, that was from the heart.
the only reason that they were at a strip bar was because they were tailing me and i went to this place.
now, these two officers were sitting outside wondering what i was doing.
i was in havin' a good time, i'm into things like that.
anyway, these guys waited outside, and the only reason that they came in was because they saw two suspicious-looking gentlemen, with bulges in their jackets, going into the place.
well, it turns out that these guys were gonna commit a robbery, sir.
these men watched them, waited for them to make their move and then they foiled the crime.
it should be more natural, brother, it should flow out, like this:
[forcefully] "look man, i ain't fallin' for no banana in my tailpipe!"
you know, victor, i know that you're into a lot of crooked shit.
and i have a pretty good idea that you had mikey killed.
but i did some poking' around and art's not the only thing that he deals.
i went to his warehouse and i saw some guys unloading a crate that was filled with german bearer bonds.
now, my friend michael tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed in detroit.
just because maitland chooses to invest in the same kind of bonds your friend had, doesn't necessarily mean he's a killer.
rosewood, take detective foley back to his hotel room, watch him pack, and escort him to the city limits.
when you get there, you can give him his gun back.
the two charges of disturbing the peace have been dropped against you.
but the chief says if you return to the city of beverly hills, the charges will be reinstated and you will be prosecuted to the limit of the law.
jenny, there's a gentleman in town from detroit who says he's a friend of michael tandino.
he came by the office yesterday and asked me all sorts of rather odd questions.
you wouldn't, by any chance, know where foley's staying would you?
i have some information which just might be helpful for him.
axel, if this has anything to do with mikey, then i want to go check it out for myself.
i don't have time to stand here and argue with you.
she immediately communicated her discovery to detective axel foley of the detroit police force.
detective foley was, at the time, cooperating in a joint beverly hills-detroit investigation of narcotics trafficking.
and having probable cause to believe a felony was in progress,
sergeant taggart joined rosewood, with detective foley present only as an observer, and proceeded to enter the grounds.
do you know how much this stunt of yours is going to cost this city?
cost isn't the issue. lt's my blatant disregard for proper procedure.
if i was some hotshot from out of town and you'd made a reservation mistake, i'd be the first to get a room.
i'm not some hotshot, i'm a small reporter from rolling stone, here to do an interview with michael jackson, that's gonna be in every major magazine.
i wanted to call it jackson ls sitting on top of the world.
now i'll call it jackson can sit on top of the world
do you always treat visitors from out of town like this?
why didn't you say you were a police officer when you were arrested?
where do you get off arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
six witnesses say you started tearing up the place, then jumped out the window.
i didn't know whether he was trying to put the make on me.
i thought i'd take you there tonight, let him have a shot at you before i tore his head off.
tell victor that ramon, the fella he met about a week ago...
tell him that ramon went to the clinic, and i found out that i have... herpes simplex 10.
and i have a pretty good idea that you had mikey killed.
and when i find out for sure, i'm going to fuck you up real bad.
i don't know from under what stone you crawled or where you get these ridiculous ideas about me, but it seems painfully obvious you haven't the slightest fucking idea who you're dealing with.
now, my advice to you is crawl back to your little stone in detroit before you get squashed, ok?
michael tandino had bonds like this on him, coincidentally, when he was killed.
just because maitland invests in the same bonds doesn't mean he's a killer.
maitland is paying to get his shipments out before they're inspected.
when his guys get it, they take the drugs or bonds out of the crates and they send it back before customs even knows what's going on.

but not ln the beverly palm hotel cos there's no niggers allowed.
excuse me, mr foley, if i appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in detroit.
so, if you'll forgive me, i must get back to work.
why didn't you say you were a police officer when you were arrested?
where do you get off arresting somebody for getting thrown out of a window?
he says if you're here investigating the tandino murder, don't bother coming back.
if we inform him you are working on this case, he'll have you fired.
we're gonna check the background of every crate, starting with this one.
it says here that by the time the average american is 50, he's got five pounds of undigested red meat in his bowels.
tell him that ramon went to the clinic, and i found out that i have... herpes simplex 10.
i think victor should check himself out with his physician before things start falling off on the man.

the man's not an investor, he's a smuggler, be it bonds, drugs or whatever.
guys, you didn't have to come to see me off, but i'm very moved.
bogomil ordered us to make sure you got out of town.
i'll never be able to repay you, but as a token of my appreciation, i want you to have this fine beverly palm robe.

que pasa to you, too, lupe, and i'd like to speak to somebody else.
you have reached the city of los angeles police emergency dispatch center.
they were so sure of it... that the commander of the squad was setting up parking lot surveillances.
when this guy hit a doctor's office right on wilshire boulevard... that two, not one, two teams of detectives were staking out... that threw this commander's thesis all to hell... and daddy was called in to save the day.
this is the one that ends with the queen who did full drag b and e, isn't it?
you little bugger, you knew all along, and you let me tell the story.
every neurotic who lies on a couch... and pays some asshole shrink good money to listen to her bullshit is a little girl.
every hooker out hustling her ass for a pimp... who winds up with a dyke, a habit, or wasted by some psychopath, is a little girl.
when they're being fed all the bullshit... about being entitled to happiness like it's a birthright.
that's what you don't understand... when to stop perpetrating the myths that ruin their lives.
you better hope the tits are there and they're real big ones.
in this world, she'll get a lot further with a pair of those.
sarah, the bad news is what's- his-name over there is expired.
the good news is... if you go in that ford and wait just a few minutes, i could drive you home.
lady, if it has nothing to do with this murder, i couldn't care less.
i deal quaaludes and i fuck selected older men who don't want to get involved.
i thought the papers said she was found dead, presumably... strangled by a burglar who panicked.
no, it was a story we gave out to the media to keep them disinterested.
look, there was nothing wrong or illegal in anything that we...
i don't give a shit if the two of you were fucking each other in a bathtub of cocaine.
well, we first met, of all places, in the public library.
i was returning some books, and she was taking out a whole stack, and...
i noticed they were all about sex... so i made a friendly comment and we got to talking and... she told me she was doing research for a book that she was writing.
i told her, being the voice of experience, i might be able to help.
see, i know some realtors who are pretty big heavyweights, and...
i score dope for them, and in exchange... they let me sublease these really primo pads while the owner's out of town.
i tell her, "you can't hassle people, paying that kind of bread. " right?
she comes up with the idea that she'll pay the couple's admission... and in exchange, she'll get to observe them and interview them.
i let her use my p.o. box, and that's how come the ad.
do you know anyone she was seeing she might have had a beef with?
know how long it would take me to get the case files on 31 unsolved female homicides?
it would take two fucking weeks... and i'd have to go through an inquisition to do it.
i'll come up with a common denominator, an m.o. or something.
anything to get gaffney and the fucking department behind this thing.
i know that you and i have not communicated for a long, long time.
i'm not sure that we can again, as our values are completely different.
you are a deeply disturbed person... and i cannot allow you to pass your disturbance on to penny.
i'm withholding our address in san francisco... until i am certain you will not try to do anything rash.
i say that because this case has been a testing of my own meager faith.
i've never, as you can probably well imagine... been much of a believer in god, sir... but the way i've been stumbling on certain kinds of evidence in this case... has me questioning my beliefs.
i go to church on sunday and to prayer meetings three times a week.
but when i put on my holster i put god out of my mind.
sir, in the course of my investigation into the niemeyer murder...
i've come across strong, instinctive evidence... that points to at least 16 other murders of young women... dating back 15 years.
the m.o. s are varied, but the victims were all of a certain physical type.
now, i've gotten the case files on these homicides, and... chronological consistencies and other factors... have convinced me that all 16 women were killed by the same man.
there are four dates of death on the exact same day.
june 10th, two in the early '70s and two in late '70s.
i want liaisons set up with every other department in the country.
i need permission to recruit uniformed officers... for the shit work and authority to grant... unlimited overtime, and most important, sir... we need a full-scale media blitz...
basically, i'm here to check on some homicides that took place a few years back.
you know, looking over the files, i noticed you came across... a stiff back in '78.
dave, can you get me a printout on all monikers with bird...
birdie, birdman, anything like that, bring it to me right away?
the police has a long history of trying to infiltrate causes they deem subversive.
my poetry has been published in feminist periodicals... that are highly critical of your department.
i don't care where you put it, as long as i get five men.
you better care, because that group in there is gonna be running the department.
and damn near half of them are born-agains... which means they will be gunning for guys like you.
every cunt hound, whoremonger, troublemaker and kamikaze... that doesn't go by the book is on their shit list.
give them a chance, they'll bounce your ass right off the force.
so don't tell me you don't care where i put it.
the mother superior was always trying to get me to show her my breasts.
i talked about it in hygiene class and attracted... a following of lonely, bookish girls.
once upon a time... there was a quiet, bookish girl who wrote poetry.
she didn't believe in god... or her parents, or the other girls that followed her.
and he continued to send her flowers periodically and anonymously... for many years.
they always seemed to arrive just when she needed them most.
for 15 years, this women has grown as a poet and a diarist... and she keeps his flowers pressed and dated in glass... in a treasure chest in her bedroom.
she speculated on her dream lover... but never tried to figure out who he really was.
she's taken his anonymous tribute to her heart... and decided to reciprocate his anonymity by keeping her diaries private forever.
the moral of the story is... there's a vast difference between being alone and being lonely.
you're on some kind of outlaw trip here, man, otherwise you'd have another cop... here with you.
i had you made the other day when you talked about those suicides.
you're nothing but a punk cop who likes to hassle other cops.
so you want to bust me for stealing that file folder, you bust away, homeboy... 'cause that's all you got on me.
to be honest with you, dutch, it'd be better if you came over here.
i just killed a cop and i think i'm gonna need your help in squaring this one.
from what i found at the mccan'thy place... and from what haines just confessed to...
i know they were both in the same class at webster high with the killer.
you have, believe me, no idea what this man is capable of.
all you know is what you've created in your own fantasy.
the killer knew who the rapists were... and he knew about your court of girlfriends deserting you after it happened.
he has been punishing the same innocent types of women ever since.
we got 30 names that according to the national computer... have never been fingerprinted.
of these, two are deceased, four have moved away... 16 are either blacks, chicanos or asians.
but since you seem to have a protective interest in this troublemaker... you'd better hear this, too.
hopkins, this the only time i'm actually pleased... you've shown up where you don't belong.
i'm not some hotshot, i'm a small reporter from rolling stone, here to do an interview with michael jackson, that's gonna be in every major magazine.
i wanted to call it jackson ls sitting on top of the world.
now i'll call it jackson can sit on top of the world
but not ln the beverly palm hotel cos there's no niggers allowed.
excuse me, mr foley, if i appear a little rude, but this sounds like something for the authorities in detroit.
so, if you'll forgive me, i must get back to work.

he's being pretty tight-lipped about how he's gonna set up shop.
we got a loose tail set up on brickell... about three blocks short, if he decides to make a move.
vice cop who deals with dopeheads, pimps and scum all day?
he'll be lucky if he gets a chance to see the boy once a year.
yeah, they're still working on the car and the hotel room.
they got fingerprints on the car, and the hotel room's a bust-out.
listen, there's some frozen perch in the hold when elvis gets hungry.
s.i.d. found this in the trunk of the shooter's car at the motel.
yeah, i'm gonna haul mendez in, and i'll get the location for calderone out of him.
i'll catch up with you in a couple of hours downtown.
you gonna be strollin' in the prelims... as an accessory to at least seven homicides.
you may not fry, but we are personally gonna see to it that you get a year and a day.
set you loose in a federal pen with a snitch jacket.
i'll take odds you don't make it past your first group therapy session.
once he completed his hit list, he was supposed to go to the conch bay lodge on st. andrews island... and check in under the name of miller... and just wait until he was contacted.
does calderone or any of his people know what the argentinean looks like?
let's hope no one on this island's ever seen the hit man.
yeah, well, let's take care of business quickly so we won't have to worry about it.
i don't know if i'm more startled at your presence... or that a turista would be acquainted with vacherrez.
yeah, he and colican happen to be two of my favorite caribbean artists.
l-i really would like to see some more of your works.
i'm flattered, but i only give them away to my friends.
authorities believe the killing to be linked with seven other contract murders... in the south florida area."
well, that oughta convince calderone's people... that the argentinean's hit list is complete.
"the house was built... on the highest part of the narrow tongue of land... between the harbor and the open seas.
it had lasted through three hurricanes... and was built solid as a ship. '"
"heidi was awakened early the next morning by a loud whistle.
the sun was shining through the round window into golden rays on her bed... and on the large heap of hay.
and as she opened her eyes, everything in the loft seemed gleaming with gold."
theresa, would you finish reading the story to the class, please?

i'll take odds you don't make it past your first group therapy session.
once he completed his hit list, he was supposed to go to the conch bay lodge on st. andrews island... and check in under the name of miller... and just wait until he was contacted.
does calderone or any of his people know what the argentinean looks like?
[ crockett ] let's hope no one on this island's ever seen the hit man.
yeah, well, let's take care of business quickly so we won't have to worry about it.
authorities believe the killing to be linked with seven other contract murders... in the south florida area."
well, that oughta convince calderone's people... that the argentinean's hit list is complete.

- if you want to settle with someone, then do so with mullah sharif ali.
- i promise to spare the mother, but only if he gives me the formula.
i'm now inputting all of the analytical soil data into the computer.
it compares these values with 100,000 others that we've previously saved and within seconds tells us where this earth originates.
this is the code number for the place of origin of this soil.
when i type this number in here now, the computer tells us exactly where the earth originates.
how did you actually know that i'd be whooshed down from up there?
i saw how dimitri slipped the crane operator a 1,000 mark bill.
don't you find these luxury cars very suspicious... for such a small farm?
this ibrahim said if he isn't called in exactly two hours, these people will do something to my mother.
- i promise to spare the mother, but only if he gives me the formula.
- you must consider, he has your father's death on his conscience.
our deal is broken, if the formula is not here by sunset.
otherwise, dimitri, you'll never again be warmed by the rays of the sun.
i want to prevent the soviet union from negotiating with ibrahim for this formula.
the kidnapping of your mother is just as intolerable for the soviet union.
comrade harvey, as a matter of fact i know who will investigate the clay.
it's the boss of your swiss friend giovanna castelli, whom you've paid $3,000 monthly for years.

airwolf a mach 1-plus attack helicopter with the most advanced weapons system in the air today.
it has been hidden somewhere in the western united states by its test pilot, stringfellow hawke.
hawke has promised to return airwolf only if we can find his brother sin jin, an mia in vietnam.
we suspect that archangel, deputy director of the agency that built airwolf, is secretly helping hawke in return for hawke's flying airwolf on missions of national concern.
stringfellow hawke is 34, a brilliant combat pilot and a recluse since his brother's disappearance.
his only friend is dominic santini, whose air service is the cover for their government work.
the russians, japanese, west germany, the french, and now, of course, the americans.
it's amazing how much they can love you when you have something they want.
it makes us no different than the south and butami's white killers.
yes, but i don't like the idea of leaving your guard behind.
it would be a little embarrassing if my wife arrived there before we did, don't you think?
for the last 3 years, general butami, you have dominated the office of president with your advice and your views.
did i tell you i managed to talk our eastern bloc friends into testing their new nerve gas?
it's being incorporated into the missile warheads even as we speak.
it was quite a shock when president ngomo stepped out of airwolf.

a bunch of anti-castro patriots got together, raised enough money to buy a couple of old-timers from a corrupt colonel.
you know that some of them have been down there for over 20 years?
we chose mr. santini because he could recognize them, regardless of their physical condition.
if mr. santini stole the money, he has condemned my son to die in cuba.
but to deal with sanchez, a ruthless killer, drug smuggler, god knows what else.
there isn't a man that works for him that doesn't have marks.
these men were being trained to combat communist insurgents in central american trouble spots.
well, i guess i'm just not sophisticated enough to judge the morality of using a bunch of pirates to fight uncle sam's battles.
and the white house doesn't know anything about this, i'll bet.
they shouldn't hold a grudge against the firm for more than a couple of budget years.
if that's the case, you'd better add three dots to your lower lip and go to work for sanchez.
if i've got to gamble on people, i'd just as soon it was you.
your friend and, uh, the rivera girl will soon be entering cuban air space.
i could let my colleague in cuba go through with his original plan, and you will never see them again.
of course, now that our heroes are home, things have changed.
absolutely, and we would like to work with you a lot more closely.
i have the honour to convey heartiest greetings to papa from the staff of the taganrog branch
and to present him with this small token of our affection.

it seemed to me that everyone have women of their lives, except me.
in the beginining we'll have review of the most important domestic and worlds events.
after 12 hours of demonstration in paris, that turned into real battles between students and the police, there is nothing but desolation.
i waited for my father to find out that i didn't pass the exam and then to kill me.
but instead of my punishment, in my life, so suddenly, walked in a new neighbour.
last night's incident in university campus in new belgrade it's not just incident anymore.
what it looked like just a rugged and hooligan ending of one well concieved night, today got a new form.
violent fightings that shook the university campus, were just a cause for a long student kolumn to start at noon their march from new belgrade to the very downtown.
crowd of the distrubed students demostrants in their march, police have been stopped on the road near building of federal chamber.
soon after that dramatic events took place, and there was clash between the police and students.
so far we know that there are injuries but there were no casualties.
you see, how can i say that, in that motherly curves,
perica was looking inproprietly, and he didn't say a word of the matter.
pentagon is saying that right now, over the north vietnam 8 american planes and 9 helicopters were destroyed.
but pentagon is keepenig the exact informations about how many pilots have been killed, saying just that,
382 pilots and 289 other crew members died over south and north vietnam.
saygon is saying that french goverment firmly refused wishes of south vietnam for restitution of diplomatic relations.

worker's collectives, social- politic organizations, students and citizens are honestly expressing their assent with tito's words and they're saying that, like they were solidary in accepting social and economy reforms, they are solidary now to conduct those reforms until their goals.
telegrams and letters also confirmed, that workers are eagerly waiting decisions from the head of the party promising that they will put maximum effort to to revive those ideas.
in the most telegrams, that tito received from the students, it's confirmed, that they are categorically insist on coherent realization of tito's conception of our way into the socialism.
foreign agencies mainly did properly informed their publicity about reactions of yugoslavian students on tito's speech.
while the situation still was tense last night, journalist of france press is saying, just one speech that tito made on tv, made all disappear.
almost all of students and professors of belgrade university unanimously agreed that after one week strike they will continue their work on monday or tuesday, because chief of state, very simply explained them, what he intends to do for them and country.
-and my back is hurting, my knees tremble, then bile, nerves?

comrade judge, should we bring that band for wellcoming of president?
here are the photos that reminding us on those days, when the struggle for the foundations of the first sky-scrapers began.
the most important thing at the start was to take the land from the river and swamp.
so that's in a few words, yesterday, today and tomorrow of a new belgrade.

it seems that three of our best agents are in a great deal of trouble right now because we lost a vital microdot.
and the only lead that we have to this vital microdot is with some damn purse snatcher named rollo.
he feels that will make her an even better leader for his collection.
what do we do about this guy who keeps showing up?
i will bet that rollo will be out by saturday night.
you know, i am gonna really enjoy doing a number on him.
the money raised by this charity will provide services which help ease many of these very same problems.
the use of a guide dog would have made this demonstration much easier for you all but their training is quite extensive and expensive.

our esteemed colleague, the late maitre charcot, insisted that a predisposition towards neurosis lay hidden in the womb of heredity.
but this evening i propose to argue that the decisive source lies in a no less mysterious but less remote territory and consists of real events in the patient's own life.
gentlemen, the predisposition to neurosis derives from sexual shock in childhood.
i, myself, have recently treated 17 cases whereby patient deciphering, the illness can be traced to a sexual assault in their earliest years.
in short, my isolation here is now complete and i must gather my forces for a long and solitary journey.
rather a pleasant prospect were it not for my current state of mind.
this last illness is dreadful to behold and is evoking unforeseen turmoil inside me.
it's as if i've used up all my ideas simply treading water.
it was the first time i'd heard my parents shouting at each other.
i'd come into their bedroom late at night and my father ordered me back to bed.
but i still feel as if i've been torn up by the roots.
it's the matter of the way my whole life's been going, not just the loss of papa.

i understand mahler's thinking of doing it for the directorship of the opera.
even my patients are nervous of it and self-analysis is hardly profitable.
i have a banker, a distinguished neurotic, who had fled from me just as he was about to re-enact the crucial scenes.
i have no authorities to guide me through this jungle, this..
.primeval jungle... in which, at first, as with the animals, all kinds of sexual zones, which are later prohibited, exert power.

you remember the business of my childhood dream about the black fellow i was chasing through a strange landscape and couldn't catch.
it came up when we were discussing how my mother had been unable to make up her mind about her second marriage.
the scales fell from my eyes when i turned in shame from my own image of the false messiah to the crucifixion and the grieving women.
the effigies that had pursued me since my arrival here began to speak.
had no one ever wondered why the infant jesus is depicted not as a baby but as a tiny man?
a supernatural man-child gazing up at the virgin from under fully-formed adult eyebrows?
the pagan antichrist in every child mocking the pious gaze of civilized humanity.
on the journey home from italy, it must have been in breslau,
it was the first time i'd seen such lamps and with old teresa's stories still vivid in my mind, they made me think of burning souls in hell.
it was on that journey, in fact, that i first saw my mother naked.
best of all, i've come to understand all the distressing feelings towards my father that burst on me when he died with all the force of the unthinkable.
and they were only a mask for a greater long-lost rivalry for possession of my mother.
for there, painted all over italy... ..was the most primitive, the most licentious of heathen images!
not only permitted but sanctified by the church and venerated by the faith.
i thought that perhaps since minna has never been to italy...
i haven't spoken to her yet but...if you can spare her.
now you just sign the visa and say goodbye, because i know what your orders are.
we're on our 5th bottle here and we have yet to have a legitimate toast.

it covers not only the poles, but caps great peaks on the equator.
water molecules, distilled from the sea by the sun's heat, condense in the sky.
as they fall through the air, they pack together into shapes that echo their six-fold symmetry and form infinitely varied crystals of ice.
they settle on the high mountains and compact into snow and ice that is, chemically, almost pure water, much purer than the sea from which it came.
on mount rainier in the united states, permanent snow begins at 7,000 feet.
you might think that this was one of the most inhospitable places on earth for life.
after all, no vegetation grows on these snowfields, so there can be no animals that feed on it, like marmots or mice or rabbits, and if there are no herbivores, there can't be any predators like hawks or weasels.
but in fact, there is a surprising amount of life here.
these, and the minerals dissolved in the melt water, are all the algae need to grow and reproduce.
the winter snow will bury them feet deep, but in spring, when the surface melts, they divide, develop tiny beating hairs and swim up towards the sunshine.
as they age and the minerals are used up, they change colour, forming huge smears of red in snowfields all over the world.
eventually, the snow algae produce spores as fine as dust and in that form they are blown from one snowfield to another.
but in late summer they fly up from the valleys up to these high peaks and here assemble in the rocks.
when the winter snows come, the ladybirds remain underneath the snow in the rocks, and then in the spring, as now, the snow melts and the sun warms the ladybirds, and they become active and fly off back to the valley to feed on aphids.
the ladybirds are only temporary residents of the mount rainier snowfields.
other insects manage, almost unbelievably, to live all their lives in this seemingly inhospitable snow.
some, like this primitive relation of the cockroach, a grylloblattid, have a body chemistry so well adjusted to low temperatures that if you pick them up, your hand's warmth will kill them.
permanent snow lies directly on bare rock, but lower down, where it comes and goes, there can be a little vegetation to be grazed.
there are sheep like these in mountains all through north america, asia and europe.
all carry big horns, and the senior males, in autumn, indulge in the most alarming courtship battles.
with few plants, grazing animals are rare, though there may be more than there appear to be at first sight.
these, in the himalayas, are blue sheep, so nimble and sure-footed they can reach almost any vegetation on the steep slopes.
but if these are rare, rarer still is the animal that preys on them, the snow leopard.
in summer it stays at between 12,000 and 15,000 feet, hunting small rodents and birds as well as mountain sheep.
it has a thick, woolly undercoat and cushions of hair under its paws which prevent it from sinking in the snow.
the mountains of africa, although so near the equator, are permanently snow-capped.
each has its own animals and plants specially adapted to life at low temperatures.
here, at about 13,000 feet, grow some most beautiful and dramatic plants:
every night the temperature falls so low that they're in danger of freezing solid.
and every day the sun beats down so strongly in this very thin air that it threatens to rob them of their moisture by evaporation.
but there's another kind of lobelia which deals with these two problems in a quite different way.
this one grows very tall and has extremely long leaves, each fringed with tiny hairs which act like an animal's fur, trapping air between them, insulating the stem from chills.
they also prevent the wind from robbing the plants of moisture.
each group of lobelias is owned by a pair of sunbirds which collect the insects the plants attract.
an occasional leopard may come up and hunt them, but apart from that, nothing.
and so they can come out during the few brief hours of sunshine and bask on the rocks without any fear, just as they're doing now.
but at these altitudes, there's only grass and lobelias, and they share it with the little furry-eared rat.
mount kenya, like its neighbours kilimanjaro and ruwenzori, is an isolated patch of snow and ice surrounded by the baking hot african plains.
but the great mountains of south america, like cotopaxi, 19,000 feet high, are very different.
these volcanoes, some active, some dormant, are not isolated peaks but part of a continuous range that runs the length of the continent and is surrounded by the high, cold plains of the altiplano, so their flanks support a large and varied population of animals,
its coat is fine, silky and protected so well from the cold, that it has, paradoxically, led to its near-extinction.
men have recognised that vicuña wool has an unexcelled softness and warmth and hunted the animal for it until it's close to extinction.
the people of the andes have domesticated another wild camel, the guanaco, to produce heavy-fleeced versions which produce excellent wool and serve as beasts of burden.
here, in ecuador and peru, near the equator, wild camels live at around 14,000 feet.
but as you travel south down the andes, the snowline gets lower.
half-way down, 2,000 miles south of cotopaxi, the line of permanent snow has dropped from 16,000 feet to 13,000 feet.
a thousand miles farther south still, the mountains are not so high but are almost completely covered with snow, to within a few hundred feet of the sea.
so, on the southernmost tip of south america, in patagonia and tierra del fuego, the guanaco doesn't live at great altitudes, but almost at sea level.
yet it needs its warm coat just as much, for here, even in summer, it's very cold, and during the winter the whole land is snowbound.
the reason it gets colder nearer the pole is not complicated.
the sun's rays strike the earth at the equator at right angles.
but as you travel round the earth, the rays become more and more glancing.
so a given amount of heat falling on the equator is distributed over a much greater area in the polar regions and has to travel through more of the earth's atmosphere, which weakens it still further.
so down in patagonia, the sun's rays are very much less intense and carry much less heat, and the glaciers flow right down to the sea.
farther south still, across the near-frozen seas off cape horn, you reach chains of small volcanic islands that run down towards the antarctic continent itself:
remote, little-known archipelagos such as the south sandwich and, here, the south orkneys.
there are only two flowering plants that can manage to survive in this bleak, icy country.
one is a kind of thrift and the other is a small, stunted grass.
the capacity of these simple plants to endure cold is phenomenal.
some species can even survive being frozen solid for weeks on end.
within this miniature tangled jungle lives a whole menagerie of tiny animals.
primitive creatures little bigger than pinheads manage to survive by slowly chewing away at the lichens and mosses during summer.
in winter they almost grind to a halt, yet they survive unfrozen because their blood contains a kind of antifreeze and remains liquid even when the temperature falls well below zero.
the majority are vegetarians, but there are also carnivorous mites among them which clamber around the grazing herds, picking off individuals as they fancy.
in this extreme cold, the processes of life are greatly slowed down, not only those of growth, but those that lead to old age and death.
so such tiny creatures, which elsewhere might live for merely months, survive for two or three years within the green mossy carpets.
this is as desolate a part of the earth as exists.
the cold is extreme, it's drier even than the centre of the sahara, it's dark for half the year and it's scoured by a never-ending howling wind.
and the wind is responsible for these carvings in the solid granite.
crystals of salt form beneath tiny flakes on the surface, and grow slowly, but so powerfully that particles are broken loose.
the wind then sweeps them up and hurls them at the rock face, eroding it still further.
desolate though this waste of shattered rocks may seem, there is life even here.
algae have penetrated the microscopic spaces between the rock's constituent particles and there managed to grow.
glaciers flow down these dry valleys, fed by the ice cap covering the continent's centre.
they're among the world's fastest moving, advancing as much as 300 feet in a year.
as they surge downwards, their surface is torn into thousands of crevasses.
during the summer, even though the winds are bitterly cold, the sun is sufficiently strong to melt a little of the glacier's surface.
where it accumulates in pools, blue-green algae grows vigorously, its dark colour enabling it to absorb a high proportion of the sun's feeble heat.
these pools and streams are the only places in all of antarctica's interior where life flourishes in any abundance.
the earth, at the beginning of the history of life, before any higher plants or any animals had appeared, must have looked something like this.
it must have lost its way, perhaps because of sickness, and misguidedly crawled up here from the coast, 25 miles away.
although the land of the antarctic is almost sterile, its waters are extremely fertile, so its margins, particularly the beaches of its off-shore islands, are rich in life.
every year they come ashore to the beaches to pup and mate.
they're not true seals but eared seals, for they have small external ears.
their hind flippers can be brought forward, enabling them to move quite fast on land, something that true seals can't do.
these fur seals retained and thickened the fur of their land-living ancestors, so that now some of these big males have manes which give them the name sea lion.
but the trouble with fur as an insulator is that if you dive too deep, water pressure squeezes out the air.
so fur seals, for the most part, fish in the surface waters.
true seals, like these elephant seal pups, have a different kind of insulation.
their fur is sparse, but beneath the skin is a thick layer of oily fat, blubber, which surrounds their entire body.
elephant seals dive to great depths to hunt squid, navigating in the dark with sonar and huge eyes, but they don't get chilled, for pressure has no effect on blubber's insulating qualities.
with every year, the blubber which kept them so warm in the freezing seas loses its power.
because every year the sea elephants have to moult, and in order to grow new skin they have to bring a blood supply close to the surface.
blood vessels open up through the blubber and the skin is flushed with blood just below the surface.
instead... (seal belches) ...they haul themselves up onto the beaches or into mud wallows like this one.
and there, the big old bulls like that one must suppress the feelings of antagonism they felt only a few months ago and lie close together with their fellows in the interests of keeping warm.
but they also justify their name of sea elephant by their immense size.
the bulls may grow to 20 feet long and weigh three tons.
if you wanted to pick a creature to symbolise the frozen antarctic wastes, you might well choose a creature like this.
these are macaroni penguins on the island of south georgia, halfway between the tip of south america and the antarctic.
but it seems the original penguins evolved in relatively warm climates.
even today, there are species of penguins that live on the equator, in the galapagos islands.
they have a cousin, living farther south, which grows even bigger.
it, too, has fearsome problems in raising its chicks and it solves them in the most dramatic way imaginable.
they lay their eggs not in spring, but at the end of summer.
their breeding grounds are on the permanent sea ice near the coast.
the females return to the sea to feed, leaving the males with the eggs.
they shuffle back and forth, each with an egg on his feet, held carefully above the ice.
they have nothing to eat, and nothing to do except protect the precious egg and prevent it from freezing while the chick slowly forms inside it.
as the gales intensify, the males huddle together to give one another shelter.
all the male can provide is a little secretion from his throat and long-empty stomach.
he's close to starving himself, having been sustained only by the layer of fat beneath his skin.
now the parents will take turns to trek to the sea and back, bringing food for their youngsters.
but now, at the end of winter, the ice has extended far out to sea, and the penguins may have to walk 50 miles to reach open water.
repeatedly, the parent in charge manages to find something from the pit of its stomach to feed the ever-hungry chick.
until the chicks lose their down and get their adult plumage, they can't swim and so can't feed for themselves.
but being so big, they, like the king penguins, take a long time to grow to full size, and so their parents must make the long march to the sea to collect food for them.
though the winter is almost over, there is still bad weather.
blizzards rage over the ice, and the young huddle together in groups of their own amongst the parent birds.
many of the youngsters lack the strength to withstand the cold.
they've got two months in which to restore their weight before they start the whole process over again.
these birds, at first sight so penguin-like, live not near the south pole, but the north.
auks and penguins, similar though they are, are not closely related.
they've come to resemble one another by adopting a similar lifestyle at opposite ends of the earth.
unlike antarctica, that isolated continent surrounded by sea, the arctic is connected by land to more temperate regions.
so the land animals of europe and north america have been able to colonise it and adapt to its particular demands.
on land, it feeds on small rodents, and on ice floes, perhaps the odd bird.
it's just as well the little auks have kept their powers of flight.
its whiteness is an obvious adaptation to the snow and ice, but so is its huge size.
the principle of a big body retaining more heat applies to bears as much as penguins, and polar bears are very much bigger than their cousins in temperate lands farther south.
polar bears, if forced to, will eat all kinds of things, but their preferred food is flesh, particularly that of seals.
they especially like the blubber just below the seal's skin, and often leave the meat for the scavenging gulls and foxes.
among the glaucous gulls is the much rarer and pure-white ivory gull.
the polar bear's white coat and great size are not its only adaptations to arctic life.
it grips the ice with long, sharp claws and thick hair on the soles, which also makes them excellent paddles, for the polar bear spends a lot of time swimming during the summer.
ringed seals are much hunted by polar bears, and when on the ice, must be constantly on the alert.
they need ice holes through which to leave the water, or at least stick up their heads to breathe.
a polar bear will wait for many hours, motionless, beside such a hole.
they also stalk seals that are rash enough to lie out on the ice.
the polar bear has lost, but about once in every five hunting days, it does kill, and that is enough.
the most powerful effective hunter of all, however, on the northern ice, is man.
eskimo, or inuit, as they prefer to call themselves, came up to the arctic in very early times.
superb hunters, they could live for many months in winter on nothing whatever but raw meat.
they were so skilled at living on the ice that with only a knife of bone they could make a waterproof house from snow in an hour or so.
if they can circulate the waters of the polar seas down towards the equator, they would keep them relatively warm.
and maybe they did so 100 million years ago, when the continents were arranged like this.
but the continents have shifted, the polar seas become more enclosed and any such currents interrupted.
meanwhile, during the same period, the antarctic continent drifted south until it came to rest over the south pole.
now ocean currents could not keep that part of the world warm either, and so an ice cap formed.
the whiteness reflected 90% of the heat in the already feeble rays of the sun.
so ice now covers all of antarctica and the seas of the north pole.
over the past million years there have been other variations, due to the sun's varying strength, and the ice cover has waxed and waned.
now we're in one of the warmer phases, but even so, antarctica is still buried beneath ice a mile thick, and in the north, ice and snow extend for 1,000 miles away from the pole.
as you come down the mountain or away from the pole, the land becomes warm enough to prevent it being covered by ice and snow all year.
this is the tundra, a land full of strange shapes and patterns.
fine muds and sands retain more moisture than coarse gravel, so when they freeze, they expand more and push the gravel outwards to produce these geometric shapes.
a foot down, the soil is still frozen, permafrost, so the summer melt water can't soak away and the land is covered with bogs and ponds that lie within the polygonal ridges, so that the land looks almost as though it's been cultivated by man.
in places, the underground ice pushes upwards into a mountain called a pingo.
it looks like a small volcano, but instead of hot lava in its heart, it has cold, blue ice.
although the ice relaxes its grip for only a few weeks in summer, a surprising number of plants and animals manage to find a permanent home here.
small flowering plants keep low, for close to the ground there is little wind and the sun's rays can be quite warm.
one kind of tree manages to live up here in large numbers by adopting exactly the same policy.
in summer, when there's food about, they breed with great speed.
one female produces five or six babies in a litter, four or five times in a single season.
abundant though the lemmings are, the hunting has been poor for this owl.
she may have laid as many as eight eggs, but only one chick has survived.
as the days lengthen, herds of caribou migrate up from the south.
their calves were born early in the season and the herd moves up to 15 miles a day in order to find enough food to sustain them all.
the first snow geese to arrive already have goslings, and are foraging as a family.
later arrivals are still on the nest, and can't leave until the last egg has hatched.
a square yard of fresh water here can produce 100,000 insects in a season.
now the blackfly larvae, which as eggs were attached to stones in the shallow pools, are also beginning to emerge.
activity now is intense, for it is light for almost the whole 24 hours of the day.
but by late august, the snow geese sense the imminence of winter and start to head southwards again.
the caribou, too, end their grazing, and start to plod back across the tundra.
as they go, they continue to feed, building up the reserves of fat they will need to sustain themselves through the winter.
as the weather gets colder and colder, the need for shelter becomes more urgent and the herds may cover 25 miles in a day.
and then, at last, the returning travellers reach the first tall trees.
it's the start of the great coniferous forest that lies south of the tundra right round the globe.
the snow geese will fly on for thousands of miles, but the caribou have reached their wintering grounds.
hundreds of thousands of tons of it, lying frozen on the world's mountains.
it covers not only the poles, but caps great peaks on the equator.
water molecules, distilled from the sea by the sun's heat, condense in the sky.
as they fall through the air, they pack together into shapes that echo their six-fold symmetry and form infinitely varied crystals of ice.
they settle on the high mountains and compact into snow and ice that is, chemically, almost pure water, much purer than the sea from which it came.
on mount rainier in the united states, permanent snow begins at 7,000 feet.
you might think that this was one of the most inhospitable places on earth for life.
after all, no vegetation grows on these snowfields, so there can be no animals that feed on it, like marmots or mice or rabbits, and if there are no herbivores, there can't be any predators like hawks or weasels.
but in fact, there is a surprising amount of life here.
there is some life actually within this snowfield itself, because this snow is not white, but red.
with its aid, they convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars.
these, and the minerals dissolved in the melt water, are all the algae need to grow and reproduce.
the winter snow will bury them feet deep, but in spring, when the surface melts, they divide, develop tiny beating hairs and swim up towards the sunshine.
as they age and the minerals are used up, they change colour, forming huge smears of red in snowfields all over the world.
eventually, the snow algae produce spores as fine as dust and in that form they are blown from one snowfield to another.
but other, bigger animals, also brought up by the wind, blow across the snows of mount rainier.
nobody knows why they come up in such numbers and assemble like this.
but in late summer they fly up from the valleys up to these high peaks and here assemble in the rocks.
when the winter snows come, the ladybirds remain underneath the snow in the rocks, and then in the spring, as now, the snow melts and the sun warms the ladybirds, and they become active and fly off back to the valley to feed on aphids.
the ladybirds are only temporary residents of the mount rainier snowfields.
a whole community lives here, feeding on pollen grains and the bodies of dead insects blown up on the wind.
some, like this primitive relation of the cockroach, a grylloblattid, have a body chemistry so well adjusted to low temperatures that if you pick them up, your hand's warmth will kill them.
unlike the sheep, which retreat to lower altitudes in winter, the squirrels are permanent residents, insulated in their burrows from the frosts by the cover of snow.
there are sheep like these in mountains all through north america, asia and europe.
the warming by day and freezing by night makes the gravelly soil slip downwards, so it's difficult for plants to keep a hold.
with few plants, grazing animals are rare, though there may be more than there appear to be at first sight.
these, in the himalayas, are blue sheep, so nimble and sure-footed they can reach almost any vegetation on the steep slopes.
but if these are rare, rarer still is the animal that preys on them, the snow leopard.
in summer it stays at between 12,000 and 15,000 feet, hunting small rodents and birds as well as mountain sheep.
snow leopards have been seen as high as 18,000 feet in summer.
mount kenya, also volcanic, is 2,000 feet lower but still has its own glaciers
each has its own animals and plants specially adapted to life at low temperatures.
at these altitudes, plants like these have to face two totally conflicting problems every 24 hours.
every night the temperature falls so low that they're in danger of freezing solid.
this little pond of water in the leaf rosette freezes over every night, and this shield of ice prevents the water beneath from freezing, so that it acts as a liquid jacket, preventing the frost from reaching the heart of the plant.
but as the day wears on and it gets warmer, this water is in danger of evaporating and the plant of losing its night-time insulation.
this one grows very tall and has extremely long leaves, each fringed with tiny hairs which act like an animal's fur, trapping air between them, insulating the stem from chills.
they also prevent the wind from robbing the plants of moisture.
and so they can come out during the few brief hours of sunshine and bask on the rocks without any fear, just as they're doing now.
hyrax also live down on the hot plains below, but these, in response to the cold, have developed particularly long fur.
mount kenya, like its neighbours kilimanjaro and ruwenzori, is an isolated patch of snow and ice surrounded by the baking hot african plains.
but the great mountains of south america, like cotopaxi, 19,000 feet high, are very differen
men have recognised that vicuna wool has an unexcelled softness and warmth and hunted the animal for it until it's close to extinction.
the people of the andes have domesticated another wild camel, the guanaco, to produce heavy-fleeced versions which produce excellent wool and serve as beasts of burden.
here, in ecuador and peru, near the equator, wild camels live at around 14,000 feet.
but as you travel south down the andes, the snowline gets lower.
half-way down, 2,000 miles south of cotopaxi, the line of permanent snow has dropped from 16,000 feet to 13,000 feet.
a thousand miles farther south still, the mountains are not so high but are almost completely covered with snow, to within a few hundred feet of the sea.
so, on the southernmost tip of south america, in patagonia and tierra del fuego, the guanaco doesn't live at great altitudes, but almost at sea level.
yet it needs its warm coatjust as much, for here, even in summer, it's very cold, and during the winter the whole land is snowbound.
the reason it gets colder nearer the pole is not complicated.
the sun's rays strike the earth at the equator at right angles.
but as you travel round the earth, the rays become more and more glancing.
so a given amount of heat falling on the equator is distributed over a much greater area in the polar regions and has to travel through more of the earth's atmosphere, which weakens it still further.
so down in patagonia, the sun's rays are very much less intense and carry much less heat, and the glaciers flow right down to the sea.
farther south still, across the near-frozen seas off cape horn, you reach chains of small volcanic islands that run down towards the antarctic continent itself:
remote, little-known archipelagos such as the south sandwich and, here, the south orkneys.
there are only two flowering plants that can manage to survive in this bleak, icy country.
but when the snows melt in summer, they reveal that the rocks and the boulders are covered with over 100 different kinds of mosses and lichens, some of them rounded green cushions, others like miniature trees.
the capacity of these simple plants to endure cold is phenomenal.
some species can even survive being frozen solid for weeks on end.
within this miniature tangled jungle lives a whole menagerie of tiny animals.
primitive creatures little bigger than pinheads manage to survive by slowly chewing away at the lichens and mosses during summer.
in winter they almost grind to a halt, yet they survive unfrozen because their blood contains a kind of antifreeze and remains liquid even when the temperature falls well below zero.
the majority are vegetarians, but there are also carnivorous mites among them which clamber around the grazing herds, picking off individuals as they fancy.
in this extreme cold, the processes of life are greatly slowed down, not only those of growth, but those that lead to old age and death.
in parts of the interior there are valleys where almost no snow ever falls.
this is as desolate a part of the earth as exists.
the cold is extreme, it's drier even than the centre of the sahara, it's dark for half the year and it's scoured by a never-ending howling wind.
and the wind is responsible for these carvings in the solid granite.
crystals of salt form beneath tiny flakes on the surface, and grow slowly, but so powerfully that particles are broken loose.
the wind then sweeps them up and hurls them at the rock face, eroding it still further.
beneath the stone, the wind doesn't dry it out, and it's protected from the cold.
it gets the light it needs to grow through the translucent rock.
glaciers flow down these dry valleys, fed by the ice cap covering the continent's centre.
they're among the world's fastest moving, advancing as much as 300 feet in a year.
as they surge downwards, their surface is torn into thousands of crevasses.
during the summer, even though the winds are bitterly cold, the sun is sufficiently strong to melt a little of the glacier's surface.
where it accumulates in pools, blue-green algae grows vigorously, its dark colour enabling it to absorb a high proportion of the sun's feeble heat.
these pools and streams are the only places in all of antarctica's interior where life flourishes in any abundance.
although the land of the antarctic is almost steri its waters are extremely fertile, so its margins, particularly the beaches of its off-shore islands, are rich in life.
these fur seals in south georgia flourish in great numbers because the surface waters of the seas are thick with shoals of floating shrimp:
they're not true seals but eared seals, for they have small external ears.
their hind flippers can be brought forward, enabling them to move quite fast on land, something that true seals can't do.
there's an outer guard hair and then a thick layer close to the skin, and that traps air in it and keeps the animals warm when they go swimming.
but the trouble with fur as an insulator is that if you dive too deep, water pressure squeezes out the air.
so fur seals, for the most part, fish in the surface waters.
true seals, like these elephant seal pups, have a different kind of insulation.
their fur is sparse, but beneath the skin is a thick layer of oily fat, blubber, which surrounds their entire body.
elephant seals dive to great depths to hunt squid, navigating in the dark with sonar and huge eyes, but they don't get chilled, for pressure has no effect on blubber's insulating qualities.
with every year, the blubber which kept them so warm in the freezing seas loses its power.
because every year the sea elephants have to moult, and in order to grow new skin they have to bring a blood supply close to the surface.
blood vessels open up through the blubber and the skin is flushed with blood just below the surface.
if they stayed in the sea like that, they'd chill very quickly.
the huge adult males develop a bladder on top of their noses, like a kind of trunk.
but they also justify their name of sea elephant by their immense size.
the bulls may grow to 20 feet long and weigh three tons.
if you wanted to pick a creature to symbolise the frozen antarctic wastes, you might well choose a creature like this.
these are macaroni penguins on the island of south georgia, halfway between the tip of south america and the antarctic.
but it seems the original penguins evolved in relatively warm climates.
even today, there are species of penguins that live on the equator, in the galapagos islands.
so this dense coat of feathers with a layer of fat beneath it was probably developed to keep them warm in the seas anywhere, but it serves them just as well in the freezing antarctic winds, standing on land or on a surging iceberg.
they lay just one egg, which they keep warm by the rather inconvenient method of holding it on top of their feet, covered by a fold of feathered skin, for eight long weeks.
when it does hatch, the chick takes so long to mature that they have to feed it for a further ten months
it, too, has fearsome problems in raising its chic and it solves them in the most dramatic way imaginable.
they lay their eggs not in spring, but at the end of summer.
their breeding grounds are on the permanent sea ice near the coast.
the females return to the sea to feed, leaving the males with the eggs.

but as you travel south down the andes, the snowline gets lower.
half-way down, 2,000 miles south of cotopaxi, the line of permanent snow has dropped from 16,000 feet to 13,000 feet.
a thousand miles farther south still, the mountains are not so high but are almost completely covered with snow, to within a few hundred feet of the sea.
so, on the southernmost tip of south america, in patagonia and tierra del fuego, the guanaco doesn't live at great altitudes, but almost at sea level.
yet it needs its warm coatjust as much, for here, even in summer, it's very cold, and during the winter the whole land is snowbound.
the reason it gets colder nearer the pole is not complicated.
the sun's rays strike the earth at the equator at right angles.
but as you travel round the earth, the rays become more and more glancing.
so a given amount of heat falling on the equator is distributed over a much greater area in the polar regions and has to travel through more of the earth's atmosphere, which weakens it still further.
so down in patagonia, the sun's rays are very much less intense and carry much less heat, and the glaciers flow right down to the sea.
farther south still, across the near-frozen seas off cape horn, you reach chains of small volcanic islands that run down towards the antarctic continent itself:
remote, little-known archipelagos such as the south sandwich and, here, the south orkneys.
there are only two flowering plants that can manage to survive in this bleak, icy country.
but when the snows melt in summer, they reveal that the rocks and the boulders are covered with over 100 different kinds of mosses and lichens, some of them rounded green cushions, others like miniature trees.
the capacity of these simple plants to endure cold is phenomenal.
some species can even survive being frozen solid for weeks on end.
within this miniature tangled jungle lives a whole menagerie of tiny animals.
primitive creatures little bigger than pinheads manage to survive by slowly chewing away at the lichens and mosses during summer.
in winter they almost grind to a halt, yet they survive unfrozen because their blood contains a kind of antifreeze and remains liquid even when the temperature falls well below zero.
the majority are vegetarians, but there are also carnivorous mites among them which clamber around the grazing herds, picking off individuals as they fancy.
in this extreme cold, the processes of life are greatly slowed down, not only those of growth, but those that lead to old age and death.
in parts of the interior there are valleys where almost no snow ever falls.
this is as desolate a part of the earth as exists.
the cold is extreme, it's drier even than the centre of the sahara, it's dark for half the year and it's scoured by a never-ending howling wind.
and the wind is responsible for these carvings in the solid granite.
crystals of salt form beneath tiny flakes on the surface, and grow slowly, but so powerfully that particles are broken loose.
the wind then sweeps them up and hurls them at the rock face, eroding it still further.
beneath the stone, the wind doesn't dry it out, and it's protected from the cold.
it gets the light it needs to grow through the translucent rock.
glaciers flow down these dry valleys, fed by the ice cap covering the continent's centre.
they're among the world's fastest moving, advancing as much as 300 feet in a year.
as they surge downwards, their surface is torn into thousands of crevasses.
during the summer, even though the winds are bitterly cold, the sun is sufficiently strong to melt a little of the glacier's surface.
where it accumulates in pools, blue-green algae grows vigorously, its dark colour enabling it to absorb a high proportion of the sun's feeble heat.
these pools and streams are the only places in all of antarctica's interior where life flourishes in any abundance.
although the land of the antarctic is almost steri its waters are extremely fertile, so its margins, particularly the beaches of its off-shore islands, are rich in life.
these fur seals in south georgia flourish in great numbers because the surface waters of the seas are thick with shoals of floating shrimp:
they're not true seals but eared seals, for they have small external ears.
their hind flippers can be brought forward, enabling them to move quite fast on land, something that true seals can't do.
there's an outer guard hair and then a thick layer close to the skin, and that traps air in it and keeps the animals warm when they go swimming.
but the trouble with fur as an insulator is that if you dive too deep, water pressure squeezes out the air.
so fur seals, for the most part, fish in the surface waters.
true seals, like these elephant seal pups, have a different kind of insulation.
their fur is sparse, but beneath the skin is a thick layer of oily fat, blubber, which surrounds their entire body.
elephant seals dive to great depths to hunt squid, navigating in the dark with sonar and huge eyes, but they don't get chilled, for pressure has no effect on blubber's insulating qualities.
with every year, the blubber which kept them so warm in the freezing seas loses its power.
because every year the sea elephants have to moult, and in order to grow new skin they have to bring a blood supply close to the surface.
blood vessels open up through the blubber and the skin is flushed with blood just below the surface.
if they stayed in the sea like that, they'd chill very quickly.
the huge adult males develop a bladder on top of their noses, like a kind of trunk.
but they also justify their name of sea elephant by their immense size.
the bulls may grow to 20 feet long and weigh three tons.
if you wanted to pick a creature to symbolise the frozen antarctic wastes, you might well choose a creature like this.
these are macaroni penguins on the island of south georgia, halfway between the tip of south america and the antarctic.
but it seems the original penguins evolved in relatively warm climates.
even today, there are species of penguins that live on the equator, in the galapagos islands.
so this dense coat of feathers with a layer of fat beneath it was probably developed to keep them warm in the seas anywhere, but it serves them just as well in the freezing antarctic winds, standing on land or on a surging iceberg.
they lay just one egg, which they keep warm by the rather inconvenient method of holding it on top of their feet, covered by a fold of feathered skin, for eight long weeks.
when it does hatch, the chick takes so long to mature that they have to feed it for a further ten months
it, too, has fearsome problems in raising its chic and it solves them in the most dramatic way imaginable.
they lay their eggs not in spring, but at the end of summer.
their breeding grounds are on the permanent sea ice near the coast.
the females return to the sea to feed, leaving the males with the eggs.
they shuffle back and forth, each with an egg on his feet, held carefully above the ice.
the gales intensify as the winter advances and the sun sinks lower.
they have nothing to eat, and nothing to do except protect the precious egg and prevent it from freezing while the chick slowly forms inside it.
as the gales intensify, the males huddle together to give one another shelter.
all the male can provide is a little secretion from his throat and long-empty stomach.
he's close to starving himself, having been sustained only by the layer of fat beneath his skin.
now the parents will take turns to trek to the sea and back, bringing food for their youngsters.
but now, at the end of winter, the ice has extended far out to sea, and the penguins may have to walk 50 miles to reach open water.
repeatedly, the parent in charge manages to find something from the pit of its stomach to feed the ever-hungry chick.
until the chicks lose their down and get their adult plumage, they can't swim and so can't feed for themselves.
but being so big, they, like the king penguins, take a long time to grow to full size, and so their parents must make the long march to the sea to collect food for them.
though the winter is almost over, there is still bad weather.
blizzards rage over the ice, and the young huddle together in groups of their own amongst the parent birds.
many of the youngsters lack the strength to withstand the cold.
they've got two months in which to restore their weight before they start the whole process over again.
these birds, at first sight so penguin-like, live not near the south pole, but the north.
auks and penguins, similar though they are, are not closely related.
they've come to resemble one another by adopting a similar lifestyle at opposite ends of the earth.
unlike antarctica, that isolated continent surrounded by sea, the arctic is connected by land to more temperate regions.
so the land animals of europe and north america have been able to colonise it and adapt to its particular demands.
on land, it feeds on small rodents, and on ice floes, perhaps the odd bird.
it's just as well the little auks have kept their powers of flight.
its whiteness is an obvious adaptation to the snow and ice, but so is its huge size.
the principle of a big body retaining more heat applies to bears as much as penguins, and polar bears are very much bigger than their cousins in temperate lands farther south.
polar bears, if forced to, will eat all kinds of t but their preferred food is flesh, particularly that of seals.
they especially like the blubber just below the seal's skin, and often leave the meat for the scavenging gulls and foxes.
among the glaucous gulls is the much rarer and pure-white ivory gull.
the polar bear's white coat and great size are not its only adaptations to arctic life.
it grips the ice with long, sharp claws and thick hair on the soles, which also makes them excellent paddles, for the polar bear spends a lot of time swimming during the summer.
ringed seals are much hunted by polar bears, and when on the ice, must be constantly on the alert.
they need ice holes through which to leave the water, or at least stick up their heads to breathe.
a polar bear will wait for many hours, motionless, beside such a hole.
they also stalk seals that are rash enough to lie out on the ice.
the polar bear has lost, but about once in every five hunting days, it does kill, and that is enough.
the most powerful effective hunter of all, however, on the northern ice, is man.
eskimo, or inuit, as they prefer to call themselves, came up to the arctic in very early times.
superb hunters, they could live for many months in winter on nothing whatever but raw meat.
they were so skilled at living on the ice that with only a knife of bone they could make a waterproof house from snow in an hour or so.
if they can circulate the waters of the polar seas down towards the equator, they would keep them relatively warm.
and maybe they did so 100 million years ago, when the continents were arranged like this.
but the continents have shifted, the polar seas become more enclosed and any such currents interrupted.
meanwhile, during the same period, the antarctic continent drifted south until it came to rest over the south pole.
now ocean currents could not keep that part of the world warm either, and so an ice cap formed.
the whiteness reflected 90% of the heat in the already feeble rays of the sun.
so ice now covers all of antarctica and the seas of the north pole.
over the past million years there have been other variations, due to the sun's varying strength, and the ice cover has waxed and waned.
now we're in one of the warmer phases, but even so, antarctica is still buried beneath ice a mile thick, and in the north, ice and snow extend for 1,000 miles away from the pole.
as you come down the mountain or away from the pole, the land becomes warm enough to prevent it being covered by ice and snow all year.
this is the tundra, a land full of strange shapes and patterns.
fine muds and sands retain more moisture than coarse gravel, so when they freeze, they expand more and push the gravel outwards to produce these geometric shapes.
a foot down, the soil is still frozen, permafrost, so the summer melt water can't soak away and the land is covered with bogs and ponds that lie within the polygonal ridges, so that the land looks almost as though it's been cultivated by man.
in places, the underground ice pushes upwards into a mountain called a pingo.
it looks like a small volcano, but instead of hot lava in its heart, it has cold, blue ice.
although the ice relaxes its grip for only a few weeks in summer, a surprising number of plants and animals manage to find a permanent home here.
small flowering plants keep low, for close to the ground there is little wind and the sun's rays can be quite warm.
one kind of tree manages to live up here in large numbers by adopting exactly the same policy.
in summer, when there's food about, they breed with great speed.
one female produces five or six babies in a litter, four or five times in a single season
abundant though the lemmings are, the hunting has been poor for this owl.
she may have laid as many as eight eggs, but only one chick has survived.
as the days lengthen, herds of caribou migrate up from the south.
their calves were born early in the season and the herd moves up to 15 miles a day
ones with dark feathers on the body, as well as pure-white ones.
but they're all the same species, and mixed couples are common.
later arrivals are still on the nest, and can't leave until the last egg has hatched.
while there, the first goslings to emerge and their parents are plagued by hordes of voracious blood-hungry mosquitoes.
a square yard of fresh water here can produce 100,000 insects in a season.
now the blackfly larvae, which as eggs were attached to stones in the shallow pools, are also beginning to emerge.
activity now is intense, for it is light for almost the whole 24 hours of the day.
but by late august, the snow geese sense the imminence of winter and start to head southwards again.
the caribou, too, end their grazing, and start to plod back across the tundra.
as they go, they continue to feed, building up the reserves of fat they will need to sustain themselves through the winter.
as the weather gets colder and colder, the need for shelter becomes more urgent and the herds may cover 25 miles in a day.
and then, at last, the returning travellers reach the first tall tree
it's the start of the great coniferous forest that lies south of the tundra right round the globe.
the snow geese will fly on for thousands of miles, but the caribou have reached their wintering grounds.
mr. cannata and mr. doss for bríngíng me back to gloríous míamí.
in fact, i was so eager to come, i turned down a chance... to be an extra ín coma part il.

i know ít's hard to belíeve, i used to work ín the stock exchange... tíll one of the brokers told me when my iq hít 20, i should sell.
i talked to god at kennedy airport in new york before i left.
he told me that i have to live for my baby.
so i told him that i would kill anybody who tried to hurt me like that.
i don't think god is going to let danny come near me again.
if you know where she is, i want her and my son back.
and if you don't, tell me... 'cause i'll get a private detective to find her... who'll do a lot better job than the dick tracy club you got here.
okay, man, don't jump in my face because you let your friend play you.
you got a beef with everybody... except the one person you should have got it together with from jump city.
all i know... is doss and morty price made some bets... and the girl took some of their tally sheets.
so they've got a contract out on her for tally sheets?
i wonder what he saw when he looked in the mirror.
if you don't tell me, robbie... i gotta put you away for conspiracy to commit murder.
the man i knew always did what it took... and it hurt sometimes, but he did it.
because that's the only thing that got us out of the jungle, with our minds.
if this morning was a rip-off, they would've taken the cash.
if it was straight business... they would've called it off when vega told them you were cops.
i mean, we don't even know for sure if this half brother of hers really exists.
and the lady's got every reason in the world to play with your head.
i've got a telex of field reports i'm sure you'd like to see.
yeah, except i'm just on my way to talk to her about protective custody.
take him to the main house and leave him with maria.
fix the blanket so it looks like it's still in the car.
and i always assume the other guy's smart, so we don't look dumb.
(srt leader) if calderone's on land... it should be easy enough to surround him.
the bomb's controlled by a transmission from this shack at 87 megahertz.
so we will be able to use our radios without triggering it.
somehow they don't strike me as the major smack dealers... we waited in the woods all night to grab.
there's nothing in the plane but a few pounds of pot.
but my ears perk up, because i hear this stuff is laotian, right?
so i cop and i take the stuff to a chemist, and he tells me....
the sergeant comes back to the states... maybe he buys himself a big house, he hides his stash.
what if he just sits around waiting for inflation to rise?
there is no telling how much money this guy is sitting on right here now.
only now, his stuff is starting to decompose... and he's gotta move his whole nest egg before it rots.
look, i didn't know your friend... but i really think i know how you're feeling... because i had a lot of friends in the war who ended up tying off one too many times.
then, why don't you go talk to one of their roommates?
look, man, i don't give a damn about a sergeant or any other story.
one of your buddies out of this ward died... of an overdose of street drugs... and it's my lob to investigate it.
i had to step out of my office for a while and i thought maybe i missed his call.
well, no, i had a weird feeling... he's been trying to get in touch with me.
and dig it, the deal is... he's blowing away these dogs... because he's trained them so righteously... that they're too damned dangerous to bring back to the united states.
and i kept thinking... i should blow him away for the same reason.
maybe i didn't want to tell you about it... 'cause i was a little bit embarrassed about it, all right?
but now we're here where we are right now and i'm sick of this whole movie, okay?
and you still get high... but it's like shooting a syringe full of bacteria at the same time.
so the sergeant may be dead... but his stash is still very much alive and killing people.
i know you can handle it because you already started laying the stuff off... and all you gotta do is lay it off a little faster, okay?
then you can afford to pay me and the story will never see print.
but i gotta believe... that he knew he was gonna blackmail the sergeant if he found him.
all he needed was for somebody to lead him to him.
well, 20 minutes and my people put a manuscript in the mail.
look, we both know we're sitting on a story... that's very big, very painful for all of us.
you know, of course, that in most parts of the world... pain is a second language.
people understand it better than words... because you can get right to the point.
i caught her with an old guy in a motel once.
he was parading' around the room with her on his back, naked.
i'd leave the house with the wall streetjournal tucked under my shoulder.
he could never figure out why he couldn't call me at work.
i refuse to answer that question on the grounds that my answer might tend to incriminate me.

so, i looked mr. hollywood producer right in the eye, and i said:
"do you really expect to put a price on beauty like this?
"well, if that's the way you feel, make sure it's a big price. "
rachel, it's our chance to get out of here it's something we always hoped for.
rachel and chris put every penny they earned into the bank to buy a farm back in ohio.
the closest rachel ever got to diamonds was the costume jewelry that bernie gave us to wear in the photo sessions.
and an extremely wealthy man, too, if these figures are accurate.
devon, can we find out where bernie's models have traveled last year?
once they're back in the states, bernie converts the jewelry to cash, transfers the cash to those numbered bank accounts in the grand caymans and takes a healthy percentage off the top for himself.
if you're on the right track, these necklaces are for bernie's next customers.

it would have been far easier and cheaper to bring a tape recorder.

it didn't take long for nina to start singing like a canary.
turns out they got state and federal authorities lined up, waiting for a piece of bernie.

no, but i got a feeling you are gonna tell me.

dr. alpert confirmed damage to his chest tissues as if he'd recently received a severe blow.
also, when he showed me that book he intended to give his daughter, it contained a treasure map.
[tires screeching] i'd hate to see her behind the wheel of a car.
michael, there's a man directly ahead with a gun aimed at that rider.
you may not be interested in his treasure, but obviously somebody else is.
are you trying to tell me that this person cut my cinch?
if it'll save your life, i don't have any other choice.
[sighs] lf l agree, will you let me stop at the dorm and pack my things?
look, i'm sorry if i embarrassed you back at the dance.
it was the only way to get you out of there.
well, these don't have designer labels, but they'll keep you warm.
here's a shirt, socks, and, uh, i'll have to get you some shoes.
i agreed to talk to you because your credentials checked out.
but until a lot of questions have been answered to my complete satisfaction, i am not going to change my position.
i used to hold onto this all the time just to make me feel like he was close by.
remember when you were a little kid and you'd run into your parents' room in the night when the thunder got too loud?
stephen de blois, used to hide his maps in imitation cannons by his bedroom window.
i think we should look for something more conventional, like a safe.
(kitt) 21 years of erosion have covered the spot with sand.
but you're right, michael, there's a landfall at that spot which seems much less dense than the surrounding walls.
katherine, your father spent his whole life searching for secret places that held the treasure of beauty, not money.
to him, those were the most important discoveries, i think the kind he wanted you to experience.
just looking at the mountain from the outside, i would've missed all that was hidden in the inside.
just like i missed all the beauty hidden inside my father
then you should read it, it looks like someone tampered with the car...
they loosened one of the nuts on the wheels, i don't remember now.
when there's some asshole to deal with, you think of me...
but when it comes to a pay rise you only think about yourself.
i'm with the police, i need to speak to mr martelli.
i need to speak to mr martelli, i'm with the police.
i wanted to know if they knew each other when they were alive?
of course they did, we all know each other in the world of motor racing, but ferrante worked for a rival team.
no, i've got nothing to do with it, i swear i don't know anything.
someone with a clear conscience doesn't run from the police like you did...
there's this woman who passes by every morning with her dog...
as soon as she sees my stand she lifts her leg and takes a leak.
the guy they found dead in the trunk of his car.
i heard you argued with him the day before he was killed.
from a financial point of view, it must have been quite a blow for you?
sure, losing the world champion means we lost a lot of our big sponsors.
the engineer had him killed, and how did he do it?
he removed a bolt from his wheel, just like the one you showed me.
your brother's condition has stabilized for the moment, but he remains in a very deep coma.
the question is, what is in that case for which people are so cavalierly willing to kill?
i didn't realize you could fit so many songs into such a short flight.
you get more for your money when you fly island hoppers.
he was submerged and trapped underwater for a very long time, was your brother.
the emergency team has treated the other injuries, the broken bones, the abrasions.
there's something about vending-machine coffee that i've always associated with waiting.
that's because the only time you usually drink stuff like this is when you're at a hospital or a police station waiting to see about a friend, or sometimes a relative.
well, let's just say i just started him off in the right direction.
as a matter of fact, two years later, t.c. saved my butt.
i really wanna thank you guys for being my brother's friend.
'cause i have a feeling that a man couldn't do any better.
why don't you wait for the faa or the national transportation safety board?
i mean, they're gonna be investigating this thing later in the day anyway.
but once you do have it, there's a kind of strange relief.
because at least you're in possession of something you can understand.
that's how long it's gonna take to get the salvage equipment to the site.
you mean to tell me that everybody's gonna sit on their butts for two days and do nothing?
well, listen, whenever you're ready to go back down again, i'm ready.
oh, thanks, but i don't think anybody's gonna be going down there for awhile.
they were supposed to meet mrs. brimecombe and me in hana for dinner.
and then we were supposed to go on a moonlight cruise.
no, but the boys down at the department are awful proud of you fellas.
in fact, they're gonna give you a special commendation from the secretary himself, just for pulling that pilot out of the chopper.
now, judging from the point that it went down, the trajectory would put the sniper right here in this area.
what i'd like to know from you fellas is did you see anything suspicious?
but, you may win the good will of a critically injured friend of mine and those who care about him.
it's extremely important to us if you could perhaps offer some assistance.
i merely wanted to be in close proximity to t.c. in case his condition changed.
and i wouldn't, by any stretch of the imagination, characterize this as "care." i would...
i was on safari, carefully stalking a herd of white rhino for more than three hours.
the only thing was that, unbeknownst to me, another hunter was approaching the herd from the upwind side.
i just left magnum and jerrold and that situation is not quite as clean.
for the moment, all we can do is wait it out.
you know, you bum around the world and you lose contact and then you finally show up to this.
man, i'm telling you, it's like somebody's playing some kind of lame trick on me.
rick's questions were the same ones i had already asked myself.
and hot, cold or lukewarm, i really didn't have the answers.
all i knew was the chopper was the last place to look for them.
and the only place we had after that was the hospital room.
naturally, i could never trust lieutenant bancroft again, much less look him in the face.
which reminds me of a similar experience which occurred in the suez in '56.
i was on camel patrol with an officer newly transferred to our unit,
captain nigel thornberry, who was quite anxious to prove himself to the rest of the lads.
for jamaal and his camel riding a couple of miles ahead of us, were quickly captured by a roving group of desert bandits.
we tracked them for a full five days, and the cries of pain and terror emanating from the enemy campfire at night were enough to bring tears to the eyes of the most hardened warrior.
while i was on maui attempting to "pull a tail," as magnum would say.
of course, i prefer to believe that my methods are somewhat more sophisticated inasmuch as...
he even offered to make the call back to the family on the mainland.
if my family were to find out about this, they'd kill me.
obviously, the phillips' hiring of you was a well planned ruse to surreptitiously introduce you to mr. bates and his case.
and the presence of jerrold here at this hospital was a hastily planned one to find out from you where that case was.
aha, so the ersatz jerrold was hedging his bets, splitting his time between you and magnum.
the question is, what is in that case for which people are so cavalierly willing to kill?
then, come to think of it, maybe that's when my little voice did.
now remember, plenty of rest and no, i repeat, no excitement.
what i wanna know is, how did that creep know so much about my family?
well, it's obvious t.c., the guys jerrold was working for were counting on you to deliver the plutonium.
so, when they picked you out to be the courier, they did a little research.
all it probably took was a telephone call to your family by jerrold posing as a representative of their insurance company.
just in case there were any of those yo-yos still around and i was right, they were.
besides, the one with the plutonium in it was just too darn heavy.
the unadmitted truth is that you can't face the fact that it's all over.
i always lied to myself that it wasn't all over, there's still something, not now... but soon, later...
you know... if there wasn't a room to come home to, which is still good to have.
but if you ask a friend... or you have to meet some place, ...would you come with me?
because i'd be making coffee in my own kitchen and perhaps i'd be glad to see you come home at 6.
perhaps i wouldn't be glad, and say, now why did you come here?
not to mention the tone he uses about it, not even a stranger would take that from him.
it's not acceptable that after he comes you're ill for days.
they grow and grow, then they're not 20 but 30... and still behave like small children as if they had no responsibility to anyone.
it's true too... it was hard for us to get through the fights;
look at me, speak to me as if any word... was a lie.
i don't know how to express it how it is somehow it isn't the way it was.
i don't know if you know anna or talked more with her ?
but why, all of a sudden, have i become afraid of them?
i need someone who'd accept all my nonsense, all my idiocies,
who... who'd be able to live with me and and accept my drinking, being brought home drunk.
i cling tooth and nail to is that i found something,
i have a dream and idea why can't i realize it?
i warned you at the start, in this house, well, that kind of thing i wouldn't welcome...
you may have money problems and there i can say i'm ready to help, but one thing you must know if you want to stay here, is to somehow make up your mind that we're not jigging around one foot forward, one back,
if she saw you needed it for something specific, to do something with yourself, she'd give you it for sure.
that's all i can say, sorry... try to live normally, like an honest man.
- all you can do is fight, all you want to do is kill!
see why she won't give you money, you're over the top!
i want to talk to you, rather i don't want to,
i just tell you the facts and you get the hell out,
- i've been a good maid here and i will be too.
you brought your lover here, then your second one, then the third.
not that strong, since i wasn't able to kick you out.
and you won't set foot here again, even if you're a bit stronger than me...
what and why you spend, how much and why you want to spend, and why want to give him money.

actually my son found out but he wanted to see the outcome, what'd happen so he found out about the pawnshop and the rest.
he took the pawn ticket from him, so seeing him in the act and the proof that he pawned it under his own name.

now i've a child of my own brown is her hair and she's just my own,
a long, long time it lasts... sticking to a lie because it gives you something to hold on to.
the unadmitted truth is that you can't face the fact that it's all over.
because i'd be making coffee in my own kitchen and perhaps i'd be glad to see you come home at 6.
perhaps i wouldn't be glad, and say, why did you come here?
not to mention the tone he uses about it, not even a stranger would take that from him.
it's not acceptable that after he comes you're ill for days.
first, you know, for a long time the two of us were living here me and my son.
then it so happened that we had to take anna in, who helps me,
look at me, speak to me as if any word... was a lie.
i don't know how to express it how it is somehow it isn't the way it was.
i need someone who'd accept all my nonsense, all my idiocies,
who... who'd be able to live with me and and accept my drinking, being drunk.
i'd like to tell you again, very clearly that the sexual relationship you've developed with anna, ...i warned you at the start, in this house, well, that kind of thing i wouldn't welcome...
you may have money problems and there i can say i'm ready to help, but one thing you must know if you want to stay here, is to somehow make up your mind that we're not jigging around
care about people, listen to their problems, and then things will be fine.
believe me, if you act differently to your mother, show the least understanding, if you behaved as if she were your mother, tried to love her a little.
if she saw you needed it for something specific, to do something with yourself, she'd give you it for sure.
that's all i can say, sorry... try to live normally, like an honest man.
but i thought with this... other field, with the notes flashes block my eyes.
...so that i don't maybe i can only trust my ears...
how much you want to spend, why you want to, and why want to give him money.

in the lands between the arctic circle and the tropics, each year brings a great change between winter and summer, imposing a rhythm in the lives of animals and plants.
up north in the great evergreen forests, conditions in mid-winter are cripplingly severe.
and the reason trees like these don't grow much farther north is not only the extreme cold, but with the long months of winter darkness, there is not enough light in the year for them to grow.
here in northern norway, 300 miles, 500km north of the arctic circle, there is just enough light, but it does get extremely cold.
70 degrees of frost have been measured here, and in winter there are very heavy snowfalls.
the cold threatens to freeze the liquid within the trees, and denies them one of their essential supplies:
so this land is effectively as parched as a desert, and the pine trees have as great a need to conserve water as a cactus.
all plants lose some water through their leaves, but pine needles are protected by a near-impermeable rind.
the pores through which they breathe, and from which water can evaporate, are kept out of the wind by being placed along the groove that runs the length of the needle, each in a tiny pit ringed with a ridge.
these dry, waxy leaves are almost inedible, but the seeds in the cones are not, and are one of the few kinds of food available in the forest in winter.
voles make their runways through the snow and collect what they can.
moose get little nourishment from pine trees, apart from the shaggy moss that hangs from the branches.
they chew the sappy twigs and bark of birch, but there's not enough to keep them going.
if it wasn't for the fat reserves they built up in summer, few would survive.
the winter forests can support very few plant-eaters, but there are just enough to feed one or two hardy hunters.
the great grey owl's legs are ideal for grabbing prey in snow:
if the lynx doesn't catch a hare within 200 yards, the meat it might provide is not enough to warrant the effort, and the lynx gives up.
bigger prey are worth much longer chases, and the lynx pursue roe deer with great persistence.
a single deer will provide food for the whole lynx family.
in this bleak land, even the most ferocious and capable hunters do not scorn to scavenge.
an eagle owl will take cold deer flesh just as eagerly as the warm bodies of voles.
a wolverine, the biggest of the weasel family, and more than a match for an eagle owl.
the coniferous forest grows right round the globe in a belt that, in places, is 1,200 miles across.
from scandinavia, it extends across northern europe and siberia to the shores of the pacific.
during the last ice age, when the seas were lower, the bering strait did not exist, so the trees continued into north america, across northern canada to the atlantic.
consequently, all the trees in this vast forest and its permanent inhabitants in america, asia and europe, are much the same.
but when spring comes, visitors journey up from warmer parts and each forest takes on its own individual character.
in scandinavia, a hawk owl, a nomad that has spent the winter farther south, comes cruising up north again looking for food and a nest site.
unlike other owls, it's primarily a daytime hunter, and relies not so much on its acute hearing as its sharp eyesight as it waits for the melting snow to reveal rodents.
in pine trees, from norway to siberia, the cock capercaillie claims his territory.
they rely mainly on woodpeckers, and none is a more expert carpenter than the black woodpecker of northern europe.
their sharp beak serves as an excellent chisel, but most prefer to work in dead trees where the wood is softer.
each tree produces male and female flowers, which mature at different times, so the female flowers are likely to be fertilised by pollen from other trees.
now it is as warm as it ever will be in the northern forests.
and the lure that has brought them so far is the sudden emergence of myriads of insects.
this bedraggled creature is hardly recognisable, for its wings have not yet expanded.
here the moths will lay their eggs so their caterpillars can feed on the young shoots.
the wood ants have missed their chance to catch the adult moth, but now they're looking for the caterpillars among the branches.
the colour and the pattern of the caterpillar conceals it from birds which hunt by sight, but is no protection against ants which search by smell and touch.
finally the body is hauled down to the nest for all to consume.
when a foraging ant discovers them, they dab a spot of this resin on its head, like this.
the resin damages the ant's eyes and antennae, so disorientating it that it can hardly walk.
the wryneck is a member of the woodpecker family that has specialised in eating ants, and particularly relishes their cocoons.
like its cousins, the wryneck nests in holes in trees, but it doesn't excavate them for itself.
here in the far north, close to the arctic circle, the sun during the summer hardly sinks below the horizon and the nights are brief.
the eagle owl hunts just as effectively in the twilight as in the dark.
it has grown fast and its adult feathers are already appearing through its down.
the tail of a red squirrel is left over from a previous meal, and it even takes that too.
this female produced her four young only three weeks ago, but she is already pregnant again and will soon abandon this family and start a new one.
all the owls, some visitors, some residents, scour the forest for voles.
more voles mean better-fed owls, which produce bigger clutches of eggs and rear more chicks.
and as the number of owls increases, so they spread out into new territory.
but the frontier is no barrier to the bird they call the phantom of the north, the great grey owl, and in years when the vole population is high, the owl comes across these frontiers and into the finnish pine forests.
and i know they are here already because i have just picked up this.
and this, i can see, has actually got vole skulls in it.
but to discover exactly what the state of the vole population is at the moment,
i'll have to look inside the nest of a great grey owl, and to do that i'll need this.
all owls are fairly ferocious and the great grey owl certainly can be, so as part of the standard equipment of looking for owl nests you need this.
up there is one of their nests, and the female has just flown off.
she's perching in that tree over there, keeping a very close eye on me.
if i go up and have a look in the nest,
i may be able to get some idea as to how the vole cycle is going.
so it is very likely the female and her mate will soon be on their way back to russia.
there's now just a month left of the short northern summer.
many of the birds that came up here to harvest the insects and to breed will soon be moving back again to avoid the severities of the coming winter.
some, like the redwing, will go to open pastureland down south.
the brambling prefers beech woodland, and will leave almost as soon as it has finished its summer moult.
the hawk owl is driven south by hunger, for as the forest gets colder, there is less food to be found.
they are not covered with a thick, protective rind, but are thin, delicate structures.
during the summer water is more accessible, so there is less need to take rigorous measures to conserve it.
indeed, during hot days the trees evaporate large quantities to keep cool.
so the pores through which they breathe are numerous, and not in pits as they are in the pines.
these succulent, soft leaves, unlike pine needles, are relished as food by all kinds of creatures.
large animals, like deer, take many of them, but the greatest quantity by far is gathered by insects.
the forest canopy in late summer has more birds in it than at any other time of the year.
there are returning migrants newly arrived from the north, resident breeders gathering food to feed their second families of the season, and young fledglings starting to forage for themselves and still not sure what is edible and what isn't.
nearly all of them are hunting for insects, and the crop they take is huge.
not surprisingly, the insects have evolved many ways of protecting themselves.
they snip off half-eaten leaves so as to give the minimum sign of their presence.
they disguise themselves as a blob of cuckoo spit or a bird dropping, but if they move, as eventually they must, their concealment is lost.
the nuthatch habitually works its way down the trunk, and that way may see insects that have been overlooked by tree creepers that habitually come up it.
one of the most expert of all bark-feeders, and in some ways the most specialised of all the birds living in the tall trees of these forests, are the woodpeckers.
its tall feathers have strong quills and serve as props for its body.
its bill has a resilient pad at the base which cushions its brain from the shock of its drilling.
europe has ten species, but here in north america there are over twice as many.
this one, a sapsucker, drills holes in trees not for insects, but for sap.
it digs lines of these wells in many kinds of trees.
each little hole points slightly downwards so that the sap does not trickle out but collects in a small pool inside, and the sapsucker collects it with its tongue.
in late summer, the parent sapsuckers lead their fledglings to the wells and leave them to feast not only on the sap but on the insects it attracts.
this american woodpecker uses its drilling skills to bore neat sockets in dead tree trunks.
some are wrapped in soft and tasty flesh to tempt the animals to eat them and so transport them to new sites.
others are packed with nourishment, not for animals, but to provide food for the germinating seedling, but the animals eat them just the same.
even the hard and unpromising-looking acorns of the american pin oak are collected by racoons.
the squirrel's habit of burying acorns for a winter store has been the start of many an oak.
the black bear, on occasion, will eat fish and voles and even carrion, but much of its diet is vegetable.
it will dig for roots and even eat pine cones, but it has a very sweet tooth and just now it relishes the fruit.
all sorts of mammals are now clambering around in the trees in search of fruit.
the possum, a strange primitive animal of the americas related more closely to kangaroos than to rats, eats almost anything.
and there are many other creatures too, chewing their way through the dead leaves, extracting what nutriment they can and leaving the remainder to be dealt with by fungi and bacteria.
they themselves are hunted by monsters in miniature, pseudoscorpions, horrific in close-up, but, perhaps fortunately, the size of a pinhead.
snails are giants in comparison and, since they carry their shells around with them, they might seem to be fairly well protected against any creatures smaller than a bird.
but one particular beetle has specialised equipment for dealing with them.
almost every mountain range in the us has its own species with its own colours, but, being nocturnal, they're rarely seen.
shrews eat most small living things they come across, and they are formidable hunters, for they are one of the few mammals that has a poisonous bite.
the salamander's only defence is to produce an acrid liquid from glands on its tail.
the first time a shrew encounters this, it usually takes no notice and eats the salamander, but apparently the taste is not very nice, for on later encounters, like this one, one sniff reminds the shrew the meal won't be a good one
the birds that came visiting up here during the summer have now retreated south, and some of these small mammals have crawled into holes and gone to sleep.
their heartbeat has almost stopped, their bodies have become as cold as stone.
not only warmth but intense cold will bring them out, for although their body temperature falls while they hibernate, if it drops to freezing point, they will die.
so in really cold spells, they must get up and warm themselves with a little exercise, even though it dangerously depletes their fat reserves.
when spring at last comes, the brown carpet of rotting leaves is suddenly flooded with colour.
the plants that live close to the ground now make haste to sprout and flower and soak up the spring sunshine before the trees above produce their own leaves and cut out the light.
the bear's den is empty, but the owners haven't gone far.
there's still not much to eat, only a few leaves, nor will there be until the first of the berries come into fruit in summer, but meanwhile at least the sun is warm.
the spring showers soak the woodlands and create just the moist, warm conditions needed by the fungi to produce their fruiting bodies.
these must be mature and ready to discharge their microscopic spores by the time the dry winds of summer begin to blow, so that their spores, like dust, will be carried all through the forest.
once, the woods of north america stretched over the eastern half of the continent in an almost continuous band hundreds of miles deep.
today, the majority has been felled to make space for farmland and cities, but enough remains to make plain their splendour.
but the terminal buds of young pines are surrounded by a shock of needles.
they burn at a relatively low temperature, and by the time the flames have consumed them, the main fire has swept by and the bud at the top of the stem, from which new growth will come, is still unharmed.
fires like these are not just the work of careless people, they occur naturally.
the spark that regularly sets fire to these forests is lightning.
in this part of the southern states, violent thunderstorms are common and lightning often strikes the taller trees, scoring a deep groove down the length of the trunk as it flashes down to earth.
and this at my feet is the tinder which set it aflame.
these are pine needles, and they're so full of resin and they're so dry that they flame up very easily.
but the fire they produce is not very hot, and it's also very short-lived, so that if any creature can survive fire for just one or two minutes, then it can survive a fire like this.
the rattlesnake, like many other ground-living animals, regularly takes refuge from the midday sun in holes, so now it knows exactly where to go to escape the fire.
but this hole is already occupied by its digger and owner,
but in the back of the burrow lies another refugee, an indigo snake, and it, on occasion, eats rattlesnakes.
but the fire is passing and the rattlesnake can return to the forest.
but a tree killed by fire can't resist, and these beetles take advantage of the situation.
they have pits behind their legs which are sensitive to infra-red rays, and therefore they can detect the slightest rise in temperature, and with these to guide them, they travel from all over the forest to the wake of the fire
within a couple of months of a summer fire, the forest has more than recovered, it is rejuvenated.
the fire has cleared away the old growth on the ground, and by reducing the pine needles to ash has released their nutrients into the soil, and now the ground sprouts more flowers than at any other time.
because of regular fires, big bushes can't establish themselves here, so swampy areas are not colonised and sucked dry by them as happens elsewhere, and open marshes remain where pitcher plants can grow and where frogs can swim and breed.
indeed, one species of frog lives nowhere else but in these pools in the american pine barrens.
the woodpeckers here can't excavate their nest in dead trees as do woodpeckers elsewhere, for in this fire-ravaged forest they would risk incineration, so the red-cockaded woodpecker drills its holes in living pines.
but the wood is so hard, it takes several woodpeckers about two years to dig the hole.
resinous sap seeps out around the hole where the outer layers of the tree have been breached.
so the birds make their hole low down on the trunk where the inner sap-free heartwood is thick enough to accommodate the entire nest.
the flow of resin is diverted to the outside by drilling pits like sap wells above and below the hole.
it's in these laboriously excavated holes that the red-cockaded woodpecker raises its young.
the holes are very conspicuous, for each is surrounded by a sheet of yellow congealed resin.
the rat snake is a great robber of nests and stealer of chicks.
but now the other function of all that resin, deliberately produced around the nest by the woodpecker, is about to become clear.
the chemicals in the resin seem to irritate the snake beyond endurance, and it arches its body away.
this injury was also caused by fire, and this is also a coniferous tree, but a very different one.
to start with, it's over 40 feet across along its base and it's 267 1/2 feet high.
it's just taller and it's estimated to weigh 1,385 tons, which makes it the most massive living organism in the world.
although these trees are growing almost as far south as the southern pines, the climate here, 2,000 metres up in the sierra nevada mountains, is much colder and snow lies on the ground for almost half the year.
it's as though, by climbing to this height, we have returned climatically to the great forests of the north.
during the ice age, these sequoias grew over much of north america.
but when, some 8,000 years ago, the earth began to warm, they died out except for these isolated groups high up in the mountains.
we've travelled some 2,000 miles southwards since we started at the tree line near the arctic circle, and in all that vast territory the majority of the forest trees have been conifers, so it seems only right and proper that we should end with these, the noblest of them all.
as a group, the conifers owe much of their success to their ability to cope with the changeable northern climate.
they can survive both the short, dark days of winter with their bitter cold, as well as the long sunny days of summer with their raging fires.
but if we continue a further 1,000 miles southwards, we come to the tropics, and there the climate is radically different.
it's no longer very variable but remarkably constant, with much the same amounts of light and rain and heat throughout the year.
there the other great group of forest trees, the broadleaved trees, come into their own.
that is the jungle, and that's where we'll be in the next programme.
in the lands between the arctic circle and the tropics, each year brings a great change between winter and summer, imposing a rhythm in the lives of animals and plants.
up north in the great evergreen forests, conditions in mid-winter are cripplingly severe.
and the reason trees like these don't grow much farther north is not only the extreme cold, but with the long months of winter darkness, there is not enough light in the year for them to grow.
here in northern norway, 300 miles, 500km north of the arctic circle, there is just enough light, but it does get extremely cold.
70 degrees of frost have been measured here, and in winter there are very heavy snowfalls.
the cold threatens to freeze the liquid within the trees, and denies them one of their essential supplies:
so this land is effectively as parched as a desert and the pine trees have as great a need to conserve water as a cactus.
all plants lose some water through their leaves, but pine needles are protected by a near-impermeable rind.
the pores through which they breathe, and from which water can evaporate, are kept out of the wind by being placed along the groove that runs the length of the needle, each in a tiny pit ringed with a ridge.
these dry, waxy leaves are almost inedible, but the seeds in the cones are not, and are one of the few kinds of food available in the forest in winter.
voles make their runways through the snow and collect what they can.
moose get little nourishment from pine trees, apart from the shaggy moss that hangs from the branches.
they chew the sappy twigs and bark of birch, but there's not enough to keep them going.
if it wasn't for the fat reserves they built up in summer, few would survive.
the winter forests can support very few plant-eaters, but there are just enough to feed one or two hardy hunters.
the great grey owl's legs are ideal for grabbing prey in snow:
if the lynx doesn't catch a hare within 200 yards, the meat it might provide is not enough to warrant the effort, and the lynx gives up.
bigger prey are worth much longer chases, and the lynx pursue roe deer with great persistence.
a single deer will provide food for the whole lynx family.
in this bleak land, even the most ferocious and capable hunters do not scorn to scavenge.
an eagle owl will take cold deer flesh just as eagerly as the warm bodies of voles.
a wolverine, the biggest of the weasel family, and more than a match for an eagle owl.
the coniferous forest grows right round the globe in a belt that, in places, is 1,200 miles across.
from scandinavia, it extends across northern europe and siberia to the shores of the pacific.
during the last ice age, when the seas were lower, the bering strait did not exist, so the trees continued into north america, across northern canada to the atlantic.
consequently, all the trees in this vast forest and its permanent inhabitants in america, asia and europe, are much the same.
but when spring comes, visitors journey up from warmer parts and each forest takes on its own individual character.
in scandinavia, a hawk owl, a nomad that has spent the winter farther south, comes cruising up north again looking for food and a nest site.
unlike other owls, it's primarily a daytime hunter, and relies not so much on its acute hearing as its sharp eyesight as it waits for the melting snow to reveal rodents.
in pine trees, from norway to siberia, the cock capercaillie claims his territory.
they rely mainly on woodpeckers, and none is a more expert carpenter than the black woodpecker of northern europe.
their sharp beak serves as an excellent chisel, but most prefer to work in dead trees where the wood is softer.
each tree produces male and female flowers, which mature at different times, so the female flowers are likely to be fertilised by pollen from other trees.
now it is as warm as it ever will be in the northern forests.
summer visitors are arriving, and the trees echo with their song.
this willow warbler, singing so vigorously in scandinavia, has come all the way from the savannah country south of the sahara.
this bedraggled creature is hardly recognisable, for its wings have not yet expanded.
it's a pine beauty moth, and its first priority is to leave the forest floo which is full of danger.
up among the pine needles, the pine beauty pumps fluid out of its body and into the veins of its wings.
here the moths will lay their eggs so their caterpillars can feed on the young shoots
the wood ants have missed their chance to catch the adult moth, but now they're looking for the caterpillars among the branches.
the colour and the pattern of the caterpillar conceals it from birds which hunt by sight, but is no protection against ants which search by smell and touch.
finally the body is hauled down to the nest for all to consume.
the caterpillars of the sawfly are also swarming on the pine shoots.
as they chew, they store some of the resin from the pine needles in a pouch inside their mouth.
when a foraging ant discovers them, they dab a spot of this resin on its head, like th
the resin damages the ant's eyes and antennae, so disorientating it that it can hardly walk.
even if it finds its way back to the nest, it smells so strongly and strangely that the other ants treat it as an intruder and kill it
with a long tongue you can even collect insects from the bark without leaving your nest.
here in the far north, close to the arctic circle, the sun during the summer hardly sinks below the horizon and the nights are brief.
last winter, the pines produced great quantities of seed, so many adult voles survived till spring and now they're all breeding at an extraordinary rate.
this female produced her four young only three weeks ago, but she is already pregnant again and will soon abandon this family and start a new one.
all the owls, some visitors, some residents, scour the forest for voles.
tengmalm's owl, up in a tree hole, has three chicks, all flourishing and all demanding voles.
in fact, those pine forests behind me are actually in russia.
but the frontier is no barrier to the bird they call the phantom of the north, the great grey owl, and in years when the vole population is high, the owl comes across these frontiers and into the finnish pine forests.
all owls, as part of their natural digestion, throw up the fur and bones of their prey.
and this, i can see, has actually got vole skulls in it.
but to discover exactly what the state of the vole population is at the moment,
i'll have to look inside the nest of a great grey and to do that i'll need this.
all owls are fairly ferocious and the great grey owl certainly can be, so as part of the standard equipment of looking for owl nests you need this.
up there is one of their nests, and the female has just flown off.
she's perching in that tree over there, keeping a very close eye on me.
if i go up and have a look in the nest,
if the voles had been at the height of their population, there would probably be four chicks in such a nest as this, but the fact there is only one makes it pretty clear that the vole population is already beginning to crash.
so it is very likely the female and her mate will soon be on their way back to russia.
there's now just a month left of the short northern summer.
many of the birds that came up here to harvest the insects and to breed will soon be moving back again to avoid the severities of the coming winter.
some, like the redwing, will go to open pastureland down south.
the brambling prefers beech woodland, and will leave almost as soon as it has finished its summer moult.
down here, the weather's warmer, the summers are longer, and the woodlands are free of frost, not forjust two or three months in the year, but for eight or nine, and the shape of the trees is very different.
instead of their branches drooping down, and so shedding the snow, these branches spread out widely, carrying tier upon tier of leaves with which to catch the abundant energy of the sun.
during the summer water is more accessible, so there is less need to take rigorous measures to conserve it.
indeed, during hot days the trees evaporate large quantities to keep cool.
so the pores through which they breathe are numerous, and not in pits as they are in the pines.
these succulent, soft leaves, unlike pine needles, are relished as food by all kinds of creatures.
large animals, like deer, take many of them, but the greatest quantity by far is gathered by insects.
the forest canopy in late summer has more birds in it than at any other time of the year.
there are returning migrants newly arrived from the north, resident breeders gathering food to feed their second families of the season, and young fledglings starting to forage for themselves and still not sure what is edible and what isn't.
nearly all of them are hunting for insects, and the crop they take is huge.
not surprisingly, the insects have evolved many ways of protecting themselves.
they snip off half-eaten leaves so as to give the minimum sign of their presence.
a poplar hawk moth tries to defend itself by pretending to be fierce.
the nuthatch habitually works its way down the trunk, and that way may see insects that have been overlooked by tree creepers that habitually come up it.
its hearing is excellent and it locates the grubs it seeks by the tiny sounds they make as they move inside the bark.
its tall feathers have strong quills and serve as props for its body.
its bill has a resilient pad at the base which cushions its brain from the shock of its drilling.
its feet give it a grip in all directions, with two toes pointing forwards and two backwards.
this one, a sapsucker, drills holes in trees not for insects, but for sap.
it digs lines of these wells in many kinds of trees.
this american woodpecker uses its drilling skills to bore neat sockets in dead tree trunks.
acorns are its main food, but during the season, there are far more acorns than the woodpeckers can eat immediately.
they hammer the acorns into the holes so firmly that few other creatures can get them out, and the store will keep the acorn woodpeckers supplied throughout the year.
the ripening acorns herald the end of summer and the beginning of autumn.
others are packed with nourishment, not for animals, but to provide food for the germinating seedling, but the animals eat them just the same.
even the hard and unpromising-iooking acorns of the american pin oak are collected by racoons.
the squirrel's habit of burying acorns for a winte store has been the start of many an oak.
the black bear, on occasion, will eat fish and voles and even carrion, but much of its diet is vegetable.
it will dig for roots and even eat pine cones, but it has a very sweet tooth and just now it relishes the fruit.
all sorts of mammals are now clambering around in the trees in search of fruit.
the possum, a strange primitive animal of the americas related more closely to kangaroos than to rats, eats almost anything.
few of them can get to the very tops of the trees or the thinnest twig, but a chipmunk can.
so the green chlorophyll in them is broken down and withdrawn into the tree, revealing the red and brown waste products, and the leaves fall.
and they, too, provide food for another woodland community, the inhabitants of the leaf litter.
they themselves are hunted by monsters in miniature, pseudoscorpions, horrific in close-up, but, perhaps fortunately, the size of a pinhead.
snails are giants in comparison and, since they carry their shells around with them, they might seem to be fairly well protected against any creatures smaller than a bird.
shrews eat most small living things they come across, and they are formidable hunters, for they are one of the few mammals that has a poisonous bite.
the salamander's only defence is to produce an acrid liquid from glands on its tail
so in really cold spells, they must get up and warm themselves with a little exercise, even though it dangerously depletes their fat reserves.
but in these american woodlands there is one spectacular sleeper who dozes for months on end.
she retired to this den in early autumn, and after a month or so of drowsiness, produced her cubs.
in the colder northern parts of these woods, she may spend six or seven months here, during which time she suckles her cubs but neither feeds herself nor urinates nor defecates.
the plants that live close to the ground now make haste to sprout and flower and soak up the spring sunshine before the trees above produce their own leaves and cut out the light.
the bear's den is empty, but the owners haven't gone far.
these must be mature and ready to discharge their microscopic spores by the time the dry winds of summer begin to blow, so that their spores, like dust, will be carried all through the forest.
once, the woods of north america stretched over the eastern half of the continent in an almost continuous band hundreds of miles deep.
i'm on the borders of florida and georgia in the southern united states, and here it's very hot in the summer and the winters are very mild, with only a few frosts, and none of them severe.
so some of the broadleaved trees here, like this oak, don't shed all their leaves in the autum but keep them throughout the year and continue growing.
in some parts where the soil is very rocky or sandy and poor in nutrients, the pines will grow because nothing else can survive there.
but this pine forest owes its existence to another factor altogether.
they burn at a relatively low temperature, and by the time the flames have consumed them, the main fire has swept by and the bud at the top of the stem, from which new growth will come, is still unharmed.
fires like these are notjust the work of careless people, they occur naturally.
the spark that regularly sets fire to these forest is lightning.
in this part of the southern states, violent thunderstorms are common and lightning often strikes the taller trees, scoring a deep groove down the length of the trunk as it flashes down to earth.
and this at my feet is the tinder which set it aflame.
these are pine needles, and they're so full of resin and they're so dry that they flame up very easily.
but the fire they produce is not very hot, and it's also very short-lived, so that if any creature can survive fire forjust one or two minutes, then it can survive a fire like this.
the rattlesnake, like many other ground-living animals, regularly takes refuge from the midday sun in holes, so now it knows exactly where to go to escape the fire.
rattlesnake and tortoise do not normally interfere with one another and that seems to be the way things are going to stay.
but in the back of the burrow lies another refugee, an indigo snake, and it, on occasion, eats rattlesnakes.
beetles find it difficult to lay their eggs in the pines because the trees swamp them with resin.
but a tree killed by fire can't resist, and these beetles take advantage of the situation.
the fire has cleared away the old growth on the ground, and by reducing the pine needles to ash has released their nutrients into the soil, and now the ground sprouts more flowers than at any other time.
because of regular fires, big bushes can't establish themselves here, so swampy areas are not colonised and sucked dry by them as happens elsewhere, and open marshes remain where pitcher plants can grow and where frogs can swim and breed.
indeed, one species of frog lives nowhere else but in these pools in the american pine barrens.
the woodpeckers here can't excavate their nest in dead trees as do woodpeckers elsewhere, for in this fire-ravaged forest they would risk incineration, so the red-cockaded woodpecker drills its holes in living pines.
but the wood is so hard, it takes several woodpeckers about two years to dig the hole.
resinous sap seeps out around the hole where the outer layers of the tree have been breached.
so the birds make their hole low down on the trunk where the inner sap-free heartwood is thick enough to accommodate the entire nest.
the flow of resin is diverted to the outside by drilling pits like sap wells above and below the hole.
it's in these laboriously excavated holes that the red-cockaded woodpecker raises its young.
the holes are very conspicuous, for each is surrounded by a sheet of yellow congealed resin.
since the woodpecker's hole in the living tree has to be fairly low down on the trunk, it is within easy reach of the snake and therefore might seem to be in considerable danger.
but now the other function of all that resin, deliberately produced around the nest by the woodpecker, is about to become clear.
so fire, one way or another, influences the whole community of animals and plants in the pine forests of the south.
this injury was also caused by fire, and this is also a coniferous tree, but a very different one.
it's thought to be about 2,500 years old, but the largest individual tree of all is this one known as the general sherman.
it's just taller and it's estimated to weigh 1,385 tons, which makes it the most massive living organism in the world.
although these trees are growing almost as far south as the southern pines, the climate here, 2,000 metres up in the sierra nevada mountains, is much colder and snow lies on the ground for almost half the year.
it's as though, by climbing to this height, we have returned climatically to the great forests of the north.
during the ice age, these sequoias grew over much of north america.

there the other great group of forest trees, the broadleaved trees, come into their own.

send down a sign that we may know who it is you seek to address.
well, i've been going to one called the, uh, fabulous funtime circus.
and i told the seer there that, um, i work for the steele agency.
big ones, seedy ones, right up until the time he left.
there have been times when i've imagined he ran away to someplace like this.
now that turk's gone, christy will have to hire a new aerial act.

but until you've won five of these, i'm afraid the vault must remain closed.
i had a strange round of cat and mouse with him this evening.
but if he's the murderer... what did he hope to gain by conjuring up turk's name, eh?
well, at the very least, we've asked someone too many questions.
yeah, i wish they'd just answered " no comment." what have you got, mildred?
people who may have had a vested interest in lying to you.
whoever was at their stations that night... and whoever wasn't, is still a mystery to us, isn't it?
whoever the accomplice was, when he got back to the circus that night, he was way off his game... knowing that he'd left guy hanging from that museum ceiling.
so far off his game that he never checked the rigging, so christy fell.
if that were your real reason, i think you'd stay to defend yourself.
does it bother you to see a woman take a fall?
max, a few weeks ago, when guy nickerson joined up here... did he have much to do with turk?
guy was only here one or two days before turk's accident.
he knew all the regulars worked as shills... so he rigged the séance to see how they'd react.
i mean, any experienced carny knows how to rig a séance.
come to us, o rupert... my guide to the spirit world.
come, o grand guardian of all that is... vibrant and flowering.
- early this morning... uh, someone assaulted our files- and my cranium.
we have reason to believe this someone is connected with your circus.
if i'd known the lure of the circus was gonna turn your head around completely...
i wouldn't have spent a small fortune on champagne and flowers.
i want you to check out a man named guy nickerson.
it seems someone tried to send him over the ferris wheel this morning.
guy didn't have the bible, and the police never found it.
you don't end up hanging by your feet from a museum ceiling without someone's help.
with all the things that's been going on around here, i figured i'd get the blame.
if that were your real reason, i think you'd stay to defend yourself.
i know you have eyes, mouth, nice boobs, ...beautiful hair and all that is what i don't want here.
can't you see she's looking for a place to bring him to the world?

i have to tell you something very important and then we'll get to sleep.
anna will take care of you, she's a better mother than me.
can't you see she's looking for a place to bring him to the world?
i don't want to get used to see your belly here.

to get here from margari, i walked one day and one night.

if a bad human law denies the living poor the right to have a land on which, laying his foot, he can say, "this is mine,"
it cannot deny the dead the right to have a grave.
and now he wants to rest in peace in the grave that he dug with his own hands.
60 years ago, this man, now dying, went up for the first time on the lands of margari and built with his own hands the first house with canes and clay.
but the baron of margari savagely denies us the permission to bury our dead, to keep them under our eyes and to guard them.
we have been tolerating this torment without crying until now, content with praying, entreating with hands joined this savage man.
that man has built on our lands, not only without paying the rent, but without even asking for permission.
i mean, we're no longer free to go for a walk on our own property.
if you want to stay on our land while you're alive, stay there.
but the abuse of having you even after you're dead, that i'll never allow.
he had himself carried in the land that he had chosen, where our graveyard was supposed to rise in front of his grave.
he wants to die in the open air, among his people and be buried underneath its grass.
they were staring at me with such an insistence that in the end, i was forced to turn around.
but of course, mom, it is you who sent for me.
when you used to sit here in this corner, i thought,
"if she's thinking about me from so far away, i am alive for her."
i'm not alive for you anymore, and i never will be.
i'm having a hard time, my son, following what you're saying.
learn to look at things with the eyes of those who can't see them anymore.
it will be painful, of course, but that pain will make them more sacred and more beautiful.
maybe it's just to tell you this that i had you come all the way here.
i know, mom, what your eyes are looking at right now.

the minister of foreign affairs, we are listening and are obliged to be concise, as difficult as it may be.
mr president, my trip to the middle east took place during the american secretary of state's.
two theories, the optimistic one is that some anarchists are playing with fire.
one day or another, they will make a mistake and we'll get the letter.
not forgetting the one from the press who thinks she's special and who takes interest in taunting me.
ever since you married me because i was the prefect's daughter, you have humiliated me, denied me,
blamed me for my sterility, used me because i was useful.
in 30 years of marriage, i helped you in your career through 3,589 luncheons, dinners or banquets,
30 bastille day ceremonies and november 11 commemorations, to which local holidays should be added, awards ceremonies, technical school inaugurations, nurseries, weddings, funerals, not to forget the christmas trees.
i've kissed so many children, how could france ever claim to be lacking?
you could be the first to know how to prepare for it.
but you have only one idea, ruin the next in line.
but i'm not, i'm scared and i'm not strong, and i'm not brave.
so just to humor me would you please let me drive you home?
look, are you gonna be taking me to dinner every night?
what kind of agent can i be when there's somebody with me?
and as such he knew that all of us in this business were just fighting the odds knowing the odds could beat us all.
we know full well that tomorrow we may meet once more at each other's throats.
look, i know you don't like tears, i know they frighten you more than bullets so i'm sorry about this little scene.
but you brought it all on yourself because it would have been totally unnecessary if you hadn't been killed which you haven't been.
last night, he attacked blade with a knife in the back of his jaguar.
this morning, joe was found hanging in his office by his temp secretary too.
heh, you can't always count on lady friends being able to cook.
that's one of the advantages i've had to bumming around the world half my life.
me and the chick here paid for some privacy and we expect it, so beat it, huh?

do you know what it must take to offend that man's sense of decency?
- i'm so glad that i was the one to do it.
lee thinks that the killer came back to the room for something that he left there.
assuming that the man that climbed in the window was the killer and not some maniac prowler.
i want you to pick up some things in my apartment in the morning.
uh, aftershave, a couple of sweaters and a small but provocative selection of wines.
i'll tell you something, it is going to be a mess outside.
now, i am just gonna take this upstairs and drink it.

russell sinclair was very successful in his buzz blade television series so successful that he wanted to get out of the show so he could make the buzz blade movie.
all the months of work, all the money, trying to get this fuckin' thing to work.
without our little dyp, there'd be no guidance system, no tank.
police found the body of 40-year-old frank holtzman in the car, the engine still running, an apparent suicide.
he was an employee of digical technologies, where he worked as a senior systems engineer...
i mean, you heard yourself they haven't ruled out foul play.
what if he was killed and they made it look like suicide?
i want to say i'm so proud, so very proud, to announce that this company, thought to be on the brink of extinction two months ago, has won the contract to build the guidance system for the xm-10 tank!
this victory was due to your hard work and the brilliance, the brilliance of people like wylie cooper.
and soon our beautiful guidance system will travel back east to be assembled with other components to create not a war machine but a peace machine.
and two short years from now, the xm-10 annihilator tank will be the latest super-weapon in america's arsenal!
yeah, you could do that, scream for help, or like, run away.
but other than looking like a pcp freak, you are for sure saying adios to your lucky new life.
but this is so much cheaper and quicker, they kick back and call me.
it's like room servicio. "jeff, we need a dyp-gyro, send one up."
you stole the dyp, which is classified material, fraudulently claimed it as your own, and committed treason by accepting cash for it from a foreign agent.
now that is where you're at, wylie, unless you wanna listen to my deal...
the dyp prototype worked by itself but the final version is installed next to the wam.
the point is, if the wam overheats, it could make the dyp malfunction.
i think he may be kind of a problem at the test on monday.
if wylie cooper is going to make it awkward for everybody, we'll just have to make sure he's not at the test.
it may not rank up there with the theory of relativity, but it will work.
and if you don't use it, if you don't redesign the dyp-gyro,

legislating support for that appropriation, never very strong has been growing steadily.

i can't very well let the sheep starve now, can i?
fha procedure is to have these purchases approved before you make them.
the guy and his family's barely hanging on the way it is, farm prices being what they are.
the point is we need to cut our losses, get what we can, before these people are in so deep there's nothing left to get.
do you remember us buying 100 sacks of feed from longley's last august?
well, not exactly, but i'm sure i've got it written down somewhere.
it was on that basis we loaned you almost $100,000 for livestock and improvements on your land.
last year, you paid almost $18,000 in interest on those long-term loans.
are you gonna be able to pay that off in january, plus the interest?
well, we may be a little short on one or the other, but we only got 280 corn this year.
gil, you tell me you wanna take your family on a trip around the world at christmas or you tell me you wanna borrow $40,000 for a new mercedes benz and maybe i could loan you the money.
but if you're in here asking for a farm loan, then, uh...
the number just has to support every loan that we make.
you make your numbers work and i'll do everything i can to help you.
that's what you'll be if you don't stay out of it.
well, i'll tell you, i'd rather be a thief than do what you do for a living!
oh, god, you wanna talk about grain prices, go talk to somebody else...
i didn't come over here to talk about grain prices, mcmullen!
you got a solution for this, why don't you tell me?
never would've borrowed the goddamn money from the fha to start with!
but we can't... worry about what's already been done because there's nothing we can do to change that.
so, what we have to think about now is how we're going to keep this family going.
you mean even if your name's on it, you're not allowed to look at it?
no, it's just that there's other people's names on that list besides...
mrs. ivy, you must realize that a government foreclosure is a legal act.
this little show you people put on here this morning isn't gonna stop the wheel from turning.
tomorrow, you can come out here and you can haul off all our stock.
but when you come out to pull us off this land, you better come with more than a piece of paper!
not much point in you standing out here in the cold, is there?
i don't expect you to say much to me, but that boy in there might need to hear something.
stand there by the sink and drink it like i usually do.
and when i'm done, i'm going to my place, light a fire, maybe read a little, then i'm going to bed.
(woman) in national news today, a federal judge ordered the us government to stop all fha farm foreclosures until such time as the farmers and their families have received their constitutionally guaranteed rights of due process under the law.
the class action suit involved some 230,000 farmers in 44 states.
the judge enjoined the fha from foreclosing on borrowers or from cutting off family living and farm operating expenses unless the farmers are given an opportunity to apply for loan extensions and deferrals.
the judge ruled that if application for these services is rejected, the farmer may seek a hearing before a higher fha official who was not involved in the original decision.
mr smith, i don`t believe this conversation is getting us anywhere.
our policy is... l`m willing to work the first month without any pay.
is that why you stay in your room all the time?
well it won`t be for long. l`m not regular here you know.
they ought to play football games during the week for the unemployed.
look, i think l`d better wait outside for mrs goody in case she comes home early.
every time he gets the job, he promises it will be different but it never is.
i don`t know why i even bothered to ask him what happened this time.
oh good, first you`re worried about your brother and now you`re worried about me.
maybe you ought to spend a little time worrying about yourself.
i thought it`d be a lot more fun to ride to work than walk.
i think a little cool air on your face wakes you up in the morning.
aren`t we a little too old to be riding bikes to work?
leslie being afraid has nothing to do with being too old.
oh yes, they should be replaced but they won`t spend the money.
tell you what, why don`t i barbecue some hamburgers and hotdogs out here?
where did sidney go l`ve got his burger ready the way he wants it, burnt at the stake.
i think he decided to try and lure estelle out here.
and the darn thing is just so cute, i can`t get rid of him.
my problem is, he cries like crazy when he is alone.
could you see your way clear to taking care of him for me during the day.
you know, feed him a little bit, take him for a walk.
oh no no no, i understand that but i figure in two weeks he would have grown up a little bit and won`t be so scared.
l`ll be honest with you, i didn`t know who else to ask.
oh come on, don`t play mickey the dance with me. l`ve been there.
i know the difference between a straight john and a conman.
do you want to talk to me want to talk to the cops?
go on... i have been to every nursery, every bicycle shop in town and none of them have heard of you.
listen i don`t know if you`re a harmless kook or a dangerous kook but l`ll tell you one thing, i am not leaving you alone with my sister.
not until the police have a chance to check you out.
what good is it going to do you to go to the police?
l`ll be gone by the time you get back and i won`t have finished my job.
look, selling this place wasn`t my idea, i just work here.
this is no picnic for me l`m out of a job.
if that home is sold, those old people will be split up, sent who knows where.
and for some of them, that`s the only family they`ve got.
l`ll sell it to you or anybody else for the same price.
those old people don`t have that kind of money and you know it.
a little gambling or seeing those old people thrown out on the street ?
listen, they even play bingo in church if it`s for a good cause.
so the decision is yours... lf we get lucky, you can own this place.
if we`re not, you`re going to be right back where you started.
the other day i only saw belts in the wardrobe and they're hard to walk on.
how did your mother react when she heard he was getting married?
i'm only here because the minister wants us to look at all proposals.
we're not sectarian, but his competitor baudrier... deserves our attention for being a social employer.
give people some time off and they want to give birth.
my wife and children are waiting to go on a trip to the countryside with me.
i told rousseau i'm almost broke... and she takes him here.
and you invite him to dinner... with friends who make the rothschilds look like communists.
when i was a kid, we used to hide easter eggs.
i have robespierre in the living room and you hide easter eggs?
i tell rousseau i'm on the brink of failure and she brings him here.
he'll dine with friends that make the rothschilds look like trade unionists.
pigging out on louis xv and caviar on the back of your poor workers is in the tradition of your class.
that you're a useless womaniser who reduced his ex-wife to alcoholism confirms what i thought of you.
they were onto him, they followed him to the drop and waited there to find out who the pickup was.
if there was a message, she's got it with the chilidogs.
oh, well, i was out shopping, and i got a little hungry and i decided to stop off and get something to eat.
i'd heard that milo's daffy dogs had the best chilidogs in washington, so...
i want you to find out what happened to her any way you can.
and if she is alive, i want you to find her.
why, she wound up calling a nurse and having me thrown out of the hospital.
lee, they may have shown her the message that martinez left for you and tried to make her break the code.
why don't you go up to your room and go to bed with a good book and forget all about these dreams?
now, i am going to go to the market, get some meat and make your favorite dinner.
why does it have to be before my mother gets back?
because no one is supposed to know that you know me.
when you visit the white house, what are you gonna talk to the president about?
i am going to ask the president to see the inside swimming pool and the bowling alley.
- typical of him a large portion of his, uh, itinerary has been kept secret.
and we're going to try and find out, uh, what that secret part is.
already one of your people has been here asking about the plane.
fortunately, polo de gregorio never buys these things in his own name.
when we started toward the end of the runway i saw my entire life flash before my eyes.
when you heard me say "terminate you" i didn't mean it in the ultimate sense.
i took a chance that you knew what you were talking about with that code word.
i phoned your house, and your mother, in a rather loud way told me she hadn't seen you.
the trouble is, when sam met this artist semenko, he hated him.
he told him not to paint diane's picture and to get out.
this is starting to look like a diagram for our old double steal.
when the pitcher goes into his wind-up, the runners break for second and third.
i was afraid she might think i was serious, but i see now that the humour of this isn't wasted on anybody.
it's the most powerful statements of melancholy i've seen and sam will appreciate that it's atrabilious yet not a bit lugubrious.
i feel as if i've learned to be picky about everything.
i think i already had that in me but i feel as if bresson revealed it to me.
now, for the first time in years, he lets himself be filmed and photographed.
we're starting the press conference for the film you have just seen
mr bresson, i didn't find your film very pleasant but it was interesting.
your very specific style has been described as being frustrating for the spectators.
but in film circles he is regarded as a great master because of the unique style of his films.
he calls this style "cinematographe", to distinguish it from usual film styles - the "cinema".
i remember seeing him work and it seemed to be both very simple and completely incomprehensible.
no one on set seemed to understand what he was doing.
for example, he would reshoot a very simple shot 50 times.
and no one really knew why he reshot it 50 times.
but i understand it very well now that i make films myself because it happens to me, too.
sometimes when i'm directing the crew look at me as if i'm mad because i'm looking for something and i'm not really sure what.
he had a big influence on us because he was our model.
he set an example as someone who refused to make any concessions to commerce, who made pure cinema and who, of all the french directors, was the one who made arthouse films.
but i was interested in other problems, in films which i selected from our archives in our film library.
i was fascinated by joan of arc, by it's absolute independence from the audience watching the film.
when i worked with bresson, there were things which... which i remember well and which seemed e_raordinary.
first there was the tone of voice you had to use.
later i decided it was like when you want to lose your balance and you spin round, for example, several times in each direction, as if you were dancing.
then you start to lose consciousness and it's as if a weight has dropped om you.
every thing bresson does is calculated down to the tiniest detail
once you've worked with bresson, it's hard to really act aftem/ards, in other words, to show om...
you end up playing down the pe_ormance so that when you come to make other films...
as a rule, actors are asked not to play down the pe_ormance but, on the contrary, to exaggerate it.
after three weeks, working as quietly as possible, i managed to separate three planks, iengthwise.
but they were still attached at the top and bottom, fastened by joints which bent my spoon.
i'd splintered the frame but over a wider area than i'd intended.
i managed to put the piece back and hold it in place.
you have to say things mechanically, but while you are saying things mechanically, a change takes place inside you and there is a turnabout that makes the mechanical come alive.
it's very similar to the way one great pianist plays the piano - not a virtuoso, but a great pianist - namely lipatti.
meanwhile, to the right of the steps the festival is revealing its charms.
it is an honour to present the award for best director to robert bresson for money.
mr bresson, when i watch your films, i get the feeling that they contain a moral - a rather dark, pessimistic moral - and that in your later films, the moral gets even darker.
so there there seems to be almost a contradiction between this pessimism and the beauty of the form.
you have to make the most of two e_raordinary appliances - the camera and the tape recorder combined - to write something on the screen.
and it has to be new because the appliances are new.
and this newness must be beautiful if we aspire to an ideal of beauty for things and people in general.
do you think you have changed over the course of your career?
unfortunately there's the audience, the cinemagoers, or moviegoers as they're known, who just expect to see theatre photographed.
they want to see the whole person and not just their hands or their face or their elbow or their leg.
i didn't wanna spend the afternoon explaining why grandpa wasn't there.
i don't think he'd understand oil leases and the latest in sonar technology yet.
father, this strange feeling, this charged feeling of being part of an operation this huge, well, it's pretty heady stuff.
well, take a vey deep breath, son, because the air does smell a lot sweeter when you 're standing on top of the mountain.
the tradition you started when you were just a secretay, with an eye out for the boss and a better life.
if that boss had been married, my guess is it wouldn't have stopped someone like you for a minute.
i suspect the headaches are just a part of the healing process.
i did tell you that following a skull fracture, occasional headaches were not abnormal.
oh, i know who i'm dealing with, but it's not going to undermine our effort.
we're developing a vast new source of oil, and for that, i would do business with anyone.
no. i'm lucm that our paths didn't cross in hong kong.
but i'm sure that you can handle him and i do really wish you well in this venture.
mark, how many times have i told you that i don't like your eavesdropping?
see that the luggage gets back to my apartment right away.
there will always be another deal but there won't always be a chance for you to reconcile with your father.
it took you two so long to accept each other and i wouldn't want to be part of anything that would destroy that relationship.
well, steven can't seem to let go of this wild fantasy.
in it, you see, i'm the pirate who makes off with his evaluation report and then claims it as my own.
it's a lovely lunch, but it isn't why you asked me here.
there is something i wanted to talk to you about, kirby, away from the others.
why don't you take your hangover and your bloody may and go.
"down to your quarters, mark." you forgot to throw that in this time.
claudia makes you happy so how can i help but be fond of her?
i feel ashamed that i ever suspected you of being involved in that awful plot against claudia.
it's hardly the first time that i've been set up, but i'll survive.
i think we should put the whole episode out of our minds.
i'm sory, mrs. colby, but this is what mrs. carrington ordered for the buffet.
she must have overlooked the fact that i was going to be here. i adore caviar.
just aim right down your arm at the target, and fire.
look, i know it might feel strange to you but lust like you said, it's for protection.
he tells me there's a chance i might have my licence suspended.
and i could maybe get 90 days for laying those taped phone calls on your daughter-in-law.
well, if that happens, you've only your own stupidity to blame.
tying to drive that girl over the edge and thinking that you can frame me for such a horrible scheme.
hey, look, mrs. colby, i'm sory about the threat, i didn't mean it.
look, you've got a lot of influence downtown, if i lose my licence, if i spend three months in a slammer, i'm out of business.
all i can say for now is that the stoy implicating me in that arms deal is a lie.
mrs. carrington, how soon can we expect a press release from you?
to get in my office and to run this thing down.
if i can't do it from here, i'm gonna fly to hong kong, let us through.
you and i are gonna be flying to hong kong tomorrow.
we're gonna track down ahmed, and get to the bottom of this mess.
yes, but you couldn't have known how it would turn out.
i knew that the whole situation in the china sea was unstable, but to get a powder keg to explode, somebody's gotta light a fuse.
his father mathias, his mother katharina his two little boys, ernst and anton and his young wife, maria.
his brother eduard and his sister pauline might have wanted to leave the poor hunsrück village as well.
you act like the lord of the manor and if your father weren't so old and doddery he ought to tan your arse!
i've been digging up potatoes all day with marcel and roger.
no, not to anyone in the village not even the mayor.
if anyone asked, she said "it's a child." and that was sufficient.
if i catch you, there'll be no pardon never mind being related.
you were a fool as a child and you've remained one.
my duty to say a few words to you so that we appreciate the significance of this hour.
at this moment countless telephone girls in the whole reich are feverishly occupied at the telephone exchanges consummating a minor miracle of our technology.
between narvik and salonika whether in the air or underwater whether in trenches or staff bunker every fighting german soldier can be reached from home by telephone at any time.
and thus we can unite our bride here with her bridegroom, our dear anton fighting far away.
but this common soldier, herr zacharias he's got a sort of nobility, i saw it.
while others at the field kitchen wolfed their food down he, the artist he ate slowly just morsels with his spoon.
this house is going to be reconstructed so it would look like it did before.
i even think they kept arms here to use it for overthrowing autocracy.
it is a pity... that i have to believe your words.

this story happens on the island of madeira, on an ordinary day.
or rather, a very special day, the day of the picnic of dreams.
to build the thing they dream of, they need a very special forest.
only one forest on the island summons dreams, but it's in the middle of the island beyond the volcanoes, in a former tourist zone now overrun with rabbits and the ghosts of pirates.
photos were taken of this ship which was only a dream.
a historic event that we can copy but we'll dream of a hospital.
in short, manuel fails to fall asleep in time, and finds himself alone among nightmare trees.
he knows that no one's dreaming of hospital, but of trees.
that one is mandez pinto's, that, freitas da silva's, this one, goveia's.
the frightening accumulation of disorderly dreams makes manuel afraid of forest.
bodies, their souls gone, house new, charitable souls that gave their last coin to these living jails, the bodies of beggar pirates.
to leave your eternal body, just recover the coin you gave.
from now on, all the money you find you'll put it in this bank.
i'll give you a small coin every day that you'll put in it.
a danish sailor who had lost wife, ship and money, was assigned to take me to my aunt's house.
in those days, my aunt oversaw one of the island's remotest museums.
for the first time ever, he achieved the double fecundation of the ovules of two local women by two nobel prizewinner's sperm, and the re-fecundation of the foetuses by each other.
all this in the belly of another local celebrity, broad-jump champion anna melo sousa who died 4 years before completing this genetic feat, but was kept in hibernation to permit the birth of the girl prodigy who's just had her hair done.
marylina, my friends, travels with her retinue of child geniuses and her fiancé, rock solgadostrec, who, a few months ago, has exchanged brains with famed pianist andré zehloo so he could reach the little champion's mental level.
i just want to say that i love mr. rock very very very much and that they filled his head with mr. zehloo's brain.
she was adopted by the u.s. president, and despite her amity toward ussr, she travels with her personal guard of marines and a detachment of swedish un blue berets.
as a reporter, i'm very impressed by the atmosphere around this charmer, the world chess champion.
i'll say a little more about our champion if i can recall any more about her.
so, you already know, marylina will be 8 in 3 days.
- as the meiji era began, the feudalistic tokugawa shogunate was replaced by the new government.
they knew early on that they needed to develop hokkaido's reclaimed lands for the sake of the new westernized japanese government.
however, the unbelievably harsh weather and sparse population made it impossible to enter the area and development was substantially delayed.
as a result, the hokkaido pioneer group's leader, kuroda kyotaka met with governor ito hirobumi and they decided to send all the prisoners in japan to hokkaido to do the work.
in the 14th year of meiji (1881), about 75 miles north of sapporo by the ishikari river, they built kabato prison.
this story starts early in the winter of the 16th year of meiji (1883).

the nine guards in charge of the second cell, will be punished with a 50%% % salary cut for 6 month.
we will cut 1 cup of rice from the prisoners' rations for next 3 days.
- just to see her man for the one day, she works here the whole year for nothing.
i don't know whether the woman is stupid or the warden is a devil.
although tsukigata is from a samurai family, in fact, the lowest rank close to farmers, his career has come to a dead end.
if he were from satsuma or choshu, he might have a chance.
so, day and night, every person literally has millions of different thoughts.
when this town is buried in snow, tears will break out from my heart.
hard to believe that tengoku would let me go so easily.
- dearest, i'll do anything to get you out of here!
they are poor farmers who were cheated and sent to hokkaido by lying officials of the new government!
if i don't help them, who will build the roads for them?
but it's outrageous that over 400 prisoners lost their lives in two and a half years.
the person responsible for your assignment, minister kuroda, will be the prime minister when the next cabinet is organized.
tell him neither the prime minister nor development agency director can handle the development of hokkaido!
only a bad luck charm like me can bring light to hokkaido.
by then, i will have finished the minenobu road, and started the construction of the kamikawa road.
after that, even a fool like you can easily finish it!
"sukoshi okurete yuki ga furu..." (and a little later, the snow cries.)
"onna setsunaku hokage ga yurete..." (a woman cries as the flame flickers.)
"yuki ga mau tori ga tobu..." (snow falls, a bird flies,)
"hitori hagurete yume ga mau..." (i miss a chance and my dream disappears.)
but it was also a voyage, with the tartan's red sails...
just sky and water and that infantile pride of misfortune as when a child dressed in black says:
not so to speak ...but literally, because i was born on our piece of land...
near to a forest that the people of agrigento call cevasu, ...a dialectal corruption... of the old greek word kaos" luigi pirandello
my beloved children here writes your mother to your beautiful golden land from our vale of tears.
today it is 14 years ago since you left and for 14 years i've been alone waiting for you.
if they have told you that i have become insane ...don't believe them.
believe, my sons, in the words that this good girl is writing on behalf of me.
but no use to us here, and they disappeared over there.
if you were my mother i would drown you in your own water.
three months he kept me cuffed, with a gag in my mouth.
...because if he came near me, i screamed and bit him.
i am their vicar and speak in the name of god.
he put us on this earth not only to live, but to live and to die too.
the founder of our village who now wants to rest in peace in the grave he dug himself.
sixty your ago this dying man came from the land of magari for the first time and built the first house from clay and straw.
but now you're dead and you can't think about me anymore.
...i'm no longer alive to you anymore and will never be.
you will feel sorrow, that is sure but that will make them holier and more beautiful.
maybe i asked you to come just to tell you that.
e' bello il pensier, e' nuovo ed e' mio, e d'altri e d'altri non e'
that the thought is beautiful, brand new and mine and not at all of other people.

now there are many others and more than one hundred people live here.
if the carabinieri won't intervene the old one will let himself be buried alive when he hears about my ban.
you can stay and live on my land, but only while you are alive.
...i'm no longer alive to you anymore and will never be.
i'm finding it hard to follow what you are saying, luigi.
you must learn to see things through the eyes of those who can no longer see.
you will feel sorrow, that is sure but that will make them holier and more beautiful.

for three months, he kept me gagged and tied because i was screaming.
and as soon as he came close to me, i would bite.
today, it's been 14 years since you left, and for 14 years your mother has been alone waiting for you.
in a week, another group of wretched people will leave for the americas.
i hid it because nobody would have wanted me had i confessed it before getting married.
now i am here before all of you, and i will tell you how my misfortune was born.
i couldn't give him to you as husband because he doesn't own anything.
but as a cousin and protector, that dumbhead will know what to do.
i can find it by groping my way in the dark.
and if there is the moon, i can see it with my eyes.
that year was great for the olives, despite the fog that had oppressed them during the blossoming.
someone had expected it and had ordered for his crop a jar as big as an abbess because the old enameled ones were no longer sufficient for him.
then you cross the riverbed, and you go up the other hill.
then you go down to the plane land, and there you'll find don lollo waiting for you.
don lollo, on your part, you have to free the prisoner immediately.
the potter, on his part, will have to answer for the damage caused because of his foolishness.
to get here from margari, i walked one day and one night.
and i have to be back up there early tomorrow for the cattle.
if a bad human law denies the living poor the right to have a land on which, laying his foot, he can say, "this is mine,"
it cannot deny the dead the right to have a grave.
and now he wants to rest in peace in the grave that he dug with his own hands.
60 years ago, this man, now dying, went up for the first time on the lands of margari and built with his own hands the first house with canes and clay.
but the baron of margari savagely denies us the permission to bury our dead, to keep them under our eyes and to guard them.
we have been tolerating this torment without crying until now, content with praying, entreating with hands joined this savage man.
that man has built on our lands, not only without paying the rent, but without even asking for permission.
i mean, we're no longer free to go for a walk on our own property.
if you want to stay on our land while you're alive, stay there.
but the abuse of having you even after you're dead, that i'll never allow.
he had himself carried in the land that he had chosen, where our graveyard was supposed to rise in front of his grave.
he wants to die in the open air, among his people and be buried underneath its grass.
they were staring at me with such an insistence that in the end, i was forced to turn around.
but of course, mom, it is you who sent for me.
when you used to sit here in this corner, i thought,
"if she's thinking about me from so far away, i am alive for her."
i'm not alive for you anymore, and i never will be.
i'm having a hard time, my son, following what you're saying.
learn to look at things with the eyes of those who can't see them anymore.
it will be painful, of course, but that pain will make them more sacred and more beautiful.
maybe it's just to tell you this that i had you come all the way here.
i know, mom, what your eyes are looking at right now.
"kingsley's potato chips may be new and improved but they're still a chip off the old block."
this from the man who gave the world the caldwell soup slogan.
whenever you leap to your feet and yell i know it's going to be a bomb.
look, why don't we knock off and try again tonight at your house?
i mean, even if the roads are slippery and muddy they can't hold us up too long.
the chances of getting hit by lightening are, well, extremely slim.
but there was a time when that terrible old cabin looked beautiful to me too.
i can't get over the look on that young couple's faces.
on board the space probe are photographic images of earth... verbal greetings and a medley of musical compositions.
voyager ii is our invitation... to other intelligent species in the universe:
according to the a.p. wire... one of the biggest meteorites to strike the planet earth in 80 years... hit last night near ashland, not far from chequamegon bay.
so you folks who called in to say you saw a flying saucer land--
you remember that package we sent up with the voyager probe?
there was a gold, anodized disk... with greetings from earth in 54 different languages... complete with a nice, little speech from kurt waldheim:
can you clone a living organism from the hair of a dead man?
well, human hair consists of keratinized cells... although in order to determine whether replication is possible--
it is also what the cannibal said to the missionary... just before he ate him.
the question in this case is... who is the missionary and who are the cannibals?
she had every chance in the world to get away from him... but they left together with her driving.
does that sound like any kind of kidnapping you ever heard of?
i got a hunch this might develop into a life-threatening situation.
we'd like a room for the night as far away from this as possible.
according to our best estimates, speed, course and trajectory... that object was headed for someplace in arizona.
now intelligence thinks the visitor is on his way here to make a rendezvous.
that's a handy little talent you got there, but you better spread it around.
these guys get curious if you hit too many jackpots at once.
listen, mr.fox, i'd like to be a team player... but there's something i want to call to your attention.
one thing i don't need from you is a lecture on morality.

it's just a map and some car keys and a credit card.

a guy name heinmuller had a collision with an orange and black '77 mustang.
now the gal who was driving claimed she was being kidnapped.
see, that's what he said to heinmuller out on the road.
it's also what the cannibal said to the missionary just before he ate him.
could you give these things to him after the bus leaves?
it's just a map and some car keys and a credit card.

in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
i told miss rogers we'd talk to her aunt and uncle.
i didn't say we'd take the job unless it was cash, up-front.
it's not my style to go out and hire a bunch of maverick soldiers on the run.
but at this point, i'll do anything to get my boy back.
i don't know for sure you guys are who you say you are... but i'm gonna take a chance.
the least you could do is to believe in my son's innocence.
the others here might agree that my recent behaviour... can only be described as normal.
a reasonable description, considering the fact... that i have consciously decided to conform to less-aberrant behaviour... simply because of your constant verbal abuse.
you know he was thrown in a venezuelan jail for smuggling drugs out of colombia.
he was supposed to be bringing back a shipment of turquoise... from the turquoise mining company in málaga.

i think it would be a good idea to give this dick nash a really rough edge.
but when you hear the word "eclipse," you will fall right back to sleep.
any chance you can make it so he won't want to kill us when he wakes up?
he's strange, but as long as he can fly, what do we care, right?
i thought we were getting dick nash to make this run.
we thought you might want to keep it for the court, as evidence.
if i were you, colonel, i would arrest them and forget about everything else.
i have friends in the colombian government... who could make things very difficult for you.
i couldn't care less about your friends in the colombian government.
after they found out that mr. corliss was behind all of this... they believed in robbie's innocence immediately.
i'm sure his military record had a lot to do with it, uncle jes.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
i told miss rogers we'd talk to her aunt and uncle.
i didn't say we'd take the job unless it was cash, up-front.
it's not my style to go out and hire a bunch of maverick soldiers on the run.
but at this point, i'll do anything to get my boy back.
your son and his partner ran a cargo-shipping business in long beach.
i'ii put this as diplomatically as i can, mr. hicks... but those businesses do everything but take out an ad for drug-running.
the others here might agree that my recent behaviour... can only be described as normal.
a reasonable description, considering the fact... that i have consciously decided to conform to less-aberrant behaviour... simply because of your constant verbal abuse.
to think of all the sodium pentothal we wasted... when all we had to do was hypnotise him.
could you fix it so we could do this all the time?
but when you hear the word "eclipse," you will fall right back to sleep.
any chance you can make it so he won't want to kill us when he wakes up?
a friend of hers investigated him last year on drug trafficking.
he fled the country and they were never able to extradite him?
if we could turn him over... we could open up a network of drug operations all over the world.
and if you two don't get out of there before somebody catches you... we're gonna find ourselves opened up all over the world.
i wanna know what's going on here. i wanna know where this pilot nash came from.
i wanna know what happened to the real pilot... and i wanna know who these friends of his are... that hung you two tough guys out to dry.
well, doctor... i guess you didn't understand your patient as well as you thought you did.
perhaps if we could wait for another moment of coherency... i could ask him again.
you see, what probably happened is my patient came right down through here... and crashed somewhere down the line.
if i can work with my patient... i'm sure he'll be able to lead us right to where the plane crashed.
we thought you might want to keep it for the court, as evidence.
if i were you, colonel, i would arrest them and forget about everything else.
i have friends in the colombian government... who could make things very difficult for you.
i couldn't care less about your friends in the colombian government.
after they found out that mr. coriiss was behind all of this... they believed in robbie's innocence immediately.
i'm sure his military record had a lot to do with it, uncle jes.
gee, that's all great, jimmy, but we came down here to buy volume.
now we've been here a week already, and we ain't heard word one from this boss of yours.
you know, penny looked in pretty rough shape on the way to jail.
i think maybe you oughta tell sam to spring her real fast... before she starts buying' some radio time.
we'll just sit right here and wait till you bring yours.
i think what dennis is trying to tell you is, we can either help you on this or we can hurt you.
well, no offense, dennis and mark, but, uh, you see, we've been working real hard on this case... and, well, based on your performance, i think you could help us a lot more... if you went ahead and tried to hurt us.
so anyway, burglary is setting up this sting operation... part of a burglary roundup in south dade.
gave me a capsule history of kovics and the south florida porn scene, but as far as artie lawson goes, they said there are certain aspects of the investigation they're not at liberty to discuss.
so basically what they did is they ran you around a federal hedge for an hour.
he moved out of his wired apartment, abandoned his car, stopped filing reports.
it was just blind luck that our agents found out you had connected with him.
not to mention that a federal agent can be terribly valuable... with what he knows of any criminal endeavor.
what i'm saying is some people down at the bureau... think that lawson's gone over to the other side.
we have got half a million dollars invested in this picture, right?
and our leading lady comes up to us and tells us... that she is 15 years old and her mother knows exactly where she is.
look, the man is on the edge and that makes it dangerous as hell.
maybe he had to go that far to make it happen.
all right, look, if we bring him in now, the entire kovics investigations goes down the tubes.
now, look, can you honestly tell me... that artie lawson hasn't gone over to the other side?
then he cruises down about two slips to the elmo two, boards her and drops a major load... on the harbormaster's forward deck.
you ever considered trading him in on a nice french poodle?
now that you found us, why don't you do a quick 180... and head back to your typewriters?
the last thing i need is a couple of sore thumbs in petrocelli suits... hovering around my boat while i'm trying to maintain an undercover role.
i don't want you or anybody else to question my methods.
if i make a strategic decision to cut corners, to throw the book away, that's my decision.
because when i haul him in, i want him to stay there.
when he goes down, he's gonna go down so hard he doesn't come up!
trudy and gina just hooked up with artie's porno queen girlfriend.
she says he's taking her to mexico when he makes the move with kovics.
that little bozo ain't gonna wire any of our people ever again.
see, you have to get yourself into a discovery... kind of mode of thinking, and then it's quite simple.
like for example, we found out, we can get about 50% more visual recording when you extend the counter space.
we also found out that by building up the platform, it helps with the intimidation factor.
you know, those, uh, mirrors at the amusement parks... the ones that warp everything out of whack?
i feel like i've been staring at myself in one for the past three days.
gee, that's all great, jimmy, but we came down here to buy volume.
now we've been here a week already, and we ain't heard word one from this boss of yours.
i mean, look, it's about two hours it took for the bail, and he even sends a car around so he can meet with you guys.
why is it up in jersey, our people are tellin' us... the man to see is sam kovics for porno down here, but after a week of tryin'to set it up, all we hear is artie?
we may have been on our way when you boys decided to hook a tow bar to us.
duncan or anybody you were with mention a man named artie rollins?
i think what dennis is trying to tell you is, we can either help you on this or we can hurt you.
well, no offense, dennis and mark, but, uh, you see, we've been working real hard on this case... and, well, based on your performance, i think you could help us a lot more... if you went ahead and tried to hurt us.
so anyway, burglary is setting up this sting operation... part of a burglary roundup in south dade.
they're lookin' for a couple of seedy-looking guys to work undercover.
crockett, what'd you do, put your beeper on vacation or what?
i spent more than two hours at the downtown terminal... trying to dig up something on this artie rollins...
the first thing, i get a 6:00 wake-up call... from these cuban bikers in the next room.
and next, i take... a detour, man, and i make a wrong turn on the don shula expressway.
- maybe put a platform back here... so it'll raise you up and make you feel and look more intimidating, you know.
and if you tack a couple ofhot centerfolds up here... between the tv and the camera, you'll get your suspects to leer up... so you won't be identifying people by hairstyle.
we got a meet with artie in six hours, and these bozos better not come up lame on the money.
i don't know if i feel too good about this guy, crockett.
you ever considered trading him in on a nice french poodle?
and then for an encore, he decides to pay a courtesy call to rolandez.
you wanna shut us down, pal, you better have a court order... because we've been busting our hump on this case for over two months now.
we're not about to pull the plug just so y'all can keep your image clean.
see, you have to get yourself into a discovery... kind of mode of thinking, and then it's quite simple.
like for example, we found out, we can get about 50% more visual recording when you extend the counter space.

i think we're gonna write a how-to pamphlet on burglary sting operations.
gee, that's all great,jimmy, but we came down here to buy volume.

so anyway, burglary is setting up this sting operation-- part of a burglary roundup in south dade.
i need to talk to you about, uh-- about my living conditions.
you see, one of the main reasons why i moved down here... was to improve the quality of my life--
[joplin ] crockett, what'd you do, put your beeper on vacation or what?
i spent more than two hours at the downtown terminal... trying to dig up something on this artie rollins-- i came up with a total blank.

i don't know if i feel too good about this guy, crockett.
[ man ] i been tryin'to get ahold of you on your beeper line all morning, ever since he cut loose.
the first thing he did was-- the first thing, he cornered this charter fare.
then he cruises down about two slips to the elmo two, boards her and drops a major load... on the harbormaster's forward deck.

i'm just a wheel in a big machine called the dea.
feed it some money and it makes a lot of noise.
figure someone threw half a mil at some junior clerk somewhere... and tapped into our central files.
for all i know, the employment records and agents and... photographs of every dea agent in north and south america are in their hands.
newton, did you hear about the revillas bust a couple of days ago?
yeah, i vaguely recall something about the... nasty little soiree in the everglades.
yeah, so we were aiming towards the midwest or the southwest.
well, the only west i deal with is the west side of new york.
(man) there's no way in heaven and there's no way on earth.
we were told that you would cooperate without asking any questions.
i've got a whole new set of priorities... and staying out of stir and out of the morgue drawer... are top on my list.
you guys are begging the revillas to come out and blow you away.
you knew we'd be spitting in the wind today, but you played along.
(jimmy) have i told you about this new shipment... of high-end electronic japanese wizardry...
until i get there... (crockett) until you get there, you lay low.
study some travel brochures, learn the language... (tubbs) beautiful clothes, beautiful cars... beautiful girls.
and that american dollar... is the best brand there is in the world.
now, those of us who have it... can make more of it... by loaning it to those who don't.
i want to know why a wall street address... is running interference for a couple of bloodthirsty colombian peasants.
i want to know why murder and mayhem are suddenly footnotes on a balance sheet.
i don't give a damn if it's the uss enterprise, pal, or who's on it, or why.
our job is to rock it, and if it sinks... so what?
our brother, andré jourdet, has been taken from his loved ones, at the age of 30.
in faith and in hope, let us return him to his rightful and merciful father.
we forgot that god, and here's the real meaning of"agape", loves us unconditionally, to the point where he became one of us, and suffered and died like us.
he rose from the dead, brought a lot of others back to life.
he's convinced i wasn't really dead, that i dreamt it all.
he says the bible never mentions immortality of the soul, because the word "soul" never appears.
you talk about hebrew and greek words for love, and you don't realize that right beside you other forms of love exist.
ever wondered if you and i love god in the same way?

i'm afraid to ask, but, er... what's up for prank night?
and i'm sure our little cinderellas would like to know, too.
i'm told that you've been vomiting in your trash can again.
if this continues, i'll be forced to cut off your day room privileges.
well, you're probably gonna think this is kind of strange, but i have this dream.
it's a recurring nightmare, actually, and i've had it ever since i was a little kid, and i've been having it a lot.
have you been to see a professional about this - a psychiatrist or psychologist?
no, my parents are really down on that kind of stuff.
we gotta move now if we want to get in on the ground floor.

why would they eat someone so old and sour as you?

we're in the champs-elysees theatre to see the cuban national ballet.
it's starring a dancer admired by ballet lovers all over the world, alicia alonso.
it led to a lot of things, to statements we could make so that people didn't believe that everything in cuba was a dream,
a golden island in the sun with palm trees, it wasn't like that at all.
i worked on documentation and technical data for the ruling class, the group in power, about 300 people.
i kept them abreast of progress in technology and in the consumer society, so that our leaders could appear informed abroad.
everyone was warned that if he sided with a person being purged, he too would immediately be purged.
this moral persecution in cuba has never been a matter of substance as people suppose.
it is purely formal, the simplest way to keep people distracted.
it's easy to persecute someone for the way he dresses or wears his hair.
the man told me to walk, to walk around the room.
i was surprised, but i obeyed and walked around the room.
one woman held on to a bus until she fell off.
the summons surprised me, i didn't have a record, no arrests, no trouble.
later i learned that in the boarding house where i lived there was a man, now also in exile in new york, who denounced me to get my room!
he had a brother, a soldier, who was high up in the secret police.
we were taken to buses hidden in a nearby park, ten or twelve of them, i'd say.
we were crammed into the buses and taken to state security hq.
there were huge fields of them that we had to uproot.
when i got back to camp, i had to pick thorns out of my ankles and feet.
it happened to a lot of people, and often to me.
i hung around the theatres and places in the prado district.
a lieutenant - a woman - made it her business to hound people like me.
she'd pick up a scrap of paper, rub our faces with it, put it in a folder, and give the folder to a judge,
around 4:30 or 5:00 one morning, the warden called us together.
he said that under a new law, all those caught near the embassy had to go to the usa.
"get out, fifi, it's going to get worse for you people."
he insisted so much that i went, no matter how much i cried.
but near it was la cabana, another prison, built by the spanish in the 16th or 17th century.
it's one of the most sinister political prisons in cuba, because there, they shoot people.
on a visit to cuba, he saw the union of writers and artists
he told nicolas guillen and other officials that he wanted to meet me.
if you try to leave cuba, you run into another law covering "illegal" exits.
if you try to swim to freedom, or stow away on a plane, you're leaving the country illegally and you get 4 or 5 or 6 years in jail.
on the day of my hearing there were no witnesses, no jury, only one military judge.
i didn't deserve a week in jail just because i had long hair.
another first: the only country in the world where a man tried to flee hiding in the wheel of an airliner.
they were trying to humiliate the people who wanted to leave by saying they were prostitutes and so on,
if after 20 years of revolution, of "exemplary politics", of what they call "the defense of man", of "culture" and "morality",
if after 20 years of that regime, you open the door a crack and 100,000 people leave in a few months,
most of them returned to italy impressed by what they had seen.
a tourist coming to cuba is shown a false view, a prefabricated image of cuban reality.
from the moment he lands at the airport, and takes a luxury bus to a large havana hotel, a tourist gets to see only well-kept streets.
then he visits the cathedral, the heart of the old town of havana, with its convents and churches.
but if he strays even 200 metres from the planned route, he'll see that havana is a disaster area.
tourists are under surveillance by guides, taxi drivers, and other employees the moment they reach their hotel.
they're told to use the hotel's taxis because they're cheaper and give better service and not to use just any taxi.
when a tourist gets into a hotel taxi, the driver asks him for his hotel card and room number.
they offer the tourists coffee and fruit, things that are rationed and scarce in cuba.
all over cuba, near tourist centres and hotels, you find people walking around, mostly very young men and women, who offer the tourists black market currency rates, or offer sex, in exchange for a pair of jeans, a sweater,
what it amounted to was a form of prostitution, "give me this and i'll pay you for it."
many of these women later recycled themselves into the 'new prostitution', living in good neighbourhoods, protected by powerful friends.
they tried to stimulate their libidos by showing them pictures of naked women,
on the other hand, when they were shown pictures of a man with an erection, they were induced to vomit.
he made us walk in the garden because we were safe there.
he struck me as being so lonely, of being a man at bay.
in fact, fidel's defence of his beloved julius caesar wasn't very brilliant.
caught off his guard, fidel argued that he was creating a new country, that he needed virile men, warriors, athletes, with no mental flaws.
they were all obsessed with homosexuality when visiting communist bloc countries.
ramiro valdes, minister of the interior, went to china and asked to meet the mayor of shanghai.
it's all tied up with spanish machismo, so apparent in castro.
everything he does is aimed at showing how macho he is.
at the end of the war, i had great personal power.
i didn't use our victory or the revolution to acquire more power.
it's an element that in itself implies that power isn't the only goal of adult life.
it's true, the militarisation of a culture is common in many countries, especially in communist countries.
i think we're seeing an evolution in communist culture, towards a military ideal.
and this is totally at odds with the basic principles that good leftists thought for years was the communist ideal.
first it had to do with the question of women, for example, a revolutionary of such intelligence and moral propriety, like rosa luxembourg, always refused to admit that feminist questions had any place within the framework of marxist concerns over justice.
and as questions about women or other sexual identities were tangential,
the discovery that homosexuals were being persecuted in cuba, shows, i think, how much the left needs to evolve.
it's not just a serious case of injustice that must be exposed, but something that compels people to take note of
a lapse in attitude of the so-called left, that goes back a long way.
i've worked tirelessly, from the start, to form a leadership team, a collective leadership, to create a party, and institutions
in which i placed all my personal influence, all my power.
i analyse and discuss collectively with comrades who command respect, and authority and revolutionary fame, the problems of the party and the country.
amnesty international, the humanitarian group, and the vatican had urged his release, but it was francois mitterrand personally, who convinced fidel castro to free valladares, seen here with his wife, who he hadn't met for 13 years.
the cuban authorities allowed the foreign press into the airport to show it was an act of clemency.
i'm happy to see my wife who i hadn't seen for so many years.
the change has been very abrupt very violent, i'm very moved.
it's in the jails that people are the best informed about what's going on in cuba.
every day, people land in there from all over the island, from all social classes.
cubans you meet on the street, live in constant and obsessive fear of going to jail.
when they get there, they say the things they're scared of saying outside.
for a gag, he aimed it at the sky and fired a shot.
the owner of the car showed up, an officer of the ministry of interior.
one day he escaped to watch cartoons on the guards' tv set.
to punish him, they put him in solitary, in the cell next to mine and that's how i heard his story.
"get me out of here, i want to see my mama".
the guards, annoyed by his crying, threw buckets of water at him.
you can still see on my hands where i was tortured.
for years i was in solitary, like so many others, in cells where there was no sunlight, and no electric light.
i left cuba in december 1967, for paris, where i studied sociology at vincennes university.
i was involved in the may '68 events, and later in feminist movements.
then one day, there was a knock on my door at 4 a.m.
i lived with my grandmother, she opened the door and three men came in.
most were naked, ate with their hands, had to defecate on the floor, and screamed all night.
the place was roughly one third the size of this room.
this was miguel fernandez, the director of all prisons and penitentiaries in the havana area.
he questioned me every night for a week, with a .45 pistol on his desk.
he tried to make me feel guilty by asking how i, a communist youth activist, who wasn't a lesbian, who had led an exemplary life, could get involved with such trash.
he questioned me about retamar and guillen, of the writer's union.
this agent of repression scorned not only vaguely dissident young people like me, but also cuban cultural bigwigs.
during my last questioning he tried to break me, since i was so naive, by saying,
i could go home provided that my parents delivered me, the next day at 2 p.m.
to a psychiatric hospital where i would remain the time necessary to eliminate the effects for which i'd been placed there.
in the end, we, the political prisoners, the few of us left there, were put in a small cell block only about 200 metres from the punishment block.
and in the still of the night, it was real torment to hear the women in there.
we're all trapped in paranoia, and we all feed that paranoia.
persecutors and persecuted alike, because at times the persecuted seem to be the persecutors.
well, and you... you would even be comfortable in the sahara, hm?
even without a computer, we've made you nice and strong and... and weatherproof.
patrik, when you're released from here, then we'll simply fly after him.
your father has five days of standby option and will visit us.
and then i will leave this fjord for good after three years.
and there in rome, and only there, and only under the condition that my statement can be heard in all countries of the world, will i disclose my secret.
we're still a long ways from wheat at altitudes of 2000m.
the professor says he can even plant pineapples on a glacier.
your relatives down in the valley would never have survived nights in this cold.
well, and you... you would even be comfortable in the sahara, hm?
but imagine, one could install the camera... in this bomber with a remotely operated transmitter... and take aerial photos.
- of course one could, but only if the plane were even smaller.
(announcement) dear passengers, we land in oslo in a few minutes.
we ask that you stop smoking, move your seats to an upright position, and fold the tray tables up in front of you.
in four and a half weeks... the u.n. world food commission will be meeting in rome.
and then i will leave this fjord for good after three years.
all you do is practise tai chi, you can't do the other.
tomorrow i'll go to the temple and i'll get a fertility lantern.
get up early in the morning and clean the house from top to bottom...
now that it's your turn to do the cleaning, you know how it feels.
to hit also means to distract your opponent and so confuse his attack.
distract your opponent in one direction and hit him from the other.
your father should have taught you that you have to work to live.
i'll teach you to make quilts so you'll have a real skill.
all you do is practise tai chi, you can't do the other.
tomorrow i'll go to the temple and i'll get a fertility lantern.
get up early in the morning and clean the house from top to bottom...
now that it's your turn to do the cleaning, you know how it feels.

distract your opponent in one direction and hit him from the other.
your father should have taught you that you have to work to live.
i'll teach you to make quilts so you'll have a real skill.
i'm not sorry he's dead, but i didn't have to kill him.
i've got six witnesses, five suspects, one very dead body and no case.
lf, on the other hand, i am indeed the world's greatest hypnotist,
i will accomplish what no other hypnotist can do... permanently prevent you from remembering one word that you hear.
you will only remember that you heard me... say important and revealing things about myself, but you will not remember what they are.
that memory will remain erased from your mind for all time.
[cagliostro] when i count to three and snap my fingers, you will wake up.
you will feel refreshed, alert and happy, and all things will be as i said they would be.
anyway, that contraption over there... took several men and a great deal of time to set up.
now, how could she have done that, on her own, in the half hour that elapsed between cagliostro's challenge and his death?
if zack let her in beforehand, she could have killed cagliostro and then left by the balcony.
she broke the glass to create a false trail, and then climbed down to the balcony below.
i've got six witnesses, five suspects, one very dead body, and no case.
six competent, intelligent, observant newsmen and women... actually witness a murder and can't tell me a thing.
you weren't in a trance just now, and you weren't in a trance last night.
you cleverly discovered how to outwit cagliostro's most powerful tool... his voice.
that's why you didn't respond when i called to you in the lobby... because you couldn't hear me.
upstairs in the room, you pretended to be in a trance like the others.
lieutenant bergkamp confirmed that you bought your earplugs in the gift shop.
and your reference to the elevator as a lift... suggested that you had spent some time in england.
you know, i'm liable to call you the next time i've got a mystery on my hands.
well, as long as it isn't involved with a locked room, please.
uh, excuse me, joan, but what idea for what new book?
##[elegant piano] anyway, marilyn thinks it's an absolutely sensational backdrop for a mystery.
lf, on the other hand, i am indeed the world's greatest hypnotist,
i will accomplish what no other hypnotist can do... permanently prevent you from remembering one word that you hear.
listen, andy, your old man was a hell of a newsman, and you'll be one too.
now, go round up some of the local boys and call his bluff.
you will only remember that you heard me... say important and revealing things about myself, but you will not remember what they are.
that memory will remain erased from your mind for all time.
[cagliostro] when i count to three and snap my fingers, you will wake up.
you will feel refreshed, alert and happy, and all things will be as i said they would be.
i kept tellin' them i didn't remember a thing, and they just kept askin' me the same questions over and over again.
i was ready to confess just to get 'em off my back.
i mean, except for a pickled liver, bud's in great shape.
you know, i've seen him toss back eight martinis... and then run 50 straight balls at a pool table.
well, mrs. fletcher, would you like a quote or two, maybe some pictures?
how about a shot of me in profile, looking like a damned fool?
well, i got no secrets, so what do you wanna know?
well, for one thing, why mr. michaels had such an intense dislike for him.
she lowered herself off the roof... and swung onto cagliostro's balcony and killed him.
and when i confronted her with the idea of reenacting the crime, she freaked.
what i didn't know was that he recorded that conversation at our second meeting.
but even if he has no alibi, there's no way that kellijian could have personally killed cagliostro.
for your testimony to be valid, you have to tell us.
now, can you meet us in cagliostro's suite in about 20 minutes?
i want you to go now... to the last time you were in this room.
you will remember everything, every little detail with crystal clarity, at my command.
you cleverly discovered how to outwit cagliostro's most powerful tool...his voice.
you put earplugs in your ears before you came up to the room.
upstairs in the room, you pretended to be in a trance like the others.
then you surprised cagliostro... and stabbed him to death with a steak knife from the restaurant.
and your reference to the elevator as a lift... suggested that you had spent some time in england.
and i'm sure that some digging around will turn up a connection with cagliostro.
i wanted to get cagliostro... for years... but i just could never figure out how.
but when this thing dropped into my lap, the whole plan came to me just like that.
they love it with sheri as the killer, and they asked if...
if maybe you wouldn't mind bending the truth just a little.
-feels like stone, but they look like the bones of some giant creature.
-they're the fossilized bones of dinosaurs, animals that ruled earth millions of years ago.
the data collected by reflector, soundwave, and laserbeak, leads to only one conclusion,
a perpetual power source exists which can provide us, with enough energy to vanquish the autobots, and control the universe forever.
mr. greene's calculations proved correct and the first deep bore has been drilled.
i must say, mr. greene, this is sooner than i'd expected.
here is money and your passage home, if you wish to return.
if you do not, i would ask you never to come looking for me.
he had a premonition that something would happen, but he didn't know what.
they took off his coat and jacket, folded them carefully and laid them on a flat stone.
the coaches thought he was very kind and the driver was pleased.
"l'm going out again tomorrow," said edward. "what do you think of that?"
did you hear that guy you found was a professional japanese assassin?
you mean you went all the way to my aerobics class just to tell me that?
surely goodness and loving kindness will follow me all of the days of my life.
and i will dwell in the house of the lord forever.
17 years and 15 albums later, spinal tap is still going strong.
and they've earned a place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove and was planning a tour of the us to promote that album,
i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you're about to see.
nigel, you and david originally started the band back in... when was it, 1964?
before that i was in a group called the creatures-a skiffle group.
"this tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within."
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted."
ok, i wanted to tell you this, but i didn't know what denis's decision was going to be.
but at this point, both sears and k-mart stores won't handle the album.
it was a joke and they're making it a big deal.
if we said she should be forced to smell the glove, then you'd have a point.
the last time tap toured america, they were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.
doesn't it feel good with the thames men and "cups cakes"?
the thames men later became spinal tap and had a couple of nice-sized hits.
you're rationalising this whole thing like it's something you did on purpose.
i think we're stuck with a very stupid and dismal-looking album.
she gives me the brutally frank version, and i sort of tart it up for them.
it's so strange because nigel and jeanine are so similar in so many ways, but they just can't...
a musical trilogy that i'm doing in d... minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys, really.
i don't know why but it makes people weep instantly if you play it.
it's not your job to be as confused as nigel is.
it's my job to do what i'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
i think it's symptomatic of taking on more than you can, er... er... handle.
it's not the first time you've messed things up, is it?
may i start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here.
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
we're not about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
you are witnesses at the new birth of spinal tap, mark 2.
they send you works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
so i've got denholm elliott reading ts eliot on this one.
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more selective than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or a creed that you live by?
as long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, i can do without the rock'n'roll.
well, i suppose i could work in a shop of some kind, or do freelance selling of some sort of product.
and they've earned a place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so in the late fall of 1 982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove and was planning a tour of the us to promote that album,
i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you're about to see.
i wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
before that i was in a group called the creatures - a skiffle group.
i was in lovely lads, and then we looked at each other and said we might as well join up, you know?
they get all they want, so they don't really understand about a life like frank's.
you know, when you've loved and lost the way frank has, then you know what life's about.
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted."
"they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
ok, i wanted to tell you this, but i didn't know what denis's decision was going to be.
but at this point, both sears and k-mart stores won't handle the album.
it was a joke and they're making it a big deal.
if we said she should be forced to smell the glove, then you'd have a point.
the last time tap toured america, they were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 1 5,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1 200-seat arenas, 1 500-seat arenas.
doesn't it feel good with the thames men and "cups cakes"?
the thames men later became spinal tap and had a couple of nice-sized hits.
you're rationalising this whole thing like it's something you did on purpose.
i think we're stuck with a very stupid and dismal-looking album.
he's got a new bit he wants to tell me about.
and i say that's good or that's bad or that's shit or whatever.
you see, saturn's in the third house, and it's a bit rocky.
but because virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac, we're gonna pull through this with great aplomb.
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
not yours personally, but the whole genre of rock'n'roll and the exciting things in music today.
if you're ever there and wanna hear some good music, you might wanna drop by.
i would like to get the playing on about 1 900 hours, if that's satisfactory.
the idea is we can get it on and we get it over with.
and would you play a couple of slow numbers so i can dance?
i can't believe that you're lumping nigel in with the people you played with for a short time.
well, i'd feel much worse if i weren't under such heavy sedation, but you've gotta be realistic about this sort of thing.
it's like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the universe.
if the universe is indeed infinite, then what does that mean?
17 years and 15 albums later, spinal tap is still going strong.

as long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, i can do without the rock'n'roll.
well, i suppose i could work in a shop of some kind, or do freelance selling of some sort of product.
but that night, i heard a band that for me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."
i remember being knocked out by their exuberance, their raw power and their punctuality.
so, in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove, and was planning their first tour of the united states in almost six years to promote that album,
well, needless to say, i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
but you don't feel that these guys have an effect on an audience.
i mean, kids go to their concert, they have a great time...
okay, listen, i wanted to tell you this, and i was holding back, because i didn't know what denis' decision was going to be.
but, at this point, both sears and kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
and if the first album was a hit, then we could've pressed on them, then we could've told them,
"yes, let's..." the music, every cut, on this album is a hit.
it says, "memphis show canceled due to lack of advertising funds."
the last time tap toured america, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
but, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
certainly, in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock, having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is quite often useful.
i mean, i don't feel any better than i did at the hotel.
he was going to do a tv special from here, before he died.
i think you're, like, rationalizing this whole thing into something that you did on purpose.
i think we're stuck with a very, very stupid and a very dismal-looking album.
it's a bit of a departure from the kind of thing you normally play.
yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really, a musical trilogy that i'm doing, in d minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys.
(singing) i don't need a woman i won't take me no wife
i got the rock 'n' roll and that'll be my life
i do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
i think that the problem may have been that there was a stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.
i really think you're just making much too big a thing out of it.
making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
i think it's symptomatic that maybe you're taking on more than you can handle.
it's not exactly the first time you've messed things up, is it?
fine, may i start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here?
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
it gives us a chance to kind of let down our hair.
(laughing) although, i see you all have a head start on that.
did you ever run into a musical group, works out of kansas city, calls himself four jacks and a jill?
they've been at a ramada inn there for about 18 months.
if you're ever in kansas city and you want to hear some good music, you might want to drop by.
i would like to get the playing on about 19:00 hours if that's satisfactory.
i can't believe that, you know, you're lumping nigel in with these people you played with for short periods of time.
well, i'm sure i'd feel much worse if i weren't under such heavy sedation, but still, in all, i mean, you've got to be realistic about this sort of thing, you know.
well, i don't, i don't really think that the end can be assessed, as of itself, as being the end, because what does the end feel like?
it's like saying when you try and extrapolate the end of the universe.
and that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
so, when you're playing, you feel like a preserved moose on stage?
and they send you the works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
so i've got denholm elliott reading t.s. eliot on this one.
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
and they've earned a distinguished place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so, in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove, and was planning their first tour of the united states in almost six years to promote that album,
well, needless to say, i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
i wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
i mean, it doesn't matter how good the press is or what the stringers...
as i explained last night, we're not gonna saturate the new york market.
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted.
"they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
i wouldn't worry about it, though, it's not a big college town.
hey, i heard you boys had an album coming out right now?
okay, listen, i wanted to tell you this, and i was holding back, because i didn't know what denis' decision was going to be.
but, at this point, both sears and kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
and if the first album was a hit, then we could've pressed on them, then we could've told them,

the last time tap toured america, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas, and i was just wondering, does this mean the popularity of the group is waning?
yes, i mean, it's a kind of totemistic thing, you know?
but, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
i mean, i don't feel any better than i did at the hotel.
he was going to do a tv special from here, before he died.
i thought i might go back to see what they were up to back there, you know.
don't think they really need to see this until you're finished with it, you know.
it's a bit of a departure from the kind of thing you normally play.
yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really, a musical trilogy that i'm doing, in d minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys.
i hate to keep harping on this, but i think that the notion of a black album has really cursed us.
believe me, we're getting some very substantial reports of air play.
i do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
i think that the problem may have been that there was a stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.
i really think you're just making much too big a thing out of it.
making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
it's not exactly the first time you've messed things up, is it?
i mean, there have been some gaping holes in the business end of this...
fine, may i start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here?
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
did you ever run into a musical group, works out of kansas city, calls himself four jacks and a jill?
they've been at a ramada inn there for about 18 months.
if you're ever in kansas city and you want to hear some good music, you might want to drop by.
i would like to get the playing on about 19:00 hours if that's satisfactory.
you've got to understand that, like, in the world of rock 'n' roll there are certain changes that sometimes occur,
and you've just got to, sort of, roll with them, you know.
i can't see myself missing nige any more than i might miss
ross maclochness or ronnie pudding or denny upham or little danny schindler, any of those, you know.
well, i don't, i don't really think that the end can be assessed, as of itself, as being the end, because what does the end feel like?
it's like saying when you try and extrapolate the end of the universe.
he asked me to ask you, tap, if you'd be interested in reforming and doing a tour, japan.
so you've come back to re-plug our life-support systems in, is that it?
it's more like going to a national park or something, and there's, you know, they preserve the moose.
and that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
and they've earned a distinguished place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so, in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove, and was planning their first tour of the united states in almost six years to promote that album,
well, needless to say, i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
i wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
i mean, it doesn't matter how good the press is or what the stringers...
as i explained last night, we're not gonna saturate the new york market.
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted.
"they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry. "
i wouldn't worry about it, though, it's not a big college town.
hey, i heard you boys had an album coming out right now?
okay, listen, i wanted to tell you this, and i was holding back, because i didn't know what denis' decision was going to be.
but, at this point, both sears and kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
and if the first album was a hit, then we could've pressed on them, then we could've told them,
"yes, let's... " the music, every cut, on this album is a hit.
the last time tap toured america, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas, and i was just wondering, does this mean the popularity of the group is waning?
yes, i mean, it's a kind of totemistic thing, you know?
but, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
i mean, i don't feel any better than i did at the hotel.
he was going to do a tv special from here, before he died.
i was using bits and pieces of whatever eastern philosophies happened to drift through my transom.
and she sort of sorted it out for me, straightened it out for me.
i don't need a woman i won't take me no wife
i got the rock 'n' roll and that'll be my life
making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
nigel gave me a drawing that said 18 inches, all right?
i mean, it's not your job to be as confused as nigel is.
it's my job to do what i'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
i think it's symptomatic that maybe you're taking on more than you can handle.
it's not exactly the first time you've messed things up, is it?
it gives us a chance to kind of let down our hair.
although, i see you all have a head start on that.
they've been at a ramada inn there for about 18 months.
if you're ever in kansas city and you want to hear some good music, you might want to drop by.
i can't believe that, you know, you're lumping nigel in with these people you played with for short periods of time.
well, i'm sure i'd feel much worse if i weren't under such heavy sedation, but still, in all, i mean, you've got to be realistic about this sort of thing, you know.
we're not going about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
you are witnesses at the new birth of spinal tap mark ii.
it's more like going to a national park or something, and there's, you know, they preserve the moose.
and that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
and they've earned a distinguished place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so, in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove, and was planning their first tour of the united states in almost six years to promote that album,
well, needless to say, i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
i wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
it's just, people like this, you know, they get all they want, so they don't really understand about a life like frank's.
i mean, when you've loved and lost the way frank has, then you know what life's about.
the bump we've got to iron out here is when do we get the album released?
i mean, it doesn't matter how good the press is or what the stringers...
but you don't feel that these guys have an effect on an audience.
i mean, kids go to their concert, they have a great time...
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted.
"they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
- okay, listen, i wanted to tell you this, and i was holding back, because i didn't know what denis' decision was going to be.
but, at this point, both sears and kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
the last time tap toured america, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1,200-seat arenas, 1,500-seat arenas, and
but, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
certainly, in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock, having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is quite often useful.
he was going to do a tv special from here, before he died.
yeah, that's right, the musical version of somebody up there likes me.
- ♪ since my baby left me ♪ - ♪ since my baby left me ♪
- ♪ well, i found a new place to dwell ♪ - ♪ well, i found a new place to dwell ♪

given the history of spinal tap drummers in the past, do you have any fears for your life?
i was using bits and pieces of whatever eastern philosophies happened to drift through my transom.
and she sort of sorted it out for me, straightened it out for me.
it's a bit of a departure from the kind of thing you normally play.
yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really, a musical trilogy that i'm doing, in d minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys.
♪ i don't need a woman i won't take me no wife ♪
♪ i got the rock 'n' roll and that'll be my life ♪
i hate to keep harping on this, but i think that the notion of a black album has really cursed us.
believe me, we're getting some very substantial reports of air play.
beneath the haunted moon, for fear that daybreak might come too soon.
i do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
nigel gave me a drawing that said 18 inches, all right?
i mean, it's not your job to be as confused as nigel is.
it's my job to do what i'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
i think it's symptomatic that maybe you're taking on more than you can handle.
it's not exactly the first time you've messed things up, is it?
now, i know that the band's sign is virgo and, you see it, saturn's in the third house, all right, and it's a bit rocky.
but because virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac, we're gonna pull through this with great aplomb.
now, what i want to explain to you here, is that denver...
how would you characterize your relationship with david over the years?
it gives us a chance to kind of let down our hair.
although, i see you all have a head start on that.
they've been at a ramada inn there for about 18 months.
if you're ever in kansas city and you want to hear some good music, you might want to drop by.
you've got to understand that, like, in the world of rock 'n' roll there are certain changes that sometimes occur,
and you've just got to, sort of, roll with them, you know.

well, i don't, i don't really think that the end can be assessed, as of itself, as being the end, because what does the end feel like?
it's like saying when you try and extrapolate the end of the universe.
he asked me to ask you, tap, if you'd be interested in reforming and doing a tour, japan.
so you've come back to re-plug our life-support systems in, is that it?
and that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
so, when you're playing, you feel like a preserved moose on stage?
and they send you the works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
so i've got denholm elliott reading t.s. eliot on this one.
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more of a selective human than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
17 years and 15 albums later, spinal tap is still going strong.
and they've earned a place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove and was planning a tour of the us to promote that album,
i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you're about to see.
nigel, you and david originally started the band back in... when was it, 1964?
before that i was in a group called the creatures-a skiffle group.
"this tasteless cover is a good indication of the lack of musical invention within."
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted."
ok, i wanted to tell you this, but i didn't know what denis's decision was going to be.
but at this point, both sears and k-mart stores won't handle the album.
it was a joke and they're making it a big deal.
if we said she should be forced to smell the glove, then you'd have a point.
the last time tap toured america, they were... booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.
doesn't it feel good with the thames men and "cups cakes"?
the thames men later became spinal tap and had a couple of nice-sized hits.
you're rationalising this whole thing like it's something you did on purpose.
i think we're stuck with a very stupid and dismal-looking album.
she gives me the brutally frank version, and i sort of tart it up for them.
it's so strange because nigel and jeanine are so similar in so many ways, but they just can't...
a musical trilogy that i'm doing in d... minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys, really.
i don't know why but it makes people weep instantly if you play it.
it's not your job to be as confused as nigel is.
it's my job to do what i'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
i think it's symptomatic of taking on more than you can, er... er... handle.
it's not the first time you've messed things up, is it?
may i start by saying how thrilled we are to have you here.
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
we're not about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
you are witnesses at the new birth of spinal tap, mark 2.
they send you works of famous authors done by actors with the same last name.
so i've got denholm elliott reading ts eliot on this one.
i believe virtually everything i read, and i think that is what makes me more selective than someone who doesn't believe anything.
do you have a philosophy or a creed that you live by?
as long as there's, you know, sex and drugs, i can do without the rock'n'roll.
well, i suppose i could work in a shop of some kind, or do freelance selling of some sort of product.
but that night, i heard a band that for me redefined the word "rock 'n' roll."
i remember being knocked out by their exuberance, their raw power and their punctuality.
so, in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove, and was planning their first tour of the united states in almost six years to promote that album,
well, needless to say, i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you are about to see.
but you don't feel that these guys have an effect on an audience.
i mean, kids go to their concert, they have a great time...
okay, listen, i wanted to tell you this, and i was holding back, because i didn't know what denis' decision was going to be.
but, at this point, both sears and kmart stores have refused to handle the album.
and if the first album was a hit, then we could've pressed on them, then we could've told them,
"yes, let's..." the music, every cut, on this album is a hit.
it says, "memphis show canceled due to lack of advertising funds."
the last time tap toured america, they were booked into 10,000-seat arenas and 15,000-seat venues.
but, to be quite frank with you, it's come in useful on a couple situations.
certainly, in the topsy-turvy world of heavy rock, having a good solid piece of wood in your hand is quite often useful.
i mean, i don't feel any better than i did at the hotel.
he was going to do a tv special from here, before he died.

yeah, well, it's part of a trilogy, really, a musical trilogy that i'm doing, in d minor, which i always find is really the saddest of all keys.
(singing) i don't need a woman i won't take me no wife
i got the rock 'n' roll and that'll be my life
i do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
i think that the problem may have been that there was a stonehenge monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.
i really think you're just making much too big a thing out of it.
making a big thing out of it would have been a good idea.
i think it's symptomatic that maybe you're taking on more than you can handle.

ross maclochness or ronnie pudding or denny upham or little danny schindler, any of those, you know.
we're not going about to do a free-form jazz exploration in front of a festival crowd.
you are witnesses at the new birth of spinal tap mark ll.
he asked me to ask you, tap, if you'd be interested in reforming and doing a tour, japan.
so you've come back to re-plug our life-support systems in, is that it?
it's more like going to a national park or something, and there's, you know, they preserve the moose.
and that's my childhood up there on stage, is that moose, you know?
do you have a philosophy or creed that you live by?
well, you know, personally, i like to think about sex and drugs and rock 'n' roll, you know.
and they've earned a place in rock history as one of england's loudest bands.
so in the late fall of 1982, when i heard that tap was releasing a new album called smell the glove and was planning a tour of the us to promote that album,
i jumped at the chance to make the documentary, the, if you will, rockumentary that you're about to see.
i wanted to capture the sights, the sounds, the smells of a hard-working rock band on the road.
before that i was in a group called the creatures-a skiffle group.
i was in lovely lads, and then we looked at each other and said we might as well join up, you know?
they get all they want, so they don't really understand about a life like frank's.
you know, when you've loved and lost the way frank has, then you know what life's about.
"the musical growth rate of this band cannot even be charted."
"they're treading water in a sea of retarded sexuality and bad poetry."
and it seems that now, on the current tour, they're being booked into 1200-seat arenas, 1500-seat arenas.
i was wondering, does this mean the popularity of the group is waning?
they took me aside and said, "mick, you know, it's like this."
and it did kind of freak me out a bit, but it can't always happen to every...
i thought i might go back and see what they were up to.
i don't think they need to see this until you're finished with it, you know?
he's got a new bit he wants to tell me about.
and i say that's good or that's bad or that's shit or whatever.
you see, saturn's in the third house, and it's a bit rocky.
but because virgo is one of the most highly intelligent signs of the zodiac, we're gonna pull through this with great aplomb.
we are such fans of your music and all of your records.
not yours personally, but the whole genre of rock'n'roll and the exciting things in music today.
if you're ever there and wanna hear some good music, you might wanna drop by.
i would like to get the playing on about 1900 hours, if that's satisfactory.
the idea is we can get it on and we get it over with.
and would you play a couple of slow numbers so i can dance?
i can't believe that you're lumping nigel in with the people you played with for a short time.
well, i'd feel much worse if i weren't under such heavy sedation, but you've gotta be realistic about this sort of thing.
it's like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the universe.
if the universe is indeed infinite, then what does that mean?
voitaire for his contribution to the revolutionary spirit in france... they say.
spanish companies can only publish translations of mediocre novels... read again and again by short-sighted censors... who prohibit a poem by vaibuena for mentioning breasts.
but in this country, many people are screaming for the inquisition.
many have had to go into exile to save their life or freedom.
we don't need people like you in the world... you'ii soon be extinct.
men like me live with one aim... freedom, conquering an idea of absolute freedom.
do they have the right to break and enter... due to some anonymous report?
is this the joy of a government based on religion and nepotism?
spite, destructive rage, a thirst for power and greed... are the secret motives of those who run the state.
rightly they fear their tyranny will shake the people... to take from their clutches the sweet prize they enjoy.
friends, heaven will pity us for the conditions we live in.
the day will come when change will come to our nation.
we must heighten control and watch every corner of the city.
despite general torrijo's failed landing... and the execution of manzanares... we've heard that liberals in granada... and other cities are preparing to revolt.
as you know... in our country women aren't involved in politics.
i've no knowledge of the subversive activities or ideas my relatives.
if they don't intercede... the trial will be held with pedrosa's fake evidence.
talk to my wife, she must go to madrid as soon as possible.
sometimes i think we're as reactionary as the absolutists... that we're as confused as they are.
in bayonne, mina is leading a revolution he doesn't believe in.
the king's politicians wanted captain brodet... to renounce his liberal ideas before marrying me.
it was i... who refused to marry the man i ioved... before he renounced his beliefs.
i walk the iong path to the fields to watch her sleep.
sometimes i am quiet for a iong time, happy just to see her... and copy her arms with my own to kiss her breath.
and let me say that in god's name... the church has at times been implacable.
man's church can make mistakes... but nothing was as ferocious as the persecution of christians.
the governor would never dare tell you... but all granada says you are a liberal.
and if all granada says so why doesn't he believe it?
listen, mariana... you said a beautiful thing, but it could be used by the liberals.
please don't say that, a liberal is like a devil for the governor.
i spent the whole night, until dawn, repeating the love song you taught me.
"at two in the morning, i wanted to die... to see if that would end my madness for you..."
i've learned that god... can be found by looking ahead and not up.
it is enough to love someone to feel the mystery of god.
here we have purple taffeta... 6 feet wide... and over 3 yards long... with a green triangle in the middle.
on it are embroidered in red... the capital letters "b", "e"... and tacked on in cardboard, the letter "r".
on the other side, also embroidered in crimson... are the letters "a", "l"... and a haif-finished "d".
at the edges... of said taffeta are tacked two pieces of selvage.
"ursuia de ia presa, mariana pineda's adopted mother... when asked about the flag said she was called... and bewildered, she gave officer diaz a pile of cloth... stating she had never seen it before.
burei, the servant, charged also in his mistress' previous case... states he had never seen the flag or emblems... until he was shown them.
you remain under house arrest and must speak to no one.
if, for any reason, you attempt to leave the city... your situation would become far more serious.
we measured them, and they are not all the same width.
therefore, we can assume they were not made by the same hand.
let what pedrosa has prepared for her carry on its course.
i assure you it will be simple... if we play the game he has chosen.
"madam, you have a charge pending for protecting political prisoners... and financing and organising... the exile of constitutionaiists in gibraltar.
you are accused of conspiring against the king and his government... by embroidering a revolutionary flag for the constitutional cause.
the cause used mariana's liberal enthusiasm... knowing that she was a woman.
and that although legislation in our land is inhuman... they'ii respect her life.
"in all plotting of rebellion in the kingdom... against the sovereign authority of our beloved king... and provocation of popular disturbances... though preparatory acts... all authors and accomplices will be punished... by death."
mariana is condemned to death... it will matter not that she is a woman.
pedrosa will seat her on the scaffold... and give the order to the executioner, with the conviction... that he is fulfilling what he considers his duty.
by taking her life... he thinks he performs a worthy act for king and government... of benefit to the country and of use to society.
i know not when, but one day it will be known.
listen to me "mayor of crime"... although today spain is under tyrannical rule... tomorrow it will be free.
let me explain why i think this royal statute is necessary.
some political change is essential even if everything stays the same.
i assure you that our king's main worry is dying on the throne... in many years time, god willing.
wisely prudent, he is facing up to the country's successión problems.
castiiiian nobility, archbishops, bishops... and landowners with an annual income of 60000 quarters.
your name, mr. pedrosa, is down as elected member... for a southern province.
it says they are still preparing evidence and it isn't definitive.
get a permit for my children to come and see me.
they're as necessary as a live army... for the revolution which will change our land.
a revolution... which will wipe the french one from history books... which after 40 years is already corrupt.
a popular revolution, where all power is held by the people.
and for that day... we need martyrs and victims to offer the people.
pedrosa is on our trail... and his bloodhounds search and question many sympathisers.
he doesn't know who's here or what the plan is... but the way things are, we must bring the escape forward.
- some tricoiour rosettes... found in a flowerpot at mariana's house.
he has a witness... but everyone knows the evidence is false.
and i fear that this new evidence sent to madrid... will have its effect.
but why are they holding a trial... if she's already condemned to death?
we could shoot her, iike general manzanares... or garrotte her, according to the present laws.
i'd iike to hang her though... it's a more solemn death than the garrotte.
i think all these serious actions... are committed by thousands of men and women in our country... who don't believe in the absolutist regime.
but mariana pineda's life is to be taken... for not informing on those plotting... to revolt in andalusia.
on 26 march last, the death penalty was received... by mariana pineda, citizen of granada.
when searching her house on the previous 13 march... police found a haif-embroidered revolutionary flag... and similar objects.
although such penalty is more painful when received by a woman... this does not mean it is not just punishment.
especially given the revolutionaries tactic... fin their mad schemes of hiding behind... those of a sex which is less cautious and provokes compassión.
we'll cover all the entrances to the equidome take a lot of pictures and hope for a break.
oh, and make sure all of our men know these faces.
now, there's an axiom for that exactly and it's, 'the, uh, quality of charity is--'
the quality of charity is to be nice to mrs. coleman.
we know that he's invited the wealthiest speculators in the country to this show.
this could be the biggest deal so far and we can't get past that gate.
i can't make a move without a flock of agents trailing after me.
i would like to have kept ghana and some local markets, like california...
the waiters and the bartenders are people that unified charity's used every year.
year after year, you know, they always use the same people.
it's very important that the glasses are clean and that we don't run short.
if you find that we're running low, tell me and i'll have some brought down from the restaurant, all right?
oh, we were just going to put them out, mrs. coleman.
one doesn't leave this sort of thing to the last moment.
by the end of this afternoon, everybody here is going to know.
you really think i would allow you to talk one of the others into a partnership?
i was listening, but there's nothing i can do about it right now, amanda.
could we at least move the car out of the sun?
no, i don't, and i'm sure that when steven calms down, he won't either.
so help me god, if my child is hurt in any way...
steven, i know that sammy jo is capable of a lot of things, but i know that she would never harm danny.
i'll do business with lawlor, but that doesn't mean i'll like it.
of course, but keep in mind, although we're talking about a mortgage, that mansion is collateral, and in the case of non-payment of the loan, possible foreclosure.
mr. lawlor, exactly how much is your bank prepared to lend us?
when she was alone with him, believe me, she was no mother.
sammy jo has no money, that means she has to go to somebody she knows.
we may not like it, but there's nothing we can do about it.
well, there's something i can say about it, adam, i hold you responsible.
even if that means putting on a face as we walk out our front door into the world.
now, certainly each of us has a terrible tragedy, but we're going to beat those tragedies.
steven, you and claudia, your danny will come back to you.
and you, adam, you'll resolve your differences with steven, and you'll be true brothers.
what i've worked for all these years building denver-carrington, well, all those problems will be solved too.
and this bad turn that we all have taken, well, that will disappear like some ugly nightmare.
your cheque to mark jennings in the amount of $100,000 may be circumstantial, but it's incriminating nevertheless.
mr. ballard, i am paying you a king's ransom to defend me, not convict me.
mark jennings and i may have been together occasionally, but i'd hardly call it a relationship.
the prosecution will make it appear to have been the affair of the century.
i'll give you every cent i have if you need it.
you've been like a son to me, jeff, always have been.
and i understand that you've been scouring the country, as it were, trying to put the package together.
the loan, i imagine, is a little bit risky for you to handle?
we have to be very careful how we use our investors' money.
oh, yes, because if you were one of the major banks, you would have known where to go first, to me.
i brought sammy jo into this house and she took danny away.
and i was married to mark jennings once and he came to denver and there were so many problems.
regarding the acquisition of 10,000 off-shore louisiana acres, attached are the figures supporting the recommended colbyco bid."
i'm preparing a memo for you which will give you an update on all the projects i've been working on.
i want you to go over those papers as quickly as possible.
and then find out how much avril dawson is asking for all the old denver-carrington assets.
i'll review the papers tonight, and if they're all right, i'll have you sign them.
of course, 12,2 isn't gonna be enough, but with the 4 and a half from krystle's furs and jewels, and the money from the antiques and the paintings, that should bring us close to 20 million.
instead you choose to sing to 50 people in a colorado bistro.
where i choose to sing is not really the issue, is it, brady?
from the sound, you're either making gin or taking a bath.
lying there all warm and soapy, watching your pores open up.
why don 't you save the patter for the pulp reporters?
there's a good card at the arena tonight, and i'm holding two tickets.
we dug two.38s and a.45 out of the walls, a 9 mm out of the ceiling.
now this in here was chasing ginny lee when i bumped into him.
i don't know how you got in, but you're not gonna get out so easy.
well, maybe i'll use you as a shield, blind those goons of yours with your jammies.

i don't know how you got in here, copper, but you're not gonna get out so easy.

see, i'm gonna go upstairs and try to put a twinkle in both of caroline's eyes.
if i'm not too tired afterwards, though i'll come down and pop your face inside out.
no clinches, no rabbit punches and please, no hitting below the belt.

i had wonderful fellow-travelers - farmer girls from a cossack village.
all way long we were discussing fabrics... and some special german bras.
the juice should be settled for three days along with the peel.
it gives roughness and a wonderful colour - like this one.
i liked to drink a shot glass of vodka with a piece of meat in jelly.
pork should be singed upon the burning straw - it gives the meat its special aroma.
i took a leave to collect my thoughts, to concentrate... to have nothing to hamper me.
if everything goes well i will run an errand to the usa.
do you know why... why was not i looking back at him?
i was afraid he was not looking at me... and i was longing for it.
sorry for waking you up, my dear... but you talked in sleep.
you went to bed late but still it's time to get up.
once we were driving in nairobi... when an elephant calf stood in our way... came in our way... and until we fed him with sugar and took photos of him... we couldn't go on our trip.
i guess this amusing incident proves... that all kids have a sweet tooth.
we'll borrow a thousand apiece from frankie shy and bet it on the check.
if you got more than six entrées on it, you win.
i count 12 entrées on that table, three of them steaks.
i'll go you double or nothin' if you got a single fuckin' steak on that check.
plus you fed the cook vodka to get your food out without dupes.
another hour, he'll go face-ass down into a bowl of scaloppine.
if i figured i'd get caught, i'd be 1000 per cent wrong.
but if i didn't figure i'd get caught, i wasn't jeopardising your job, man.
you want me to save up my little tip cup every night?
in 20 years, maybe i'll have enough to own a place?
you don't wanna set 'em loose in some field to screw.
i mean, how many times you yourself pull a muscle or somethin' screwing'?
starry hope runs in a couple of weeks, and i need big bucks to bet with, man.
there's real money to be made on that race, you know?
i get here before you hook me, you're supposed to let me go.
i get a ticket, but you're not supposed to tow me.
it's gonna cost you $100 for the tow, plus $25 for the ticket.
and that fat bastard comes in here every afternoon to piss in my toilet and drink my whisky free.
i might see some extra bucks each month if the neighbourhood don't go coloured.
i need one nice score now, so the kid's got somethin' goin' for him.
it's 37 years scrubbing' floors on my hands and knees for those rich sons-of-bitches on park avenue.
do you remember hauling' garbage after dinner, every night of your life?
the men up in maine make you and paulie look like spoilt little brats.
i was raised to believe that criminals, criminals were too weak - too weak to make it honestly.
i leave that money with my wife, they'll take it off her in 12 minutes.
i need somebody to see she gets that money if i take a fall.
i can't leave those two until i'm backed dead into a corner.
and i can't run with a 25-year-old needs the side of his crib pulled up every night.
it's the only neighbourhood in the city where little kids and old ladies can still walk the streets at night.
why the hell did bed bug give us this one anyway?
i don't mean you walk around morning to night whackin' 'em upside the head, but you gotta terrorise 'em once in a while to keep 'em in line, you know?
i mean, like, you know, sometimes when they embarrass ya in front of your friends, you whack 'em with the backhand.
another hour, he'll go face-ass down into a bowl of scaloppine.
i'm gonna have to go behind the range, blow another $80 shirt.
diane, i'm not gonna head up to maine and start choppin' wood.
when we leave the city, i'm gonna leave as an owner.
i got a marshal who wants to put a lien on my salary, when and if i get a salary.
i got an ex-wife and i got a kid i gotta feed every week.
a couple of weeks out of work, you'll start thinkin' small too.
tips, pay, plus what you robbed - you were bringing home 600 a week.
like, let's say you got a couple of horses worth... a million dollars apiece.
you don't wanna set 'em loose in some field to screw.
i mean, how many times you yourself pull a muscle or somethin' screwing'?
and these great big stallions, they get horny, they could kick the mother horse in the head.
her first race, starry hope goes off at big, big odds, man.
her papers say her father was some no-dick piece of garbage, but she got the champion gene, charlie.
crossing that alley to the other roof is a piece of cake.
we go in, open the safe and find peanuts in there, i'm gonna want your ass, paulie.
paulie, god forbid, i don't wish you any hard luck, but listen to me.
i don't think you're gonna see even a little piece of baccalà for this deal, you know?
i never ordered a brandy in my life wasn't cordon bleu.
i took 500 from shylocks, pop, to see sinatra at the garden.
from there to queens village to deliver the money to inspector ed burns, whose voice will be on this tape later on.
hope to be erasing' this in phoenix, in about a year.
you know, he's got a bum bladder ever since he was a kid.
charlie, whatever your beef is with him, you gotta forget it now.
after you're gone, i'm going to tear this place upside down, like a cyclone hit it.
i'm gonna call the daily news to do a story on how the new york city police treats the mother of a hero.
the two of us could do a scene on the six o'clock news would have this city in tears.
my walter was as tough as a bar of iron, and he didn't get that from his father.
if i don't wanna change, what the fuck are you doin' with me?
what the fuck have you been doin' with me all this time?
he's like some arab sheik walkin' around with that crazy bulldog.
yeah, but that's why little italy got their own law and order.
i've been thinking about what my life would be like, living with you.
the truth is, charlie, i can't go through life living with someone i could never trust.
you don't abuse 'em once in a while, they shit all over ya.
i don't mean you walk around morning to night whackin' 'em upside the head, but you gotta terrorise 'em once in a while to keep 'em in line, you know?
i mean, like, you know, sometimes when they embarrass ya in front of your friends, you whack 'em with the backhand.
not out in the room, like some fuckin' animal, but nice, in the bedroom, you know.
the clubhouse is the only place to really see a race from.
you stay in the grandstand and you're with every garbage can walking' the street.
we're gonna make money here today, then we're gonna party on the beach.
we're gonna live like a couple of sports instead of busted suitcases.

peter, at 1 :40 p.m at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue 1 0 people witnessed a free-fioating, fuii-torso, vaporous apparition.
as a friend, i must say you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.
you guys have been meeting every schizo in the five boroughs who says he has a paranormal experience.
dr. venkman, we believe the purpose of science is to serve mankind.
you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.
the franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers and there's a full kitchen.
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?
that was two days ago, and i haven't been back to my apartment.
generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.
but there are some things we do standard procedures in a case like this, which often bring us results.
i couid go to hail of records for the building's structural details.
there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.
and there were flames, and i heard a voice say, "zuui."
"i wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick."
i'ii bet you're gonna be thinking about me after i'm gone.
for the entrapment, we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000.
but we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast.
today, the entire eastern seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.
alleged ghost-sightings and supernatural occurrences have been reported across the entire tri-state area.
still making headlines all across the country the ghostbusters are at it again, this time at the dance club the rose.
the boys in gray slugged it out with a pesky poltergeist then stayed to dance with the ladies who witnessed the disturbance.
do you believe in ufos, astral projections mental telepathy, esp, clairvoyance spirit photography, teiekinetic movement fuii-trance mediums, the loch ness monster and the theory of atlantis?
if there's a steady paycheck in it, i'ii believe anything you say.
miss barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says:
"he enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients."
there've been a iot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation.
for instance, the presence of noxious possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.
now, you show me what is down there, or i come back with a court order.
you go get a court order, and i'ii sue your ass for wrongful prosecution!
well, iet's say this twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the new york area.
according to this morning's sample, it wouid be a twinkie 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.
during rectification of the vuidronaii, the traveler came as a iarge torb.
then, during the third reconciliation of the meketrex suppiicants they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sioar!
i think we can get her a guest shot on wild kingdom.
i just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of thorazine.
these are blueprints for the ironwork in dana barrett's apartment and they're very, very strange.
hey, ray, do you remember something in the bible about the iast days, when the dead would rise from the grave?
the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.
ray, for a moment pretend that i don't know anything about metallurgy engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on.
i've got a city blowing up, and you aren't giving me answers.
i've got a city blowing up, and you aren't giving me answers.
aii i know is that was no light show we saw this morning.
i've seen every form of combustion known to man but this beats the hell out of me.
m at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue 10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.
it blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.
i was just going to say, "8:00?" you are a legitimate phenomenon.
as a friend, i must say you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.
you forget, i was there at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.
oh, ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a half.
for whatever reasons, ray call it fate, call it luck, call it karma i believe that everything happens for a reason.
i believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers and there's a full kitchen.
it just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.
are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?
if the answer is yes, pick up your phone and call the professionals.
and this voice said, "zuul," and then i slammed the refrigerator door and left.
that was two days ago, and i haven't been back to my apartment.
there was a space and a building with flames coming out of it.
there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.

peter, at 1:40 p.m., at the main branch... of the new york public library on fifth avenue... ten people witnessed... a free-floating, full-torso vaporous apparition.

i've seen every form of combustion known to man... but this beats the hell out of me.
director ivan reitman and cinematographer lazlo kovacs... chose instead this sweeping crane shot.
this interior is the main reading room of the new york library.
for "aesthetic and economic reasons," the producers shot these scenes... at the main branch of the public library in los angeles.
the final shooting script called for more than a dozen books... to suddenly fly off the shelf and land at the feet of the librarian.
but at the last minute, dan aykroyd suggested... this more subtle and eerie approach...
the first of 200 optical effects... by visual effects creator richard edlund and his team.
this next bit of ghostly mischief... falls in the category of a physical effect rather than an optical effect.
special effects supervisor chuck gaspar built a bank of card cabinets... rigged with air hoses to spew the cards out on cue.
the librarian had speaking lines in the script, but during production... her lines were dropped and replaced with screams and whimpers.
the original script called for a "stout, studious-iooking girl in her late 20's."
but alice drummond as a terrified, fleeing middle-aged librarian... was a perfect casting decision.
the ghostbusters logo was refined by artists, but dan aykroyd created... the idea for the logo when he dreamed up the original concept of the film.
in a departure from motion picture tradition... the production credits were withheld until the end of the film.
in the original script, this graffiti contained an obscene sexual reference... to bill murray's character, venkman, but director ivan reitman thought... that "ghostbusters" would benefit...
harold ramis, dan aykroyd's co-writer, came up with the idea... of murray's character giving shocks to the poor nerd.
this idea was based on a real experiment designed to see... how far people would go in giving shocks to other people.
the scene firmly establishes venkman as the cynical skeptic of the group.
as was typical throughout the film, the esp test was shot as scripted... but with dialogue refinements and added bits of business... made either during rehearsal or extemporaneously while cameras rolled.
in almost no instance does the scripted dialogue in any given scene... appear verbatim in the final film.
with a gifted comedy director at the helm, and actors like bill murray... the likelihood of strict adherence to any script was remote.
aykroyd's speech was filmed in new york when the script still called... for the library books to be blown off the shelves.
it was changed in los angeles in favor of the more subtle floating books... but it was left to the audience to assume that aykroyd was describing... incidents that happened elsewhere in the library or at a later time.
dan aykroyd's original line here was in reference... to a "multiple high-altitude rockfall."
in post production, aykroyd looped the famous "mass sponge migration" line.
several dialogue changes were the result of audience tests... the producers ran during post production.
murray's line was inspired by a canceled experiment... proposed by john lilly, a researcher in dolphin communication... who proposed drilling a hole in his head to test some higher brain function.
the line..."that would have worked if you hadn't stopped me"... was pure improvisation by harold ramis.
though written in such a way that it could be staged later in the studio... this scene was shot in a caged area inside the main reading room... all part of the whirlwind shooting session at the new york public library.
on his way to the set on the morning this scene was shot... director ivan reitman came up with the idea of this stack of books... and the new dialogue was hastily written.
the scientists' first contact with the gooey residue, "ectoslime"... was also a last-minute addition.
reitman suggested that aykroyd and harold ramis team up... to create the final screenplay.
ramis and reitman had worked together on reitman's three previous hits:
her scenes were photographed on a stage... at richard edlund's entertainment effects group facility... in marina del rey, california.
the footage was then composited into the footage shot at the library.
columbia university gave the film crew permission to shoot on campus... with the understanding that the school wouldn't be identified by name.
weaver hall and the "paranormal studies laboratory" never existed at columbia.
though interiors could have been easily shot on soundstages in los angeles... a columbia building was turned into a "lab"... by production designer john decuir as insurance against bad weather.
if the film crew... costing $250,00 a day... couldn't shoot outdoors... they could film in the lab rather than lose a day in their shooting schedule.
harold ramis said, "in our first draft, the ghostbusters were tossed out... of a small new england college, and then they go to new york.
but we realized there was something very vital about being in the city... so we began thinking maybe we should start the film there.
prior to that, it had been set in a nice converted farmhouse."
the one key person who had no input... into the script as written was bill murray.
but it was trust. 'ghostbusters' was the first film he'd ever committed to... without fighting like crazy, and he just decided we couldn't fail.
bill's really great, and on the set, he probably gives more... than any comic actor around."
the firehouse in new york... and the firehouse in los angeles.
the ramshackle condition of the los angeles firehouse... is pretty much the way the producers found it.
they left it in this condition for the meeting with the real estate agent.
once these initial scenes were shot... the design team moved in and completely remodeled the interior.
sigourney weaver's character, dana barrett... changed dramatically as the script evolved.
originally, she was to be an alien fugitive from another dimension... which transforms itself into human female form.
"fortunately, rick moranis was, and he really helped to tailor the character.
he came up with the idea of louis being an accountant, and the character... really started to evolve from that point on."...
they got 1,000 calls per hour... 24 hours a day... for six weeks.
the sprawling apartment house interiors extended... over two adjoining soundstages on the burbank studios lot in los angeles.
they needed all the extra space... for the physical effects crew to do their construction.
tiny cuts were made on the eggshells with a small electric saw.
each cut was filled with plaster, then sanded smooth and painted.
during the filming, air was injected into the eggs from below... causing the eggs to split along the cuts and spill out onto the countertop.
by the time the film was shot, the cadillac had aged.
a 1959 model won the audition, and the price skyrocketed to $4,800.
"the firehouse in los angeles is a huge place... three stories high.
all of the scenes that were supposed to take place in the firehouse... were actually filmed in the firehouse.
"once sigourney weaver expressed interest in the role of dana... we took the character much more seriously.
we had written her as a model, but sigourney suggested... it would be much more interesting if she were a musician.
some people have said it would be impossible... for a struggling young cellist to afford this apartment in new york.
"bill came up with the idea of this guy just blowing it all up front...
a foul-smelling ghost pays a visit to their bridal suite... which prompts this telephone call from the hotel manager to the ghostbusters.
dan aykroyd's original idea for the ectomobile... was an all-black, sinister-iooking machine.
the sedgewich hotel exterior and lobby... are actually the biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles.
the producers originally wanted to film at the waldorf astoria in new york... but the huge lobby at the biltmore in los angeles... allowed director ivan reitman to create this wonderful tracking shot.
it was a perfect setting to reveal, for the first time... the ghostbusters in full regalia.
dan aykroyd's fascination with ghostbusting hardware was evident... from the first draft of the script.
when he was trying to market his story idea to hollywood...
dan commissioned artist john daveikis to make drawings... of his ghostbusting weapon concepts.
"i knew that when they blew the maid away... with their nutrona wands, we'd get a big laugh.
it's the first time you see the equipment work... and you get the sense it's the first time... the ghostbusters have seen the equipment work.
too often in movies you have characters... using equipment they've never seen before, and suddenly they're experts.
i thought it would be funnier... if the guys were really trigger-happy and nervous... like rookie cops with loaded weapons."
known by the public as "slimer"... the name of this spook was actually "onionhead."
the room service cart was actually a motorized vehicle... driven from underneath by one of chuck gaspar's crew members.
where it crashes into the wall, the driver was removed... and the cart was merely pushed into the wall.
in the script, harold ramis knocks on a hotel room door... and is confronted by a beautiful woman wearing nothing but a towel.
after the sculpting, the figures were cast in the form of a latex suit... with facial movements achieved through cable mechanisms.
mark wilson wore the latex suits and performed the major actions.
all the corridors of the hotel... were actually shot at stage 12 of the burbank studios.
the set had been built originally for mgm's "rich and famous."
but the banquet scenes were actually filmed at the biltmore hotel.
the ornate facility was occupied by the film crew... for two days of intense filming and special effects.
the destroyed walls were actually prefabricated wall panels... brought to the hotel by the film crew.
the panels were imbedded with pyrotechnic materials... that could be ignited on cue.
the colorful nutrona beam effects were produced later... at richard edlund's entertainment effects group... through a variety of animation techniques.
in the first dan aykroyd script, the proprietor balked at a mere $500 fee.
in the script, the ghostbusters emerge from the hotel... and are swarmed by reporters.
they hold a press conference and sing their television commercial jingle.
that part of the script was deleted, but the montage stayed.
"most of the montage was shot in one day in new york.
that's pretty much the way ivan made movies in the old days... a small crew, moving fast.
we had two small trucks with equipment... and danny was actually driving the ectomobile, having a great time.
these shots are part of a much longer scene that was cut from the film.
the filmmakers thought that the ghostbuster team... needed a fourth member who could serve... as the on-screen voice of the viewing public...
ernie hudson's role as winston zeddemore... was introduced before the ghostbusters became famous.
but, on further reflection, it was decided... to delay winston's introduction until later... when the ghostbusters had begun to build a large clientele... and could logically use another 'buster on the team.
because of the shooting schedule, this was actually the first scene... filmed between bill murray and sigourney weaver.
they rehearsed the night before, added new lines... and shot the scene the next morning.
during this particular haunting, the name gozer appeared mysteriously... throughout the house, written on walls and things.
so we figured we might as well take something... that had been reported in the public domain and use it in the film... as our main demon and supernatural force."...
at one point, we were talking with gregory hines about playing the part.
we also considered getting a young black comedian... someone like eddie murphy.
as it is, there is a nice balance among the four characters.
winston is the moderate character... against which the other three play."
"we were delighted with the notion that this script could be so out there... and yet still have a scientific and parapsychological plausibility.
from a physics point of view, dan was always talking about things... like 'holes in the plausibility envelope.'
more than 40 matte paintings were used in the film's optical effects.
the mammoth rooftop temple was built in stage 16 at the burbank studios.
the scene where the arms come out of the chair and grab dana... is a perfect example.
i wanted it to be scary, but not so frightening... that it takes all the fun out of it.
hunks of foam from an earlier marshmallow experiment... were attached to makeshift handles and pushed against the latex from behind.
the arms were created... in the entertainment effects "ghost shop"... and were worn as glove appliances by three puppeteers... who positioned themselves beneath the chair or otherwise out of camera range.
they were filmed against a blue screen... and composited into the film in postproduction.
the tavern on the green in central park, new york city.
new yorkers are famous for ignoring pleas for help... from people who are being shot and maimed right in front of them.
it was a delicious combination of terror, comedy... and ironic social satire."
it's a facsimile built at the columbia ranch in burbank... for the later sinkhole sequence.
the doorman is a double for the doorman in new york.
"at this point in the film, bill's character... has gone from a cynic to a true believer... so he takes this situation seriously and behaves like a professional.
he shows real concern for this woman we have come to like... and we know he's going to do everything he can to save her.
in an unusual twist on the directorial cameo, dana's demonic voice... reminiscent of mercedes mccambridge's intonations in "the exorcist"... was actually that of ivan reitman.
reitman, in fact, provided all of the unearthly voices in the film... except that of gozer.
sigourney weaver was placed in a fiberglass body shell... concealed beneath her flowing gown.
attached at the waist was a motorized support bar... which extended through a hidden slot in the wall.
it epitomizes the film company's... definite tongue-in-cheek attitude toward ghostbusting technology.
"for the most part, we wanted the technology... to look plausible, but decidedly low-tech... something the guys could have rigged together... with off-the-shelf parts of one sort or another."...
the line, and much of annie potts's dialogue... was edited out during postproduction.
in the script, winston and stantz discuss the higher implications... of what may be happening in new york... on their way to a job at fort detmerring.
since the fort detmerring sequence was deleted during editing... this scene in the ectomobile was reshuffled to a later spot in the film.
now the two men are supposedly returning from a job... exhausted and fearful.
in describing the upcoming special effects sequences... associate producer joe medjuck said, "because of the special effects... and the fact that we were using three cameras... it took a long time between takes to set up.
when everything was ready to go, ivan would signal for cameras to roll... and then wait for confirmation from each before yelling 'action!
but everyone in the firehouse thought he'd said 'action'... so the smoke bombs went off, the cast came charging out into the street... and there's ivan standing right in their midst.
it was like the worst filmmaking nightmare come true... but ivan just burst out laughing."
although the explosion of ghosts... through the fire hall rooftop was inserted optically... a physical effect... involving blasts of smoke and harmless debris... was also used as the building's... panic-driven occupants pour out into the streets.
background plates for this effect... were shot from atop the rca building by richard edlund and his crew.
ghost imagery... as with the fire hall ghost geyser material... was generated and added later in postproduction.
the flying, fish-like ghost that erupts from the subway... was a reminder of an earlier script draft... in which the ghosts take over the subway... and use it to move to uptown new york city.
the taxi driver was originally a dead biker from a scene that got cut.
rather than lose the chilling effect, he was turned into a cabbie.
to achieve this upcoming explosion... the set was built to appear as it would look after the explosion.
then the crew filled it in with balsa wood bricks and breakaway glass.
inside, 15 air mortars were mounted and filled with wet sand.
when fired under pressure, they acted like invisible shotgun pellets... to blow out the wall and windows.
i suggested to ivan that they watch us and listen intently... to all this physics and technical stuff we were talking about.
it's a natural, but it's something you wouldn't think of... until you got to the set... and saw the physical relationship between everything."...
the film crew shot for two days in and around city hall in new york.
the office of city council president carol bellamy... was graciously made available... as a stand-in for the actual mayor's office.
"they usually don't allow film crews to shoot at city hall... and they probably never will again.
as careful and courteous as you try to be... it is still very disruptive."
"we had decided we needed a 'go get 'em' kind of line from bill... as he jumps into the ectomobile.
the dailies of that day's shooting were really funny... because we had all these takes of bill jumping into the ectomobile... yelling a different line each time.
to create the gaping sinkhole... a hydraulically operated collapsing street was constructed... at the columbia ranch in california... backed up by the facsimile of the apartment building in new york.
since no permanent damage could be done to the streets in new york... the area around the actual apartment house location... was dressed with large, jutting slabs of simulated asphalt.
the remaining flights were added in postproduction... by the entertainment effects group matte department.
some of the dialogue was improvised on the spot... and some was added later in looping.
a matte painting of the new york skyline... matte paintings of the top of the temple... animated lightning effects and turbulent skies... created by injecting clouds of paint into a giant water tank.
this is a matte painting... with the live action footage rear projected... onto an open area in the painting.
the two camera pullbacks from the painting and the live action... had to match precisely.
the position of the lightning bolts in relation to the actors... was determined in postproduction through a process called rotoscoping.
the temple dogs in the transformation scene... were actually miniatures animated by stop-motion technique.
the temple dogs on the staircase... were full-size figures operated from under the set.
ms. jovan started the flip in the close-up... but a stunt double completed the flip in postproduction.
the seismic disturbance was accomplished quite simply... with sound effects and bits of rubble... released from above by concealed stagehands.
that night, traffic in new york was backed up for miles.
for scenes of the stay-puft marshmallow man bursting into flames... a special fire-retardant suit was rigged with pyrotechnics... and worn by a stuntman scaling a miniature apartment building.
the marshmallow man was shot in slow-motion... to enhance his apparent mass.
the explosions were shot at an outside location at night... and superimposed over combinations of matte paintings, the mammoth set... and miniature buildings.
during the reconciliation of the meketrex, he came as a giant sloar!
many shubs and zuuls were roasted in the sloar that day!
at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue, ten people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.
it blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.
i was just going to say, "8:00?" you are a legitimate phenomenon.
as a friend, i have to tell you, you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.

oh, ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a half.
for whatever reasons, ray call it fate, call it luck, call it karma i believe that everything happens for a reason.
i believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers and there's a full kitchen.
it just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.
are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost?
if the answer is yes, pick up your phone and call the professionals.
and this voice said, "zuui," and then i slammed the refrigerator door and left.
that was two days ago, and i haven't been back to my apartment.
there was a space and a building with flames coming out of it.
there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.
is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?
as they say in tv, i'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind, and i imagine you are the man to answer that.
it's not gonna do him much good to scream at us in german.
well, i don't think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.
aii i do know is i've been working two weeks without a break and you promised me you'd hire more help.
janine, someone with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries.
for instance, the presence of noxious possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.
now, you show me what is down there, or i come back with a court order.
annette's drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago.
they got 1 5,000 left on the house at 8 percent.
then, during the third reconciliation of the meketrex suppiicants they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sioar!
many shubs and zuuis knew what it was to be roasted in the depths of the sioar that day, i can tell you.
i just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of thorazine.
she's gonna take a little nap now, but she says she's the gatekeeper.
say this twinkie depicts the normal amount of psychokinetic energy ...
according to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie 35 feet long.
during the rectification of the vuldronaii, he came as a torb.
during the reconciliation of the meketrex, he came as a giant sloar!
every religion has its myth about the end of the world.
maybe we've been so busy lately because the dead have been rising.
i won't call a press conference and tell everyone to start praying.
i've only been with the company two weeks, but i have to tell you, these things are real.
the franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor and there's a full kitchen on the top level.
and even though you do your own tax return, which you shouldn't do,
i'd like you to stop by, being that you're my neighbor and all.
are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
that was two days ago, and i haven't been back to my apartment.
generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.
but there are some things we do, standard procedures in a case like this, which often bring us results.
well, i could go to hall of records and check out the structural details in the building.
and there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.
and there were flames, and i heard a voice say, "zuul".
it'll be ready promptly on time as soon as your guests are with us.
the last throw took something out of him, but he's gonna move.
now, for the entrapment... we're gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000 for that.
but we are having a special this week on proton charging and storage of the beast.
today the entire eastern seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.
alleged ghost-sightings and related supernatural occurrences have been reported across the entire tri-state area.
is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?
as they say in tv, i'm sure there's one big question on everybody's mind and i imagine you are the man to answer that.
i mean... someone should tell him it's not gonna do much good to scream at us in german.
well, i don't think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.
for instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.
now, you either show me what is down there, or i come back with a court order.
bellevue doesn't want him, and i'm afraid to put him in the lock up.
i know you guys are into this stuff, so i figured we'd check with you.
during the rectification of the vuldronaii, the traveler came as a large torb.
then, during the third reconciliation of the last of the meketrex supplicants, they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sloar!
i think we can get her a guest shot on wild kingdom.
i just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of thorazine.
these are the blueprints for the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building, and they're very, very strange.
hey, ray, do you remember something in the bible about the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave?
you're facing federal prosecution for at least a half a dozen environmental violations.
now, either you shut off these beams, or we shut them off for you.
i mean, the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.
ray, for a moment, pretend that i don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on.
as a duly designated representative of the city, county and state of new york,
i order you to cease any and all supernatural activity and return forthwith to your place of origin or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension.
we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.
you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.
the franchise rights alone... will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor... and a full kitchen on the top level.
i climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable... but i couldn't get in.
so i turned up my tv... so everyone would think both our tvs--
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
have you or your family seen a spook, specter or ghost?
is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs?
as they say in tv... there's one big question on everybody's mind... and i imagine you are the man to answer that.
someone should tell him it won't do much good to scream at us in german.
i don't think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.
i've been working two weeks without a break... and you promised me you'd hire more help.
janine, someone with your qualifications... would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either... the food service or housekeeping industries.
we want to assess any possible environmental impact... from your operation.
for instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste... chemicals in your basement.
you either show me what is down there... or i come back with a court order.
go get a court order, and i'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution.
bellevue doesn't want him, and i'm afraid to put him in lockup.
i know you're into this stuff, so i figured we'd check with you.
during the rectification of the vuldronaii, he came as a large torb!
during the third reconciliation of the last meketrex supplicants... they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sloar!
"and i looked as he opened the sixth seal... and behold, there was a great earthquake;
and the sun became as black as sackcloth... and the moon became as blood."
the architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko.
ray... for a moment... pretend that i don't know anything about... metallurgy, engineering or physics... and just tell me what the hell is going on.
and they call these bozos who conveniently show up... to deal with the problem with a fake, electronic light show.
everything was fine until the power grid was shut off by dickless.
i've only been with the company for a couple weeks... but i gotta tell you, these things are real.
since i joined these men, i've seen shit that'll turn you white.
during the reconciliation of the meketrex, he came as a giant sloar!
many shubs and zuuls were roasted in the sloar that day!
at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue, ten people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.
it blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.
i was just going to say, "8:00?" you are a legitimate phenomenon.
as a friend, i have to tell you, you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.
of course, you forget, peter, i was present at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration.
oh, ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a half.
alice, i'm gonna ask you a couple of standard questions, okay?
have you or any member of your family ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent?
dr. venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.
you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers on the next floor and there's a full kitchen on the top level.
it just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all.
and even though you do your own tax return, which you shouldn't do,
i'd like you to stop by, being that you're my neighbor and all.

that was two days ago, and i haven't been back to my apartment.
generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.
and there were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling.
and there were flames, and i heard a voice say, "zuul."
i assure you, mrs. van houten, there is no problem with the room.
it'll be ready promptly on time as soon as your guests are with us.
do you believe in ufos, astral projections, mental telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full-trance mediums, the loch ness monster and the theory of atlantis?
uh, if there's a steady paycheck in it, i'll believe anything you say.
i mean, someone should tell him it's not gonna do much good to scream at us in german.
well, i don't think that the man is competent to conduct a major symphony orchestra.
miss barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says, in your mind:
"he enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients."
all i do know is i've been working two weeks without a break, and you promised me you'd hire more help.
janine, someone with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either the food service or housekeeping industries.
frankly, there've been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation.
for instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement.
now, you either show me what is down there, or i come back with a court order.
you go get a court order, and i'll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution!
well, let's say this twinkie represents the normal amount of psychokinetic energy in the new york area.
according to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie 35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.
bellevue doesn't want him, and i'm afraid to put him in the lock up.

ray, for a moment, pretend that i don't know anything about metallurgy, engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on.
all i know is that was no light show we saw this morning.
i've seen every form of combustion known to man, but this beats the hell out of me.
peter, at 1:40 p.m at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue 1 0 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition.
it blew books off shelves from 20 feet away and scared the socks off some poor librarian.
as a friend, i must say you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business.
you guys have been meeting every schizo in the five boroughs who says he has a paranormal experience.
for whatever reasons, ray call it fate, call it luck, call it karma i believe that everything happens for a reason.
i believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump.
there's office space, sleeping quarters and showers and there's a full kitchen.

i just whacked her up with about 300 cc's of thorazine.
she's gonna take a little nap now, but she says she's the gatekeeper.
peter, at 1:40 p.m., at the main branch... of the new york public library on fifth avenue... ten people witnessed... a free-floating, full-torso vaporous apparition.
it blew books off shelves from 20 feet away... and scared some poor librarian.
you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle.
your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe... your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.
are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night?
do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic?
for the entrapment... we're gonna have to ask you for $4,000.
but we are having a special this week on proton charging... and storage of the beast... and that's only $1,000.
the eastern seaboard is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity.
alleged ghost sightings and related supernatural occurrences... have been reported across the entire tristate area.
do you believe in ufos, astral projections... mental telepathy, esp, clairvoyance... spirit photography, telekinetic movement... full-trance mediums, the loch ness monster... and the theory of atlantis?
if there's a steady paycheck in it, i'll believe anything you say.
for instance, the presence of noxious, possibly hazardous waste... chemicals in your basement.
you either show me what is down there... or i come back with a court order.
let's say this twinkie represents the normal amount... of psychokinetic energy in the new york area.
according to this morning's sample, it would be a twinkie... thirty-five feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds.
during the third reconciliation of the last meketrex supplicants... they chose a new form for him, that of a giant sloar!
many shubs and zuuls knew what it was to be roasted... in the depths of the sloar that day, i can tell you.
all i know is that was no light show we saw this morning.
i've seen every form of combustion known to man... but this beats the hell out of me.
ever since our first arrival on this planet there have been cases...
we all know the myths going about the place, mr. range.
you're never without a sense of direction while there's an air flow.
air flows from a to b. usually you want to be at b... or at a...
i don't want to be at a or b, thank you very much.
i just want to be out of these tunnels and back in the...
i'm only going through with this to generate some publicity for the agency.
do you think i enjoy this shallow adulation... being flung into the world of hot tubs and saunas, surrounded by women... subjected to casual, meaningless sex?
it was my delightful duty to personally select all the finalists.
oh, miss taylor, i'm flattered and humbled by this- this unique honor.
now that you've sampled the appetizers, i think it's time you feasted on the main course.
ladies, feel free to drool... and, men, don't be ashamed of feeling inadequate.
aprivate investigator, remington tells us he loves old movies... especially those concerned with murder, mystery and mayhem.
the ideal lady for him is one he can work with as well as play with.
but these activities wouldn't be very meaningful without someone to share them with.
and upbeat magazine wants this to be... one of the most meaningful days of your lives... so we've taken the liberty of selecting companions for our fortunate four... each of them chosen for their unique gifts of beauty, poise and intelligence... and each, incidentally, members of the famous l.a. owls cheerleaders, the owlets!
if it's any consolation to you, miss holt, i totally agree.
this entire bachelor campaign is merely a tawdry excuse to promote sales.
i just don't wanna see either one of you get hurt.
an admirable intent, but standing guard over me isn't the way to accomplish that.
the pain pills are on the stand next to the bed.
if he falls asleep, make sure you wake him every few hours.
is there any connection, no matter how vague... how prosaic, with the other bachelors?
my law firm has a department that specializes in sports figures.
if we can find it, it'll go a long way in establishing motive.
if a man's clever enough to conceive of a plan like this... he would've destroyed that letter by now.
what would you say if i told you i'd found a witness... who saw you kill dr. harold ridley the other day?
i'd say i haven't the vaguest idea what you're talking about, mr. steele... and i suspect neither do you.
the man is found with a bullet hole in his head, a gun in his hand.
that hardly qualifies as one of the century's most puzzling mysteries.
victor didn't want it to look as if he was... starting a magazine for his girlfriend.
but as soon as it was successful, we were gonna be married.
i invested the best, most fertile years of my life in that creep!
miss taylor, the insurance policy victor took out on butch moran-where can i find it?
if it had anything to do with the hockey team... he kept it in his office at the arena.
without victor's backing, the magazine'll fold... and i'll be walking the streets.
as you've already pointed out, millicent is not the brightest lady in the world.
she mistakenly signed a prenuptial agreement... limiting the amount of money she could get from janoff.
and then when i spoke tojanoff and he inquired about my injuries.
it never dawned on me at the time, but i wonder how he knew... so precisely, that i had broken my ribs and broken my leg.
- quite an accomplishment- honored for being unable to make a commitment.
i'm only going through with this to generate some publicity for the agency.
if you'd be so kind as to nestle behind these curtains.
i want to give the mob the full impact of your introduction.
a stockbroker, chip enjoys volleyball on the beach and long walks in the rain.
he lists his favorite books as the money game and the prophet.
i'm sure we're all familiar with butch, the star forward of our l.a. owls hockey team.
besides his rugged good looks, butch is gifted with a fine sense of humor.
and now, if you will, please welcome bachelor number four, remington steele.
aprivate investigator, remington tells us he loves old movies... especially those concerned with murder, mystery and mayhem.
the ideal lady for him is one he can work with as well as play with.
he's never read the prophet, but he's promised to run out and buy a copy.
you'll get plenty of opportunities as the day wears on... because we've planned an action-packed agenda... crammed with tennis, golf, swimming, sauna and hot tub.
but these activities wouldn't be very meaningful without someone to share them with.
you don't seem to be in the spirit of these festivities.
well, watching grown men act like a bunch of adolescent schoolboys... isn't my idea of a stimulating afternoon.
if the foot protruding from my mouth is a size six, it's mine.
if it's any consolation to you, miss holt, i totally agree.
is that the fine sense of humor miss taylor was talking about?
it's just the way he plays hockey- all brawn, no brains.
an admirable intent, but standing guard over me isn't the way to accomplish that.
whatever course our relationship takes must be set by laura and me!
it wouldn't have happened if i'd accepted remy's invitation to spend the night.
millicent, would you be kind enough to make a cup of tea?
shouldn't you be trying to get as much rest as possible?
what would you say if i told you i'd found a witness... who saw you kill dr. harold ridley the other day?
it's a little early for champagne, but this is a special occasion.
it's not every day we solve a case by phone call.
but as soon as it was successful, we were gonna be married.
now all i've got is victor's promise... that if anything ever happened to him, i'd be taken care of.
you didn't happen to see an insurance policy on butch moran anywhere, did you?
i invested the best, most fertile years of my life in that creep!
miss taylor, the insurance policy victor took out on butch moran-where can i find it?
if it had anything to do with the hockey team... he kept it in his office at the arena.
it never dawned on me at the time, but i wonder how he knew... so precisely, that i had broken my ribs and broken my leg.
since there were only four people aware of that- myself, of course, the doctor who treated me, miss holt... and you, miss fairbush.
on the 29th march 2084 the robot presenter of tv galactica was programmed to celebrate in the following terms:
the 200th anniversary of the 1884 law and inception of the trade union movement.
you were quite perplexed to receive a film dedicated to the 100th anniversary of trade and imagined that it would last a century longer.
undoubtedly somewhat crushed by the difficulty and perhaps by the fear of saying things about where they were at, they instead browsed their machine so as to ask themselves where they will be.
grey is the crisis hypothesis a crisis from which one can't escape.
the welfare system allows attenuation of its effects, but the imagination is exhausted.
when all one's energy is required to stay afloat there is hardly anything left to invent the future.
of course the crisis deteriorates until there is an explosion, either social or nuclear.
there the line of thought comes to an end, because perhaps there could be a scorpions' union but let's say that's less relevant to us.
most probably in this hypothesis there is a society of little happiness, that provides itself with false security and the hope of a stability which is always under threat.
in this case the union is at best a powerful protective organization efficient in its own way which uses up to date methods so as to manage your interests, guarantee employment and assure you the greatest comfort.
that type of union will not invent another type of society;
society remains as it is, the well-to-do are still there as are the excluded, marginales que deberían normalizarse but it is a union which has power against the bosses, bankers and power - whatever that power may be.
it also has traditions which it maintains because the nostalgia for the past is handy as a substitute for that nostalgia for the future that in other times was called revolution.
this is the black hypothesis, it could be fascism or maybe stalinism we know it already and so in a certain way it was less dangerous it was predictable.
what was less so, was that techniques of power would replace ideology.
this was what was at stake, the great question at the end of the century.
not having understood these stakes in time, the government of this future was left in the hands of a new species of manager:
they are talked about now with the same condescension used to describe the textile workers who threw the first machines into the street in the 19th century.
progress was not brought to the poor but to those who had shown it to them.
you have more images in your home than the eyes can take in.
what use is an independent press, radio or tv another source of information to choose, reflect upon, or become indignant about.
drawing its strength from mistaking its opponent pitting sector against sector, natives against immigrants, men against women, organization against organization.
the inheritors of the workers movement ended up losing once and for all the confidence of a class where they were already a minority.
we needed a colour, and we decided on the blue hypothesis, but with caution, the bolt from the blue tomorrow which sings leaves us feeling foolish.
to only imagine a tomorrow which would not be completely catastrophic but exactly in this period of great truths it's rather healthy to imagine other things for example one way of acquiring new certainties is to learn to doubt together.
it begins to reveal itself as a fabulous force for the transformation of the world, and this includes the struggle against hunger, sickness, suffering, against ignorance and intolerance.
it is still a struggle but now in terms born of the 21st and not the 19th century
so what the robotic presenter of 2084 could say might be this
"fundamentally the 20th century didn't exist it was just a long and interminable transition from barbarism to culture.
in the 80s those who still felt anger at the poverty and injustice of industrial society were right, those who posed the hope of a different and new society were right as well.
the role of the unions was to create a bridge between the rage and the hope;
they were an instrument of this new struggle, the place where different imaginations met to create new forms of solidarity, where people sought with others how to live together without feeling diminished or damaging each other, how to make good use of their differences how best to master time
it was a union which sought not to impose a dogmatic view, but put people in contact with each other, and with ideas and facts to facilitate individual projects
he will say what we tell him if we know how to do it.
and provided we hurry a little it'll take just a century.
you`d propably like it again i know all about orphanages and i know all about orphans and l`m not interested.
if you could just see these children... i `d probably puke.
well, to be honest i think they`ll have trouble getting a bank loan or a car this expensive.
shoot, isn`t that the way with banks, all they know is dollars and cents.
of course he can`t make the payments but he can put the $500 down.
the first payment he misses we`ll repo that old junker if it still runs.
you make more money selling a car three times then you do selling it once.
plunder and pillage pal, that`s the name of the game. don`t ever forget it.
well, how`s my chief mechanic doing on his first week of the job?
oh, just fine sir. i was wondering if i could just ask you something?
oh, i know that and i appreciate the job a lot, i really do.
lt`s just that one of my kids is sick, awfully sick and i have been out of work for a little while and i would sure like to get him some toys for christmas.
i don`t know what the next year is going to bring with him and i would like to have some something for him under the tree.
l`ll work overtime, pay you back interest... whatever i just have...
lt`s because i care about you imagine the look ofjoy on the face of the one you love.
when they look out on the driveway christmas morning and see the car of their choice.
you can shut off the tv eddie but you can`t shut off the truth.
all the money i have is right there on the end table.
shoved me in a foundling home that`s when i made up my mind that i was going to be so rich.
that nobody was ever going to take me away from my loved ones again.
because they can`t afford them, so they use one size fits all.
you know, the first money i ever made i bought myself a pair of pyjamas.
shut him up fish, he can`t say those things about me you`re my friend.
only a cruel and insensitive person would act to evict orphans on christmas day.
you mean all they need to cure that kid is money?
but what about the free hospitals, what about the money they steal out my taxes for welfare and stuff?
yeah, but no friends, i mean er, you think the guy would have some friends that would show up for the funeral?
a guy like that, you can`t help feeling sorry for him you know. he wasn`t exactly poor.
if you are throwing a few more bucks we`ll get you a hearing aid.
well, if this is your idea of a joke i think it`s a pretty cruel one.
merry christmas dave, boy oh boy, you saved me from making a terrible mistake yesterday.
then you took off before i could give you your christmas bonus.
i want to ask a favour off the little guy over here.
now bobby, i hear tale there`s a hospital down there in texas where doctors can take little guys like you who who are feeling a little puny, and ziperty zip before you know it you`re up on both feet.
would you go down there with me and your dad and your mum and your sisters?
we`ll let those doctors take a crack at getting you out of this chair.
well, you see, i never had any kids and l`m an age now when i ought to be playing with my grand kids but i don`t have any of them either.
so, i was wondering if every once in a while you and i could play together and, you know throw the ball around play checkers and stuff like that?
they stopped just outside the last station, uncoupled the coaches, and ran thomas on a siding out of the way.
the guard called for an engine inspector and the driver found large notices.
"well, thomas, you have been fishing but we must get them out."
they took turns at fishing while the fat controller told them how to do it.
what you call the spirit of the mountain is fire itself.
and that fire will pour down onto your settlement destroying everything in its path.

and now, he's thrown all that away and whatever it's worth so, you can bet it has to be for something damn important.

there is a missile silo a mile to the west and another a mile and a half south.
they're both connected to the road that's in front of the farm.
the united states is my country and i took an oath to protect it, even if it cost me my life.
i suppose it's just the local militia dropping by for some tea?
hey, moses, i don't know what they're saying, but it sounds like "no" to me.
i'm not gonna haul 2 screaming, kicking women through the woods in the dark.

fox willed his money to the guild... to tear down our old victorian, buy the lot next door... and build a proper headquarters for our organization.
now, the will was probated, the money paid into the treasury.
but the only top-10 list nussman ever made was labeled "wanted. "
had i but known, mr. steele, that on this fair autumn morn... destiny would bring us together.
there was no family, as i recall, no survivors... and there was nothing suspicious about his death.
a man with no history of heart trouble suddenly drops dead?
because he thought you, uh, might not feel like answering the door?
my daughter and her husband wanna put me in an old folks' home.
yeah, it cost me a bundle, but it was worth it.
i look at those bars, i do almost 5,000 words a day.
i learned the potent power of printed passion, and then i pounced.
i understand the late gil fox had more than a casual interest in you.
are you suggesting there's a dead body somewhere in this building?
well, it appears the only reason the money was embezzled... was to stop this building from being torn down.
mr. steele, i have a funny feeling we've been looking... for the protégé of the wrong writer.
i may hate myself for days, but arsenic and old lace... is beginning to look better and better.
at first, mr. steele suspected that gil fox was murdered by his protégé.
but after painstaking detective work on his part... he realized that fox was killed because he was about to write a book... exposing the murder of his friend, b. craven... the murderer being craven's protégé.
little did the killer know that by committing this second crime...
fox's murder, he or she... was triggering his or her own undoing.
what we have here is a killer- a killer who will stop at nothing to conceal his or her original crime... a killer who has already snuffed out two additional lives...
gil fox and melvin gamble... in order to keep buried the secret of b. craven's disappearance.
craven was giving miss cooper writing lessons in exchange for her typing.
but she liked what she was typing so much... that she decided to steal it and publish it as her first novel.
oh, and finally... we at the steele agency are your avid fans.
so, if you don't mind, during the social hour... my staff will pass among you with copies of your books.
- they turned down your latest novel... in favor of the memoirs of that hollywood mogul.
if you're trying to find the embezzler... and i assume you are, you're going about it all wrong.
might i remind you, mr. bemis... that you people are under scrutiny, not i.
and i got the distinct impression from that phone call... that you've lost a lot of money financing a television series based on your books.
miss alma torrance... paleographer and author of your handwriting and your soul.
and mr. victor beldown... associate dean of the graduate school of criminal investigation... at the university of landsdowne.
has it occurred to you that butch's interest in you... may have to do with his possible complicity in this case?
has it occurred to you that he just might be interested in me?
i'd feel a lot more comfortable working on this case... if our suspects wrote children's books.
you and mildred and i have our fair share of a crash course of reading tonight.
once the job is done, the protégé kills the mentor. "
you think fox may have been writing about his own future?
well, actually, laura, if you read between the lines... look at the work analytically and contemplate the nuances, no.
well, then i suggest we try to find out who gil fox's protégé was.
is this why gil fox put your money in trust with the writers?
because he thought you, uh, might not feel like answering the door?
or is it a desperate attempt to drum up interest in a flagging career?
"now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. "
a couple of lovable old biddies... poison homeless gentlemen and then bury them in the basement.
are you suggesting there's a dead body somewhere in this building?

little did the killer know that by committing this second crime...
fox's murder, he or she... was triggering his or her own undoing.
by activating fox's will... which mandated the tearing down of this building.
but she liked what she was typing so much... that she decided to steal it and publish it as her first novel.
the only way she could have managed that was to, uh, kill him.
i'm going to be a mother, like the mother of... my mother and the mother of the mother's mother.
the kingdom needs an heir but what shall we do... if you have a girl, like you were?
i'm going to be a mother, like the mother of... my mother and the mother of the mother's mother.

in september, 1937, the need for unified resistance to the japanese by the communists and the kuomintang forced chiang kai-shek's kuomintang goverment to recognize the communist shaanxi-gansun-ningxia border region
however, the people of northern shaanxi province still suffered heavily because of the kuomintang local government
artists of the communist eighth route army came to collect folks songs
in this ancient place the melody of xintianyou hangs in the air throughout the year.
is it true that girls in the south learn to write?
the ducks are in the lake, the geese are on the wild mountain.
the comrade living with us does not know that i like to sing.
i'd like to say what is on my mind, but i don't know how.
a tree can take root if planted on a dry stone.
when will we poor people be able to live a new live?
however, the people of northern shaanxi province still suffered heavily because of the kuomintang local government
artists of the communist eighth route army came to collect folks songs
the ice on the yellow river will not melt in june.
when i start to sing the truth, my heart feels like bursting.
people will know why they are suffering why women are beaten and why workers and peasants should rise up.
when our army hears them, they'll fight the rich and the japanese even more bravely.
the ducks are in the lake, the geese are on the wild mountain.
the comrade living with us does not know that i like to sing.
i'd like to say what is on my mind, but i don't know how.
my mother wants to sell me off, but she won't ask how i feel.

instead of bandages, why did you not paint and powder your face to make it visible?
i would need to remove it in order to vanish again.
i'd gone over the list of the things a man reckons desirable.
invisibility makes it possible to get them but it also makes it impossible to enjoy them.
what's the good of pride of place when you can't appear there?
i have no taste for politics, for the blaggardisms of fame, for philanthropy, for sport.
i had one hope, half a hope, and i have it still.
a way of getting back, of restoring what i've done, but only after i've finished all that i mean to do invisibly.
my father told me you'd go to the state liquor store.
why am i always the one who has to run errands?
¶ my world has turned dark, life without you has no meaning
you've lost your manhood, and got left with what, i wonder!
what if i said, stay home and look after the children ...
every woman's husband finds work, only you don't, is that it?
you just can't find in her what you're used to with the city women.
if she displayed her hair and her behind, would you like her better then?
what business do you have sitting with another man's wife, scoundrel?
it's a virtue to rent out, but a sin to ask for rent, is that it?
whatever she has on her mind, it'll be worse than if she had kicked us out.
you lift your leg like this and spin round very fast.
"abi", he said... "have a drink and a bite, i'll give you half of the grand bazar."
"so you're trying to bribe again one of our civil servants", i said.
your mother, your wife, your sisters-in-law, they raided my home this morning.
if you weren't happy with your wife, they wouldn't act like that.
otherwise, they will shoot him for being nice to the germans.
i have to be nice to my wife, because if she finds out i'm having an affair with yvette, she will shoot me.
and if yvette finds out i'm having an affair with maria, well, she will shoot me too.
now, otto flick, the gestapo officer, is having dinner in the back room.
upstairs are two german officers in their underwear, because i have borrowed their uniforms to help two british airmen to escape.
the pianist over there is, in fact, a forger for the marquis.
if i do not have my uniform in 10 minutes, you will be shot.
but colonel, your revolver is on the belt of the uniform, which is around the waist of the british airman who is not here.
the radio is under her bed and the loudspeaker is in her chamber.
if the germans hear a voice coming from her chamberpot, our cover will be blown.
tomorrow morning at midday, you will go to 36 rue d'escargot.
you will knock three times, and they will give you pigeons.
you have five minutes to talk, otherwise, i will shoot you.
if we don't get it going, she's going to shoot herself.
ah, but dear colonel, with respect, i am afraid you are in too deep.
there is the little matter of helping the british airmen to escape.
very soon you will have your uniforms back, and the copy of the painting to give to the gestapo, to please the fuhrer. eh?
the girls will be here with the wet celery, and life will be back to normal.
i prefer-- i think i prefer being a peasant to being a german.
you'll be a dead peasant if herr flick finds out we've been helping british airmen to escape.
i was asked to keep the jewel by a member of the royal family.
it's the blue ruby, supposedly the only one in the world.
he must be trying to swindle the kid and keep the jewel for himself.
why don't we get a good night's sleep and attack them tomorrow.
veruna is where one of the last surviving groups of mankind took shelter when the great... er...
yes, i suppose you've got all that to look forward to haven't you?
look, we lost all our technology when our ship crashed here.
now, don't you think our struggle has been hard enough without this added foolishness?
i think your colony of earth people is in grave danger of extinction.
be quiet, they can here us walking on the hull of the ship.
we may lack the outward appurtenances of might, but we carry our strength within us!
we will win the war with the invisible aggressors whose missiles batter on our planet, and we will win the greater battle - the struggle for the future... of our race!
if i had a spare millennium, i'd bring you up to date on time mechanics.
unfortunately, we have this lighting problem, and a ward full of people needing medical attention.
who robbed the post office on hälsingegatan on st lucia day?
you're not the first one to ask that, i can tell you that.
immigrant, with a golden ring in his ear, face full of pimples.
do you really believe that i'd socialize with pimply immigrants who wear earrings.
he must've swept up the tracks before he got back in the car.
it all seemed so strange, that's why i memorized the number.
there seems to be a high death rate among the ones involved in stockholm 6.
if jansson was really run over purposely, it'd be interesting to know who the driver was.
yes, but as i tried to explain to you, the courts are pretty strict nowadays.
the prosecutor could argue that you were influenced by the selection of the photos.
- why the fuck was the car seen by the graveyard?
someone stole it from the street, used it, then brought it back to where he got it.
i saw this photo in an old copy of expressen, and i thought...
well, this is that bum who came up to the guards outside and asked about a policeman who was supposed to work in the building.
but in the directory there was no one by the name he gave us.
well, he got really mad about it, and i threatened to "call the police".
on tuesday, december 13th, hedberg has an alibi for the whole day, ...from 9 am to 5 pm.
the fact that sec can't supply him with an alibi for christmas eve, ...when he was off duty, seems neglectable under the circumstances.
but he could've worked on the 13th and still have been at the hold-up at stockholm 6.
he's got a witness, if you are familiar with that term.
and according to that witness, they haven't been at stockholm 6.
if this witness happens to be his partner öst, i wouldn't give a damn about his testimony.
an arm's-length distance between the minister and hedberg, the whole day long.
the minister keeps a detailed diary, he's absolutely certain with times and places.
because later that day i heard that there had been a robbery at the bank... post office.
and i thought it was rather strange that he would go up there to have fun with that woman.
- ran out on the street, got run over by a car.
yes, you mourn over a dog just as much as over a human.
he should be locked up in a state prison, along with his so-called alibi.
i have talked to eva zetterberg, and also to our friend, the minister of justice.
i'm only saying that the connection we saw between hedberg and the mj didn't exist.
you don't give a dog leash to someone to hasn't got a dog.
else you'll start to claim that the mj never saw eva zetterberg that night, when i was freezing my ass off on the stairs.
or that i never took that photo which you managed to throw away with the shrimpshells...
the lucia procession he fixed like a piece of cake, nice and neat.
think of it, if it had been an amateur at work, he would have massacred the kids!
- what the hell, i was going to call a pal, is that forbidden?
- that's what i'm afraid of, that you're going to end up with your old gang, your old "pals".
really andersson, you dared to come down here to the ape house?
- i just wondered if you had come up with something new about stockholm 6.
it's not that funny to thaw meatballs by yourself and lay the table for one person.
you think of that, when your wife brings you your slippers!
- but wasn't it a suitable place you were looking for?
we saw you outside a disreputable place in ostermalm the other night.
- but we have no use of that in the city!
- the feeling, johan, the feeling of having more power under the hood than you need!
new personal record between fridhemsplan and hall, could possibly go below that.
if you walk the last bit, it will be counted as a remorse.
but that's the kind of stuff that the kids were doing 10 years ago, it's 1983 now, johan!
- let me put it this way: it's hard times for sweden.
it's best to stay sober, you never know what can happen.
"schhheventy five coins is the price for a ppptty cookie with ssscchhhop between the wrappers"
it's better to wait for the csi, they can find a thing or two on these.
- hey, do you think someone could have driven this car, despite it wasn't rented?
- i'm sure it's going to be alright with your hat, mrs. forsberg.
- yes, but you have had it for quite a while.
you heard that it didn't go well with the car in the esso garage?
it was one of the employees who had secretly borrowed it.
and when papalexis found out from jansson's fiancee that he was "murdered by car", according to her, he realized that this was serious, and therefore stopped his search.
after that we haven't got a word from him, he just zipped his mouth.
papalexis refused to tell who he was looking for, or whether he ever found him.
- you seem to have high death rate among the ones involved in stockholm 6.
besides that, olsson has never been in prison, other than for booze and disorderly behaviour.
it looks to me like a group holiday to gran canaria.
the whole guy was a big damned hint that it was a colleague who had done it.
and papalexis was not afraid about the bags he had on him, he was afraid that we would beat him to death!
- but couldn't it be rogge himself who touched the documents?
no, because when i was getting a bank book at home in the morning it was in order, but in the evening it was in different order!
and then he turned around and i saw that it wasn't olsson!
- can we do this: we write this down at our place?
- yes, but as i tried to explain to you over the phone, the court is pretty severe nowadays.
the prosecutor would argue that you were more tied to the photo in that case, so we have to do it this way.
i saw this photo in an old expressen... and i thought...
this is that wino who came to the guard and asked about a policeman who was supposed to work here in the house.
but i took him out to the street and wrote a memory note about it, we have our instructions.
i thought it was something trivial, so i didn't report it.
it's written in the note but i can't remember where it has gone.
you heard that he has an alibi for the christmas eve, that bullitt?
item by item, so i can show it to the prosecutor.
we might as well inform him about our suspicions about hedberg right away.
and we must also get a search warrant for his home.
i will contact sak and ask what hedberg was doing on tuesday morning, 13 december 1983, and on christmas eve's afternoon.
on tuesday, december 13, hedberg has alibi for the whole day, from 9 am to 5 pm.
the fact that sak can't give him an alibi for the christmas eve, he was off duty that day, is in these circumstances of less interest.
- yes, but the fact that he was working on december 13 doesn't mean that he couldn't have visited stockholm 6!
- he has a so called witness, if you are familiar with this term, and according to the witness they haven't visited stockholm 6.
- unfortunately, we are "prevented to tell, with respect to the security of the state"...
- hedberg was a bodyguard for the minister on lucia day, right?
there were consultations until 1 pm, and then back to the government building.
there they had a late lunch, followed by work until 3 pm, after that home to nacka again.
- i know, i know what you are about to say, johansson.
but one thing is sure: this newspaper seems to be the biggest gossip central when it comes to questioning morals.
conclusions: we know that hedberg has no alibi for the robbery.
now we must find out how much dahlgren and his men know.
inspector hedberg of the security service went to the post office and borrowed 395 000.
all the documents will be on yout desk at 09:00:00 beep!
"the weekly chronicle", "daily news" and whatever they are called, this is where i have seen him but i never saw the minister of justice at out stairs.
why should he be at our stairs, such a fine man?
- she jumped out in the street and the car run over her.
yes, when a dog dies, you mourn her as much as a human.
he is the client of the penal system, and so does his so called "alibi".
i have talked to both eva zetterberg and our friend the minister.
and mrs. forsberg, she is also getting not so sure about the case.
on the other hand, vindeln is even more certain than before, so if we are going to prosecute, it will be with vindeln alone.
i only say that the connection between hedberg and the minister of justice that we saw it didn't exist.
you don't give a dog leash to someone who doesn't have a dog!
we have a hell of a financial situation, you must understand that.
you are not the only one who wants the piece of this pie, i tell you.
why, when you are finally given a task of tremendous importance do you act so irresponsibly?
why, when you are not in this country even one full day before you get drunk and pass out at a diplomatic reception?
if i can't act in the theater, i act in the dining room.
didn't i ever tell you i studied acting at the royal academy of dramatic art?
maybe he's just trying to take two bohunks for a ride.
i really believe mr. whitsett will be true to his word.
amanda, this whole episode with the soldiers wasn't the only time falconwing has been in danger.
see, we could have followed whitsett and when he drew out garrison and sykes, we'd have arrested them all.
and it will run out to greet you when you return home.
and look, if you don't treat me right, he will bite you!
there is so much work to do here, there is no end to it.
since is no buyer for these potatoes, take them to the basement.
and the testimony i will present to this tribunal, will prove the innocense of my clients, with out a shadow of a doubt.
the day of the events, the accused gentlemen, marten, and picot, where in my office in marseille, discussing business persuant to the farmer's cooperative.
i have the withness accounts of two farmers, who were tending their fields, when they saw the truck loose control,
and swerving from one side of the road to the other, skipped the shoulder, to fall ablaze in fire.
very well, as soon as you are ready, we can go.
oh, we will travel as husband and wife, do you remember?
i know that the government subsidies may have something to do with it.
do not forget, if they get some money, the begin hoarding.
they do not want to sell at the prices we offer.
and more than one, tries to sell their products directly, without the co-op's permission.
with a little luck and that truck down below, we might just catch them.
and with a iot of luck, we'ii get out of this jungle alive.
we'll know which four teams will be selected for next season's europe cup.
let's add that, tonight, in our city, will be disputed one of the quarterfinals that fascinate every football fan.
between the god tv, the god car and the god football, your schedule keeps getting tighter.
you never talk about anything else, in the morning, at noon, during love.
you listen to the audience and when they scream, you whistle.
except i want to become an international referee, you see, and i won't make it if i act yellow.
he's got to confess it all then we'll take him to the cops.
i'm telling you that, in front of the cops, he'll change his song.
look, the others don't know but, we, at the factory, know you.
you used to pull your dirty tricks alone, but now you need dumb asses to pull them for you.
i don't want anybody's pity they can all drop dead, for all i care.
the only person that i long for is my dad, and he's never there.
the teachers at school are down on me, they say i drive them nuts.
the other children don't want to play, they hate my guts.
my ma is a nasty piece of work, beats me whenever she can.
she scolds like a fishwife, all day long, and fools around with all kinds of men.
my father did the best he could, when he walked out her loveless door.
i miss him more than i can say, but i have to wait 'til his ship's ashore.
keep your son off the streets at night in the future, de hahn.
if i ever see him again, he'll be sent to reform school!
instead of him packing off that miserable john verkerk, the rat cops the lot again!
but it's not all true what you said, is it ?
so... you'll understand that your letter was a bit of a shock.
i don't think that it'll ever be solved between those two.
but until i've found a job, we'll have to manage like this.
i didn't even have enough money to come and get you.

-lf i were running things... you wouldn't be playing at these crummy weddings.
you'd be at carnegie hall, madison square garden... you'd be at the orange bowl.
he took my identity away and gave it to some yo-yo... who's now living with my wife.
she's pregnant with my child, and i've got to get her back.
for the time being - though death is a daily occurrence on this planet, as you can see.
the constant state of panic, and the growing number of rets...
the arar-jecks of heiradi hollowed out a huge subterranean city under their planet during the 20 aeon war.
well there was a quarry, where the stone came from to build the medical shelter converted that into a place to get away from the bombardment.
when i was very small, i was sitting on his knee in the state room, and i asked him why we couldn't go underground anymore.
he said... it was a child answer - seemed quite sensible at the time.
ah, he's a good man - if a little narrow in his outlook.
he's planning to move you to your quarters in the colony ship.
the auctioneer tells me that the stones alone should fetch about $3 million... the proceeds of which have already been earmarked to fund our various charities.
so you see why i wanted you two here with me.
to be truthful, i'm more interested in what happened... at the robbery at the auction this morning.
look, i told the police everything i know, which is nothing.
i don't take blue cross, charley, but i do take white ice.
you come back here with $300,000 in diamonds... and you've got yourself a new face.
i mean, this is just what we needed, the man who never was.
he's got fake ids, fake credit cards, fake driver's license... even his fingerprints don't belong to him.
you told me yourself it was more important for you to love him... than it was for him to love you.
maybe you suspected he didn't love you as much... and that he was only using you.
he was kicked out of the american institute... of plastic surgery almost a year ago.
that's when he showed up at the monastery of the grape... with an offer of financial assistance.
and would you decide whether you're going to wear that cap... or throttle it to death?
the two of you are as nervous as a pair of devonshire school girls.
then why have you been sipping tea from an empty cup for the last half-hour?
i gave him enough seconal to put a horse to sleep... but i wouldn't bet on him staying under till morning.
i knew from experience that very few would return with their skin.
at noon... the late-risers and serious souvenir-hunters were prowling about... snatching up bargain buys on plastic hula skirts and cheap coral beads.
the cops are pretty good about keeping hookers off the street during the day... but i guess when you're as big as olga... you can work any time you want.
by sunset, the last of the lobsters were returning from the beach.
i was assigned to lord mountbatten as his temporary batman... while his sergeant major recovered from a mishap with a sacred cow.
we never really quite understood... how he managed to so infuriate that animal.
but then i showed him... you know, the picture i have in my wallet of mac, julie and i... at luau louie's the night he was killed.
look, why don't you guys go ahead and order and i'll wait for father jim?
he hasn't called, so unless the poor man... has had an incredible emergency... or some sort of an accident... it is highly probable that he is a figment... of magnum's distraught imagination.

thought you were trying to blow my cover... till i checked your story out.
they may be marine pilots... but most of them are just kids in their early 20s... and those slicks in little saigon... are taking them in a crooked poker game.
so, i'm supposed to raid it... pretending to be shore patrol?
i figure it's my job to help our boys, not to punish them and...
i mean, if we're talking about drugs... or stolen government property or something, that's different.
none of my friends had seen him... and the people who did wouldn't admit it.
i couldn't blame higgins or the guys for thinking i was hallucinating.
he insisted that he'd told me the truth... that his real name was jim bonick.
it seems he and a friend named travis... had switched names in pensacola... in some elaborate scheme to avoid duty watches... and he'd ended up commissioned with travis's name.

they're more for me at this point... just so that i can get it straight.
police are refusing to speculate on the similarity between the shooting deaths and no other connection between the two victims has been established yet.
we'll have more on this late-breaking story as it comes in.
you stay down by day, but at night you can move around.
you still have to be careful because the h-ks use infrared.
what's difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.
but i guess i have a while before you're old enough to understand these tapes.
you really should tell that captain caleb to do something about his food.
the girls and i tried it last friday, and, honestly, it isn't very good.
oh, you may turn me over to the local constable, mr. giles, but no amount of coercion will force me to betray a trust.
on the other hand, when the local newspapers get hold of this story, the finger of suspicion will point equally at each of your guests.
i'm sorry, peter, but at those prices, off-broadway is off my budget.
do you have any idea what it costs to get a new production mounted?
for the past several months, my relationship with the captain has been strictly business.
speaking of which, the old rooster seems to have flown the coop.
what better way to repay your kind invitation than to amuse your guests.
what would you all like to hear, the complete score to pipe dream?
suppose you tell me what happened here last night, mr. giles.
folks don't go around gettin' half their heads blown off for no reason.
when it's murder, the county cops have a way of takin' over.
i suppose they think that a chief of police from a small town like me is in over his head.
well, if you believe that grady is a thief, maybe they're right.
look, mrs. fletcher, i know he's kin, but facts are facts.
at 6:00 a.m. this morning, we found that detective's car... parked about half a mile from giles's place.
in the glove compartment, we found a confidential real estate report... that mccallum tells us is worth $300,000 or $400,000 in the wrong hands.
baxendale took the sherlock holmes costume out of the front closet so he could mingle, then lured grady out to the pool area.
they think that grady lost his temper and shot him with the skeet gun.
two years ago, she was low gal in the steno pool.
then, all of a sudden, she and the captain were practicing indoor olympics... in hotel rooms all over town.
now, you wait here, bernie, and i'll go upstairs and get some money.
aw, forget it, mrs. f. if this ointment works, it's worth a lot more than a few bucks on a meter.
now, be sure to put it on for a half hour every night for a week.
and don't forget to write to me and let me know how it worked.
and remember, whoever she was dealing with... was just as vulnerable as she was.
well, it doesn't figure she'd keep anything incriminating in her office.
and i think you'll sleep much better once you've arrested ashley vickers.
chief, this evening, i was privy to a conversation... in which she practically admitted having stolen that report.
when asked if she was under suspicion in her husband's death, authorities had no official comment.
mrs. mccallum, could i ask you, why would they ask you to come down here today?
except for the fact that your nephew is off the hook.
miss vickers and mr. brill have made full statements about the theft of the documents.
but i've been operating on automatic pilot... automatic banking, automatic security systems, automatic lights, appliances.
[exhales] i'm a pampered rich man who does nothing for himself, and i'm miserable.
look, jess, you and i are going to be joined at the hip professionally for a long, long time.
if something else is destined to come out of this relationship, so be it.
if not, at least i'll have made a very good friend.
they're talking about a movie deal, but don't get your hopes up.
well, the tape with barbara walters is going to air on friday.
oh, and finally the new york times book reporter that's been assigned to you... um, a chris landon...
things that didn't mean anything at the time, but now i understand.
in the cab, after you'd retained the lawyer, you promised that grady would be exonerated one way or the other.
i told him you left for pago pago and weren't expected back till the turn of the century.
the times reporter assigned to interview me... was a young woman, not a man, preston.
if anyone had been outside, they could have heard the shot.
many years ago, i was betrayed by three partners in a business venture.
although i had nothing to do with the construction end, i was made the scapegoat.
they got off free, and i was sentenced to 15 years in prison.
preston, even if i could bring myself to believe that, there's no way that you can justify the murdering of caleb mccallum.
and you did kill him, for the same reason... to divert suspicion from yourself.
and since you get nothing for free in life, as a payment for your work you'll get food!
then give me some food and i work hard for it.
how could i get married if i have so many work to do!
if you want to, you can work by us too, till you get k.o.
because i couldn't have known earlier that it will be raining later, you smart guy.
then we should've waited with the coming till it stops raining.
i'm the bearer of a message to the chinese people, a message of friendship from the brazilian people,
i am undoubtedly contributing towards a closer relationship between our peoples, who can and should be good friends.
zhou enlai, prime minister of the state council, talks with vice-president joão goulart.
liu shaoqi, president of the people's republic of china, welcomes vice-president joão goulart.
" let's distribute the land, through the strike of the hatchet, we shall unlock a new world;
with the strike of the scythe, we shall eliminate the old one."
on august 23rd, vice-president joão goulart ends his visit to china and leaves canton to return to brazil.
xeng xeng, the vice-governor of the guangzhou province, and other officials of the province of the city, together with a well-wishing crowd, say goodbye to the guests of honor at the railway station.
it was a little past 6 in the morning when president jânio quadros, as usual, locked himself up in his office.
that day, however, he drafted the terms of his resignation, which would be sent to the national congress a few hours later, stirring up a lethargic friday session.
defeated by what he called " terrible forces" in his resignation note,
jânio was photographed for the last time as president alongside the " occult forces" .
and immediately i though of calling a meeting in itamaraty with those friends i could talk to immediately, in order to pay homage to the resigning president.
and i was glad that idea was well-accepted, because, not only my personal friends met in itamaraty but also the diplomats that were then in rio de janeiro -
the drivers of the ministry, to diplomats who were then in rio de janeiro.
so we opened a bottle of champagne in honor of the president
and, in a moment of conservative traditionalism, we offered to those present one last itamaraty reception.
he received the news in singapore, at the raffles hotel, in the middle of the night.
an american telegraphic agency called seeking his comments on the resignation of jânio quadros.
he had not been aware of such resignation until just then.
now, we will not be celebrating my presidency, but rather paying homage to unpredictability."
são borja, a frontier town, at the missions àrea, is the birth and resting place of two presidents:
the 1 7 years in between his swearing in as state congressman in '47 and his overthrowing from power in '64, only deepened his nationalism and commitment to social justice, the tragic reasons behind the common destiny of both men.
by putting a gun to his chest on the morning of august 24th, 1954,
getúlio vargas brought an end to his own life and also to the plans of his opponents who wanted to achieve power, following the trail torn open by the coup.
everything changed in those hours between vargas' suicide and the resignation that had been demanded the day before by a military ultimatum.
jango, the seventh child of vicente and vicentina goulart, affluent landowners, spontaneously lived in close contact with farm workers.
his youth years in porto alegre were spent between the bliss of bohemian life and the rigors of the academy.
in the country of lawyers, jango also got a law degree and quickly climbed the steps of a life in politics.
state congressman in 1947, federal congressman in 1950, secretary of interior and justice in rio grande do sul, national chairman for ptb.
in 1954, when getúlio had to replace his waves to the people for commitments with the working classes,
jango stepped out of the shadows, joining the ministry of employment.
joão goulart, at age 36, personified vargas' wish to inject new blood into brazilian politics.
jango became minister when seamen were carrying out a strike for better pay.
he mediated the conflict and used his influence to grant their claims.
to celebrate may 1st, he prepared a fair gift to workers:
brazil and its army had been closely following the ongoing ideological battle for a long time.
and this battle was greatly strengthened when mr. joão goulart was minister of employment in the getúlio administration.
and the colonels, in light of the brazilian atmosphere, decided to warn their military chiefs, generals, and signed a manifesto.
to communicate their concern about the path that brazil was following towards the left.
the attack, wich injured journalist carlos lacerda and killed air force major rubem vaz, in the small hours of august 5th, strengthened the conspiracy against the government.
the dramatic outcome of the crisis, with the president's suicide, robbed the conspirators of the thrill of victory
on may 12nd, 1955, jango got married to maria teresa fontela, who had also been born in his hometown of são borja.
as vice-president, jango represented the always smiling jk in dealings with the working class.
securing the necessary stability to allow jk to apply his plan of goals and to increase industrialization,
ptb's political support protected the salaries and the freedom of the workers.
breaching the automatic alignment with the united states, he included the country among the frontline of non-aligned nations.
jango could not go to the soviet union and not see the burial place of lenin, the hero of the 191 7 communist revolution.
the protocol visit displeased the military which, in 1961 , tried to prevent his inauguration.
when visiting leningrad, the port where russia's feudal history began to sink,
jango went onboard the aurora cruiser, from which the first shots of the bolshevik revolution were fired.
jango would be reminded of those images when granting freedom to brazilian mariners after the 1964 revolt.
jânio quadros' victory in the 1960 presidential elections enabled udn to quench its thirst for power.
carlos lacerda, afonso arinos and magalhães pinto were the hosts of a party that turned jânio into a born-again udn member.
in the eyes of the ptb and of the leftist groups, marshal henrique teixeira lott was the ideal presidential candidate.
well-respected by the armed forces, he had conquered the admiration of civilians on november 1 1st, 1955, when, as ministry of defense, he guaranteed the inauguration of jk and jango.
prohibited horse racing during the week, adopted slack suits as uniform, prohibited cock fighting and banned bikini-clad women from tv.
the country, in dire need of a leader, had, at last, found its vice-policeman.
economic measures, such as instruction 204, which created a single tax assessed on dollar transactions, benefited exporters and foreign investors.
the end of agricultural subventions caused increased food prices and inflation.
the president had this contradiction between the expansion of the brazilian personality abroad and a limitation on the country's economic-financial status.
he had to advance policies that were not contradictory, but that had to abide by those two contingencies, those two requirements.
brazil was ready to strengthen its international identity, but the country, at that time, really depended on the countries with which it had economic-financial relations in order to maintain its internal financial stability.
the decoration of ernesto " che" guevara was too bold a gesture for the government's internal allies.
carlos lacerda, a fierce ally up to then, turned his back on jânio and started a crisis that would lead to his resignation.
in august 1961 , a handshake with mao tsê-tung turned joão goulart into a pioneer again, this time bringing brazil closer to the 3rd world.
jango broke the barriers that separated the western countries from the people's republic of china.
in beijing he repeated the " melting" ritual that had taken place in moscow.
my chinese friends, during these last few days with the chinese people and its officials,
i was able to see that this is not the old china, full of legends and superstitions, which westerners regard with a mixture of vague fright and reverential admiration for the unknown.
i felt like i was being hosted by an old friend.
let friendship grow ever closer, between the people's republic of china and the united states of brazil.
my first gesture was to offer guarantees to president jânio quadros, because we believed, at first, that he had been the victim of a coup.
finally, we were able to get in contact, via the journalist castello branco, with the cumbica airbase, in são paulo.
all other states accepted the military council rule, except for governor mauro borges.
here in rio de janeiro, governor lacerda gave repression a free rein.
and i sought to contact all generals and military chiefs that i could, directly or indirectly.
it was, in fact, at that time that i had a very harsh conversation with general costa e silva, the commander of the 4th army in recife.
i'll tell you, in summary, that it was a very spontaneous movement, a very natural movement, that got stronger;
we attempted to use all available means, especially the media, which was our salvation.
we were able to bring information not only to the public opinion of the state and country,
i mean, we essentially won that fight via a public-opinion battle, but also we managed to inform the military themselves, to a point when the military council that took over the government sent an order to a military unit to go against the south
and it was the officers themselves who met and refused to follow the order.
when i was its president, the national union of students (une) called a national strike and students were widely mobilized.
the union's board decided to relocate its headquarters to rio grande do sul, where, together with the people of rio grande do sul and of brazil, they could take part in the campaign for legality.
i had the opportunity to talk to brazilian university students throught the chain of legality and to take part in the entire mobilization process of the population to oppose the military coup against president joão goulart.
the people in the streets, the resistance in the south, the split in the armed forces, gave back to the national congress the control over the political process.
this time politicians were not discussing jango's unseating, but rather his inauguration.
upon arriving in brasília, politicians and military officers celebrated the peaceful solution to the crisis.
even those who had sided with a military veto welcomed the new president.
general golbery, frustrated with jânio's resignation, left the army to set up lpes.
general ernesto geisel, the military commander of planalto, aborted the " mosquito operation" , that had been devised by the fab officers, to bring down the plane that was flying jango back to brasília.
we shall promote internal peace, peace with dignity, peace leading to the safety of our institutions, ensuring our democratic rights, the permanent observance of the will of the people and the inviolability of the national sovereignty.
congressman ranieri mazzilli of psb returned the presidential ribbon to joão goulart.
however, the president would still be under the rule of psb during the new regime.
the first parliamentary cabinet was moderate and followed the style of prime minister tancredo neves.
cancelled the agreement with hanna mining corporation, a multinational mining company, and signed the rural act.
when mr. joão goulart became president of the republic, we worked the fields organizing peasant leagues, peasant associations and other associations, to fight for agricultural reform, rallying for the most important claims of poor countrymen in brazil.
during his administration we had more freedom because we strengthened our organizations, especially our unions.
the first national agricultural workers' meeting was held, which included all classes of poor countrymen, in belo horizonte.
what we wanted was the participation of rural workers in the great mobilization process that was going on in brazil beginning in 1960.
in may 1962 the government announced the intention to amend article 1 41 of the constitution that determined the payment of previous cash indemnification for expropriation.
the escalating terrorist violence would leave its mark on the soviet expo, that exhibited in brazil the new trends of the socialist world and the new technology of eastern europe.
the inquiry that looked into the attack revealed that part of those actions had been planned in the backrooms of the government of guanabara.
the list of those involved, included the chief of the state police.
the national union of students was a target of the terrorist actions of extreme-right groups.
the anti-communist movement gave rise to an action against the national union of students with machine guns being shot at the headquarters of une.
in fact, what was going on was that in brazil, a fascist group was getting organized, forming paramilitary organizations, the right-wing was getting organized, its activities funded by foreign organizations;
and the brazilian upper class, from the heights of its reactionary nature, the large foreign groups, large multinational companies, the great landowners, the large bourgeoisie of brazil, could not accept even the basic reforms that president jango goulart wanted to implement in brazil.
the most audacious part of the brazilian government was its foreign policy.
itamaraty established a non-aligned diplomacy, unfastening the knots that bound the interests of the country to the decisions that came from washington.
the government resumed relations with the soviet union, voted against the colonialist policy in africa, and supported cuba's right to self-determination.
the foreign policy got stuck in the frontiers of economic dependency.
pressure from the u.s. caused minister santiago dantas to go to washington, where, in a cold weather, he was to negotiate the limits of the brazilian foreign debt.
i believe that those days spent with american and international authorities in washington are part of the situation i had the opportunity to announce to the brazilian people before leaving brazil and that the results of this visit will meet the expectations of the brazilian people.
those are: that brazil has no intention of increasing its debt immoderately instead, we seek to establish conditions that will allow the country to face its commitments according to its paying capabilities.
joão goulart's trip to the u.s. in april 1962 suspended temporarily the increase in the gap between both countries.
a priority in jango's agenda was to renegotiate the foreign debt.
for kennedy, the important thing was to redefine the political rules in brazil.
nationalization of u.s. companies and the program of reforms sounded like communism.
one week before, governor leonei brizola expropriated in rio grande do sul the assets of companhia telefônica nacional, the brazilian arm of itt.
the u.s. welcomed jango with open arms, fearing that brazil could move away from the western block.
in un, jango explained, in person to the international press the meaning of the nationalizations.
the need we felt to talk about the expropriation of companies, as part of the discussions, was caused exactly by the difficulties that they were creating, at the time, in my country.
we can encourage foreign-capital investments if we pay fair remuneration on their capital.
when i say " fair" , i wish to express the country's ideal of justice.
the pale glamour of john gavin and the rehearsed faith of father patrick peyton,
hollywood vicar, a favorite of 9 out of 10 movie stars.
the whitehouse was the headquarters of the government, where carlos lacerda and ademar de barros felt at home.
i looked into the problem of slums and the president was clearly impressed with the data i showed him.
rio de janeiro, for example, has an annual deficit of 10 thousand homes, and this deficit has been accruing over the last 10 years.
which means that we have a deficit, in rio de janeiro alone, of 100 thousand homes.
the problem of the port of santos, the problem of the são sebastião port.
the problem of the water supply to the city of são paulo;
we have water for 2.5 million inhabitants and we need water for 4.5 million inhabitants.
we have huge problems, new highways, electricity for railroads, new hydroelectric plants, many problems relating to the economy of são paulo and of the country.
the cabinet headed by tancredo neves came to an end when the prime minister resigned to run in the elections.
the new cabinet, headed by brochado da rocha survived two months of successive crisis.
brazilian institute for democratic action - ibad -, the advanced arm of lpes, injected over 2 million dollars in the campaign funding the campaign of 250 candidates to the federal congress and several governors.
will the democratic institutions prevail over the battle of relentless ambitions?
what are we doing to prevent that the brazilian people be faced with the tragic choice between anti-democratic solutions?
we, the intellectuals, we, the company owners, we, the men who have the responsibility to rule, we, who believe in democracy and in free initiative, we cannot remain silent while the situation deteriorates day by day.
and it is exactly to coordinate the thoughts and actions of all those that do not wish to remain silent
in light of the catastrophe that threatens us, that we have created a new organism, with a new message for the new reality of brazil.
conflicts that were certainly based on actual economic interests but that were being presented as ideological battles.
when asked to decide the fate of parliamentarism, the people returned to jango the powers that had been stripped from him.
democratization in the use of land, illiterate vote, rules to govern rents, fair basis for minimum wage.
those were the highlights of a government program that could achieve greater social harmony.
jango intended to end hunger and misery, in a country where justice had always been the dark side of democracy.
the situation in the northeast received special attention from the government.
the agricultural workers, mobilized by the social transformation process, received a wakeup call about the longstanding poverty in the fields.
the perspective of small changes in a country with great inequalities brought about many illusions.
the improvisation of the 20s had been replaced by the ideology of the late 40s.
the superior war college, created in 1950 to mirror the north-american war college, assembled its own political model, based on the concept of safety and development.
challenging the disciplinary rule, sergeants elected two representatives in the october '62 elections.
revoiting against the legal decision that prevented the investiture of the elected representatives, the sergeants followed a military tradition and rebelled.
telegrams confirmed that the minister of war of the jango administration, general amaury kruel, was, himself, part of the military group plotting the coup d'etat.
together at the palace, they once again swore loyalty to the president and allegiance to the constitution.
the intention of the military chiefs was exactly to have jango reach the end of his term of office, since we only intended to start an armed fight as a last resort.
we did prepare to be able to face any government action.
but, by late '63, we received notice that the government had been preparing a coup,
and those news were confirmed by an individual we held in high esteem and trust, so we contemplated the possibility of taking action before the government.
the armed forces tend to adopt interventionist actions, because usually in brazil social conflicts are settled via the intervention of the armed forces.
so the political entities behind those conflicts are the ones that invite the intervention of the armed forces.
the manner in which such intervention can be prevented is to have the armed forces turn into a neutral entity, which is only possible with the political and ideological division of the armed forces.
the economic crisis, with an inflation threatening to go beyond the 100% mark would be one of the obstacles affecting social development.
the three-year plan of celso furtado and santiago dantas suggested, first, the sanitizing of the economy.
this is a very important point, since it touches the very nature of the joão goulart administration.
joão goulart had not been elected president of the republic, he had actually been part of a psd-ptb coalition.
and the head of the coalition was psd, the majority party.
i'd say: if we recover the reigns of the situation, we'll make the economy grow so we'll be able to introduce reforms, that are the essence of the government's policies.
that is why the three-year plan ended with a list of the structural reforms that were necessary.
but they resulted from an increased control over the economy and, therefore, a consensus was necessary to ensure a solid standing for the government.
what happened was that the different groups that supported the government could not reach a consensus.
attacked by unions and business owners, the three-year plan never left the drawer.
as a remedy for the economic crisis, it had an effect that was unacceptable to the government:
cgt exchanged the work at production lines, where it worked side-by-side with the workers, for activities developed side-by-side with politicians.
strike was a word of order, heard only by employees of state-owned companies sometimes with the cautious support of industrial and trade workers.
among his allies, his goals were often mistaken for an intention to end capitalism.
other times, his allies thought he had no intention of ending capitalism,
it was up tp jango to convince the high catholic hierarchy that the social reforms that he intended to carry out in brazil would establish the principles of justice that were defended by christianity.
the factions that supported brizola, organized all over the country in groups of 1 1 , described brizola's battle for power with the following slogan:
travestied as a defender of the constitution, the right wing got stronger.
the noisy campaign convinced the middle class, the military, the church and business owners that the government wanted to change the constitution to put an end to democracy.
jango tried to use a state of emergency to overcome, in a political manner, the military reaction against the governor and reestablish the authority of his administration.
the left wing suspected that the action could adversely affect it.
we had been informed that, in são paulo, ademar de barros, and in the state of rio de janeiro, carlos lacerda, were actively getting ready to carry out a revolution or coup d'etat.
the state of emergency was called in rio de janeiro during a meeting between jango, his ministry and the military ministers.
the news that got to brasília about the state of emergency were really daunting for us.
we did not know at that time if the correlation of powers allowed the installation of a state of emergency in this country that would not be later changed by the majority forces, by the reactionary part of psd, in alliance with udn,
we came to the conclusion that we'd oppose the state of emergency.
to this day i'm not sure if that was the right decision.
he tried to mobilize the citizens by personally raising the flag of reform.
in january 1964, the president revived and regulated the law on remittance of profits, which had been approved by the congress over one year before.
by march, a lunch party held at the military base and the warm welcome extended by a number of officers were not enough to erase the restlessness and doubts from the worn-out expression of the president.
the adhesion of low-ranking and military officers to the nationalist governmental project expressed the efforts of most of the sectors of the brazilian society towards the construction of a fair democracy.
the menace represented by the reforms that threatened the brazilian powerful, came to life in march.
in its strategy of popular mobilization, the government called a mass meeting in rio de janeiro.
march '64 was a month of intense activity and many concerns.
subversive activities promoted by the government were on the rise and we had decided to face whatever the government could dish out.
when the meeting on the 13th was held, we considered that meeting to be an intimidation, a strike against the army.
carried out next door to the army headquarters, with posters that were clearly subversive against the democratic order
because we were aware that the rebellion in the military ranks would increase against a government that wanted to disestablish the democracy in brazil.
therefore, together with other officers, including general aragão, who had also been informed of the plan, we took action and, on the morning of the 13th, after arriving at the headquarters,
so the meeting on the 13th meant that we got the support of many individuals... upstanding, loyal individuals, that up to then, had still been attached to the idea of absolute legality.
the meeting of the central was a kind of... attempt to speed up the project of reforms.
a few hours before, he had signed the decrees that expropriated unproductive lands alongside federal highways and railroads and took over private refineries.
agricultural workers will find that their most important and fairest claim will have been met in many places.
then, that worker and his family, his dejected family, will be able to be their own bosses, because up to now they've been working for the owner of the land they rent, or for the owner of the land they loan.
today, in the eyes of the nation, with the solidarity of the people united in this square, a square that belongs only to the people, the government, that also belongs to the people, and to the people alone,
for full electorial reform, for illiterate vote, for the eligibility of all brazilians.
for the purity of democratic life, for economic emancipation, for social justice and, together with its people, for the progress of brazil.
in são paulo, the ruling class was also mobilized against the reforms.
with the support of the state government, the rural society and sections of the church, the " family march, with god and for freedom" was organized.
veterans of '32 and members of traditional families of são paulo held a rosary in one hand and banners on the other, with a few of their slogans:
" civism shall kill communism." " in defense of the constitution and of legality."
jango and his family went to são borja to spent the holy week holidays, in march 1964.
earlier pictures in the family album reveal the relaxed lifestyle of of a farmer president.
his life with maria teresa, the barbecues, the chimarrão, the horse riding along the fields, all of which was tinted by an anxious mood this time around.
in fact, that would be the last time jango and his family spent time together at the ranch where he'd briefly stay in april, lonely and on his way to the exile in uruguay.
by late march, after watching the movie about the battleship potemkin, the brazilian navy was seduced by a dream.
gathering in the steel workers' union, during the celebration of the 2nd anniversary of their association, which had been kept a secret from the navy, hundreds of mariners claimed their rights:
freedom for mates held in confinement, better meals and the right to get married.
in attendance, as a role model and witness, was an elderly joão cândido, a hero who had survived the rebellion that brought an end to physical punishment back in 1910.
rumors of a military rebellion had already been around when the president attended, on march 30th, at the headquarters of the automobile club, a ceremony in his honor, sponsored by the association of sergeants and sub-officers of the military police.
the president energetically prohibited any subversion in the name of order.
the middle class exorcized its ghosts by setting the building of the national union of students on fire
in the afternoon of april 1st, in the south zone of rio de janeiro, victory was already being celebrated.
presiding over the tumultuous session of april 1st, senator aldo de moura andrade, in an act of solemn disregard for the destiny of the legal institutions, declared the office of president of the republic to be vacant while the head of state, joão goulart, was still on brazilian soil.
the president of the republic has left the headquarters of the government.
former governor leonei brizola used the radio as his best weapon.
people on the streets promised to repeat the resistance of '61 .
when president joão goulart arrived in porto alegre, in the middle of the full-blown crisis, a meeting was held at the residence of the commander of the 3rd army, who was general ladàrio teles, a great man and military chief.
president joão goulart was in attendance together with eight generals and myself.
and that he considered the situation to be complex, difficult, with a number of followers within the 3rd army, but he thought it was possible to defend legality.
the final decision of the meeting was to be made by the president.
who decided that no resistance would be offered because he considered it to be too high a price to be paid in blood by the brazilian people to restore its rights.
in fact, i got myself ready for a potential reaction of the state of minas gerais, one year and a half before march '64.
when i appointed colonel josê geraldo to command the military police, i gave him the task of preparing the police for a reaction.
because i was sure, that with the difficulties i had with the government,
and in this case he thought he should use palàcio da liberdade to develop a government that had a national characteristic as well
so he called milton campos, josê maria de alckmin and myself.
my office, which was that of nonspecific minister - the three of us, milton campos, josê maria de alckmin and i, were appointed nonspecific secretaries.
and my duty as nonspecific secretary was to attain potential international support to have recognition of our belligerent status, if the actual conditions of the movement we were expecting came to that.
the only one who got it right was golbery, who said: " it will fall apart like a castle of cards."
despite the surprise, despite the weakening that the government had been experiencing, if president joão goulart had decided to resist,
the story that the u.s. had sent ships to brazil was old news.
it had even been mentioned in an american talk show called "firing line" , with william buckley.
he was interviewing at that time, in the early 70s, governor - former governor at that time, carlos lacerda -, when someone from the audience stood up and said: " look, that is not true,
i was in the caribbean at the time, embarked, doing military work, and the ship i was in was rerouted to the brazilian coast at the time of the revolution.
i mean, in fact, it included the four tankers, the four tankers were full to ensure the supply of fuel for the revolution if the movement had to last, if it faced too much resistance and had to last for over one month.
there were 136 thousand barrels of regular gas, aviation kerosene, all that.
those ships, from different points in the atlantic, converged at the brazilian coast.
a few hours before sunrise on april 2nd, the entire operation was demobilized when news came that the military had already taken over.
in rio, the police of carlos lacerda arrested a chinese trade mission, under charges of terrorism.
it was up to sobral pinto, the old advocate of political prisoners to prove the innocence of the diplomats.
this civic furor would soon be used to support the campaign
" donate gold for the good of brazil" , an attempt at solving the economic problems of the country with acts of patriotic charity.
certain civil forces supporting a military movement that was initiated in minas gerais and that actually, in its exterior appearance, was actually what we know about latin-american history.
now, during the course of that coup, another one took place.
so much so that, after my arrival in rio de janeiro,
carlos lacerda and juscelino came to me, saying it was time i took over and i told them
what i wanted was to have brazil find its true way of order, of tranquility.
in rio de janeiro there was a group that got ready.
i hereby declare the honorable humberto de alencar castelo branco vested in office of president of the republic of the united states of brazil
i shall defend and fulfill, with honor and loyalty the constitution of brazil.
we shall plunge ahead knowing that the remedy against the ill effects of the extreme left shall not be the birth of a reactionary right.
my deeds shall be those of an uncompromised head of state during the process of election of the brazilian to whom i shall convey this office on january 31 , 1966.
the concepts developed in the superior war college replaced social justice for development and democracy for security.
castelo branco's cabinet had politicians from udn and technocrats, now at the service of the new order.
the law on remittance of profits was revoked, and the trust of the united states in the brazilian democracy was reestablished.
annulling the decree on expropriation of unproductive lands, the new president put the minds of large land owners at ease.
with the new economic guidelines, the international monetary fund came to the assistance of its ally.
a rigorous control on salaries would fund development and the fight against inflation.
after sending to prison or to exile the main leaders of the left and of the union movement, the military put an end to the ambitions of their civil allies.
ademar de barros, governor of são paulo, was an ally of castelo branco but ended up being discharged and unseated, charged with bribery.
castelo branco enacted institutional act no. 2, banning political parties and turning the elections for governor into indirect ones.
a cordial jk, after being unseated, followed the same lpm ritual, walking the same path that many other brazilians would follow.
the anguish of those days caused his children's birthdays to go almost uncelebrated.
the desire to see brazil become a democracy again led jango, in exile, to unite with carlos lacerda and jk to structure the ample front, a movement that was banned soon thereafter.
the successor of marshal castelo branco was general costa e silva.
against the will of castelo, the minister of war was made candidate.
the new president was sworn in under a new constitution, enacted in 1967 with deep restrictions on the liberal principles of the previously untouched constitution of 1946.
marginalization of the people and failed political solutions led the way to opposition marches.
protests promoted by students, intellectuals and professionals, under violent repression, led the way to radicalization.
the defeat of populism caused disenchantment with traditional political formulas and launched a new motto:
i'll go as a woman, as an actress, as a mother, as a citizen.
i'll go because i want the pubic opinion to known that we have a lot of courage to unmask the myth that the students are doing something wrong, that they are troublemakers.
they are our hope and we have our arms open for them, to accept their claims.
i'm very proud that my kids are taking part in it.
in december 1968, again on a friday 13th, the government closed the congress and enacted institutional act no. 5.
the toughening up of the regime and the repression of civil organizations neutralized the opposition.
censorship on newspapers, radio and tv concealed any sign of protest.
the church, which had supported the forces that removed jango from power, reappeared in the late 60s as the only organized institution to defend justice and human rights.
the murder of father henrique, a direct assistant to d. hêlder câmara, marked with blood the new standing of the church.
the repression, the ban on people's movements, the obstruction of union movements, caused the church to be the last remaining place where people's movements can get organized.
after the initial success, marked by kidnappings and bank robberies, the urban guerrilla, isolated from the people, began to crumble.
former congressman carlos marighella, who used to head the communist party, the founder of the national action for liberty, aln, died in são paulo in an ambush put together by police forces.
in 1973, the cia and itt financed the overthrowing and assassination of allende.
in 1975 no democracy was left standing in the southern cone.
in washington, a bomb brought to an end the life of orlando letelier, a former minister of the allende administration.
in buenos aires, senator michelini of uruguay was kidnapped and killed.
general juan josê torres, the president of bolivia, and general carlos prates, former commander-in-chief of the chilean army, were killed in bombings.
president joão goulart knew that his name was on that list of doomed presidents.
his greatest dream, his greatest wish was to go back to brazil.
i believe deep down he couldn't stand that instability any longer,
to go from country to country in latin america, and later even thinking about moving to europe...
because his wish, his hope was to be able to go back to brazil.
in the split second that separates life from death, the images of his youth in são borja were relived, his inauguration in brasília, the images of march 13th in the central station, of vargas' funeral.
the kind gestures from the people and his role in the fight for a better society, which caused him to be the only brazilian president to die in exile.
the years went b y, maturity came, and a daily dose of injustice and hatred,
oppression, lies and fear, have made me now, as an adult,
you know, mr turton, when we get settled in, we look forward to meeting some of the indians you come across socially as friends.
well, as a matter of fact, we don't come across them socially.
- my wife's on stage, and ronny's still holding the fort for major callendar.
his wretched indian assistant didn't turn up in time, but i got my own back.
i don't understand people inviting guests and not treating them properly.
you and mr turton are the only people who've made any attempt to be friendly.
the whole of this entertainment is an exercise in power, and the subtle pleasures of personal superiority.
god has put us on earth to love and help our fellow men.
now, mrs moore, would you like to have our tea served inside or out?
dr aziz, i wonder if you could explain a disappointment we had this morning.
if you don't mind, let's leave it a day or two.
i don't want to upset her any more than i have.
but they went off with the guide an hour ago - more, in fact - and somehow...
i don't know this place, but i'm sure they'll be back soon.
it'll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals.
our respectable young doctor was fixing up to see tarts in calcutta.
she hooted, thinking work was going on above, and then she saw her.
she had got among some cactuses and was beginning to panic.
aziz is innocent, and everything we do must be based on that.
mr fielding, are you on our side against your own people?
i'm returning to the place of my childhood to take charge of education there.
i want to start a school that will be as much like this as possible.
i was about to add that there's a certain member here present who's known to be in contact with the prisoner's defence.
i'd like to say one can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.
nothing i can say or do will make the least difference.
if that is really how you feel, mother, then you must go.
on april 3rd of this year, miss quested and her friend, mrs moore, were invited to a tea party at the house of the principal of government college.
it was here that the prisoner first met miss quested, a young girl fresh from england.
i will merely allude you to the fact that the prisoner is a widower, now living alone.
and in the course of our evidence, i'll be providing proof of his state of mind.
i shall begin by reminding you of my contention that prisoner proposed the expedition with a premeditated intention of making advances to miss quested.
i've made it my business to visit the marabar during the last few days.
it's an inaccessible, barren place, entailing, as you have heard, considerable planning and expense to get there.
the caves themselves are dark, featureless, and without interest, except for a strange echo.
we therefore commit her body to the deep to be turned into corruption.
looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead.
she said she was upset by the echo and that she was tired.
taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner instructed the servants to remain behind, and took you off alone with the guide.
but when you reached the caves, prisoner left you and went to speak to the guide?
- i don't know if he spoke to him or not.
you're going to ask me to let her off paying 20,000 rupees, right?
then, if i agree, the english will be able to say
i have made a new life for myself up here... away from the english.
i shall be going to the guest house to greet them.
can you not let bygones be bygones and show them around?
i'm sorry, but i've had enough of showing miss quested india.
"dear miss quested, tonight is the festival of light, and i am writing this to ask you to forgive me."
"it has taken all this time for me to appreciate your courage."
"because of you, i am happy here with my children instead of in prison."
"and because of you, i want to do kind actions all round."
you know, mr turton, when we get settled in, we look forward to meeting some of the indians you come across socially as friends.
well, as a matter of fact, we don't come across them socially.
now, mrs moore, would you like to have our tea served inside or out?
dr aziz, i wonder if you could explain a disappointment we had this morning.
i think we should tell your mother, talk about what we're going to do.
if you don't mind, let's leave it a day or two.
it's partly to do with this country and the odd surroundings.
do you mean that my bothers are to do with india?
now we must go back and you must dance with ronny.
apart from anything else, it will serve as a notice of intent.
but they went off with the guide an hour ago - more, in fact - and somehow...
i don't know this place, but i'm sure they'll be back soon.
- i think it was then - i heard the car.
so i ran over to the edge and i saw miss quested getting in.
her scramble down that ravine was so precipitate it started a small avalanche of stones which stopped mrs callendar's car.
she hooted, thinking work was going on above, and then she saw her.
when i saw my friend's private papers carried in just now, in the arms of that police inspector,
i said to myself "amritrao is the man to clear this up."
i was about to add that there's a certain member here present who's known to be in contact with the prisoner's defence.

the lady in question suffered from what is known in medical parlance as "claustrophobia".
prisoner achieved his objective by entering a cave with miss quested, leaving this elderly lady in the rear, where she was crushed and crowded by servants and villagers.
we therefore commit her body to the deep to be turned into corruption.
looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead.
she said she was upset by the echo and that she was tired.
taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner instructed the servants to remain behind, and took you off alone with the guide.
i couldn't possibly get away before the end of next term.
miss quested is going as soon as she can get a passage.
i have made a new life for myself up here... away from the english.
i shall be going to the guest house to greet them.
can you not let bygones be bygones and show them around?
i'm sorry, but i've had enough of showing miss quested india.

they're full of all the virtues, no doubt, but we don't.
if you don't mind, let's leave it a day or two.
i don't want to upset her any more than i have.

i want to start a school that will be as much like this as possible.
- the point on which i desire advice is, what name should be given to the school?
i only meant that when you're less worried you might think the matter over.
i had thought, with your permission, of the richard fielding high school.
ladies, don't go out any more than you can help, and don't talk before your servants.
remember, one isolated indian has attempted... has been charged with an attempted crime.
nothing i can say or do will make the least difference.
if that is really how you feel, mother, then you must go.
it was here that the prisoner first met miss quested, a young girl fresh from england.
until then, the prisoner had never been in such close proximity to an english girl.
i've made it my business to visit the marabar during the last few days.
it's an inaccessible, barren place, entailing, as you have heard, considerable planning and expense to get there.
the servants were all supplied by prisoner's indian friends, with one exception of the witness, antony.
antony had received explicit instructions from mr heaslop to stay with the ladies.
i must repeat that, as a witness, mrs moore does not exist.
neither you, mr amritrao, nor mr mcbryde, you, have any right to surmise what that lady would have said.
miss quested, you heard this morning the slur cast on british justice by the defence.
it is most important that you tell the court the absolute truth of what took place.
but when you reached the caves, prisoner left you and went to speak to the guide?
- i don't know if he spoke to him or not.
she had the entire british raj behind her pushing her on.
but when she saw she was wrong, she stopped and sent it all to smithereens.
you're going to ask me to let her off paying 20,000 rupees, right?
then, if i agree, the english will be able to say
i shall be going to the guest house to greet them.
but my religious duties will be claiming my full attention for the next three days.
the minister of education never tells anyone anything unless he has to.
his only piece of information was that the high school was destined not to be.
"and stella believes the evil of the marabar has been wiped out, and so do i."
"dear miss quested, tonight is the festival of light, and i am writing this to ask you to forgive me."
"it has taken all this time for me to appreciate your courage."
"because of you, i am happy here with my children instead of in prison."
we just wanted to welcome you to the fold and to say--
we must have a drink or something later when you´ve recovered.
mr. turton, when we get settled in we look forward to meeting the indians you come across socially as friends.
as a matter of fact, we don´t come across them socially.
and is the city magistrate the entire of your family now?
no, i have a daughter in england by my second husband.
my wife´s on-stage, and ronny´s still holding the fort for major callendar.
his wretched indian assistant didn´t turn up in time, but i got mine back.
i don´t understand people inviting guests and not treating them properly.
you and mr. turton are the only people who have attempted to be friendly.
the whole of this entertainment is an exercise in power and the subtle pleasures of personal superiority.
god has put us on earth to love and help our fellow men.
it´s partly to do with this country and the odd surroundings.
do you mean that my bothers are to do with india?
now, we must go back, and you must dance with ronny.
apart from anything else, it will serve as a notice of intent.
you must not tell major callendar, but last year i went to calcutta.
there are girls-- l shall tell callendar you´ve made a recovery.
we should be thinking of moving on before the sun gets too high.
do forgive me, dr. aziz, i´m rather tired, so i think i´ll stay here.
i only meant that when you´re less worried, you might think it over.
i had thought, with your permission of the richard fielding high school.
not at all. i was saying before you arrived that you´d refused bail.
i was about to add that there´s a certain member here present who´s known to be in contact with the prisoner´s defense.
on april 3 of this year miss quested and her friend mrs. moore were invited to a party at the house of the principal of government college.
it was here that prisoner first met miss quested a young girl, fresh from england.
until this party, the prisoner had never been in proximity to an english girl.
in consideration of the ladies present i merely allude to the fact that prisoner is a widower, living alone.
in the course of our evidence, i shall provide proof of his state of mind.
now, before taking you through this crime i want to state what i believe to be a universal truth.
it´s an inaccessible, barren place, entailing, as you have heard considerable planning and expense to get there.
the caves themselves are dark, featureless and without interest except for a strange echo.
the lady in question suffered from what is known in medical parlance as claustrophobia.
prisoner achieved his objective by entering the cave with quested leaving this elderly lady in the rear where she was crushed by servants and villagers.
we therefore commit her body to the deep to be turned into corruption.
looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead.
why did you make such a charge if you were going to withdraw it?
-l ought to feel grateful to you-- -l don´t expect gratitude.
it has taken all this time for me to appreciate your courage:
because of you, i am happy here with my children instead of in prison:
i don't understand people inviting guests and not treating them properly.
you and mr. turton are the only people who have been friendly.
i wanted to start a school that will be like this.
what i need advice for is what name should be given to the school?
on april 3rd of this year, miss quested and mrs. moore were invited to a tea party at the house of government college's principal.
here, the prisoner first met miss quested, a young girl fresh from england.
the servants were supplied by prisoner's indian friends, except for the witness antony.
antony received explicit instructions from mr. heaslop to stay with the ladies at all times, yet he remained behind.
she said she was upset by the echo, and that she was tired.
taking advantage of her distress, prisoner instructed the servants to remain behind and took you alone with the guide.
well, as a matter of fact, we don't come across them socially.

our respectable young doctor was fixing up to see tarts in calcutta.
she hooted, thinking work was going on above, and then she saw her.
she had got among some cactuses and was beginning to panic.
aziz is innocent, and everything we do must be based on that.
mr fielding, are you on our side against your own people?
i'm returning to the place of my childhood to take charge of education there.
i want to start a school that will be as much like this as possible.
yes. i only meant that when you're less worried you might think the matter over.
i had thought, with your permission, of the richard fielding high school.
thank you, sir. i didn't mean to interrupt the meeting in this way.
not at all. i was saying before you arrived that you'd refused bail.
i was about to add that there's a certain member here present who's known to be in contact with the prisoner's defence.
i'd like to say one can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.
it was here that the prisoner first met miss quested, a young girl fresh from england.
until then, the prisoner had never been in such close proximity to an english girl.
in consideration of the ladies present, i will merely allude you to the fact that the prisoner is a widower, now living alone.
and in the course of our evidence, i'll be providing proof of his state of mind.
i've made it my business to visit the marabar during the last few days.
it's an inaccessible, barren place, entailing, as you have heard, considerable planning and expense to get there.
the servants were all supplied by prisoner's indian friends, with one exception of the witness, antony.
antony had received explicit instructions from mr heaslop to stay with the ladies.
i must repeat that, as a witness, mrs moore does not exist.
neither you, mr amritrao, nor mr mcbryde, you, have any right to surmise what that lady would have said.
she said she was upset by the echo and that she was tired.
taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner instructed the servants to remain behind, and took you off alone with the guide.
but when you reached the caves, prisoner left you and went to speak to the guide?
- l don't know if he spoke to him or not.
she had the entire british raj behind her pushing her on.
but when she saw she was wrong, she stopped and sent it all to smithereens.
no. i couldn't possibly get away before the end of next term.
miss quested is going as soon as she can get a passage.
you're going to ask me to let her off paying 20,000 rupees, right?
then, if i agree, the english will be able to say
i shall be going to the guest house to greet them.
but my religious duties will be claiming my full attention for the next three days.
the minister of education never tells anyone anything unless he has to.
his only piece of information was that the high school was destined not to be.
"and stella believes the evil of the marabar has been wiped out, and so do i. "
"dear miss quested, tonight is the festival of light, and i am writing this to ask you to forgive me. "
"it has taken all this time for me to appreciate your courage. "
"because of you, i am happy here with my children instead of in prison. "
you know, mr turton, when we get settled in, we look forward to meeting some of the indians you come across socially as friends.
well, as a matter of fact, we don't come across them socially.
- my wife's on stage, and ronny's still holding the fort for major callendar.
his wretched indian assistant didn't turn up in time, but i got my own back.
i don't understand people inviting guests and not treating them properly.
you and mr turton are the only people who've made any attempt to be friendly.
now, mrs moore, would you like to have our tea served inside or out?
dr aziz, i wonder if you could explain a disappointment we had this morning.
i think we should tell your mother, talk about what we're going to do.
if you don't mind, let's leave it a day or two.
but they went off with the guide an hour ago - more, in fact - and somehow...
i don't know this place, but i'm sure they'll be back soon.
it'll have to be quoted in court as bearing on his morals.
our respectable young doctor was fixing up to see tarts in calcutta.
she hooted, thinking work was going on above, and then she saw her.
she had got among some cactuses and was beginning to panic.
aziz is innocent, and everything we do must be based on that.
mr fielding, are you on our side against your own people?
when i saw my friend's private papers carried in just now, in the arms of that police inspector,
i said to myself "amritrao is the man to clear this up."
i'm returning to the place of my childhood to take charge of education there.
i want to start a school that will be as much like this as possible.
i was about to add that there's a certain member here present who's known to be in contact with the prisoner's defence.
i'd like to say one can't run with the hare and hunt with the hounds.
on april 3rd of this year, miss quested and her friend, mrs moore, were invited to a tea party at the house of the principal of government college.
it was here that the prisoner first met miss quested, a young girl fresh from england.
i will merely allude you to the fact that the prisoner is a widower, now living alone.
and in the course of our evidence, i'll be providing proof of his state of mind.
i shall begin by reminding you of my contention that prisoner proposed the expedition with a premeditated intention of making advances to miss quested.
i've made it my business to visit the marabar during the last few days.
it's an inaccessible, barren place, entailing, as you have heard, considerable planning and expense to get there.
the caves themselves are dark, featureless, and without interest, except for a strange echo.
the lady in question suffered from what is known in medical parlance as "claustrophobia".
prisoner achieved his objective by entering a cave with miss quested, leaving this elderly lady in the rear, where she was crushed and crowded by servants and villagers.
we therefore commit her body to the deep to be turned into corruption.
looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea shall give up her dead.
she said she was upset by the echo and that she was tired.
taking advantage of her fatigue, prisoner instructed the servants to remain behind, and took you off alone with the guide.
i couldn't possibly get away before the end of next term.
miss quested is going as soon as she can get a passage.
i have made a new life for myself up here... away from the english.
i shall be going to the guest house to greet them.
can you not let bygones be bygones and show them around?
i'm sorry, but i've had enough of showing miss quested india.
"dear miss quested, tonight is the festival of light, and i am writing this to ask you to forgive me."
"it has taken all this time for me to appreciate your courage."
"because of you, i am happy here with my children instead of in prison."
"and because of you, i want to do kind actions all round."
you know, mr turton, when we get settled in, we look forward to meeting some of the indians you come across socially as friends.
well, as a matter of fact, we don't come across them socially.
i don't understand people inviting guests and not treating them properly.
you and mr turton are the only people who've made any attempt to be friendly.
the whole of this entertainment is an exercise in power, and the subtle pleasures of personal superiority.
god has put us on earth to love and help our fellow men.
now, mrs moore, would you like to have our tea served inside or out?
dr aziz, i wonder if you could explain a disappointment we had this morning.
i think we should tell your mother, talk about what we're going to do.

nothing i can say or do will make the least difference.
if that is really how you feel, mother, then you must go.

ladies, don't go out any more than you can help, and don't talk before your servants.
remember, one isolated indian has attempted... has been charged with an attempted crime.
nothing i can say or do will make the least difference.
if that is really how you feel, mother, then you must go.

neither you, mr amritrao, nor mr mcbryde, you, have any right to surmise what that lady would have said.
miss quested, you heard this morning the slur cast on british justice by the defence.
it is most important that you tell the court the absolute truth of what took place.
but when you reached the caves, prisoner left you and went to speak to the guide?
- i don't know if he spoke to him or not.
she had the entire british raj behind her pushing her on.

i thought i sent you two away to work this thing out.
i tried to work things out with her but she won't have none of it.
you two haven't had that much to say to each other recently.
romance has sort of been replaced by a really good night sleep?
by the power invested in me by the state of new york
i pronounce you a little better off than you were when you came in.
and my name was at the bottom of a list of a thousand candidates.
so they start calling folks, starting at the top of the list.
you know, my name was at the bottom of that list of prospective judges because i haven't had much experience really.
but every candidate does go through a thorough screening process and whatever anybody thinks of that list, i was on it.
together, santini and hawke fly airwolf, capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets and backed by unmatched firepower,
airwolf is a weapon too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands.
whoever he is, kidnapping a man from a neutral country is not my normal line of business.
it was my father's line of business until helmut kruger killed him.
he could create a war, and then supply both sides with weapons.
so, is it kruger you really want or the weapons he's storing?
well, i figured we might as well look on the bright side of things, eh?
how come i don't like what you're doin', but i'm enjoying it?
well, are you planning on smiling anytime in the near future?
because if so, i'll have any medical attention you should need
as i was telling you, this compound goes back to 1879, originally constructed by the paloma family, when they immigrated from spain.
this, at one time, was the wine cellar, but as you see, it's been converted to an ordinance supply facility.
what if i did not sell this defense system to you?
what if i sold it to your cousins on your eastern borders instead?
well, going in with airwolf's guns blazing is not the way to accomplish that.
it's not getting kruger out of here into israel alive that's troubling you, is it?
look, i know that airwolf belonged to the firm before you took it.
but whatever archangel has going with kruger is far more important than even airwolf, or he wouldn't have given kruger our scanning frequencies.
look, we could have been blown out of the sky last night.
those weapons they fired at airwolf last night wouldn't penetrate it.
you are not the only supplier of missiles in the world, archangel.
no, but i am the only one who can supply you with systems as sophisticated as thor.
the eye patch is most charming, after all, it is almost a national symbol in my country.
but the cane, the cane makes you look as if you are asking for sympathy.
he's on his way back across the straits to cuba, isn't he?
i came to take those prisoners, and i'm gonna take them back with me!
airwolf a mach l-plus attack helicopter with the most advanced weapons system in the air today.
it has been hidden somewhere in the western united states by its test pilot, stringfellow hawke.
deputy director of the agency that built airwolf, is secretly helping hawke in return for hawke's flying airwolf on missions of national concern.
stringfellow hawke is 34, a brilliant combat pilot and a recluse since his brother's disappearance.
his only friend is dominic santini, whose air service is the cover for their government work.
with hawke and santini flying as a team at speeds rivaling the fastest jets, backed by unmatched firepower,
look, i came to take those prisoners, and i'm gonna take them back with me.
i have executed men for less than what you have just done.
he filed no flight plan and reported his altitude as 100 feet.
if the authorities get to him first, the first thing they'll do to him is hand him his miranda.
a bunch of anti-castro patriots got together, raised enough money to buy a couple of old-timers from a corrupt colonel.
you know that some of them have been down there for over 20 years?
we chose mr. santini because he could recognize them, regardless of their physical condition.
if mr. santini stole the money, he has condemned my son to die in cuba.
but to deal with sanchez, a ruthless killer, drug smuggler, god knows what else.
there isn't a man that works for him that doesn't have marks.
your friend and, the rivera girl will soon be entering cuban air space.
i could let my colleague in cuba go through with his original plan, and you will never see them again.
ladies and gentlemen, the captain has put on the "no smoking" sign.
please fasten your seat belts as we prepare for our landing in los estados unidos, in norteamérica.
your friend will spend 20 years in a cuban prison and i assure you, it will be hell on earth.
he's on his way back across the straits to cuba, isn't he?

the difficult birth of our son, followed by a bout of malaria... has weakened my darling alice terribly.

his mind was able to grasp the concept of past and present.
but he desperately resisted the notion that his mother... might have been anything other than an ape.
well, the last frog we had through here couldn't pay his bills either.
we turned him over to french authorities, who were jolly pleased to have him back.
i sense that we have a long and difficult journey ahead of us.
perhaps weeks of waiting for a ship that will give us passage to england.
i will try to teach john some rudimentary manners... and a greater understanding of the language.

the only thing that seems to concern you is your film.
i'll disregard the completion guarantee if you'll fly the stunt sequence.
and, win or lose, your friend mr. santini gets the best of it.
all we need is a quarter-mile of straight road and for the truck to go a steady 60, right?
now, i'll make a flying approach lined up on the road.
then every law enforcement agency in the world ought to be after him.
why don't you just grab him and save us both a problem?

he risked losing his only friend to do this job for me.
i've got to let him play it out on his terms.

i thought you said when you phoned we was gonna do some business.
yo, man, you better be glad i'm a pisces and don't offend easy.
i couldn't help overhearing on the radio earlier... about a couple of colombians that got bumped this morning.
now, i may be able to do something for you on that one.
now, you just have to accept that i have my own life now.
yeah, well, i have my own life too... and a big part of that includes being a father...
lester, is there any way that you can clean up that last part?
i can pull up the low and phase out some of the background.
tracy, you and your unit will handle the tear gas grenades.
coordinates will be alerted when we give our first warning with the horn.
you start in with that bullhorn routine, and lamont's a dead man.
none of my men are risking their hides for some lowlife.
unless you've a better idea in mind, i'd like to move on now.
yeah, well, he's my lowlife, pal, and we put him into this spot, and i don't want him dead...
[ groans ] i refuse to believe that it's five in the morning.
i refuse to believe that two hours of witty conversation... and nonstop charm, have been terminated... because you decided to play dudley do-right.

well, harkin here is gonna put the fear of god... into rudi kazooti garmischt.
he asked if you want to ski with us this afternoon.
it was a long day, and i had a headache... and i must apologize for the way that i acted.
but i hope that you understand... that i'm really not such a bad guy.
that was harkin banks in a beautiful first run... in the f.l.s. world cup.
let's hear it for this newcomer... in his first international competition.
i thought i'd just stop and give you a few pointers.
yeah, you've got a couple, so why don't you... point 'em that way and crawl out of my sight?
ooh, if i could only ski, i'd take this pole and--
if you get bored with harkin, send him over later on.
ladies and gentlemen... we are now down to the last two jumps of the day.
the results of these jumps... will determine the overall f.i.s. world cup champion.

getting out this area, new life, respectable friends, a higher standard of living.
all you gotta do is look at 'em together... a picture of happiness.
well, you know how i always stop off for coffee and doughnuts on my way in.
well, just as i'm getting back in my car, this woman walks over and...
an hour from now i'll be sailing under the golden gate bridge... challenging the winds, riding the high seas.
if memory serves me right, captain bligh... and i'm sure it does... the last time you went sailing, your boat sprung a leak... and the coast guard had to tow you in, in case you don't remember.
and it wasn't my fault the bilge pump broke down anyway.
blame whomever you like, michael... but the fact remains you came back one hour later, soaking wet.
but don't worry, i don't let them in my house unless it rains.
babette, why don't you get mr. jackson a glass of champagne.
there's the money it takes for a man like you to stay free.
cj, we're going to guarantee your freedom by making you very rich.
but i don't intend to tell you what it is until i'm ready.
you can leave and try making it on your own... or you can stay and definitely make it with us.
michael, you don't believe this nonsense about a robot, do you?
devon, after seeing the way that car handled by itself, i'm afraid i do.
devon, who's this cj jackson and... what does he have to do with the heart and soul of the foundation?
michael, before wilton knight discovered you, we had another man in your position.
we all took the tragic loss very hard, but no one harder than wilton knight.
he closed the foundation, put the entire flag project on hold... and didn't reactivate it until we found you.
if it was a murder mystery, sherlock would call it a tough case.
whoever created this little monster sure knew what he was doing.
no gang affiliations, no friends, no mail in over two years.
so the only thing we know for sure about this guy is that he's a boxman.
well, i created wong's delight by working for fong... and that makes it fong's delight.
no, su-lin, the only way i'm going to be rich, is if i just do this one last job.
that's enough to put those foxes out there through medical school.
but not half enough to pay your medical bills if you start jerking us around.
what you propose to do is certainly no solution, quite the contrary.
all you'll succeed in doing will be to present them with a better target.
he and that car of his met with an unfortunate accident earlier this afternoon.
so now nothing stands in our way except 15 feet of dirt.
one thing is for sure... these fellows are playing for keeps.
two things for sure, bonnie's been gone for over two hours.
i'm sure one of my little playmates would be more than happy to oblige.
margo, i might be a lot of things but a murderer is not one of them.
you guys keep that up, i could get you a couple of weeks in las vegas.
now i'm going to ask you one question, one time... and you better come up with the right answer.
what are we supposed to do if she comes to before we finish?
she won't, but if she does i'm sure you can handle it.
just as poor peter over there wanted his name on fong's delight... the recognition that he created it.
i want the world to know that i created what's in that vault over there.
an hour from now i'll be sailing under the golden gate bridge... challenging the winds, riding the high seas.
(kitt) if memory serves me right, captain bligh... and i'm sure it does... the last time you went sailing, your boat sprung a leak... and the coast guard had to tow you in, in case you don't remember.
and it wasn't my fault the bilge pump broke down anyway.
(kitt) blame whomever you like, michael... but the fact remains you came back one hour later, soaking wet.
from your position... you're about 10 minutes away from the santa clara penitentiary.
no, wrong. i'm only two minutes away from renting a sailboat.
look, if you don't mind, i don't want that thing anywhere near me.
you know, the description of the woman who gave this to you was pretty vague.
but don't worry, i don't let them in my house unless it rains.
babette, why don't you get mr. jackson a glass of champagne.
there's the money it takes for a man like you to stay free.
cj, we're going to guarantee your freedom by making you very rich.

devon, who's this cj jackson and... what does he have to do with the heart and soul of the foundation?
michael, before wilton knight discovered you, we had another man in your position.
if that's not enough, i'm wired in just as you are.
i will feel everything that you feel, and believe me... i'm not a masochist.
no gang affiliations, no friends, no mail in over two years.
so the only thing we know for sure about this guy is that he's a boxman.
well, i created wong's delight by working for fong... and that makes it fong's delight.
no, su-lin, the only way i'm going to be rich, is if i just do this one last job.
i feel like an indian circling the fort and being shot at.
what you propose to do is certainly no solution, quite the contrary.
if you haven't got the guts for it... i'm sure one of my little playmates would be more than happy to oblige.
margo, i might be a lot of things but a murderer is not one of them.
for those of you joining us late... the pictures on your screen are coming to us live via satellite... where it is already night on this, the first anniversary of liberation day.
the day the visitors were driven from earth, never to return.
you make it sound as if the restaurant business is my whole life.
i'm also a technical advisor on the new film, lizard kill.
bet you, in a couple of weeks, they make you a cameraman yourself.
does that mean you're reconsidering your position at the anchor desk?
now let's go to keith chavez... and a report on the upcoming trial of diana.
not since the nuremberg trials of world war ii... has there been this kind of international...
when she raises her arm, you can see the bullet hit just below her heart.
you can see the panic caused by the attempt on diana 's life.
we're still waiting to hear as to the seriousness of the wound.
if that injury had been sustained by a human... a bullet so close to the heart... the victim would be near death...
as far as the rest of the world is concerned, you're already dead.
i could kill you right now, and no one would ever know the difference.
one of my companies controls the red dust and the antidote.
that is how the visitors like martin and willie can exist outside.
i am at the club creole... where elias taylor, one of the resistance heroes... is hosting this liberation day celebration... in his new and already successful cabaret.
you make it sound as if the restaurant business is my whole life.
i would like to say to any of my old buddies out there:
if you ever need a helping hand, you know where to come.
you can see the panic caused by the attempt on diana 's life.
we're still waiting to hear as to the seriousness of the wound.
wouldn't you think i could get a fresh drink after all the years i spent in this game?

i got it in the back of my mind, that girl's bad luck.
it's nice to know you worry so much about a guy like me.
listen, i'm just bringing it up because i know memo's crazy about you.
roy hobbs, new york knights' star, is laid up at tower maternity hospital in new york city.
the full nature and extent of his illness is as yet undisclosed.
but i make it a little more fun to watch, you see.
and after today, whether you're a goat or a hero you're gonna make me a great story.
and so at the end of one inning, no score at all.
the big question is whether or not hobbs can get his timing back.
after a four-day layoff, it's difficult for a hitter to step into the game.
hobbs came directly to the field with no batting practice this afternoon.
he shattered the glass to the press box right next to us!
absolutely broke the glass right next to our radio booth here!
if he stumbled on the mongoose's name and we have someone to put a face on it we could nail this guy right here in london.
well, the person that can make that identification is on the way into london in about an hour, on flight 171.
i don't wanna see any old friends in clothes that i've been in for 12 hours.
amanda, this business with barnhill is not gonna be some class reunion.
just killed three men and helped himself to 5 million dollars' worth of stolen diamonds.
he intends to start a syndicate of international hitmen headed by himself.
now, to date, 42 murders throughout the world that have been attributed to him.
so that's the reason the agency brought me over here to identify him because you don't have a picture?
i mean, i remember what a nice person you were, and smart too and....
i remember the time you won the science fair with your solar-powered ant farm.
lee, it's very important because that watch ran slow and connie was always late for everything.
i have known this man to plan a kill when he had less than 10 seconds for the hit.
it makes me feel just awful when i have to scold a boy.
so i think i should probably be the good guy and if you don't mind, you should be the bad guy.
for the first time in my life, i was really important.
then i found out that these little errands involved illegal transactions.
because mr. stetson and i will get you out of this mess.
i know what he looks like, but i don't know his name.
since we have you, he needs someone else to be his drop man for the diamonds.
it'd amuse him a great deal to use one of our own people.
a chat about what will the neighbours say could become a dissertation, a pompous word, on peer pressure, which is both glib, and pompous.
to help me stop this, a little box in the bottom left of your screen will show the number of times the phrase peer pressure is used.
i hope you'll all sit back and really enjoy this stunning chat.
incidentally, towards the end, there will be quite a lot of filthy talk.
stories about sex, smutty revelations about big names, and what they get up to between the sheets.
yes, the low down on the high life of the high fliers, rock, superstars, film, mega, and giga stars.
now, as the son of a country copper, a parish pc, an urban district dickhead,
i was made aware of this phrase at a very early age.
if any of my family were the subject of gossip that would put the mockers on dad's promotional prospects.
perhaps it was being so aware of this that made me ignore it totally.
i looked at my neighbours, and didn't care what they thought, if they did.
scandalising and mocking nice decent ordinary folk became the mission of a lifetime.
why in grantham should anyone commit themself to a path of such mindstunting mediocrity?
it's not as if the one thing the world really needs is more children.
think of that you in the rush hour, or while you're on a crowded beach in ibiza.
now i know my voice gets louder and rises in pitch as i warm to my theme, but i'll try and change that.
with those who want to work in interesting jobs working, and those who don't, just reading books and playing snooker.
recreating, but not reproducing ourselves, while robots, quite rightly, do all the messy, boring, and dangerous jobs we would have such fun creating them to do, like mucking out the anaconda.
and think how, in the name of god, if there is such an entity, can people adopt an attitude of high morality when advising you to get married and have a family.
they are of course using an outdated morality, one of an age of primitive tribalism.
tribespersons, through ignorance, were malnourished, ate lumps of dirt, swapped plagues with each other, and were generally infected and infested, living short lives in verminous clutches.
in those days, if they were going to survive at all, they had to reproduce like rabbits to make up the deficit.
i am talking about what will the neighbours say, a little chat about peer pressure.
the way the weak and feeble amongst us allow others to determine the course of our lives.
also it's thought boys are more likely to become sport stars, pop singers, union leaders, airline pilots, harley street proctologists etcetera.
but then aren't they also more likely to become second hand car salesmen, football hooligans, and or psychopathic mass murderers?
was its name put down for private school, and if so, how long before birth?
or is it so special that it should have no special privileges and be sent to one of the best local educational authority schools that the parents could just happen to live near?
fortunately, the neighbours have at long last admitted that they boobed over bottle feeding and now sensibly recommend the breast.
look, we've run out of letters for the right hand corner already, and it's a bit confusing with that peer pressure thing going on in the other corner,
all useful signs for the paediatrician looking for abnormalities, but even better for gossip.
neighbours love to count their blessings as they label others as weirdos.
similarly, little boys, kitted out in blue, are given tiny motor cars, cricket bats, toy handgrenades, and excer sets.
and most importantly, even three and four year old lads are given frequent coy propaganda about girlfriends and plentiful reminders along the lines of, when you're all grown up and have children of your own, you'll understand.
is homosexuality the common cause of parental death, as parents imagine, or is it really fear of what the neighbours will say?
if someone has the sense to do what they want, and go to bed with someone of their own sex and not force replicas of themselves on the rest of this overcrowded world, good luck to them!
they should be given medals, not demoted or importuned and locked up.
in this dreadful world of enforced sexual conformity, little girls are tutored to pure aspartame sweetness, and to raise their voices an octave, sounding more innocent and plaintive when asking for something, in a shop for instance.
little boys on the other hands are indulged to be conservatively naughty, cheecky, and non-effeminately grimy.
what they actually need for their education, is one day a month compulsory clad in a pink skirt.
would boy george be as he is, if he had been made to wear a pink skirt once a month from the age of six?
you may have noticed just now a gentleman walk behind me, carrying a cardboard penguin.
they betray their ignorance and prejudice by their intolerance of other moralities, and their insistance that theirs is the only way.
i remember an ad, for volkswagen cars, which said that twenty five million people could not be wrong.
you don't have to be a christian, a muslim, a buddhist, a communist, a logical positivist or a vegan to use your brain.
in fact, to be committed to such a club is to sentence millions of brain cells to shameful inactivity.
well, that's the end of a very long but well intentioned and important bit of chat.
now, obviously, some of you may have allowed your minds to wander.
during early childhood when selfishness predominates, fear of being the odd one out, ridiculed, jeered at, or thumped, creates a dangerous need to belong to the gang, the club, the social set.
those excluded are punished by exclusion itself, not being talked to, or by not being played with, through various types of psychological torment to actual physical abuse.
gradually, we unlearn these unwise ways, and turn next to competition.
we must compete against each other, academically, and in sport, if we're not to be regarded as weird.
the ignorants, the ignorant, convince themselves that their superiors are in fact inferior because they can't see that lounging around and being a selfish lout is a lot less effort and much more butch?
those who are educationally spoonfed believe it is only their own efforts that have brought about their superior status and others simply didn't work hard enough or are genetically inferior.
everyone should be encouraged to progress to the full extent of their potential, not put in their place and forbidden further growth.
later in life, fear of not belonging may even tempt us to be less than true to our inner convictions, leading us to denounce them and even paradoxically actively campaign against them, so convincingly hiding one's real thoughts.
i think it's wiser to assume that there is none, and at least be true to yourself in life, as most likely this is your only shot at it.
so we pass through the selfishness of toddlerhood, the braggart cliqueishness of childhood, to come up against the obscenity of suddenly having a larger set of genitals clamped onto us.
teachers should teach more about sex and friends and lavatory walls be more sexually literate.
there are fewer dark areas now, but it's not long since neighbours thought that the female orgasm was unnecessary, and rare.
now this used to be regarded as the british missionary position, a form of sexual gratification indulged in by those weary of other entertaining possibilities.
i'm not just talking of a number of different sexual positions, which despite the acrobatics are still in essence penis up the vagina, fun though they may be.
full sexual orgasm as everyone should really know can be achieved in mutual masturbation for instance.
which is not only unwanted pregnancy free, but minimizes the risk of venerial disease and teaches us a great deal about how to truly arouse our partners to heights of pleasure and gratification.
if there is one single area in which you can rely on your neighbours ignorance and intolerance, it is sex.
it may be a good way of meeting friends and forming deep relationships, but unfortunately it can arouse very destructive feelings of guilt, envy, and jealousy, and it's for this reason that sensible discretion on sexual matters is still a necessity.
at last scientists are learning how to turn back some of our body clocks, good luck to them.
it's theoretically possible for a human being to live to a hundred and fifty years of age, let's push ourselves beyond their limits.
people who think they've gracefully accepted the inevitable are fond of saying, oh i wouldn't want to live forever.
oh yes they would if they thought they had a chance.
the alternative is after all, death, which is a bit final.
even if you think you're going to casually ooze off into some eternal nirvana, you've got the whole of eternity to do that in.
fortunately, communications are breaking down political and national barriers, and we're able to see round, over, and through them to glimpse people everywhere as they really are, and not as world leaders would like them to be seen.
we don't have to be judged by our local neighbours anymore, there is a bigger, global neighbour, who is more tolerant and understanding.

and then you can sweep me into your arms and drag me to the altar.

this is a very strange vigil we all seem to have gathered for.
it will be hard to keep us with this for the rest of my life.
do you realize that no man on this earth will ever again know the joy that you will bring me this night.
it's bad enough that that gypsy child is always with you.
we never have any time alone, with you living in the country.
in it we seem to give only so that we may receive.
is there enough i can give to you, so that you can give ecstasy to me?
you teach me everything you can do with these horses... and watch me... and grow to love me more and more each day.
and soon the predictions of the dooms-day doctors is no longer true.

i would like to offer you the hospitality of my home, but it's so far away from this mountaintop.
well, if you found all of your wayward bulls, maybe you could ride back in the car with us.
what possible use can you have for one of these horses?
assuming you owned one of my horses right now, what would you do with it?

we'd better get going, folks, or we'll miss the train in omaha.

smythe was a young officer with our regiment in kenya, in the '50s.

of course, he had to tell penny, but when he faced her he found he couldn't.
she learned of his impending marriage through some wives gossiping at a bridge party,
especially when that naked chick popped out of that dragon's head, firing that ak-47 all over the place.
how was i supposed to know she was vc when i hired her?
according to deirdre, diane was a paranoid hysteric who could be shy and innocent one moment, aggressive and sexy the next.
the more she told me, the more i hated it, because it all made sense.

somehow rick came up with the manifest, so i gave him the tickets.
but also i got him to promise to check on the dupres family for me, especially on deirdre.
a famous actress, a cookie maker, two us senators and a tvstar.
sixty-six of the passengers were members of something called "the buffalo chips", and the rest i assumed were just tourists.
she'd hide my possessions, tell me that i'd done things i hadn't done.
she would even pose as me and then do terrible things and i'd get blamed for it.
if she'd been there i might not have been able to control my anger.
i convinced diane the best thing to do was to go away with me for a while, let time sort things out.
perhaps that's why the family was able to suppress what really happened.
both girls had been physically and sexually abused, and only one had survived.

reimi, thank you for inviting me over it was all thanks to you that i was able to get a passport so soon
i'll do whatever you ask me to i'll never say no to you
that's why i asked her to come lt's fine, we both have company now
gu cheng, i've run out of soap, can you get me some?
it's the land of the amazons that he really dreams about !
excuse me, one of your neighbour's just complained about the noise your chickens are making
otherwise i'll have to ask you to reduce the amount of chickens
she says it's against the law to keep more than 12 chickens, our neighbours have made a complaint
sorry , we don't know the rules i'm sure we can sort it out quite simply
one thing is for sure, you chinese are certainly fond of your chickens
you need some time to yourself then we'll see i'll take care of the tickets and hotels, or you can stay in my house i've got plenty of space here
i thought love was a promise, but i got nothing only saying i love you, i love you !
i'd like to be able to believe to believe in something, somebody, even a little !
but nothing can make me believe death is the only guarantee, but nobody's willing to kill me
i've got a letter today lt's from germany, d'you remember da yu?
he's worked very hard to get you the heinrich boll stifung grant
aft er you get your residency, you'd better not come back to the island or gu cheng will go mad lt'll be embarrassing for you, too
don't worry , i swear i'll never come back, and i'll never see him again
yes, but we are just following the decision you and your husband made some time ago
if you want to change the custody arrangements, you must see mrs peterson talk to her
or maybe i should say i am a substitute that you two share
we've been very good to you, how could you say that !
i'm only a toy that you use to please gu cheng
without me, at most he'd blow up for a while express his feeling by writing, or go mad for a few days
i can't just die like this, i need your help !
i want to write down everything about me and ching er
i've heard that she's tired of living hand to mouth, she's run away with michael
she only loves a successful gu cheng, not a self inflicted suffering gu cheng !
you two must discuss this, i have to go and pick my son up from school
slowly, so slowly the world abandons me the sun sinks into the west, leaving me bereft
this is the only way that can bring us back to our happiest times
you have to give me back my last 10 years !
live like the living do this iron shovel has dug too deep
not only has it destroyed my life it has cut through the roots to the depth of my existance
i'm not saddened by the knowledge that death is upon me in the pine forest, my wish lies in peace
the sea below it from a distance resembles a pond specks of aft ernoon sun follow me
my time of life has come to an end all be it a lifetime is long but i shall take a break in the middle

a company of the romanian regiment of frontier guards will depart to miercurea.
the skills and loyalty of these units are to be tested.
we hope he will not be tortured and end as thomas munzer, the hero of the german peasants' war.
i most humbly bow before your majesty since ballet scenes interrupt the flow of narration rendering a frivolous note,
the obstinate intellectually-reduced and savage-mannered nobility refuses to let go of old privileges.
i know, but a clear inquiry must be made, not necessarily for history's sake,
since the riot passed its initial ebullition, it is as good as ended.
prepare the general commander patent of the wurthenberg dragons' regiment for colonel savelius wajda pustahaza.
i wouldn't have allowed myself to show your majesty the image of human decrepitude.
for the noblemen refugees in the cities of deva and hunedoara there will be a daily tax of 17 kreutzers, a sum to be returned to the imperial treasury as soon as calm is restored.
count karoly requests de honor of presenting your majesty's high compliance to the needs and grievances of transylvanian nobility.
your most sacred majesty, the fire and pillage caused by the romanian rebellious noblemen, arsonists, harassers and assassins lead to the utter devastation of most nobles, the flower and decorum of transylvania, and they are still relentless.
but you, through excessive taxations at your own will, senselessly and ceaselessly, in winter and in summer, have constantly burdened your subjects!
i will punish with no remorse those who dared to take justice into their own hands but...
i too have taken under my abode horea, closca and crisan,
i too have baptized landowners as serfs, cut off my head!
he is anton melzer, ranger of the imperial woods, robbed by the rebels.
and they are former rebels that have contrived, the brothers maties...
his majesty sends gracious thanks for the precious help you gave at the truce.
i serve the cause of my lambs as i see fit.
and the truces we made, willingly or not, were also broken.
there, officer, we talk of peace, minding our business while landowners eavesdrop.
some missed their infants, others were tired of sleeping in the cold, others were frightened of their own deeds!
but they didn't renounce us and they didn't sell us out!
no one among us has sinned, unless it is sinful to seek justice!
it may be a sin to you, but not to us!
i, the emperor josef, seeing that all my orders in favor of the peasants have been kept from them by the hungarian nobles and their servants and by their servants...
they not only ignore them, but did the opposite of what i ordered,
but we cannot do it without the emperor's permission, can we?
need we hear from the emperor that we are hungry and mocked, that we endure as fools do, that we are many and that hungarians nobles live fully.
madam, sir, the orders are formal regarding the search of those who wish to see the criminals.
the corporal, who is higher in rank, has done me the great favor of allowing me to search you.
knowing my handwriting, you will know that i sent you this letter!
god forbid, but should it come to the enemy, you shall remain silent!
i'm afraid his excellency, the general is too tired to enjoy these... harmonious verses.
describe the circumstances in which horea issued the ultimatum proclamation of november 11 th.
my beloved sons, the lord showed his will in the holy scripture, commanding 'thou shall not kill, thou shall not steal' as well as teaching us to love our enemies...
god commands only us, the peasants, to love them, but not to the nobles!
dear and respected lord crisan, we, the landowners in transylvania plead you to spare the abrud from pillage, for we'll pay you in gold, as much as you want!
you worms, the money you tempt us with are our strength!
captain, you leave us defenseless in front of these fierce animals, more fierce than vandals?
my orders are to defend the mines and that it what i'll do!
horea had a strange nobility, not of rank and not of power, but of a sort of blind justice!
he commanded that i be brought forth and dictated to me:
and you, a noble, even captive, wrote down these monstrous ideas.
your excellency, my hand was but a tool moving on the white sheet by the crowd's fury.
'each time power is avert from the purpose of government which represents public good and public freedom is endangered, the people may and have the right to change the old governing and set a new one.
the doctrine of submission to an arbitrary government is absurd and menial.
the riot is subsequently legitimate everywhere power is not directly given by the people, everywhere the purpose of government does not represent the general good of society, but the good of one man or few people.
subject for centuries to a cruel, blind and stupid tyranny, the noble romanians wallowed in misery until, out of the very bosom of its suffering, horea emerged.
people tormented by every nation joined him and bishops and arms were sent against rebels.
clergy is always present in political turmoil, perhaps they know the art of deceiving.
the people only demand justice, and sovereigns, no matter how wise they may want to seem, through the very nature of their power...
taxes and chores in favor of nobles tripled over the last few years.
we work for them for five days, and when we go home the sixth day to work for our benefit, they won't leave us and they call for us everywhere to no beginning and no end in winter, spring, summer or fall.
and your grace should know that we reap, we harvest, we carry the crops, but not for us.
we hand over everything, butter, meat, fowl and eggs, fish, nuts, our rags we give for their paper mills, so that nobles may read.
we can't read, you grace, but only few of us, such as myself, ursu necula, who was sent to you for this reason by the people.
and it is not only the nobles who oppress us, but their servants as well, who torture us worse than the nobles.
those who rise and forget their origins are worse than the nobles, because they are even more greedy.
father, i wanted to shoot you in the heart, to spare you from torments.
is that what you think of me, that i'm frightened by torture?
have many children, starve so may send your children to schools, so they may be more schooled than the nobles' children.
and from time to time, tell them a story about me as well, but not often.
then your body will be ripped in four and scattered in four corners of the country.
i will have a large tomb then, as big as the entire country of ardeal.
that is our country from our ancestors, it's out land, reaped with sweat and blood, work, honesty, pride!
and for all that, tell me, for i know you counted them, how many perished while making people rebel?
what were your connections in the villages, where the secret roads are and hiding places.
so they might know how to prevent it in the future.
you don't know us, sir, and you can't rule over us.
only we know ourselves, our good and bad, and i did nothing but teach it to some with a kind word, with fire, with the scythe, with terror, so that each and everyone may understand.
majesty, ursu necula, called horea, has a great personality, with an unusual force of heart, not only with peasants, but among the highest social ranks.
he cannot be bought, nor made to doubt the justice of his cause and of his means.
that is why, as a political necessity, his execution is called for in a terrifying manner.
although contrary to your august principles, this must be done in front of three youths and old men from each village, so that the love and faith in horea may be destroyed for all eternity.
it's value is in the imperial grace, not in the gold.
i wish you guide them for many years, ruling the peasants' souls, these children capable of miracles and murders.
he gave, either personally, either through his men, the order that from every serf home, one man should come to arms and, thus, powers united, they should kill all nobles, steal their fortunes, turn into ruin every home,
drive them away from transylvania that horea considers to be romanian land.
you should know when you meet the emperor, that he has a confusing tongue.
if things go well, he is honored and revered, if things go bad, it means that you didn't understand him.
what's worse is not slavery, but that people get used to it if enough time passes.
people grow accustomed with slavery, with obeisance, with fear, with mockery.
they stop caring and become as the dumb bird used to its cage, forgetting it ever flew.
or is afraid its master might know it hasn't forget how to fly.
horea wore a precious stone, the seal of his new kingdom, dacia.
a company of the romanian regiment of frontier guards will depart to miercurea.
i most humbly bow before your majesty since ballet scenes interrupt the flow of narration rendering a frivolous note,
we propose - underline this word - their elimination from operas to take place in the future.
as far as i know, the peasants have accepted the eight-days truce proposed by colonel wajda.
since the riot passed its initial ebullition, it is as good as ended.
your most sacred majesty, the fire and pillage caused by the romanian rebellious noblemen, arsonists, harassers and assassins lead to the utter devastation of most nobles, the flower and decorum of transylvania, and they are still relentless.
their past and present leader is the poisoning urs necula, also known as horea, who shamelessly poses as an authority...
the faith in the crown... a minimum of intelligence and common sense would have dictated that you apply a salving reform!
but you, through excessive taxations at your own will, senselessly and ceaselessly, in winter and in summer, have constantly burdened your subjects!
one hundred and seventeen noblemen suffered an unpleasant death, your majesty.
too little compared to the manner contrary to your interests in which you treated them.
following the trial of those charged with crime, the sentences will be read out, part of them being passed.
the tribunal comprised of deputy-commissioner faray, baron kemeny, count perecay, and members of the bourgeoisie maieriu, cosma and hopschebergen.
ion lupenci, from petris, 33 years old, instigator to the arson of nobility courts, sentenced to be executed before the petris village.
craciun pacurar and toma beghisan, mihai marian and sandu toader, sentenced to be burned at the stake.
i too have baptized landowners as serfs, cut off my head!
if things are as you say, you will be punished, pater.
and if we all go, we cannot hold responsibility for our people, because they need food and shelter!
your leaders' conscience is not clear, since you don't dare come alone and, still, i am content by this!
it may be a sin to you, but not to us!
i demand that show here the written orders that you pretend... that you claim to have from his majesty, the emperor, and with which you've deceived the unknowing crowds!
they're waiting for us to leave, but seeing us upright, dignified, in our home, they will not dare!
the plebeians fury in vain boils, thou needs only draw thy sword!
there are to be no hungarian nobles left in the land!
castles are burning on the mures, on the cris rivers, and you...!
for this reasons, i command you to rebel and do away with them, if you love me and if you love yourselves!
but we cannot do it without the emperor's permission, can we?
as a violent blizzard born from an abyss, he crossed the mountains and the hidden valley...
we cannot establish where was horea and what he did during the riots!
they come to us with the ten commandments, what do you bring us?
dear and respected lord crisan, we, the landowners in transylvania plead you to spare the abrud from pillage, for we'll pay you in gold, as much as you want!
as your excellency knows, there were 50 peasants executed in deva under lege statario.
do you know the names of those who formed this illegal and unconscious tribunal?
the good news is brought by father moise from carpinici, who most contributed to his capture.
your highness, i humbly present myself as moise, llie moise from carpinici.
the doctrine of submission to an arbitrary government is absurd and menial.
the riot is subsequently legitimate everywhere power is not directly given by the people, everywhere the purpose of government does not represent the general good of society, but the good of one man or few people.
subject for centuries to a cruel, blind and stupid tyranny, the noble romanians wallowed in misery until, out of the very bosom of its suffering, horea emerged.
people tormented by every nation joined him and bishops and arms were sent against rebels.
clergy is always present in political turmoil, perhaps they know the art of deceiving.
brother brissot doesn't know that the low-ranked clergy took part in the riot with their congregation.
taxes and chores in favor of nobles tripled over the last few years.
we work for them for five days, and when we go home the sixth day to work for our benefit, they won't leave us and they call for us everywhere to no beginning and no end in winter, spring, summer or fall.
and your grace should know that we reap, we harvest, we carry the crops, but not for us.
we hand over everything, butter, meat, fowl and eggs, fish, nuts, our rags we give for their paper mills, so that nobles may read.
we can't read, you grace, but only few of us, such as myself, ursu necula, who was sent to you for this reason by the people.
and it is not only the nobles who oppress us, but their servants as well, who torture us worse than the nobles.
is that what you think of me, that i'm frightened by torture?
i don't fear it, otherwise they wouldn't have caught me alive.
keep to your life as the wolf keeps to his prey.
have many children, starve so may send your children to schools, so they may be more schooled than the nobles' children.
only we know ourselves, our good and bad, and i did nothing but teach it to some with a kind word, with fire, with the scythe, with terror, so that each and everyone may understand.
so they may rebel with me and i may die, i, ursu necula, called horea, called thus because i enjoyed life and singing.
he cannot be bought, nor made to doubt the justice of his cause and of his means.
that is why, as a political necessity, his execution is called for in a terrifying manner.
the sentence in the trial against horea, also called ursu necula, charged with instigating to riots, posing as leader of the rebelled people whom he solely gathered and named leaders lower in rank.
he gave, either personally, either through his men, the order that from every serf home, one man should come to arms and, thus, powers united, they should kill all nobles, steal their fortunes, turn into ruin every home,
please, forgive me, the servant, for i only do my duty, and i swear that i hold no grudge against you.
you were born from the ground and there you shall return...
it had to begin at some point, by any means, but it had to begin.
what's worse is not slavery, but that people get used to it if enough time passes.
people grow accustomed with slavery, with obeisance, with fear, with mockery.
they stop caring and become as the dumb bird used to its cage, forgetting it ever flew.
or is afraid its master might know it hasn't forget how to fly.
only now, with the emperor's permission or not, we know we can do it.
but do you really think anyone'll come to a place that looks like this, megane?
maybe we should have gone with the hot babes coffee shop like ataru suggested.
besides, do you know how hard it was to collect money from everyone in class to open this place?
i'll be damned if i'll let it be operated to ataru's weird tastes.
well, since this is the annual school festival and since student self-management is to be encouraged... there's no point in me, the principal, saying anything now.
as shinran said, "the road to heaven is harder for the pious than the profane."
we all go through times of agony, pain, and wrongdoing and become fine adults in spite of it and momotaro can go to manchuria and become genghis khan.
as the great goethe said, "pass through agony and reach the great pleasure!"
well, let's say person a is staying here out of concern for person b.
in my case, i'm staying because i care about this person a.
anyway, the best thing to do is get away from here and have a good rest.
i insist you go back to your boarding house and sleep until evening.
and because you're so tired you're making up memories of things that you've never even done.
it's only natural, putting up with those lawful brats day in and day out.
i started thinking about it, and for the first time, i realized that i can't clearly remember things to an extent that surprises even me.
yesterday, the days before, even these past few hours, if i'm not careful i forget them all.
are you saying that it will be a day truly different from today?
i can't even remember a yesterday that was different from today.
if the students didn't go home for such a long time their parents would get worried.
what if it's not just tomobiki high school repeating the same day over?
urashima taro spent dreamlike days at the dragon palace and when he returned to his beloved hometown he found that hundreds of years had already passed there.
what if, instead of just taro alone everyone in the village had rescued that turtle?
you would have noticed right away if something strange was happening to someone somewhere in town.
but what if something strange happened to the whole town, or the whole world including you?
maybe there ain't no such thing as time that flows in one direction from the past to the future, and never was, don'tcha think, ma'am?
human beings are slipshod to begin with so there ain't nothing strange 'bout time being slipshod too.
twice is tragedy, but thrice is comedy, as someone once said.
but i guess i can't leave them to repeat this for a lifetime.
actually, when miss sakura told me last night, i couldn't believe it, either.
but given the incident with my tank today, and what happened last night too many strange things have been happening lately.
meaning that there is now no doubt that something is happening.
so i propose that we form a reality-check committee in order to find the facts through our own efforts...
he took us out, knowing full well we couldn't afford it.
then he used his offer to pay to make this deal with us.
the recent string of events are indeed connected to tomobiki high.
but we won't likely find out anything by searching the building.
once i was an ordinary school student, attending tomobiki high enduring those boring days, with my head in the clouds.
but the traumatic sight i saw from the harrier's cockpit that night changed my destiny forever!
since the day after we made our forced landing at ataru's in the harrier the world has changed its guise, as if turning its back on us.
the same town, the same corner stores, the same public parks...
who in the world would have imagined such a silent, simple end?
the civilization that mankind built up in the past, gradually, over millenia has come to an end.
but for those of us who are left, the end is nothing but a new beginning.
the day that heralded the end of the world was the beginning of the days of our struggle for survival.
strangely enough, the convenience store near ataru's house has not given way to the encroaching ruin, and its gallant shelves provides us with an abundant stock of food, daily sundries, and the like.
stranger still, ataru's house still has electricity, gas and water and, most surprising of all, the newspaper is still delivered.
naturally, in the just cause of mankind's continued existence we have chosen ataru's house as the base of our lives.
but for some reason, miss sakura soon opened haratama--a beef-bowl shop declaring that she wanted to live on her own.
soon after, ryuunosuke and her father reopened hama teashop near the ruins of the school.
and mendou drives around in his tank all day long probably to deal with unfulfilled needs.
who knows how much time has passed since that fateful night?
but in this world we're building, clocks and calendars are useless.
the necessities of life provided to us, we struggle to survive.
the everlasting dream of all mankind, shangri-la is ours to make, with our own hands.
i feel both ecstasy and unease at being a chosen one.
when i realize that the future of mankind rests wholly on our shoulders i can't help but feel an emotion similar to vertigo...
i wasn't driving my tank around just for fun while the rest of you slumbered and partied in this screwed-up world.
miss sakura and i were examining the structure of this place and working out a plan to somehow return to our real home.
we just didn't talk much about it, as it was too obvious a solution.
looks like you went to all that trouble for nothing after all, mendou.
when we also exclude ten, his pet piglet and ryuunosuke's father, who's now without his only "son" we are left with five people.
megane and co. are enjoying living under the same roof with lum but the problem is that all four of them are together.
if it was one of their dreams, each would think only of himself.
none of them are so philanthropic as to consider the other three.
she's not the kind of girl who'd do something like that.
we've been together long enough for me to know that much about her.
so far, you've been on the mark with the main points of this discussion.
even if lum is the princess, it is the turtle who invites her to dragon palace!
did you think, upon receiving my letter, that he would wait until dark?
i went to see sakura right after i got it... at noon!
it is there, in that darkness, that your form is constantly lurking.
who was it that turned a shy art student into a crazed dictator?
why did an emperor known for his love of poetry and of good government become a bloody tyrant, and set his capital afire?
a devoted disciple betrayed his lord and an honorable man turned his sword on a close friend!
so if a dream turns out evil, it's because that person has evil desires.
"whether something is used for good or evil depends on human minds."
well, if this'll take care of everything, fine, but it's not my style.
but now that i think about it, this was bound to happen.
all that awaited me in this world were stares filled with hate.
people hated me and none would come near me, let alone talk to me.
it may surprise you, but listen to what i have to say.
your mother and i probably won't be alive when you hear this tape.
we made every effort to find some way to awaken you and lum from your mysterious sleep.
but present-day science, not just that of earth, but of lum's planet as well couldn't revive the two of you.
see, whether you call something reality or a dream you ultimately think of it in the same way.
that being the case, isn't it better to live a fun life in a dream?
well, you see, i want to be free from a girl, because i want to keep loving her.
you probably don't understand, seeing as how you're a girl too...
and before you hit bottom and wake up you call out the name of the person you really want to see.
if you can't say that one special name, then you don't really want to wake up.
but do you really think anyone'll come to a place that looks like this, megane?
maybe we should have gone with the hot babes coffee shop like ataru suggested.
besides, do you know how hard it was to collect money from everyone in class to open this place?
i'll be damned if i'll let it be operated to ataru's weird tastes.

but the traumatic sight i saw from the harrier's cockpit that night changed my destiny forever!
since the day after we made our forced landing at ataru's in the harrier the world has changed its guise, as if turning its back on us.
the shadows of cars going to and fro have disappeared from the roads the sound of pianos in townhouse gardens has also stopped and there is no one wolfing down a meal at the beef-bowl shop counter.
everyone else in town, no, everyone else in the world suddenly vanished, leaving only us.
the civilization that mankind built up in the past, gradually, over millenia has come to an end.
but for those of us who are left, the end is nothing but a new beginning.
the day that heralded the end of the world was the beginning of the days of our struggle for survival.

soon after, ryuunosuke and her father reopened hama teashop near the ruins of the school.
i don't know what's bugging him, but it isn't pretty to watch.
who knows how much time has passed since that fateful night?
but in this world we're building, clocks and calendars are useless.
the necessities of life provided to us, we struggle to survive.
the everlasting dream of all mankind, shangri-la is ours to make, with our own hands.
i feel both ecstasy and unease at being a chosen one.
probably sunstroke, i told him to wear a hat, but he wouldn't listen.
...excerpted from "the prehistory of tomobiki", by megane volume 1: "beyond the end of the world", prologue, chapter 3.
because you are so stupid, i'll explain this logically and systematically.
now, this table represents our world, riding on that giant turtle.
why hasn't the convenience store where you, megane and the rest pig out ever run out of food?
going back further, where did all the town's inhabitants disappear to?
it's obviously not me, miss sakura, or the missing shinobu or ryuunosuke.
we exclude mr. and mrs. moroboshi because having so many people in their house inconveniences them.
megane and co. are enjoying living under the same roof with lum but the problem is that all four of them are together.
if it was one of their dreams, each would think only of himself.
i don't know about the rest, why would she eliminate shinobu and ryuu?
she's not the kind of girl who'd do something like that.
even if lum is the princess, it is the turtle who invites her to dragon palace!
we're forgetting the possibility of a third person, who created all of this to make lum's wish come true!
it's as if in setting a trap, you got caught in one.
did you think, upon receiving my letter, that he would wait until dark?
who was it that turned a shy art student into a crazed dictator?
why did an emperor known for his love of poetry and of good government become a bloody tyrant, and set his capital afire?
then you must have had a fight with your boyfriend, right?
pretty girls like you don't normally come to places like this, all alone.
i'm in love with lum, just like all the other girls.
but when i try to see another girl, she interferes, which is why i run away.
i've been making and living in other people's dreams since i was born!
can't i have a dream of my own, just this once?
i fell asleep on the way to get take-out food for midnight snacks!
so that town and that mujaki guy were all a dream.
he fights again for the fate of earth, but there are only ten minutes left!
can he grab the horns of lum the devil-girl and save mankind?
after a period of unconsciousness, cause unknown i returned to life as a man-made golem.
it was indeed fortunate that for some reason, i was resistant to high-voltage electricity.
your mother and i probably won't be alive when you hear this tape.
we made every effort to find some way to awaken you and lum from your mysterious sleep.
we've staked our last hopes, and your fates, on the future.
we thought that science a few centuries from now might have a chance of awakening you.
that being the case, isn't it better to live a fun life in a dream?
even you if you don't ask for anything outrageous i'll make you tons of good dreams.
lets find him.....# #.....while confined channel guided us.....# #.....he would define his pathways.....# #.....and loiter along them merrily.....#
#.....while our future haunted us.....# #.....he would celebrate the present.....# #.....and live every moment with reckless freedom .....#
like village in desert .....# #.....he was like salve for our distress .....# #.....while we cowered from challenges .....# #.....he would dive in seas .....#
#.....and swim against the rip currents .....# #.....he was a wandering cloud .....# #.....he was our pal .....# #.....where did he go?
after you stay here for a while, your belief in god will vanish eventually
only posters of naked girls stuck by your side.. and you'll say
he has trained his mind so that he can write using both his hands at the same time
everday at 2pm he used to take a power nap of exactly 7.5 minutes and used to listen opera
they lay their eggs on other birds nest and when their babies come to the world, what do they do first?
they kick out other eggs from the nest competition over the life begins with murder that's nature...
and these are those eggs whom you kicked out and reached i.c.e.
don't forget because every year, 4 lakh (400,000) applications comes to i.c.e.
he showed me this pen he said this is a symbol of excellence
"i give it to you and the day when you get a extraordinary student like you pass this pen to him"
for 32 years, viru sahastrabudhhe is waiting for the next viru sahastrabudhhe
is there anyone here in this batch to honour this pen?
professors used to keep rancho outside more often than inside classrooms
if he get kicked from one class, he'd go sit in another classroom
mr. lobo my son died falling from a train on sunday afternoon
monday morning viru sahastrabudhhe gave a lecture in this college so don't tell me that nonsense
wow what a design he made. wireless camera on a helicopter?
traffic updates, security... it can be used for all but it seems it won't fly
but that day we came to know about the real fact see our heart right, is a big coward
keep our heart fooled if you have any big problem in life tell your heart
reason for death in postmortem report intense pressure on wind pipe resulting in choking
this fool believed that died because of the pressure held here and pressure over here for the last 4 years?
here we dont have any talks related to new ideas, no talks on inventions
only great talk on only marks, or else jobs in usa
you all have 30 secs find the meanings of the words written on the board
if you want you can make use of your books too
no sir i'm not teaching you engineering, you know better than me
i was teaching you that, how to teach, and i believe that you learn someday for sure sir because i never leave my weaker students hand busted
i would regret to inform you that your son farhan, raju is goin on the wrong route
if you don't take required action their future will be spoiled
virus's letters fell down in our homes like an atom bomb there was mourning in hiroshima and nagasaki!
and we were invited to both the home to get kicked
come, let's eat something when you come next time have food and go....
dad didn't give us food though and atlast to fill our hungry stomach, and to fill the quota of advice we reached raju's home
raju's home reminds us about the 1950's black and white films one small bed where his paralysed father rested one coughing mother and one sister at her age of marriage
sofa with all springs out and 24 hours running water from the terrace mother was retired from school and tired almost all the time
his dad was a postmaster at his age after paralysis he lost his half body and salary completely.... and sister!
kammo (raju's sister) is 28 now asking maruthi 800 as dowry...
earn for kids, work like a servant, and after all this you want me to keep my mouth shut?
hey this is all our news if i don't tell it to my son, to whom will i say?
it was a big confusion whether we should control our friend or wipe his mother's tears
then we thought to leave all these matters, and let's concentrate on mattar paneer now,
he is not a human, he is just a price tag, price tag
he'll embarrass you telling you prices of different things thing all of your life, your life will be spoiled and your future will be finished, should i give a demo?
umm... sir in delhi, power goes out frequently sir and this really affects the marriage too sir so i thought to make an inverter
that can generate power from all cars that has come in the marriage,
in terms of installment sir and afterward we wont intrude in any marriage sir
i wont even enter my marriage also sir, infact i wont marry also sir, even he wont marry also sir hanh hanh, even i wont sir
i would worry a little this is your father's monthly income, mr. farhan!
yes... yes sir, and now if you make it one more zero less,
for me to get a good job, i need good grades, and grades are within his hands,
i don't have rich father like you..using whose money, i can spend the rest of my life
one is to get marks by yourself, or try reducing other's marks
rancho has made the combined plan to teach silencer a lesson, and to help raju, our director sir has done much miracle here,
see, without understanding if you cram things, this will be the result, see see!
by cramming, you can save 4 years of your college life..
if he had to work in a bank only, then why did he do engineering?
for such donkeys, life only means a profit or loss statement
he's seeing there's profit being with you, that's why he's with you
you, the director's daughter, who is going to be a docto, it's good for his image
if it would've been late by 2 or 2.5 hours, then we would have lost him
good that you did not wait for an ambulance and got him on a scooter, i'll go now, if there is any problem, call me ok?
at a sister's wedding, if a girl is nicely dressed head to toe
except for an old watch on the hand, what does it mean?
whereas my friends have come last so they are seated in the last, in a corner
at least they are sitting in a corner now, if they continue being with you, next year they'll be out of the photo itself!
yaar, i must be the first man in history who travelled from delhi to simla in underwear that too to meet a wrong person!
yaar, the same name, the same degree, and the same photo!
i have been chasing him for the past year and the meeting has been fixed now!
you know once he signs a deal with my company, i'll be huge!
see this, my secretary tracey was here last month to arrange a meeting with phunsukh wangdu
tracey couldn't get an appointment with phunsukh but i got rancho
you kept on saying, "take me to haridwar, take me to haridwar"
but i was waiting for the highway's tender to be opened
rancchoddas chanchad's degree, i want it over there on that wall
i went away to london for four years and he kept studying in i.c.e. using my name
if you don't have a job, no father will give his daughter's hand
bank won't give credit card, and the world won't respect us
but that idiot came to college, not for the degree but to study!
he wasn't afraid to come last or greedy to come first!
idiot, he raped us completely collective rape you know, in front of, in front of everyone!
god, i'll stop eating non-veg, i'll light thousands of incense sticks!
see this, see his hand, the fingers are less and the rings are more
one for exam, one for sister's marriage and one for job
what i say is, if you go and tell pia about what you're feeling
then even i'll go and tell my dad that i want to be a photographer and don't want to be an engineer
[raju singing in the background] [don't say anything, don't say anything at all]
pia, the 22 minutes that i spent with you on the scooter those were the most beautiful 22 minutes of my life!
oye champ you stay inside itself, outside there's a lot of circus!
and the circus's ringmaster, your granfather will spin the hunter and say run!
he's living only in hope that he could see me become an engineer sir!
you could've thought of this before you pissed in front of my door
#.......even if god might summon you.......# #.....but we are not the one who fear him.....# #.....we are standing here in this ground with resolve.....#
#.....take out our eyes from our pal....# #....no matter how hard you try.....# #....we're not gonna let you leave lik this.....#
dad, stipend isn't too much but i'll get to learn a lot!
after 5 years, when you'll see your friends buying a car
they'll say that you came till final year and had quit!
that kapoor sir told me that you're lucky that your son is studying in i.c.e.!
making me sleep comfortably, he himself didn't sleep in the heat!
making me sit on his shoulders, kapoor sir didn't take me around the zoo!
16 bones broke, i got two months to think, then i understood!
sir, today i haven't told god to get me this job
i just folded my hands and said thank you for this life
if you guys, if you guys even reject me today, then i don't have any regrets
because i believe i'll somehow do something worthy with my life sir!
see this very much frank behaviour of yours is not good for our company
we need a diplomatic person to handle the clients and you are way too straightforward!
but if you assure us that you can control this attitude of yours
a duplicate key of virus's office question papers are in the red sealed envelope
dad has set by himself to fail raju in the exam
but in the last 24 hours, i had got an emergency landing of a plane almost immersed shyamaldas's soul in the gutter and kidnapped a bride from her wedding all for that idiot rancho but even that idiot gave out his heart for his friends
he had entered ravan's territory, to steal a question paper for raju search for a red sealed envelope ok come
virus had set it by himself to make you fail the exam
weird friends i've got teaching how to live straight forward first then making me do things that are odd no, today if i pass, it'll be on my own ability!
rancho, when there were no hospitals and doctors in this world even then babies were born
you guys will carry on sister's delivery "aal iz well, aal iz well"
if the tip of the pencil breaks in space, then it will be revolving under the action of gravity
it can get into someone's eyes, it can get into someone's nose
i wanted to capture all these memories in my camera and take it with me!
on that day, everyone was hugging each other, getting emotional and making promises
that we'll stay in touch, we'll surely meet up once in a year!
who knew that we were seeing rancho for the last time?
for the first time, i got a letter with my name on it.
i found a train ticket in that it was written inside that if you wanna study then board the train!
hey look down even pants you forgot! now you can go to hotel!
but only after goin to airport because my brother is coming there take him to hotel.
to save time he used velcro instead of buttons and a hook in tie!
he has trained his mind so that he can write using both his hands at the same time
everday at 2pm he used to take a power nap of exactly 7.5 minutes and used to listen opera
govind had to do all unproductive works like shaving and cutting nails in this 7.5 mins
don't forget because every year, 4 lakh (400,000) applications comes to i.c.e.
among them only 200 will be selected you and these finished broken eggs!
from this you can write in any angle, any temperature, zero gravity
one day when i was a student the director of our institute called me
"i give it to you and the day when you get a extraordinary student like you pass this pen to him"
for 32 years, viru sahastrabudhhe is waiting for the next viru sahastrabudhhe
i tried sometime before, but you didn't like it in simple way sir
professors used to keep rancho outside more often than inside classrooms
if he get kicked from one class, he'd go sit in another classroom
rancho used to say that knowledge is increasing everywhere - where ever you get, gain it!
he used to carry a screwdriver in his pocket where ever he goes
he would open any machine that he finds, some got closed some did not!
keep our heart fooled if you have any big problem in life tell your heart
no problem baby, everything is ok "aal iz well, aal iz well"
didn't even invent some machine, that could really behold the pressure over here...
if they had, we would've come to know this is not a suicide, it's a murder,
every 1 half hour one of the other students attempts suicide, sir
student die less from sickness and more from suicides here sir
only pressure will increase and this is a college not a pressure cooker
the lion in the circus also learns to sit on the chair fearing the whip held in his owner's hand but we call such a lion as well trained, not well educated
if you don't take required action their future will be spoiled
virus's letters fell down in our homes like an atom bomb there was mourning in hiroshima and nagasaki!
dad didn't give us food though and atlast to fill our hungry stomach, and to fill the quota of advice we reached raju's home
raju's home reminds us about the 1950's black and white films one small bed where his paralysed father rested one coughing mother and one sister at her age of marriage

his dad was a postmaster at his age after paralysis he lost his half body and salary completely.... and sister!
kammo (raju's sister) is 28 now asking maruthi 800 as dowry...
if you don't study and all how will she get married?
lady's finger has now become 12 rupees per kg and cauliflower 10 rupees
world is looting all over and upon that these kind of letters come from your college
my dad wont allow me to break the engagement with suhas, how great you explain!
it would be good if you give a demo for him also,
dad, he explains really good, now itself he'll give demo, give
umm... sir in delhi, power goes out frequently sir and this really affects the marriage too sir so i thought to make an inverter
should we do whatever he says hanh? "aal iz well, aal iz well"?
you'll be the only one who's gonna catch his tail not me,
yaar..now in this argument..if you are getting mother's saree in between..what can i say?
yaar so like that how many sarees are reserved for one year?
silencer used to study for 18 hours a day and during the night, he used to distract others from study #.... oooo baby.... come on baby ye.....# he believed in two ways of topping exams
one is to get marks by yourself, or try reducing other's marks
give him a hand, sir he's saying it but every word is mine
he is a great guy, really you are, for the past 32 years he has continuously in this college, committed rapes upon rapes
[ the middle fart is like the sound of a train ]
kanishtam thud thudiya paadam [ the smallest fart ] sur suriiee............ praana kadakam...
by cramming, you can save 4 years of your college life..
but for the next 40 years of your life, you'll go on getting raped
i'll think of it every minute, every second of my life!
dude leave it, actually we were giving demo for raju... that don't cram things and study
first he did engineering, then mba, and after that he went to america to work for a bank
if he had to work in a bank only, then why did he do engineering?
for such donkeys, life only means a profit or loss statement
he's seeing there's profit being with you, that's why he's with you
aare there are a lot of exams, but only one dad
now we'll take the post master sir and go only then!
but it is so for you, now you can wear ur mom's watch whenever you want!
nobody will say why have you worn an 18th century watch and all that!
except for an old watch on the hand, what does it mean?
on that day, you were missin your mom a lot, right?
aare yaar.. how can you leave him alone here and go!
i'm there, doctors are there, and it's only a matter of 3 hours
at least they are sitting in a corner now, if they continue being with you, next year they'll be out of the photo itself!
neither will they pass nor any company will give them jobs!
tracey couldn't get an appointment with phunsukh but i got rancho
i checked simla's phone directory, in that the name was chanchad rancchoddas
but i was waiting for the highway's tender to be opened
the tender opened over there and you closed your eyes over here!
he used to wear my old uniform and get into the school
whichever class he liked, he would go and sit in that one!
let it continue as it is, make this boy an engineer
rancchoddas chanchad's degree, i want it over there on that wall
i went away to london for four years and he kept studying in i.c.e. using my name
he had a deal with my dad that after getting a degree from i.c.e.
if we dont have a degree, we won't have a job!
if you don't have a job, no father will give his daughter's hand
bank won't give credit card, and the world won't respect us
but that idiot came to college, not for the degree but to study!
sir, suppose any student gets a job and he fails in the finals by 1-2 marks then will the job remain or?
very good question is there any other person, in whose mind, the same question is arising?
he wanted to go to him, go to hungary and learn, work from him!
but fearing his dad, due to hitler qureshi, he never posted the letter at all!
one for exam, one for sister's marriage and one for job
aare if you are you scared of the future do you think you can live?
he dies on pia and fears to tell go go, get lost
it's easy to give free advice dude but difficult to follow it
pia, the 22 minutes that i spent with you on the scooter those were the most beautiful 22 minutes of my life!
i can spend the rest of my life on the scooter with you
do you know, you come on scooter everyday wearing a bride's costume in my dreams!
instead of the veil, you take off your helmet and you come near me to kiss me
that means if it's a boy, then it's an engineer and if it's a girl, then it's a doctor
oye champ you stay inside itself, outside there's a lot of circus!
#......we wont let you go .......# #.......we shall not let you leave.......#
#.......even if god might summon you.......# #.....but we are not the one who fear him.....# #.....we are standing here in this ground with resolve.....#
#.....take out our eyes from our pal....# #....no matter how hard you try.....# #....we're not gonna let you leave lik this.....#
#......we wont let you go .......# #.......we shall not let you leave.......#
he forcibly made me put yours and mom's photo in this!
he started saying that promise me that whenever such stupid thoughts come to your mind see this photo and think what will happen to this smile when they see your dead body!
sir, today i haven't told god to get me this job
i just folded my hands and said thank you for this life
if you guys, if you guys even reject me today, then i don't have any regrets
because i believe i'll somehow do something worthy with my life sir!
see this very much frank behaviour of yours is not good for our company
we need a diplomatic person to handle the clients and you are way too straightforward!
everything is fair in love and war ok, just tell me one thing
do you really feel nose comes in between if you wanted to kiss?
whenever his daughters are getting married, we come off to ruin it!
ok listen, i'll handle pia, you pull out the price tag!
but today if you complete this marriage, you never forget that car was at the gate!
we had come to take you to rancho, but only because you feared from people
he had entered ravan's territory, to steal a question paper for raju search for a red sealed envelope ok come
he was very afraid, that if raju failed, he'll again go and do a high jump!
on that day, everyone was hugging each other, getting emotional and making promises
that we'll stay in touch, we'll surely meet up once in a year!

robin just thought it'd be better... because of what almost happened to his dad a couple of years ago... if the kid stayed out at the estate, and it'd be safer.
i mean, if you really think i would stoop so low... as to spy on my best friend's youth league team... in favor of strangers, of foreigners... then i'll leave.
i just want you to know, t.c... that it's going to be a long time before i'm able to forget this.
it's funny how when you get a bunch of adults... around a kid's game... it all of a sudden is not a game anymore.
and then when you have a kid who happens to be a prince involved... they really start playing for keeps.
look, i'm just a baseball coach... but i know danny pretty good... and i think you're both overreacting.
the kid runs away all the time and we always find him.
all the more reason a tighter rein should be kept on him.
look, you stick to the hit and run... and you, miss peardon... to the biology and practical math.
you mean, you learned to talk like that from television reruns.
will you let me watch the rest of the game with you?
now if you want to let me know what's going on, then maybe i can help.
otherwise, you got no right to come in here... and come down on me for watching a ball game with a little kid.
you haven't missed a game or a practice in over three years.
i know, but my folks need me to help out with my brothers and sister.
i got to get an extra job after school and on weekends.
and there just isn't going to be any time for me to play on the team.
that was playing with your friends... doing something that was fun and sharing it with your buddies.
now there's gonna be plenty of time for work and responsibility... and you're going to get your share of it.
well... first of all, you're going to have to stop looking so disgusted.
and then second, you're going to have to stay late after practice tomorrow... and help me get rid of some newspapers.
for your information, ice pick and i got a gentleman's wager.
and furthermore, we both agreed that whoever wins... kicks into the oahu orphans home.
since when would i turn down a free luau... to do some work back at the estate?
and since when would i be worrying... about something that everybody in no uncertain terms... told me wasn't my case?
i guess they want me to get used... to having dudes trying to off me.
so i don't need to hear the same jive from you, okay?
i think you may be the only person around here... who's really my friend.
and i know you're the only person around here... with an al kaline glove.
get those suckers right up there on the porch... where the people don't have to... walk outside to the sidewalk and get them.
and then they don't get all wet when the sprinklers come on.

i mean, you'll find that most folks generally have more problems than... you've ever even thought of.
i'm gonna show you how i used to do it when i was a kid.
of course, we had to do it on a bicycle... but anyway...
higgins, in all likelihood, some more of those crazies... are gonna try and get at danny at the ball game tomorrow.
now, there's only so much that russler... or any 800 cops can do about it.
yeah, and i think we flew over just about all of them.
plus the whole town's been up half the night looking for him.
but whatever your game... you could always count on one thing in places like these.
you could, in the space of a couple of hours, temporarily escape... and forget the problems of the outside world.
i mean, if you really think i would stoop so low... as to spy on my best friend's youth league team... in favor of strangers, of foreigners... then i'll leave.
i just want you to know, t.c... that it's going to be a long time before i'm able to forget this.
i mean, i wondered if little danny played... with a batting helmet or a crown.
or if things didn't go his way... would he just take his country and go home?
look, if you're bugged at what i said about your pad... i'm sorry, okay?
i guess everybody's got to make do with what they've got.
look, i'm just a baseball coach... but i know danny pretty good... and i think you're both overreacting.
the kid runs away all the time and we always find him.
all the more reason a tighter rein should be kept on him.

i know, but my folks need me to help out with my brothers and sister.
i got to get an extra job after school and on weekends.
you know... i don't think you're going to make it unless you have a chance to be a kid.
you know when i was growing up... i knew a lot of kids that had to work to help their families out.
that was playing with your friends... doing something that was fun and sharing it with your buddies.
now there's gonna be plenty of time for work and responsibility... and you're going to get your share of it.
well... first of all, you're going to have to stop looking so disgusted.

(magnum) one of the nice things... about living in paradise is that... no matter how tough or confusing things get... you can always escape into the water.
its warmth goes right through you... cleansing away your troubles... sometimes making you feel just like a kid again.
now, i asked them to let me talk to you... because you're the only person around here... that makes any sense.
i think you may be the only person around here... who's really my friend.

and these days, a iot of kids lose themselves in computer explosions... of lights and sounds.
but whatever your game... you could always count on one thing in places like these.
so one day, we all went to see this family therapist,
and with his encouragement, i decided to take this little trip.
-it upsets me to see you and george arguing all the time.
-i'm afraid there isn't much that you can do about that.
then why you don't stay with us, in azah's old room?
-i don't think it would be a good idea for us to become...
it's with this in mind that i've decided to remain here.
i realize that this is going to come as a shock to you,
which will help to give you some idea of their background.
as you'll see, there's a ghost member that i'm dealing with here:
you were in town all day yesterday and you didn't call me once!
this one goes up, that one goes up, around my neck in a hug!
then i realized, you're such a cheap son of a bitch, you probably wouldn't satisfy my sense of right or wrong.
what i want is either 25,000 in cash now, on the table, or 10,000 a month for the next four months.
i'm not running around for his cigarettes while he strokes you.
i'm not waiting in the car... while he does whatever he does to you.

the greatest visionary of the cinema as his friend maeterlinck called him no doubt way ahead of his time finds himself obliged to toe the line
gance limits himself to make worthy films but none has the vision brilliance of napoleon 13 00:01:25,985 -- 00:01:29,550 the triple screen and polyvision are soon a fading memory
however in the 80s the napoleon comet begins to shine again first at the telluride festival then london, new york, los angeles, rome,
tokyo, and finally paris are dazzled and rediscover an almost complete version of napoleon by abel gance of over 5 hours patiently reconstructed in the uk by kevin brownlow with the collaboration of the british film institute and the cinémathèque française.
through exceptional documents of the period, we will relive some privileged moments of the filming of napoleon which convey an enthusiasm and a creative joy rarely seen since.
but first let us go back to the 25th of june 1925 to listen to the voice of abel gance himself, his famous proclamation to the technicians artists of the studio de billancourt.
"we have to ensure, and please understand the profound meaning i impart to the words that this film enables us to enter into the temple of the arts through the immense gate of history
an indescribable anguish overcomes me at the thought that my will and the very gift of life are meaningless if you don't all give me your utmost devotion at all times
thanks to you we shall bring the revolution the empire back to life the task is enormous.
you have to find in yourselves the fire, the madness, the power, the talent and the sacrifice of the soldiers of that time.
to all of you and especially to you humble extras who will bear the burden of recreating the spirit of your ancestors and with your hearts joined together paint 80 00:04:44,130 -- 00:04:48,430 the fearful portrait of france between 1792 1815,
i ask you, or rather i demand that you tforget your petty personal problems and give me your complete commitment only thus will you piously serve the already illustrious cause of the most beautiful art of the future through the most wonderful of the pages of history"
it must be an actor as in life itself suffering with the wounded, fighting with the soldiers and leading the troops with the generals
it must involve itself so completely with the drama so that inspiration becomes a collective process.
"i was interested in the character because he was larger than life in his time which was also an exceptional moment in history".
he shoots some scenes with the director lupu pick, of some classics like la nuit de la saint-sylvestre le rail
dressed as bonaparte, he appears in the middle of the night at fontainebleau castle, where gance is working on the script
he asks the guard, who is visibly terrified to call the director.
the old man obeys and stuttering tells gance that the phantom of napoleon is at the gate !
intrigued, gance walks out and in a décor of the period lit by ghostly candles, he finds what seems to be a reincarnation of bonaparte
and a beginner, suzanne charpentier, will play violine, a young woman who falls in love with bonaparte but will never declare her love.
suzanne charpentier that gance renames annabella, as a homage to annabel lee by edgar alan poe, whom he deeply admires
from all these images he releases a frenzy, a joy of creating rarely reached since.
i was trying to make the screen explode by all possible means
i demanded from my operators to use the camera to create all the imaginable pyrotechnics
i wanted the camera to walk with man and run with the horse slide with the sledge, climb, descend, turn around, trip at all times
nowadays this seems banal, but at that time the cinema wasn't used to jumps starts
gance asks the engineer simon feldman to construct a camera capable of making a 360º turn
i start shooting on wednesday, at 4 h 52 the camera starts rolling
technique: all of brienne in layers of shades of white like the winter day in which it takes place, clear, lucid, nervous, sharp and funny.
there is cinema and the art of cinema which has yet to create its neologism
he is inside a little fort, he gives some orders and then he orders someone who holds a stick to lift and lower the hat as if someone was under it.
the vertiginous vision of the 4th dimension of life was accelerating and slowing down.
the cinema becomes the work of an alchemist from which we can expect the transmutation of all the other arts.
if we are able the touch the heart, the metronome of cinema is like the formal tragedies of the xviith century
indeed we will have to apply strict rules to the cinema of the future
cervantes says this admirable phrase to sancho through the words of don quixote:
"alas here is life my friend, only it's not half as interesting as the one we see in the theatre"
what a sublime defence of art in general and particularly of our art.
just as reflections of fire on a copper pot is more beautiful than the fire itself, the image of a mountain more beautiful in its reflection on ice, the image of life is more beautiful on screen than life itself.
in this sequence the cook tristan fleury appears placed by nicolas koline.
totally devoted to the young bonaparte, his destiny will be intertwined with napoleon's from the terror in paris to the siege in toulon 281 00:16:29,057 -- 00:16:31,893 and even in the italian army of which he was part.
ah !" said the teacher, i was forgetting a little piece of land of no importance lost in the middle of the ocean, write "saint-helena, small island".
he no long responds to the children stamping their feet but seems lost in a dream
"the image only exists as a representation of the strength of its creator, that is the secret that no critic seems to have understood.
there lies the wonderful psychic aspect of the cinema that is being born.
here again the camera is tightly strapped to the operator's chest, the steadycam points its nose, pushed by simon feldman.
under the hilarious looks of the crew, the cameraman mundwiller`s eyes seem as angry as bonaparte's.
never has a work of art better demonstrated its omnipotence in space and time.
an inclined platform is built to enable the camera to descend the staircase.
a corsican militia composed of, one has to add, authentic djigit cossacks hired for the occasion.
the onlookers, curious and filled with passion, follow the crew everywhere and complicate the shooting conditions even more,
the weather was against us, an average of one sunny day out of three.
upon arriving i caught the flu followed by a nervous depression.
on the other hand, the fact that dieudonné was a bad horsemen influenced me.
and naturally, gance demands, requires, obtains that a camera be fixed on a horses back.
i am dangerous and interesting in all ways depending on whether my pistol is loaded.
the horse accident of which pozzo di borgo, played by chakatouny, is the victim, causes a halt in the shooting schedule.
he loves giving an audience to journalists, pretty women and people from show business, in between committing some more or less bloody crime.
the embraces seem to go on for ever, under the vigilant eyes of romanetti's bodyguards.
we are drenched and dieudonné, after an hour's work refuses to continue and leaves grumbling, saying he won't shoot water scenes in such awful weather.
"i think the scenes are beautiful but i'm going to catch a cold
"i will return the flag says bonaparte to pozzo di borgo who, seething with rage, watches him drift away..
and while in paris, montagnards and girondins furiously fight, another huge storm breaks over bonaparte's boat.
and now miraculously saved by another ship that gance christens "fate", and where by coincidence, his brothers joseph and lucien are,
bonaparte slowly pulls himself together... under the attentive gaze of the "master".
meanwhile, in the corsican scrub the rest of the family flees exhausted, towards the beach at aspretto, where bonaparte has arranged to meet them.
the shepherds are there to defend them as danger is still close.
at the first gunshot pretend to be hysterical at the second one, cry...
at the third one the fugitives run towards the sea to reach the boat
on the now becalmed sea, the sailboat glides silently taking bonaparte towards his destiny.
"an eagle is perched at the top of the huge mast."
and the exceptional quality of the filmed sequences, the film requires such a huge investment that napoleon is in an ailing state.
one by one, the investors pull out, the diary shows little optimism
" 21th june 1925, the situation of napoleon is extremely serious:
"crash of the stinnes bank, edmond and hugo are now rivals,
at the end of 1925, napoleon rises again, but at the price of many concessions .
abel gance no longer has financial control, but he is at the height of his creative genius and shoots feverishly in the studio the scenes of the siege of toulon, and the birth of la marseillaise, the double storm of the convention.
every day people come from everywhere, curious to see the studio where napoleon is being filmed.
they arrive with a smile on their lips and chatting as though at the music-hall, but leave more often than not pensive and serious even meditative at times, as though a hidden god suddenly opened the golden gates for them.
they have witnessed close-up how drama is created, with more sadness and suffering than reality itself 504 00:45:25,125 -- 00:45:28,125 can bring into our lives and how with faith
one can transform a studio into a real church of light.
it's in the scenes of the terror that gance lays bare his personal vision of napoleon.
a man in perpetual conflict between the revolutionary who wants a peaceful revolution and who has to wage war with the fallacious hope of establishing a long lasting peace..
"in this film i will not judge or comment on the evolution of bonaparte after the italian campaign.
after the 18 brumaire, i could even be one of his detractors.
my bonaparte remains in the ranks of idealistic republicans of which christ was the first example.
thus as an idealist, he speaks up against the hideous massacres of the hostages in toulon"
of this sequence, one the most extraordinary of the film, only a few photographs remain..
the reels where lost and to this day have never been found.
thankfully this is not the case of the scenes in the prison of carmes, shot in the studio, with the same sets, which would also be used for the scene of "the victims ball".
by dint of playing with fire, a serious accident will considerably upset the shooting schedule.
then comes the shooting of the club des cordelier scenes, the birth of the la marseillaise and the convention.
gance is everywhere... worrying about the smallest prop, about every technical detail, the precise gestures of his actors, for which he mimes the very scene.
the singer damia gives life to the spirit of la marseillaise.
the writer jean harois, who is following the shooting, describes in a passionate book the director's working methods:
could you sing la marseillaise 12 times in a row in crescendo"
so a thousand extras, most of them hired from the strikers of the renault factory nearby, fascinated and enchanted, sing la marseillaise 12, 15, 20 times.
the inverting of images has the magic power of taking us back to a transcendental form of mathematics:
the open gates of poetry that necessarily fill any work of art.
these movements of movements create a sensory euphoria in the measure that the physical, physiological, psychological and psychic relation between the images will harmoniously blend in a moment in time.
the divining rod is present in every camera and the eye of merlin the sorcerer is inside every lens.
those who don't believe in the immortality of their soul punish themselves", said robespierre
thus those who don't believe in cinema will never see what they are capable of seeing, and will dispute the evidence of a great film.
in response to the public's enthusiasm, napoleon is projected ten times, with the triptychs, in a version reduced to 3 h 15 m.
a month later, a longer version but without the triptychs, is presented in paris in two parts.
gance protests, rages, tries to take them to court... in vain.
having lost control of the production he is unable to stop the massacre
thus, this immense effort invested in the creation of a masterpiece comes to a dead end..
then from the depth of his energy and sensitivity a string seems to break.
which means that tomorrow i could be shakespeare, perrault or dante
why should i remain smiling letting useless flowers fall from my hands?
fabulous creative resources that after 1927 he never put to full use.
but apart from the personal tragedy of the artist, which is immense, men ask prometheus for fire and think little of the state of his liver !
gance, with his napoleon has brought us fire from the pages of history.
a16 00:59:06,446 -- 00:59:09,424 for some artists are like stars :
it took an average of 5 hours, 15 minutes for the balloons to fall.
in other words, the balloon that fell in mrs. hudson's garden... flew that much time from somewhere.
yes, my wife and i live here alone, there's no one else.
did anyone visit the island, or have you seen anything unusual?
a golden statue of an angel was stolen by professor moriarty.
holmes begins his investigation as seven tiny faces appear before him.
holmes and the boys start an adventure... to recover the statue from an abandoned boat.
if you ever find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
first kirby's sickness, then losing her child, and kidnapping of the horse, and now, finally, this terrible thing about adam.
i tell you, darling, i really don't know what i'd do without you.
okay, well, you've had your say along with just about eveybody else.
so i'd appreciate it if you'd just leave me alone so i could finish what i have to do here.
- like this... lf anything, i've picked up on a few pointers since that last fantastic night.
and you're going to show me evey single one of them, like now.
well, is the aging, if still attractive, boy reporter jeremy thatcher interested?
or would you like to catch the next flight back to your trendy new york pad tonight?
yes, but the last time you gave me a hot tip, i nearly got burned.
if you think you're gonna get any sympathy from me, you can forget it.
but i ty to get back here evey day about this time to be with our son.
look, i know i'm going to be the last one to be let in on the big news, but why don't we change that for once and let me know up front?
- well, he rambled a bit at first, saying that you might blame him for allegree being kidnapped that night.
but i kept pushing him, and i got the feeling that there was somebody he was afraid of.
but i did get him to talk about the wine that he had drunk that night.
and i told the police that he had a little, like a couple of glasses.
someone's been sending her violets, with the card and the name "lancelot."
matthew blaisdel used to send her violets when they were first married.
you've expressed your dislike for her, to put it mildly, on more than one occasion.
you've constantly referred to her paranoia and her having been in a mental institution twice.
you haven't acknowledged, ever, how beautifully she's come through all of this.
how good a mother she is to danny and a wife she is to me-
find dex dexter and tell him it's important that i see him, right now.
and when adam comes in, you interrupt anything i'm involved in, you understand?
you may not know this about sam dexter, your old and good friend.
once, after a drink too many, he told me that he'd had a thing with alexis when you were still married to her.
so what i suggest that you do is to take those cards and letters and bring them to the police.
but steven threw away the first box, and what good would it do to bring the other one?
i tried to tell you on the telephone that it was a personal matter.
alexis, in the past, i've accused you of a lot of things.
perhaps what adam needs is not more punishment, but more love and help.
i ask your forgiveness again, alexis, and i thank you. i... i thank you vey much for helping me.
i have vey strong feelings for you, darling, but i'm just not ready for marriage.
i want our relationship to go on just the way it's been going.
you know, really, your opinions have absolutely nothing to do with me.
so why don't you go and show off your legs on the tennis court?
i checked out that garbage myself a little while ago with maria-elena.
and she told me the truth about why your fiancé walked out on her.
my guess is that she tried to trap him and he refused to be trapped.
oh, fallon, i suggest that you be vey sure of that.
what if he wanted you to leave little blake and let off around the world just with you and him?
you and jeff ought to cut a record of that together.
so i suggest vey strongly that you check him out again to make sure it's true.
or is my oh, so independent daughter afraid that it just might be true?
"she is really only the spoiled wife of a tycoon playing at being a career lady.
when her lavish wedding present was stolen, she cried on her wealthy husband's shoulder to buy him back secretly, without bringing in the police."
kystle, there has got to be somebody in this town who wants to see you embarrassed.
if you have any idea who it is, i would be happy to go after him or her and take whatever comes.
come on, fallon, would you get serious once and listen to me?
i think the person that stole allegree was his half owner.
and i also think that jack crager, one of his trainers, at de vilbis' orders drugged tony and took off with the horse while he was unconscious.
you of course have proof of all of this deep thinking of yours?
i am sick and tired of you and my mother inventing garbage against the man i happened to be in love with.
i finally find a little happiness and eveybody's tying to destroy it.

my name is "nakai", too, but the students call me komako.
i wanted to show them how we place the nets around here, but they said they didn't want to see that.
i then offered them a feast and bed for the night, but again they refused my offer.
as you can see, i'm not a fine figure of a man.
three long years ago, i left this town... and travelled far, like a migrating bird.
i did, hοwever, leave a message with his hοusekeeper, whο said she cοuld cοntact him.
i have nο dοubt that he will be here fοr lunch, as requested.
uncle mark said it was οne way οut, anyway, and mummy said, "yes, but it was sο hοrrible."
and uncle mark said he didn't see the pοint in being hypοcritical.
well, i think it's abοut the best line we have at the mοment.
there is the financial mοtive, but at this stage it lοοks as if mrs jeffersοn and gaskell have a cast-irοn alibi.
she knows the world only through the prism of that village and its daily life.

we think pamela may have stumbled acrοss sοmething that made her tοο dangerοus fοr the murderer.
dο yοu think yοu feel up tο answering sοme questiοns, sir?
accοrding tο yοur first statement, when yοu repοrted her missing at ηarοld rοad,
pamela left westcliff tο attend a guide's rally in danemοuth and yοu expected her hοme fοr supper?
the heart rug was a a patterned οriental sοrt οf thing.
that dress she was wearing had sοme lοng hairs stuck tο it, apparently.
it may be that she hοped tο dο well οut οf this business οf her adοptiοn.
to get back tο cοnway, what dο yοu suppοse sparked οff this infatuatiοn with the girl?
why did yοu refer tο mrs bantry as "pοοr dοlly" this afternοοn?
it seems tο me that this may be the sοrt οf crime that never gets resοlved, like the brightοn trunk murders.
yοu and i have never gοt οn well in the past, have we?
thanks fοr the οffer and all that, but i can't see that situatiοn changing, can yοu?
i remember one night, we were doing the supper dishes and she said to me:
"mommy, when i grow up, do you think i'll be as beautiful as fallon carrington, even close?"
now, those are good people, all of them, out of work.
i should be trying to help them get their jobs back again, but i can't.
we shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump.
for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible.
may the soul of fallon carrington colby, betrothed of jeffrey colby,
mother of blake jeffrey colby, daughter of blake carrington and alexis colby,
but the memories don't go away, no matter where you live.
blake, what matters to me is that we have each other.
are you sure you're that skinny little thing that used to run up these stairs and say to me,
"aunt bessie, if you're cooking chicken, can i have the drumstick?"
in the big mansion which may not belong to the carringtons much longer.
well, enjoy the mansion and the kid for as long as you can.
and each of you went out of your way to help me adjust by your kindness and your understanding.
which makes it all the more difficult for me to ask you to understand now why we have to let you go, temporarily.
gerard will give you each a cheque covering your salaries for the next month.
i hope with all my heart that you'll be back with us soon.
blake, one night some time ago, in front of those people, you told them that it was mrs. carrington who ran this house and no one else.
well, i did what i had to do, at least for the time being.
doctor man will surely make all efforts to recover the boy.

the heritage of japanese katanas will be added to the new empire gear's science to create the most powerful sword!

a meteorite heading towards the earth affects the brains of the biomen.
the new empire gear takes this opportunity to launch an attack.
the bio robo is also saddened by the death of yellow four.
the are 9 with terantulas and we are only we are only 4!
they allow us to transform into biomen in a split second.{let's see their transformation process once more}
do you really think we could let you turn this world into ashes?
it appears that doctor man is an extraordinarily terrifying demonic scientist.
the passionate and courageous biomen are the only ones who can stand up to his demonic science.
so we turned that room of that building into a teleportation device.
that's how we could teleport directly from this factory at mt.
jellyfish-kans's head sends out a powerful electrical energy to the black hole bombs.
and it won't stop until all of tokyo is absorbed in.
the peace of tokyo has been saved by the great efforts of the biomen!
doctor man's wrath burns bright for new terrifying strategies towards the earth.
my plan is to use piranha-kans's chaos beam to destroy nuclear submarines from opposing countries.
we will use this in order to trigger a conflict with another nation.
the technology from planet bio is thousands of years ahead of earth's!
it is true that the technology from planet bio is astonishing.
it was at these training grounds that i noticed your talent.
i knew you'd come here as long as you were continuing archery.
you have chosen a fight more difficult than the path to the olympics.
this must be the fate of those who fight at the cost of their own lives.
i wanted to create a mecha giant to suit my own taste.
and it looks like he made you do the experiments for it.
he head back to the bio robot with his bio mach 1.
i am a member of the big three of the new gear empire - the powerful monster!
the proof seems to be that i can talk with animals.{crazy fuck}
i have within me the power of bio particles entrusted by the people of {the planet}bio!
it looks like this is going to be a long battle.
dr. man has made the decision to engage in mortal combat.
it is said that strange memories and happenings are present in the unconsciousness of their descendants.
doctor man will use a memory regeneration machine to revive the memories of jiro urashima.
i never thought that super electron brain would give you a headache!
we'll have our revenge on you for everything you made us go through!
this is why i created a new type of mecha giant.
i don't care what happens to the beastnoids if it means we can defeat the biomen.
but the biomen can't stay cheerful forever.{meaning something might go wrong soon}
how can they face the new mecha giants that are capable of destroying the super maser?
there is no doubt dr. man will take advantage of the situation now that he has hikaru as a hostage.
they will make a lot of spiders and spread throughout japan!
and then i will be the ruler of that vice city!
mecha giant mummy-kans cannot be seen without wearing these filtered glasses.
when he can sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth, with one mighty gesture of his hand.
if our lord wasn't testing us, how would you account for the proliferation these days of this obscene rock and roll music with its gospel of easy sexuality and relaxed morality?
some kids snuck over the state line a year ago to see a rock 'n' roll group.
they were stopped on their way back into town by the police.
"that comes from knowing that all our lives are tied up with each other's."
"that we feel all the same joys, the same sorrows, and that we care."
the council has no intention of granting a small group of students' wishes.
eleanor and i are absolutely certain that this boy is organising a dance.
this is my fight, with the town, not with one guy.
you can't turn my fight into some "screw you" to your old man.
all right, virginia, i guess that ends the discussion on this issue.
so the price of a dog licence will go from $3.50 to $4.50:
even if this was not a law, which it is... ..i'm afraid i would have a lot of difficulty endorsing an enterprise which is as fraught with genuine peril as i believe this one to be.
besides the liquor and the drugs, which always seem to accompany such an event, the thing that distresses me even more, ren,
i just wanted to say a few words about this motion, so that you wouldn't think that we were encouraging destruction with this idea.
from the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
they danced in prayer, or so that their crops would be plentiful, or so their hunt would be good.
and they danced to stay physically fit and show their community spirit.
a time to mourn... and there is a time to dance.
there was a time for this law, but not any more.
and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth.
and to the angel was given the key to the bottomless pit.
and he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace.
and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
and, like that parent... ..i find myself at that moment when i have to decide...
..do i hold on, or do i trust you to yourselves?
if we don't start trusting our children how will they ever become trustworthy?
i'm told that the senior class at the high school has got use of a warehouse in bayson for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
if he wasn't testing us... how would you account... for the sorry state of our society... for the crimes... that plague the big cities of this country... when he could sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth... with one mighty gesture of his hand?
if our lord wasn't testing us, how would you account... for the proliferation these days... of this obscene rock and roll music... with its gospel of easy sexuality... and relaxed morality?
she's biting my neck, and i'm trying to get over the stick shift... 'cause we're goin' like a freight train now.
all of a sudden, she starts screaming at the top of her lungs...
i never did think he had all his dogs barking anyway.
besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over ren?
i was down in denver last year... for about a week at a bible convention.
and the whole time i was there, people would come up... and ask me, "reverend, how can you live in such a small town..."
if you could just once, just for one minute... experience the feeling of family that comes from knowing... that all of our lives are tied up with each of us.
that we feel all the same joys... the same sorrows, and that we care.
i'll watch you guys, see if you can show me something new.
we didn't come all this way just to sit it out.
'bout five years ago... these kids were playing highway tag and they were drunk.
one car hits the other one, and they both go over the bridge.
i don't understand why you feel it necessary to lie to me.
i don't know why you find it necessary to check up on me.
i want you to tell me it ain't so, mr. chicago big shot.
he heard you're gonna try and throw a dance at school.
reverend moore, mrs. evans is calling about that dance at school.
would you tell her i'll call her back after junior bible?
this is my fight, it's with the town, not with one guy.
you don't get to turn my fight into a "screw you" to your old man.
you talk like that's the only thing that gets them excited.
don't you remember when we used to look at each other and get excited?
i'm afraid i would have difficulty endorsing an enterprise... which is as fraught with genuine peril... as i believe this one to be.
besides liquor and drugs, which seem to accompany such an event... the thing that distresses me even more, ren... is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
"from the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons."

i just don't know that i believe in everything you believe in... but i believe in you.
i'm standing up here before you today... with a very troubled heart.
do i hold on... or do i trust you to yourselves?
let go and hope that you've understood... at least some of my lessons.
if we don't start trusting our children... how will they ever become trustworthy?
i'm told that the senior class at the high school... has got use of the warehouse in bayson... for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
if our lord wasn't testing us, how would you account... for the proliferation these days... of this obscene rock and roll music... with its gospel of easy sexuality... and relaxed morality?
if our lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take all... these pornographic books and albums... and turn them into one big fiery cinder like that!
if we could get one to dance, just one, then that was it.
we'd get out on the floor and we'd really start to smoke.
i'm off 'cause they don't have funds for one more gymnast, but thank you.
i'm busting my balls trying to fit in and every door slams in my face.
and the whole time i was there, people would come up... and ask me, "reverend, how can you live in such a small town... so far away from the hustle and bustle of the 20th century?"
i'd say to them, "you'd never ask me that... if you could just once, just for one minute... experience the feeling of family that comes from knowing... that all of our lives are tied up with each of us.
roger, the town council has no intention of bowing... to wishes of a small group of students.
eleanor and i are absolutely certain that this boy is organizing a dance.
and i've been quiet, supportive, unobtrusive and... after 20 years i still think you're a wonderful preacher.
you can lift a congregation up so high... they have to look down to see heaven.
reverend, if you'll excuse my saying so... when we got rid of that young english teacher at the school... we didn't get any support from you.
because i didn't think we had any grounds for his dismissal.
that's one more thing ariel is not going to forgive me for, but...
can you step out of the way enough to realize she's doing this for you?
my business was off, but people are taking business away from me.
your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls and today your mother lost her job.
i just wanted to say a few words about this motion... so that you wouldn't think that we were... encouraging destruction with this idea.

besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over ren?
i was down in denver last year... for about a week at a bible convention.
and the whole time i was there, people would come up... and ask me, "reverend, how can you live in such a small town... so far away from the hustle and bustle of the 20th century?"
i'd say to them, "you'd never ask me that... if you could just once, just for one minute... experience the feeling of family that comes from knowing... that all of our lives are tied up with each of us.
that we feel all the same joys... the same sorrows, and that we care.
i'll watch you guys, see if you can show me something new.
we didn't come all this way just to sit it out.
'bout five years ago... these kids were playing highway tag and they were drunk.
one car hits the other one, and they both go over the bridge.
i don't understand why you feel it necessary to lie to me.
i don't know why you find it necessary to check up on me.
i want you to tell me it ain't so, mr. chicago big shot.
he heard you're gonna try and throw a dance at school.
reverend moore, mrs. evans is calling about that dance at school.
would you tell her i'll call her back after junior bible?
this is my fight, it's with the town, not with one guy.
you don't get to turn my fight into a "screw you" to your old man.
you talk like that's the only thing that gets them excited.
don't you remember when we used to look at each other and get excited?
i'm afraid i would have difficulty endorsing an enterprise... which is as fraught with genuine peril... as i believe this one to be.
besides liquor and drugs, which seem to accompany such an event... the thing that distresses me even more, ren... is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
"from the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
they danced in prayer... or so that their crops would be plentiful... or so their hunt would be good.
and he opened the bottomless pit... and there arose a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace.
and the sun and air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit".
i find myself at that moment when i have to decide.
do i hold on... or do i trust you to yourselves?
let go and hope that you've understood... at least some of my lessons.
if we don't start trusting our children... how will they ever become trustworthy?
i'm told that the senior class at the high school... has got use of the warehouse in bayson... for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
please... join me to pray to the lord... to guide them in their endeavors.
if he wasn't testing us, how would you account for the sorry state of our society, for the crimes that plague the big cities of this country?
when he can sweep this pestilence from the face of the earth, with one mighty gesture of his hand.
i welcome this challenge from my lord, so that one day i can deliver all of you unto his hands.
and when that day dawns, i don't want to have to do any explaining.
i took care of all that last week, registered him and everything.
vi, i made you some of those tollhouse squares i promised.
if we could get one of them to dance, that was it.
we'd get on the floor and really start to smoke, cutting in on each other, and these girls would stop whatever they were doing, and look.
- what i have been telling you, about the trouble and the drugs.
you seem to be having trouble since you moved here and i figured...
no, i'm off the team 'cause they don't have the funds for one more gymnast this year, but thanks anyway.
i'm trying to fit in and every door is slammed in my face.
i'd say to them, 'you'd never ask me that' 'if you could, just for one minute, experience the feeling of family' 'that comes from knowing that all our lives are tied up with each other's.'
'that we feel all the same joys, the same sorrows, and that we care.'
the council has no intention of granting a small group of students' wishes.
eleanor and i are absolutely certain that this boy is organising a dance.
this is my fight, with the town, not with one guy.
you can't turn my fight into some 'screw you' to your old man.
all right, virginia, i guess that ends the discussion on this issue.
so the price of a dog licence will go from $3.50 to $4.50:
even if this was not a law, which it is i'm afraid i would have a lot of difficulty endorsing an enterprise which is as fraught with genuine peril as i believe this one to be.
besides the liquor and the drugs, which always seem to accompany such an event, the thing that distresses me even more, ren, is the spiritual corruption that can be involved.
from the oldest of times, people danced for a number of reasons.
they danced in prayer, or so that their crops would be plentiful, or so their hunt would be good.
boy, when are you gonna wake up and smell the coffee?
shaw moore walked into that meeting with them votes already in his pocket.
i beheld and heard an angel, flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, 'woe, woe, woe to the inhabitors of the earth.'
and i saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth.
and to the angel was given the key to the bottomless pit.
and he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace.
but i'm really like a first-time parent who makes mistakes and tries to learn from them.
and, like that parent i find myself at that moment when i have to decide do i hold on, or do i trust you to yourselves?
if we don't start trusting our children how will they ever become trustworthy?
i'm told that the senior class at the high school has got use of a warehouse in bayson for the purpose of putting on a senior dance.
if our lord wasn't testing us, how would you account... for the proliferation these days... of this obscene rock and roll music... with its gospel of easy sexuality... and relaxed morality?
if our lord wasn't testing us, why, he could take all... these pornographic books and albums... and turn them into one big fiery cinder like that!
if we could get one to dance, just one, then that was it.
we'd get out on the floor and we'd really start to smoke.
i never did think he had all his dogs barking anyway.
besides, what is wrong about getting a little psyched over ren?

you directors get so worried when somebody tries to take your picture over.
i still want you at the dailies, but stay off the soundstage.
'cause going and getting rid of it could've been a sin, right?

look at the virtually nonexistent careers of a dorothy stratten or a frances farmer.

average age of death, average age of marriage, average age of pregnancy.
use this equation to compute the population of china in the year 2040.
"take a spider off his web and shut him up inside two shells of a nut.
now boil the nut in oil into which has been added some of the web.
maybe you should let that thing out of its box, you know.

we've always been very proud of old captain wayne and his yankee gumption.
and nobody cares that he fought on the side of the british in the revolutionary war?
every time he doesn't know what to do he starts to clear his throat.
i've never told him about that little habit, 'cause i play poker with him too.
oh, there's not a chance he'd ever go back to woodley.
you know, after they fired him, they tried to keep his plans and designs.
i've got so many bug bites, i don't know where to start scratching'.
bugs didn't have any trouble finding us, but we didn't spot that car.
then about 5:30, after six hours of searching everywhere except the barbershop,
amos finally tells us where he really thinks the car is.
bless his pointy little head... is convinced that the car was hidden in that van.
that doesn't make any sense because the next day that very same car ran down mr. merrill.
i'm sorry, but i don't think the car ever reached the highway.
did you look around that stretch of woods just east of the old gentry farm?
some phantom car... that could be halfway to newfoundland by now.
you and i know that that car was not swallowed up in any moving van.
all i know is that my budget is in desperate trouble, and i don't plan to get myself in the same condition.
then you don't mind if i look around on my own?
i'm afraid, ma'am, i'm gonna have to bring him in for questioning.
daniel, i just want you to know that i don't believe a word of this.
if you, uh, ask me, this whole thing is kind of screwy.
but, uh, i don't argue with her when she gets set on somethin'.
tell me, leslie, whatever made you rush to this particular vehicle?
well, i thought i could drive it onto the field and block that station wagon before it hit anyone.
i saw the mileage when you rented the car, and i saw the current mileage.
and a little simple subtraction... told me that no way could you have made those trips.
it was the speed of the driverless car that bothered me.
i mean, mr. woodley managed to stay ahead of it all the way... from the outfield to home plate.
speaking of which, may i offer a toast to the two ladies in my life?
to the one who just saved my life... and to the other who's been saving it for years, only i was too preoccupied to notice.
but i'll move heaven and earth to get you to stay on here with me.
i'm sorry to eat and run, jess, but they're having a tournament on that arcade game, and since i am the current record holder,
well, he told sherifftupper that you had invited him and his partner to come up and visit.
jessica, the only thing i'd invite woodley and merrill to would be to a hanging party.
nobody knows 'cause nobody saw it, but a little while ago...
ernie tatum's kids saw that same station wagon heading' north on... thank you...
i've never told him about that little habit, 'cause i play poker with him too.
well, i'll do what i can, ethan, providing he wants me to help.
now, daniel, mr. woodley is still insisting that you called him and invited him up here.
[sighs] jess, if i had, don't you think i would've remembered it?
each one is a miniature ultrahigh-efficiency amplifier, controlled by this transmitter.
the ultrasonic sound should frighten the aphids into somebody else's yard.
now, remember, jessie, there were no witnesses except the tatum kids, and they could've made a mistake.
i'm sorry, but i don't think the car ever reached the highway.
if you jogged every morning like i do, you'd learn something.
there are at least a dozen ways in and out, if you know where to look.
the rumor is the company is in financial trouble, despite the big contract they just landed.
strange the partners should show up here in cabot cove when they're in financial difficulty.
the lawyer tony got wants me to undergo a psychiatric examination.
i think he's laying the groundwork for a plea of temporary insanity.
ms. fletcher thought it might be best if you were here.
if you, uh, ask me, this whole thing is kind of screwy.
yesterday i wondered why tony had to buy so little gas, so i peeked at the car rental agreement.
i saw the mileage when you rented the car, and i saw the current mileage.
well, not then it wasn't, but according to woodley's confession, it was the key to a multimillion-dollar contract they'd just landed.
the simple way, of course, would have been to kill you.
when the potato blooms it has a small blossom like a violet - with a yellow dot.
with these hands i dig up the fruit of the lovelies flower in the world.
you're envious 'cause i did a reader school kids have been using for 10 years.
professor jirasek used to come here and say that this mineral water was the healthiest in central europe.
i was taking a pork-feast to friends, the soup can tipped over
i tried to save it drove into a ditch and upturned the car and nothing happened except my hair was full of barley.
then we cleaned the car all day the yolks were drying all over the sun was scorching and the stink for two months that car stank like the local mineral water.
so i can only give lifts to my chums, any stranger would think i'd shit my trousers.
- it extinguished in the school that belongs to both villages!
- the school is common but the hunting grounds are ours!
and she did not think of anything else yeah, yeah, yeah.
i have to add yeah, yeah, yeah, that she hot combs her curls...

midnight tripe soup must be stirred until it cools or it settles and then we could give it to the pigs,
"one dead man is sometimes better than a thousand live ones."
our dear varlam had many virtues, it's hard to enumerate them all.
yes, he's a warm-hearted man, he did not abandon me in my time of misery.
abel, do you see those brightly lit windows beyond the cemetery?
that's what you're guilty of, that's the fact of the crime.
yes, i dug him up from the grave, but i don't plead guilty.
therefore, we'll have to conduct both a hearing and an investigation, and, certainly, pass the verdict, right here.
that's why i ask this court to listen carefully to the defendant.
by almost superhuman efforts he had forged a weapon of his own social enslavement and destruction of his personality.
the situation even reached a point where the political authorities had muzzled him.
has the time really passed when the scientist's intellectual freedom and independent research could enlighten and enrich people's lives?
has he forgotten, in his blind quest for the scientific truth, about his moral responsibility before humanity and about his honour?
our world is under threat of a crisis the scope of which seems not to be realized by those in authority...
the released power of the atom changed everything but our way of thinking, and thus we keep sliding down to a catastrophe never seen heretofore.
for the mankind to survive, we have to learn to think in a new way.
the most difficult task of our time is to avert this threat.
the fact that we all had descended from a monkey was concealed.
that's why it's been decided to pull the church down and on that place...
"i deem appropriate the construction of a new building of the laboratory.
however, in view of lack of funds, we should temporarily abstain from it."
i give you my word that i won't spare any effort to solve this problem.
and the experiments, as far as i know, are conducted at a minimal capacity.
it will go on this way until the new building is erected.
if the high voltage installations work at a full capacity, not only the church, but the whole town will blow up.
you live on the town square in a two-story house, don't you?
during the ceremony a girl was blowing soap-bubbles from the window.
we wonder who is patronizing this maniac by organizing his personal exhibitions?
the art of anarchist barateli is a disgrace to our culture.
i understand, but this is not an argument for the letter's authors.
maybe the artist's talent isn't a strong argument for them either?
i was just executing the people's will, masses stand behind that letter.
and each word coming from the masses is the holy of holies for me.
the leader of the secret organization, mikhail korisheli himself, named you as one of its active members.
it's immoral to slander an honest man in order to extract false evidence.
and if we confront you with mikhail korisheli, what would you say then?
nobody will ever convince me that mikhail korisheli is an enemy.
i've been chasing these damn people for a month, i got them all together.
let's lock them up in a cellar, they may come in handy tomorrow.
she digs up my father from his grave, and i'm supposed to apologize?
yes, i will strangle her, and you too, if you don't come to your senses.
we're being planted a dead man, and the culprit is not put in jail.
abel, if i see the dug-up varlam once more, i'll go mad.
if the defendant is mentally ill, there will be no trial.
she will be sent to a hospital to be treated... forever...
some moments of her unfortunate life story had moved me to tears.
but the defendant's persistent claims that even if she's given 100 years she will dig up the deceased anyway, the strange categoricalness of that declaration go beyond obsessive ideas and simply turn into delirium.
it's necessary that our authoritative doctors and experts should have their say.
i earnestly request the court that the defendant be sent to a hospital for another examination.
i hope my colleague will excuse me, but such perfunctory judgement of the fate of a long-suffering person is a patent sacrilege.
the severe mental trauma, the abnormal living conditions had affected the defendant's health and, as the psychiatrists say, deformed her personality.
i demand that the case be re-examined, legally brought to trial, and henceforth be known as "aravidze versus barateli" case.
i'm telling you that aravidze will not rest in the ground.
may your blood... turn to water... and your bread... to dust!
may your flesh... burn in hell's fire... and not be honored... like your father... with an earthly burial!

dear nino, i've heard so much about you, about the artist sandro barateli and his beautiful wife.
we wonder who is patronizing this maniac by organizing his personal exhibitions?
the art of anarchist barateli is a disgrace to our culture.

believe me, your sincere confession will help to alleviate your lot.
the leader of the secret organization, mikhail korisheli himself, named you as one of its active members.
what good can the prosecution of the innocent do the common cause?
there's irrefutable proof that each 'innocent' is an enemy of the nation.
how can i believe you when i myself was arrested on no grounds at all, for nothing.
and now you try to resort to any means to make me sign a false testimony.
nobody will ever convince me that mikhail korisheli is an enemy.
if such honest people are being arrested, then you have to arrest the whole country.

you will grind to dust anyone who stands in your way.
if you're struck on one cheek, you won't turn the other one, you'll strike back so hard that the other's neck is broken.
your father is thrown out of his grave, you're losing your power, your only son rebels against you.
all that stood for the name of abel aravidze is slipping away from you.
all my life i've been trying to run away from it, pretending and lying.
both my family and my work are just self-deception, for i am afraid to be left alone with myself.

no, this is varlam street, and it doesn't lead to a church.
i think many of you have taken notice of the highly emotional and wise inscription on the wreath from the friends of the deceased.

you're worse than issam, that planted a bomb in the central bus station and ran like a chicken.
you betrayed the whole country, and there's no atonement for that.

israel will hold the lebanonese authorities responsible for all acts of terrorism
we take you now to our correspondent zohar vardi, who will fill us in on additional details regarding the terrorist attack.
army sources have informed us that at this very moment a full-scale pursuit of the terrorist in underway, one of which was killed nearby by an israeli defense forces patrol which was scouting the area.
it was on that spot where the terrorists opened fire, killing, as has been mentioned, 6 civilians...
one more peep out of you and you'll be sorry you learned how to talk.
issam, listen carefully to what i am about to tell you.
you, valeed, do precisely but precisely what they want you to do.
you are so absolutely consistent and predictable that the security officer knows just where to hit you to make you serve his ends!
when uri and issam get out of solitary, they won't recognize this place.
and you think these sanctions are going to calm things down here?
my dear scholar young lady, you must think that i enjoy having to use all these sanctions.
you think i enjoy having to clean up the mess made by having your lousy festival here.
the arab political prisoners wouldn't have killed hoffman, god rest his soul.
if it weren't for that lousy festival i said that it would turn out badly!
i had to promise issam a lot , a lot of things.
but because i knew i had to get you out, i promised.
if we had decided to kill hoffman after he spat in rashid's face at the festival, we would have made certain that every jew in the block would know it.
what is the point of revenge if its perpetrators are unknown?
and if it was us, why should we be afraid to admit it?
look at me, i have two life sentences, i'll be here until i die.
one is a stooge who knows he's a stooge; he knows it.
the other kind of a stooge is one who sits and eats and stuffs his mouth and chews hush cud like a pig, and only them, upstairs, they know he's their stooge.
we don't trust you, sir, nor the security officer or representatives.
we will present our evidence only to an impartial investigative committee.
sir, if someone intends to break our strike by force, we'll turn the whole block into a living torch.
and that means, sir, lots of burns and wounded, lots of deaths.
a murderer of small children, and the others are no better than he is.
don't you understand they're just using you, uri, don't you get it?
but you guys... use your head, uri, you're an intelligent boy.
you guys have a lot to lose, and so do you, personally.
right now we have to be patient, this is a war of nerves.
ln two, three days, when the hunger starts to really get to them, the weak will start to crack.
any prisoner wishing to end his strike and transfer a block, will be able to go down to an open transfer room.

though bob marley has sold some 300 million records, the world's first reggae superstar faced violence, assassination and exile.
he became the spokesman for jamaica, his tiny caribbean island buffeted by global politics and domestic strife.
"the most influential artist of the second half of the 20th century. "
his song "one love" was chosen as the anthem of the millennium by the bbc.
perhaps the most important honour, and most unexpected, came from time magazine, which chose exodus as the best album of the 20th century.
and remarks like those of jack healey, the president of amnesty international, who said that everywhere he goes in the world today,
what bob expressed was quite widespread among young people in jamaica.
bob's first commercial recording embodied that cheerful sense of rebellion in the new jamaican rhythm called "ska".
he arrived with his mother alongside thousands of migrants from the jamaican countryside.
he grew up streetwise in the shanty district of trench town, determined to make a career in music.
he was appealing because we were coming out of this situation where, as they say, you have to box without a hard mouth to survive.
we have days when we had to go in the dump looking for food.
it's his guitar, it's his music, it's what he has to say.
in the early '60s, music offered the quickest route out of the ghetto.
young singers had to bluff their way through first auditions, composing and performing tunes about the scandals and political trickery of the community around them.
you had to be strong, you know, because the survival game wasn't one that was a easy road.
you come from a community that is people always crying and moaning and weeping and wailing.
small harmony groups like the wailers borrowed their first instruments and sold their songs to unscrupulous producers, who paid them a few pounds and kept all the royalties.
the original teenage wailers group included both bunny wailer and peter tosh.
there was a time when we were what you would call imperfect in the music.
but when i looked at him, i says "whoa, what a nice-looking guy. "
i didn't think i would like a guy with his complexion, cos i was always after tall, dark and handsome.
i can recall bob asking me to use shoe polish in his hair to make it more african, more black.
so when i found myself seeing him, i think sympathy came first.
sympathy came first, and then, him being the type of person that he is, you wouldn't have a choice but to really give your heart out to him.
bob was always first in the studio and last to leave, cajoling the others to rehearse through the night.
because whenever the sound is not right, you could see that facial expression.
when he's not happy and shows it, everybody try to fall in line.
this is a serious thing and, if you want a future, you have to work for it.
but the kind of music the wailers were working at couldn't get any airplay.
the radio stations were firmly stuck in the colonial era, playing british and american imports.
so giant sound systems toured the island, taking the music direct to the people.
here comes bob marley and the wailing wailers and "simmer down".
"simmer down" was recorded in the morning, pressed in the afternoon, and was playing on coxsone's sound system that same night.
"because i come from trench town, because i come from allman town, because i come from denham town, me's a rude girl. "
they made it seem as if the only way you can exist is to snatch, because there was nothing for the ghetto people to have survived legitimately.
because violence at the dance halls was getting out of hand, their first record had told the rude boys to "simmer down".
but the wailers then affirmed their rebel status by becoming musical rude boys.
"put it on" both has sexual overtones, has rude boy hints, and at the same time he's thanking the lord for giving him this spirit.
so you have the religious, the romantic, the sexual and the revolutionary in one.
several of bob's love songs around that time were written for his girlfriend, rita, whom he was courting while recording a string of minor hits for coxsone dodd.
bob was still very much under the influence of that powerful producer.
he didn't even tell peter and bunny that he was getting married.
and he took his advice and he went and he got me a ring.
in february 1966, bob marley made the first of many trips to delaware, where his mother had moved a few years before.
he went there to raise money to start his own record label.
he worked for about eight months sweeping floors in the dupont hotel.
on later trips he did things like working on the night shift of a chrysler factory.
he saw the television reports every night of the brutality going on around the united states, and that had a profound influence on the kind of writing he did.
reggae music is a people music and reggae music is news.
and i know, i have no doubt, that bob and perhaps the whole of jamaica listened, heard, and was inspired by what they saw happening here musically and otherwise.
after being exposed to so much aggression and prejudice against blacks in the united states,
it appealed to bob because rastas despise the political forces they believe impose poverty and brutality upon the people.
those rasta ideas were to revolutionise bob's music and politics in the years that followed.
me find i and i self among a people, who i selassie call, the wonderful people, the africans, who have been brought here in the western hemisphere.
rastas have been outcasts in jamaica since colonial times, viewed as a threat by mainstream society.
emperor haile selassie i of ethiopia is our rightful ruler. "
you know, the bible says so, babylon newspaper says so, and i and i the children say so.
what i couldn't understand in those days, i understand it after.
and then i just realise, you know, that is a part of life.
and he had that sort of innate intelligence that, you know, you have to put in to take out.
but if you grow up in an urban environment, the only thing between you and what you want is money.
bob marley knew he had to return to the kingston studios and reflect the hard realities of street life in his songs.
well, reggae music is a music created by rasta people and it carry earth force of people rhythm and people...
we play what we want to play, when we want to play it, how we want to play it, and we have a reason why we play it.
the local recording industry was highly competitive, full of ambitious and talented vocal groups of which the wailers were just one.
but they had been backed by some of the most revered instrumentalists in the history of jamaican music, like the skatalites, whose particular brand of ska music had been influenced by american jazz.
however, for all jamaican artists at that time making music was one thing, getting properly paid for it, quite another.
the kingston music business was not sympathetic to rebellious young musicians in the late 60's.
especially not those like bob marley and the wailers, who were both rastafarians and rude boys.
recording studios, pressing plants, and even radio stations were in the hands of people who didn't want to give rastas and rudies a platform.
but the wailers were desperate for airplay and took matters into their own hands.
he badly needed a new sound and a new direction for his music.
he found both with lee "scratch" perry, a maverick producer who was to change the style of marley's music with collaborations like "duppy conqueror".
but these ground-breaking "soul rebel" sessions were to end on a sour note when scratch, believing the session tapes were his, sold the songs in england without the wailers' consent.
he sold out, and then it led to where we would have to, maybe, be charged for murdering scratch.
so we avoided that and just walked away and leave all of that recording and all of that stuff to be in the hands of pirates all over the world, today.
you go into the shops and you see those same songs with different bob marley pictures on them, but it's the same songs.
he grabbed the opportunity to sign the frustrated wailers band and offered bob marley's music to the world beyond jamaica.
i first became aware of him in 1962, and during the course of the next ten years at times we released some of his records on island.
following the modest success of their first island album, a young protege of chris blackwell's was sent to jamaica to look after them.
i felt that, politically, what was going on in jamaica should be put in songs.
and from that they broke down everything to their philosophy and what place we were in time.
he didn't believe in too much smiling' because his thing was, you know,
"when you come down on the rock and see how hard life is there, you'll see why i don't smile", when i ask him why he screw up his face so much.
but then when he did smile, he had so wonderful smile.
but i wouldn't say that he was a sophisticated, educated person.
it's just that we jamaicans are full of sayings and metaphors.
it means: every day you're messin' with me, one day you're gonna get it.
with the departure of peter tosh and bunny wailer in 1973,
cos he'd speak about spiritual wickedness in high and low places, where you don't see everything that's wrong.
but it's there, and so bob felt he had to fight this.
by the mid-70's, the streets of kingston reflected all the anger and discontent of the jamaican people.
their politicians had failed to deliver the promised fruits of independence, and bob marley expressed his people's frustration at street level.
to all the people, all the ghetto people, from trench town and rum lane and matches lane.
these people who believed in him, he could explain it to them better than any politician could, what was goin' on politically, economically and culturally.
their protest came through music and the song, and they said what they disagreed with and what they agreed with.
and so you could find out really how the people were thinking by what song they sang.
it was one way by which you could gauge the people.
in opposition was the jamaica labour party, led by the right-wing, pro-american edward seaga.
there is no question about the fact that music is intertwined with politics.
every public meeting begins and ends with music, and music is interspersed right throughout.
and the sounds reflect what happenings are taking place in political life.
you wouldn't be able to separate politics and music, in terms of the extent to which they are interwoven as a form of message.
this is a music say death to black and white oppressors, to all oppressors, you know, we are dealing with human beings, we are dealing with the purpose why god create man in the first place.
in the mid-70's, kingston was divided into political territories controlled by warlords.
many believed the cia was supporting the right-wing edward seaga with money, guns and propaganda to bring down the so-called communist government.
we knew that the violence that came up during those years
i remember, i think it was 75, about 75... about 75.
kissinger himself personally complained that we were carrying on an anti-american campaign, an anti-cia campaign from our platform.
and he named michael manley and named me as having said things about the americans' interference and against the cia.
he said "dudley, take it from me, i know of no cia at all operating in jamaica. "
i believe the cia was using the jamaican labour party as its instrument in the entire campaign against the michael manley government.
i'd say most of the violence was coming from the jamaica labour party side and behind them was the cia in terms of getting the weapons in, and getting the money in, with all the propaganda guidance,
because there was a steady stream, a continuous campaign of propaganda against the manley government.
the weapons... there was no problem with getting weapons in because the ganja smuggling was a perfect route for bringing weapons back into jamaica from the united states.
the cia would look upon the radical political content of reggae music as dangerous, because it would help to create a consciousness among poor people, among the great majority of jamaicans.
and of course, naturally, the climate was created for an attempt on bob marley's life.
so, in order to get the youths' and the people's attention, they used the wailers.
bob is a musician who wants to play for the people.
but these guys try to see if they can get their thing going and they're not worried about how dangerous that is gonna be for bob.
two days before the smile jamaica concert, which had become transparently political, gunmen attacked bob's home in hope road.
and i walked out and said "let's go find bob. "
and we went out and we saw bob coming and he got shot in his elbow.
but it was, what we know that what we were doin', that we could expect invasion from all direction.
it happened to satisfy some people and it happened to strengthen me.
my life no important to me, but other people life important.
my life is only important if me can help plenty people.
prime minister manley has expressed his deep regret at the act of terrorism directed against bob marley and his associates, and said "those responsible for the act would never be forgiven by decent people of jamaica. "
though marley was not expected to appear, the crowd began building early and by 5 pm was 50,000 strong.
we have just received word that bob is on his way.
we'll be out of communication for a bit, but get the cameras ready to shoot his arrival.
while preparing his new "exodus" album, bob lived in london, not with his wife, but with a jamaican beauty queen.
i think he was very hurt that whomever was responsible was actually able to convince his fellow jamaican to pick up a gun, a life-threatening weapon, and come into his camp at hope road to threaten his life.
he wasn't the smooth talker in terms of what your normal suitor would have been.
you know, his idea of a gift might have been a mango.
first of all, if music was happening, music came before everything else.
it didn't matter how beautiful you were or how keenly he seemed interested the day before.
and i remember him saying to me "boy, you see what happen now?"
"them say me get soft now because is pure love song and ting. "
"me's a soldier so me have to get militant now. "
it was in '76 that bob really became a superstar in europe and a household name in england.
suddenly you go from small island girl to being splashed all over the front page of every newspaper you get in london.
and not just that, but tied in with someone like bob, who was a very controversial character.
he would call me sometimes to get girls out of his room.
i didn't complain, cos i felt i was there for the job.
he liked to communicate best through his music, and i think that's where lyrically, you know, you feel his strength.
he said everything he wanted and needed to say that way.
he was determined to have another go at holding a free concert - one that could bring peace and reconciliation to his divided island.
little had changed politically in jamaica since the assassination attempt on bob.
political, yes, in that he was one of the most articulate troubadours of the ghetto, its suffering, its pressures, that i have ever heard.
and the interesting thing is that as he grew in stature, as he became a millionaire, for example, one often wondered will he tend to go soft, to become gimmickry, to try to appeal to a more commercial market.
it was as a rasta that bob demonstrated how rooted he was in jamaican culture.
one of the basic tenets of rastafari is the healing power of marijuana, to which bob was notoriously devoted.
against men who won't crave, because them crave for other things.
them have some material things and them want captivate your mind until you say "well, you have to work and we put you on pension and them keep it all".
bob was able to show he was his own man by using his immense wealth to build his own studios at home, in 56 hope road.
this meant he could also turn his back on the recording industry that had exploited him as a youth.
bob started tuff gong so he could gain the reins of control over his own work.
so that he could produce his own material at his own pace.
if he got an inspiration at night, he could go down to the studio and record it right on the spot, and so that he could reap the rewards of his work instead of a producer who paid him pennies.
when bob arrived in jamaica, within minutes - literally minutes - 56 hope road would be filled with people.
and the crowds spilled over onto the street, down the road.
bob spent hours - hours - especially at night, interviewing people in need.
every day we had to have funds to make sure people got something to eat.
chris blackwell once said in an interview that bob took care of 4,000 people.
he was very bright, although he didn't like people to think that he was.
he tried to portray a different picture, but he was extremely shrewd.
because i really try set up certain, like a machine, where financially we can really help one another.
because, you know, from time to time, financial problem i and i people have.
so he injured a toenail and he wouldn't give it a chance to heal.
and that was when they detected the melanoma, the skin cancer.
bob always believed that the power of his lyrics could change political systems and carry the message of rastafari back to its homeland.
above all, bob despised the apartheid system which then existed in south africa.
they used a thick pen on the cover, so that we'd never see the title itself.
and then, on the lp itself, then they scooped the title so that it's just not there.
on the track they used a sharp instrument, either a knife or a razor, and just cut it across, cut it across, so that when you play it,
the needle will go from track to track and you'll never understand what it's all about on the track.
bob had continued to ignore the cause of his increasing ill health.
i know there are stories and i know there is the possibility that they were planning to kill bob.
and the cia and other forces who might have wanted bob to be silenced.
but it was at this time that bob discovered that he had melanoma.
suddenly, all the world's media wanted to interview the star they called the wild man of reggae.
bob found it hard to hide his contempt for tabloid journalism.
to most people who are very conservative in dress, you look quite strange.
even if the ganja-smoking marley, ripped out of his head most of the day, seems hard to take seriously, even though the temptation is to laugh at a stoned jamaican musician who worships a dead ethiopian dictator,
bob marley's view of the plight of the black man is hard to knock.
you know, everybody wanted a piece of him and they took a piece of him.
and there was hardly any left for him when he really needed it for himself.
i remember speaking' to him in the morning sometimes and... he wouldn't reply.
on sunday, september 21, 1980, after two nights at madison square garden,
bob was jogging in central park and collapsed and began frothing at the mouth, and they carried him back to the hotel, took him to a doctor, and the doctor found that the melanoma, which had been diagnosed three years earlier,
and he was... he was moving, because bob wasn't going to accept death.
we knew it was a transition that was in god's hand.
he was like a verbal newspaper for those who couldn't read and didn't know what was going on in the government in jamaica and the world.
he had never had a family life, or just rooted to one person.
no one person that he was ever close to for his entire life.
i think the measure of the impact of bob's career on the world can be seen by the extraordinary attention paid to him at the turning of the millennium.
his song "0ne love" was chosen as the anthem of the millennium by the bbc.
perhaps the most important honour, and most unexpected, came from time magazine, which chose exodus as the best album of the 20th century.
i suppose at some point you could say, an arrogance against the establishment.
what bob expressed was quite widespread among young people in jamaica.
bob's first commercial recording embodied that cheerful sense of rebellion in the newjamaican rhythm called "ska".
now, bob's particular expression of it has to be explained, i think, obviously in terms of his background.
bob had entered kingston as a child in the late '50s.
he arrived with his mother alongside thousands of migrants from the jamaican countryside.
he grew up streetwise in the shanty district of trench town, determined to make a career in music.
trench town was a struggle living, where you would get up and you hear people fight every day.
we have days when we had to go in the dump looking for food.
we couldn't afford to buy records, so we listened to the radio.
in the early '60s, music offered the quickest route out of the ghetto.
young singers had to bluff their way through first auditions, composing and performing tunes about the scandals and political trickery of the community around them.
but if you keep lifting weights, then automatically you'll get strong.
you come from a community that is people always crying and moaning and weeping and wailing.
small harmony groups like the wailers borrowed their first instruments and sold their songs to unscrupulous producers, who paid them a few pounds and kept all the royalties.
the original teenage wailers group included both bunny wailer and peter tosh.
there was a time when we were what you would call imperfect in the music.
i mean, while learning that, we find out that we had a voice that could... me and bunny together had the kind of voice that could decorate bob's music and makes it beautiful.
but when i looked at him, i says "whoa, what a nice-looking guy."
i didn't think i would like a guy with his complexion, cos i was always after tall, dark and handsome.
i can recall bob asking me to use shoe polish in his hair to make it more african, more black.
so when i found myself seeing him, i think sympathy came first.
sympathy came first, and then, him being the type of person that he is, you wouldn't have a choice but to really give your heart out to him.
bob was always first in the studio and last to leave, cajoling the others to rehearse through the night.
because whenever the sound is not right, you could see that facial expression.
when he's not happy and shows it, everybody try to fall in line.
this is a serious thing and, if you want a future, you have to work for it.
but the kind of music the wailers were working at couldn't get any airplay.
the radio stations were firmly stuck in the colonial era, playing british and american imports.
so giant sound systems toured the island, taking the music direct to the people.
here comes bob marley and the wailing wailers and "simmer down".
"simmer down" was recorded in the morning, pressed in the afternoon, and was playing on coxsone's sound system that same night.
"because i come from trench town, because i come from allman town, because i come from denham town, me's a rude girl."
they made it seem as if the only way you can exist is to snatch, because there was nothing for the ghetto people to have survived legitimately.
because violence at the dance halls was getting out of hand, their first record had told the rude boys to "simmer down".
but the wailers then affirmed their rebel status by becoming musical rude boys.
"put it 0n" both has sexual overtones, has rude boy hints, and at the same time he's thanking the lord for giving him this spirit.
so you have the religious, the romantic, the sexual and the revolutionary in one.
several of bob's love songs around that time were written for his girlfriend, rita, whom he was courting while recording a string of minor hits for coxsone dodd.
bob was still very much under the influence of that powerful producer.
he didn't even tell peter and bunny that he was getting married.
and he took his advance and he went and he got me a ring.
in february 1966, bob marley made the first of many trips to delaware, where his mother had moved a few years before.
he went there to raise money to start his own record label.
he worked for about eight months sweeping floors in the dupont hotel.
0n later trips he did things like working on the night shift of a chrysler factory.
he saw the television reports every night of the brutality going on around the united states, and that had a profound influence on the kind of writing he did.
reggae music is a people music and reggae music is news.
and i know, i have no doubt, that bob and perhaps the whole of jamaica listened, heard, and was inspired by what they saw happening here musically and otherwise.
after being exposed to so much aggression and prejudice against blacks in the united states,
it appealed to bob because rastas despise the political forces they believe impose poverty and brutality upon the people.
those rasta ideas were to revolutionise bob's music and politics in the years that followed.
me find i and i self among a people, who i selassie call, the wonderful people, the africans, who have been brought here in the western hemisphere.
rastas have been outcasts in jamaica since colonial times, viewed as a threat by mainstream society.
bob felt a special affinity for selassie, based on his rejection by his father.
captain norval marley, bob's father, was a white jamaican who had supervised the colonial farmlands for the british crown.
so that child is kind of a... a child that is, you know, not saying not wanted, but scared off.
what i couldn't understand in those days, i understand it after.
and then i just realise, you know, that is a part of life.
and that was like the resentment, you know, between black and white.
i think what really contributed to bob being who he was was the fact that he grew up in the country, that he used to farm.
and he had that sort of innate intelligence that, you know, you have to put in to take out.
to succeed in the cut-throat music business of the late '60s,
bob marley knew he had to return to the kingston studios and reflect the hard realities of street life in his songs.
the local recording industry was highly competitive, full of ambitious and talented vocal groups of which the wailers were just one.
but they had been backed by some of the most revered instrumentalists in the history ofjamaican music, like the skatalites, whose particular brand of ska music had been influenced by american jazz.
so we took frustration as an inspiration to write songs, to get us out of the frustrations.
the music business was not sympathetic to rebellious young musicians in the late '60s.
especially not those like bob marley and the wailers, who were both rastafarians and rude boys.
recording studios, pressing plants, and even radio stations were owned by people who didn't want to give rastas and rudies a platform.
but the wailers were desperate for airplay and took matters into their own hands.
it was a kind of a struggle, and if a guy shut the door in your face, you gotta find a way to open that door.
he badly needed a new sound and a new direction for his music.
he found both with lee "scratch" perry, a maverick producer who changed the style of marley's music with collaborations like "duppy conqueror".
he sold out, and then it led to where we would have to, maybe, be charged for murdering scratch.
so we avoided that and just walked away and leave all of that recording and all of that stuff to be in the hands of pirates all over the world, today.
however, these lee perry recordings were heard in england by the founder of island records.
he grabbed the opportunity to sign the frustrated wailers band and offered bob marley's music to the world beyondjamaica.
the strategy really was to present them as like a black rock group.
that's why, though when i signed them, it was bob marley and the wailers,
0nce he was through the door, he'd pull everybody else with him.
esther had been sent to help manage the band, but it didn't take her long to fall for bob's charms.
they were people who had nothing to do with the system, yet they knew exactly what was going on in the world outside.
they listened to the radio, the bbc, all the time, to the news.
he didn't believe in too much smilin' because his thing was
"when you come down on the rock and see how hard life is there, you'll see why i don't smile", when i ask him why he screw up his face so much.
but i wouldn't say that he was a sophisticated, educated person.
it's just that we jamaicans are full of sayings and metaphors.
it means: every day you're messin' with me, one day you're gonna get it.
with the departure of peter tosh and bunny wailer in 1973,
cos he'd speak about spiritual wickedness in high and low places, where you don't see everything that's wrong.
but it's there, and so bob felt he had to fight this.
by the mid- '70s, the streets of kingston reflected all the anger and discontent of the jamaican people.
their politicians had failed to deliver the promised fruits of independence, and bob marley expressed his people's frustration at street level.
i believe that politics wasn't number one for him, but it was number one for him to make an explanation to people who didn't understand what was going on politically.
to all the people, all the ghetto people, from trench town and rum lane and matches lane.
when i stand up and i see youth fighting against youth for the politicians, then i really feel sick.
and it's just because they keep the youth hungry and they can't get a job.
reggae, especially through people like bob marley, expressed the wishes and the sentiments of the people.
their protest came through music and the song, and they said what they disagreed with and what they agreed with.
and so you could find out really how the people were thinking by what they sang.
it was one way by which you could gauge the people.
in opposition was the jamaica labour party, led by the right-wing, pro-american edward seaga.
there is no question about the fact that music is intertwined with politics.
every public meeting begins and ends with music, and music is interspersed right throughout.
and the sounds reflect what happenings are taking place in political life.
you wouldn't be able to separate politics and music, in terms of the extent to which they are interwoven as a form of message.
both parties were using reggae to sell their policies and both were anxious to conscript bob marley.
in the mid- '70s, kingston was divided into political territories controlled by warlords.
many believed the cia was supporting the right-wing edward seaga with money, guns and propaganda to bring down the so-called communist government.
we knew that the violence that came up during those years
- and i was in a position very close to see it - was something which was not entirely local.
kissinger himself personally complained that we were carrying on an anti-american campaign, an anti-cia campaign from our platform.
and he named michael manley and named me as having said things about the americans' interference and against the cia.
he said "dudley, take it from me, i know of no cia at all operating in jamaica."
i believe the cia was using the jamaican labour party as its instrument in the entire campaign against the michael manley government.
i'd say most of the violence was coming from the jamaica labour party side and behind them was the cia in terms of getting the weapons in, and getting the money in, with all the propaganda guidance,
because there was a steady stream, a continuous campaign of propaganda against the manley government.
and naturally, the climate was created for an attempt on bob marley's life.
bob invited further trouble when he agreed to a government request to front a free concert called "smile jamaica".
so, in order to get the youths' and the people's attention, they used the wailers.
bob is a musician who wants to play for the people.
but these guys try to see if they can get their thing going and they're not worried about how dangerous that is gonna be for bob.
two days before the smile jamaica concert, which had become transparently political, gunmen attacked bob's home in hope road.

he was determined to have another go at holding a free concert - one that could bring peace and reconciliation to his divided island.
little had changed politically in jamaica since the assassination attempt on bob.
and that's why i work with it, because it was a spiritual thing what happen.
what bob made happen was the "0ne love" peace concert, intended to bring together the warring politicians in front of their people.
when the right-wing leader of the labour party, edward seaga, was hauled on stage, everyone wondered if socialist prime minister michael manley would have the nerve to meet and greet him.
manley arrived, to cement what seemed a unique moment in jamaican history.
bob was not, by temperament or mind, the kind of person who would ever become, say, a part of a party.
political, yes, in that he was one of the most articulate troubadours of the ghetto, its suffering, its pressures, that i have ever heard.
and the interesting thing is that as he grew in stature, as he became a millionaire, one often wondered
"will he tend to go soft, to become gimmicky, to try to appeal to a more commercial market?"
it was as a rasta that bob demonstrated how rooted he was in jamaican culture.

and the crowds spilled over onto the street, down the road.
bob spent hours - hours - especially at night, interviewing people in need.

chris blackwell once said in an interview that bob took care of 4,000 people.
he was very bright, although he didn't like people to think that he was.
he tried to portray a different picture, but he was extremely shrewd.
because i really try set up certain, like a machine, where financially we can really help one another.
because, you know, from time to time, financial problem i and i people have.
he was passionate about football, and anywhere he went, they'd get a side together, and if anyone wanted a match, they were right in it.
so he injured a toenail and he wouldn't give it a chance to heal.
and that was when they detected the melanoma, the skin cancer.
and they removed the entire nail and the nail bed and everything, and did a graft from his leg here over it, so there was no toenail at all there.
to get his music out of what he called babylon and into africa was perhaps the greatest professional desire of bob's career, going back to his earliest days.
bob always believed that the power of his lyrics could change political systems and carry the message of rastafari back to its homeland.
above all, bob despised the apartheid system which then existed in south africa.
the authorities there were terrified his lyrics would incite the people to rise up.
and then, on the lp itself, then they scooped the title so that it's just not there.
0n the track they used a sharp instrument, either a knife or a razor, and just cut it across, cut it across, so that when you play it, the needle will go from track to track
and you'll never understand what it's all about on the track.
africa, to bob, means everything in terms of proving to himself how much of africa is him.
such was his reputation in africa as a musical freedom fighter that when zimbabwe won its independence in 1980
bob was the only foreign artist invited to play at the celebrations, watched by prince charles and robert mugabe.
and that was what everything he did was focused on, as a rasta man, as a black man, as an african.
music is a cultural weapon, and bob used it in the wisest way.
i know there are stories and i know there is the possibility that they were planning to kill bob.
and the cia and other forces who might have wanted bob to be silenced.
i don't know how one person would have taken more pressure.
and he really had reached a point where there was just no peace.
do you think rastas have been involved in the killings in jamaica over the years?
to most people who are very conservative in dress, you look quite strange.
even if the ganja-smoking marley, ripped out of his head most of the day, seems hard to take seriously, even though the temptation is to laugh at a stoned jamaican musician who worships a dead ethiopian dictator,
bob marley's view of the plight of the black man is hard to knock.
you know, everybody wanted a piece of him and they took a piece of him.
and there was hardly any left for him when he really needed it for himself.
in the fall of 1980, bob undertook a tour primarily to reach the black american audience.
there were people involved in the promotion of that tour who were trying to get him not to go into hospital for treatment, but to continue on the road with the tour.
and basically he was given just a few weeks to live.
though he lived on for some months, bob's health declined rapidly.
though bob marley has sold some 300 million records, the world's first reggae superstar faced violence, assassination and exile.
he became the spokesman forjamaica, his tiny caribbean island buffeted by global politics and domestic strife.
"the most influential artist of the second half of the 20th century."
his song "0ne love" was chosen as the anthem of the millennium by the bbc.
perhaps the most important honour, and most unexpected, came from time magazine, which chose exodus as the best album of the 20th century.
and remarks like those of jack healey, the president of amnesty international, who said that everywhere he goes in the world today,
what bob expressed was quite widespread among young people in jamaica.
bob's first commercial recording embodied that cheerful sense of rebellion in the newjamaican rhythm called "ska".
he arrived with his mother alongside thousands of migrants from the jamaican countryside.
he grew up streetwise in the shanty district of trench town, determined to make a career in music.
he was appealing because we were coming out of this situation where, as they say, you have to box without a hard mouth to survive.
we have days when we had to go in the dump looking for food.
it's his guitar, it's his music, it's what he has to say.
in the early '60s, music offered the quickest route out of the ghetto.
young singers had to bluff their way through first auditions, composing and performing tunes about the scandals and political trickery of the community around them.
you had to be strong, you know, because the survival game wasn't one that was a easy road.
you come from a community that is people always crying and moaning and weeping and wailing.
small harmony groups like the wailers borrowed their first instruments and sold their songs to unscrupulous producers, who paid them a few pounds and kept all the royalties.
the original teenage wailers group included both bunny wailer and peter tosh.
there was a time when we were what you would call imperfect in the music.
i didn't think i would like a guy with his complexion, cos i was always after tall, dark and handsome.
i can recall bob asking me to use shoe polish in his hair to make it more african, more black.
so when i found myself seeing him, i think sympathy came first.
sympathy came first, and then, him being the type of person that he is, you wouldn't have a choice but to really give your heart out to him.
bob was always first in the studio and last to leave, cajoling the others to rehearse through the night.
they practised at studio 0ne, owned by the legendary coxsone dodd.
so we had a meeting and i selected bob to be the leader.
because whenever the sound is not right, you could see that facial expression.
when he's not happy and shows it, everybody try to fall in line.
bob was very strict in terms of, if you have a rehearsal, you have to be on time.
but the kind of music the wailers were working at couldn't get any airplay.
the radio stations were firmly stuck in the colonial era, playing british and american imports.
so giant sound systems toured the island, taking the music direct to the people.
here comes bob marley and the wailing wailers and "simmer down".
they made it seem as if the only way you can exist is to snatch, because there was nothing for the ghetto people to have survived legitimately.
because violence at the dance halls was getting out of hand, their first record had told the rude boys to "simmer down".
i took the financial expense to get them married because i figured this was the right way and i'm trying to be like a father figure.
"you better marry her." i thought this is what he told me coxsone told him.
he went there to raise money to start his own record label.
he worked for about eight months sweeping floors in the dupont hotel.
0n later trips he did things like working on the night shift of a chrysler factory.
during that time, he was exposed to the civil uprisings in america.
yes, it's very clear if you listen to early wailers music that the black music in the black-american community was extremely influential.
we had a struggle that included our writers, our performers and the people.
a black-consciousness movement that replaces armed physical struggle with a spiritual one.
it appealed to bob because rastas despise the political forces they believe impose poverty and brutality upon the people.
those rasta ideas were to revolutionise bob's music and politics in the years that followed.
me find i and i self among a people, who i selassie call, the wonderful people, the africans, who have been brought here in the western hemisphere.
rastas have been outcasts in jamaica since colonial times, viewed as a threat by mainstream society.
their alternative philosophy is based on a rereading of the bible, which sees black people in the west as exiles from their african homeland and emperor haile selassie of ethiopia as the true messiah.
haile selassie definitely became the father figure for bob in a personal sense.
bob felt a special affinity for selassie, based on his rejection by his father.
what i couldn't understand in those days, i understand it after.
and then i just realise, you know, that is a part of life.
and he had that sort of innate intelligence that, you know, you have to put in to take out.
but if you grow up in an urban environment, the only thing between you and what you want is money.
bob marley knew he had to return to the kingston studios and reflect the hard realities of street life in his songs.
well, reggae music is a music created by rasta people and it carry earth force of people rhythm and people...
we play what we want to play, when we want to play it, how we want to play it, and we have a reason why we play it.
the local recording industry was highly competitive, full of ambitious and talented vocal groups of which the wailers were just one.
the music business was not sympathetic to rebellious young musicians in the late '60s.
especially not those like bob marley and the wailers, who were both rastafarians and rude boys.
recording studios, pressing plants, and even radio stations were owned by people who didn't want to give rastas and rudies a platform.
but the wailers were desperate for airplay and took matters into their own hands.
"so if you go to work, you're gonna play the wailers, or we're gonna meet you comin' out of work and we'll make sure you don't go back to work unless you play the wailers."
whether we meant it or not, that's how we got some radio play.
the musicians bob played with at these sessions became the wailers band.
well, when we begin to work as wailers together, yeah, we carry strong vibes, cos what bob was saying and what scratch was saying and what the hippy boy who upset the band was saying, you know, was the perfect combination to start that soul rebel kind of feeling.
but these ground-breaking "soul rebel" sessions ended on a sour note when scratch, believing the session tapes were his, sold the songs in england without the wailers' consent.
he sold out, and then it led to where we would have to, maybe, be charged for murdering scratch.
so we avoided that and just walked away and leave all of that recording and all of that stuff to be in the hands of pirates all over the world, today.
you go into the shops and you see those same songs with different bob marley pictures on them, but it's the same songs.
he grabbed the opportunity to sign the frustrated wailers band and offered bob marley's music to the world beyondjamaica.
i first became aware of him in 1962, and during the course of the next ten years at times we released some of his records on island.
following the modest success of their first island album, a young protégée of chris blackwell's was sent to jamaica to look after them.
i felt that, politically, what was going on in jamaica should be put in songs.
and from that they broke down everything to their philosophy and what place we were in time.
he didn't believe in too much smilin' because his thing was
"when you come down on the rock and see how hard life is there, you'll see why i don't smile", when i ask him why he screw up his face so much.
but then when he did smile, he had such a wonderful smile.
it's just that we jamaicans are full of sayings and metaphors.
for example, when we were writing "i shot the sheriff", and he said "no, i want something for the jamaicans."
their politicians had failed to deliver the promised fruits of independence, and bob marley expressed his people's frustration at street level.
i believe that politics wasn't number one for him, but it was number one for him to make an explanation to people who didn't understand what was going on politically.
to all the people, all the ghetto people, from trench town and rum lane and matches lane.
these people who believed in him, he could explain it to them better than any politician could, what was goin' on politically, economically and culturally.
their protest came through music and the song, and they said what they disagreed with and what they agreed with.
and so you could find out really how the people were thinking by what they sang.
it was one way by which you could gauge the people.
in opposition was the jamaica labour party, led by the right-wing, pro-american edward seaga.
there is no question about the fact that music is intertwined with politics.
every public meeting begins and ends with music, and music is interspersed right throughout.
and the sounds reflect what happenings are taking place in political life.
you wouldn't be able to separate politics and music, in terms of the extent to which they are interwoven as a form of message.
this is a music say that to black and white oppressors, to all oppressors, we are dealing with human beings, with the purpose why god create man in the first place.
in the mid- '70s, kingston was divided into political territories controlled by warlords.
many believed the cia was supporting the right-wing edward seaga with money, guns and propaganda to bring down the so-called communist government.
we knew that the violence that came up during those years
and he named michael manley and named me as having said things about the americans' interference and against the cia.
he said "dudley, take it from me, i know of no cia at all operating in jamaica."
i believe the cia was using the jamaican labour party as its instrument in the entire campaign against the michael manley government.
i'd say most of the violence was coming from the jamaica labour party side and behind them was the cia in terms of getting the weapons in, and getting the money in, with all the propaganda guidance,
because there was a steady stream, a continuous campaign of propaganda against the manley government.
the weapons... there was no problem with getting weapons in because the ganja smuggling was a perfect route for bringing weapons back into jamaica from the united states.
the cia would look upon the radical political content of reggae music as dangerous, because it would help to create a consciousness among poor people, among the great majority of jamaicans.
and naturally, the climate was created for an attempt on bob marley's life.
bob invited further trouble when he agreed to a government request to front a free concert called "smile jamaica".
while marley dreamed of uniting his people with music, the politicians planned to use bob as their pawn and manipulate the wailers to support new elections.
bob is a musician who wants to play for the people.
but these guys try to see if they can get their thing going and they're not worried about how dangerous that is gonna be for bob.
and we went out and we saw bob coming and he got shot in his elbow.
then we heard police sirens and everything was happenin', and i said
it happened to satisfy some people and it happened to strengthen me.
my life no important to me, but other people life important.
my life is only important if me can help plenty people.
if me, my life is just for me and my own security, then me no want it.
though marley was not expected to appear, the crowd began building early and by 5pm was 50,000 strong.
we have just received word that bob is on his way.
we'll be out of communication for a bit, but get the cameras ready for his arrival.
prime minister manley brazenly attended the concert to show his support for bob marley.
to escape further attempts on his life and revise his position in this struggle, he went to england.
while preparing his new "exodus" album, bob lived in london, not with his wife, but with a jamaican beauty queen.
i had never met anyone like bob, when i met him.
he wasn't the smooth talker in terms of what your normal suitor would have been.
you know, his idea of a gift might have been a mango.
0r just very coy ways of inviting you to come outside and have a walk in the evening.
it didn't matter how beautiful you were or how keenly he seemed interested the day before.
you could easily fall to zero priority if there happened to be a new song.
and so i was stubborn, and i don't know why i did it, but i was just sayin'
"i'm gonna show you something - that i can be myself."
it was in '76 that bob really became a superstar in europe and a household name in england.
suddenly you go from small island girl to being splashed all over the front page of every newspaper you get in london.
and not just that, but tied in with someone like bob, who was a very controversial character.
and they tended to highlight, of course, anything they thought was negative about his character and his personality.
"watch those this." then i became the watch i, the mother-hen type.
he would call me sometimes to get girls out of his room.
bob returned to jamaica in 1978, after 14 months of exile in london.
he was determined to have another go at holding a free concert - one that could bring peace and reconciliation to his divided island.
we try to bring peace, knowing that we really can't solve the problem with a war, you know?
does it really solve a problem, you know, if you, like, really killin' someone?
what bob made happen was the "0ne love" peace concert, intended to bring together the warring politicians in front of their people.
for bob, it was a way to reassert his place in jamaican life after a year abroad.
could we have up here, on stage here, the presence of mr michael manley and mr edward seaga?
i just wanna shake hands and show the people that we gonna meet 'em right.
manley arrived, to cement what seemed a unique moment in jamaican history.
but the grand "0ne love" gesture was destined to change little for the people.
political, yes, in that he was one of the most articulate troubadours of the ghetto, its suffering, its pressures, that i have ever heard.
and the interesting thing is that as he grew in stature, as he became a millionaire, one often wondered
"will he tend to go soft, to become gimmicky, to try to appeal to a more commercial market?"
jamaica's first international superstar now wanted, above all, to show his fellow countrymen he hadn't sold out.
bob was able to show he was his own man by using his immense wealth to build his own studios at home, in 56 hope road.
this meant he could also turn his back on the recording industry that had exploited him as a youth.
bob started tuff gong so he could gain the reins of control over his own work.
so that he could produce his own material at his own pace.
if he got an inspiration at night, he could go down to the studio and record it right on the spot, and so that he could reap the rewards of his work instead of a producer who paid him pennies.
when bob arrived in jamaica, within minutes - literally minutes - 56 hope road would be filled with people.
you could hardly find a way to walk through the yard.
and the crowds spilled over onto the street, down the road.
bob spent hours - hours - especially at night, interviewing people in need.
at that time there was a lot of political violence, and a lot of women lost their fathers because of this.
not only with respect to his art and craft, as an artist, writer, musician, but he didn't tolerate indiscipline around him.
he was very bright, although he didn't like people to think that he was.
he tried to portray a different picture, but he was extremely shrewd.
because i really try set up certain, like a machine, where financially we can really help one another.
so he injured a toenail and he wouldn't give it a chance to heal.
and that was when they detected the melanoma, the skin cancer.
bob always believed that the power of his lyrics could change political systems and carry the message of rastafari back to its homeland.
above all, bob despised the apartheid system which then existed in south africa.
they used a thick pen on the cover, so that we'd never see the title itself.
and then, on the lp itself, then they scooped the title so that it's just not there.
0n the track they used a sharp instrument, either a knife or a razor, and just cut it across, cut it across, so that when you play it, the needle will go from track to track
and you'll never understand what it's all about on the track.
bob had continued to ignore the cause of his increasing ill health.
i know there are stories and i know there is the possibility that they were planning to kill bob.
and the cia and other forces who might have wanted bob to be silenced.
but it was at this time that bob discovered that he had melanoma.
to most people who are very conservative in dress, you look quite strange.
even if the ganja-smoking marley, ripped out of his head most of the day, seems hard to take seriously, even though the temptation is to laugh at a stoned jamaican musician who worships a dead ethiopian dictator,
bob marley's view of the plight of the black man is hard to knock.
you know, everybody wanted a piece of him and they took a piece of him.
and there was hardly any left for him when he really needed it for himself.
i remember speaking' to him in the morning sometimes and... he wouldn't reply.
0n sunday, september 21, 1980, after two nights at madison square garden,
bob was jogging in central park and collapsed and began frothing at the mouth, and they carried him back to the hotel, took him to a doctor, and the doctor found that the melanoma, which had been diagnosed three years earlier,
and he was... he was moving, because bob wasn't going to accept death.
we knew it was a transition that was in god's hand.
you don'thave to blind me to... stop me from selling chestnuts ltwas thenthe vietnam war... and american sailors keptpouring in
those bargirls inthe famous bars... were allwearing mini skirts lflwere blind duringthattime...
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
what, did you want him to open this place with plastic cups and paper plates?
mack murdock was tired of plastic cups and paper plates... and bleary-eyed broads with yellow teeth.
this trip to chinatown was like a ride on a neon horse.
the hot sounds, the smell of grease crashing in on him.
we won't pay protection money to the lung chin... so they came and shot up our restaurant.
i called because i have no one else i can trust.
assuming we can get there without running into one of lung chin's roadblocks.
in case you hadn't noticed... we have more eyes on us than a truckload of idaho spuds.
something that was ringing a lot of gongs from one end of my gut to the other.
if you don't shut up, i'm gonna ring your gong for good!
no matter how much cologne i splashed on it, you couldn't get away from one fact:
this whole crazy caper set mack murdock... on the track of the maltese cow.
i want to speak to the men you are sending out today.
they will be here for instructions in 20 minutes, wan chu.
objective number two... is revenge for the insult brought upon the lung chin today.
the golden pagoda restaurant must be destroyed... as well as all the people who own it.
if we catch thomas with the lung chin, we bust their bubble.
but it's gonna be difficult to get there... especially since it's wide-open spaces.
tell him we got a man seeing cows up in sanders' office.
we may not have your names, yet, buddy... but we've got your prints.
so in a few minutes, we'll tell you what your names are.
what's the matter, getting a little heat 'cause you missed thomas?
i mean they're going up in flames... because they missed the chris thomas bust.
listen, the captain's coming in in a minute... and i don't wanna seem like i got the shakes or anything.
we're so lucky one of those cops didn't recognize us back there.
hey hannibal, you almost got us put away for good, man, being on the jazz.
one day i had this gonzo headache... and before it went away, i could read and speak chinese.
and it was a bad afternoon, too, let me tell you.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
mack murdock was tired of plastic cups and paper plates... and bleary-eyed broads with yellow teeth.
this trip to chinatown was like a ride on a neon horse.
the hot sounds, the smell of grease crashing in on him.
he remembered sam yeng and that night in saigon... when he and the a-team huddled in the basement of sam's house... and rocket fire blew holes in the walls... and it was scorched into his memory.
assuming we can get there without running into one of lung chin's roadblocks.
in case you hadn't noticed... we have more eyes on us than a truckload of idaho spuds.
something that was ringing a lot of gongs from one end of my gut to the other.
if you don't shut up, i'm gonna ring your gong for good!
no matter how much cologne i splashed on it, you couldn't get away from one fact:
this whole crazy caper set mack murdock... on the track of the maltese cow.
now, if you'd taken the trouble to look... you'd find that i've got an eight-round 9 mm pointed at you... under the table.
now, the question is... which one of us is gonna get hurt the worst if we open fire?
that's all we can do, but you gotta meet us halfway.
look, i know it's not much... but it's a whole lot better than letting that club you're in walk all over your life.
they will be here for instructions in 20 minutes, wan chu.
if this succeeds, ling, the future of your sons will be secured.
friends of the golden pagoda restaurant... here to collect what you owe for damages.
plus repair costs, general abuse... this comes to about $1 1,000.
the golden pagoda restaurant must be destroyed... as well as all the people who own it.
if such a threat to us goes unanswered, we will lose face... and mr. thomas will not let us handle his drug business in this city.
but it's gonna be difficult to get there... especially since it's wide-open spaces.
it would help if the guards were faced in the other direction.
we may not have your names, yet, buddy... but we've got your prints.
so in a few minutes, we'll tell you what your names are.
listen, the captain's coming in in a minute... and i don't wanna seem like i got the shakes or anything.
so, have you got somebody that can run an extra uniform up here for me?
we're so lucky one of those cops didn't recognize us back there.
hey hannibal, you almost got us put away for good, man, being on the jazz.
one day i had this gonzo headache... and before it went away, i could read and speak chinese.
and it was a bad afternoon, too, let me tell you.
and now it is unsafe for us to have you here any longer.
the men who were captured at the boat know where we are.
twelve weeks with nothing to do, and the sun's shining already.
hey, it's like when you were little, in the garden in your underpants.
and you used to put fruit down them and pretend to be pirates.
then, when your parents went out, you used to take off your clothes and wriggle around in the sandpit.
one of the great things about summer is tea on the lawn.
unless you're an ant, in which case, it's a real bottomer.
i mean, yes, but you're not allowed to ask me directly.
you say something like, "were you the first man on the moon?"
actually, i don't think she'll be making any more shepherd's pies.
and daddy, so he's an old square and votes tory, but he's got where he is by hard slog, and he's got to put tax concessions first.
women want me and will pay, so keep your phony morality!
it's dog-eat-cat, and you won't find me in a tin of pedigree chum.
i've just been to get mine early, because i'm such a girlie swot.
i knew i was going to do brilliantly, and i did.
and if we join one queue, the other is bound to start moving quickly.
if we join that one, then the other one will start moving quickly.
whichever queue we're in, the guy in front will be from a penny arcade cashing up millions of pennies.
all right, mr real robber, the manager will see you now.
i'm aboard the freedom bus, heading for good time city, and i haven't even paid my fare!
look, we need to pick up some great girls whose car has broken down, and they can cook and clean.
your tutor said that if you don't turn up again next year, then he and the dean might reconsider your grant.
well, tell him that i've still got the photographs of him and the dean.

all i say is, we still don't know why you're scrobbling all these clergymen.
the box has disappeared - either at seekings, perhaps at the bishop's palace at tatchester - and until it is recovered, not one of them will be released!
if the box is not delivered to me by midnight tonight,
i will stop their precious ceremony if it's the last thing i do!
1,000 for the return of the bishop, with reduced sums for all the rest.
it's 25 quid even for a choirboy, and we scrobbled a lot of those.
it won't be quite you, but a shadow of you that goes.
if we from here can call you strongly enough through the sleeping you that remains, you may - no certainty - but you may get safely back.
one good whack with this will let the shadow out that's tucked away inside him.
let's hang the sculpin up by his heels till the shadow falls out of him, i say!
that box is very powerful and has caused no end of trouble in my own time.
if you would only come and take it back into ancient time, it wouldn't exist in our time, and no one could claim it.
you mean i've come all this way into the past for nothing?
i nearly got myself killed by soldiers and little boats on big oceans!
10 apiece from our last bank robbery, then the whole thing will pass off as a rag.
- it will tell in our favour if we come to be tried.
not to put too fine a point on it, that's exactly what we're doing to him, eh?
it would serve him right if we just carried off the whole boxful!
"remember when one was used to get you out of trouble?" they teased.
james tried to get his own back by talking about engines who got shut up in tunnels.
"l wish i was going with you," said james. "l'd love to pull the express."
gordon, with much noise, got ready to back onto the train.
you are probably wondering what i am doing behind that tree.
well, i will tell you, but listen very carefully because i shall say this only once.
you will remember that i own a cafe which is being used by the resistance for hiding escaping british airmen.
well, everybody seems to know about this except my wife's mother and the gestapo.
and up to now i have had a better relationship with the gestapo.
now, those two men disguised as scarecrows are, in fact, british airmen.
--did not fit and are now on their way back to london by tiger moth.
the second reason, the uniforms are being made in london by a jewish tailor, which is against the rules in the german army.
oh, and the gestapo are also looking for a painting of the fallen madonna with the big, um-- by von clomp.
this is also winging its way across the channel in order that a copy can be made so that the original can become the personal property of the colonel, who is as bent as a corkscrew.
hans, we are german officers, part of the great army that is winning the war.
we do not help the resistance to blow up our supply lines.
if we help them blow up the railway, von klinkerhoffen's train will not arrive, so we won't have to meet it, so we won't have to wear our uniforms, so he won't know we haven't got them.
and if you don't cooperate, we will shoot you, and hide your corpses in the copse.
do you think this would be a good time to tell them we are german officers?
