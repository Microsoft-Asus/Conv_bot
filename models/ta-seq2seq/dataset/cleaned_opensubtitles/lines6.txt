has been convicted for the illegal possession of firearms violating use of explosives laws, etc.
worked at torajima animation company until last year but was fired for nearly killing an assistant animation director and was taken in by unoyama.
in a movie, people tend to want to spill their guts.
it's true that a lot of truths are in what's spilled but things that could nauseate you are also in there.
itoh was one of those who was caught up in such an illusion.
a screenwriter tends to fall into a lonely dialogue with his movie.
it causes him to isolate himself, to feel stagnated and frustrated and eventually it invites a situation where he ends up spilling his guts out.
that's precisely why one should make a movie by communicating with others.
by the time this animation is discovered, i will probably have left this world.
someone nailed my apartment door shut, making it impossible for me to get out.
to speak about a character always involves a certain type of difficulty.
that is because, when speaking about a character one is more vulnerable, is strongly urged by one's unconsciousness and without even realizing it, is forced to take an ideological standpoint.
as you know, the audience usually understands the roles in the story such as heroes and villains, through cinematic figures called "personas" or the instance of "specific roles performed by actors" as well as the instance of the individuals who are identifiable and have inner human rights.
however, in animation actors serving as actual entities of these "personas" do not exist.
not to mention ordinary people, but animals, plants, monsters, aliens and even desks and chairs and melon bread or even a gunk can, as an existence that has inner personality and a specific role in a certain story, can be created.
a dream character can be anything and can be drawn in any way.
a character that a real actor cannot play, even if he tried.
however, because of this unlimited possibility animation characters are forced to suffer from not being able to shoulder the ideological demands placed upon them.
the planning meeting gets entangled, the director gets mad the animation director is called names, the sponsor is cursed and the fans send razor blades.
a character is drawn by multiple animators and does not bear the slightest resemblance.
after all, is a character an existence which, using images as a catalyst and propagates itself inside the mind of the audience an existence without substance?
is it an image reinforced by countless episodes and situations and nothing more?
a character doesn't need a persona or a specific instance of a mysterious air of a certain character which is emitted as the sediment of the persona because it's absent.
a character who is never exposed to the eyes of an audience although recognized as an inner personality.
a character defined solely by the intention of the creator a pure and ultimate existence.
but, after having shut myself up in the apartment, waiting for death as i am now what comes to my mind is something exactly opposite.
so it was right after the mutilation murder of itoh and 5 days before aya and tsuya's drawings.
i wonder if it's a serial murder case by the same killer.
and thereafter take a role in the story by taking actions.
with no memories of himself, prior to acting out his story of the time when he was still unborn.
then, after speaking his scripted, magnificent lines he starts taking actions.
movie-making, though i hesitate to say so, is not a fixed occupation.
in movies, their inner thoughts are also expressed and told as voices.
indeed, by speaking the characters have freed themselves from the silent movies' world of excessive and stylized gestures and pushed themselves up from being merely performers who play certain roles to that of personas.
and it is also a sabbath of the heretics with a picture-less film placed in the altar as their idol.
in the world of animation, the true ruler of the work who can control not only a character's life and death but also its entire existence, including how its innermost mind works is none other than the sound director.
in his presence, even the director himself is just a mere technician whose onlyjob is to design the images and oversee the production.
what should be looked for in a director is not creativity but rather an ability to manage the production.
it's true, in the history of movies voices were always subordinate to the images.
and at the same time, regardless of circumstances they dominated the images as the voice of truth and put them in their proper order.
that tacit agreement between creators and audience is indeed the spell of voices from which movies cannot get free.
that's the trap movies walked into right on their own by having pretended to assume the air of reality.
you merely stretched the interpretation of the movies' fate as a means of expression.
this is also the limitation of the system because a movie is defined by what comes after it.
however, when a certain type of image is tied with music it becomes something alluring that could contain the danger of ruining a person.
that's why music must be kept as a faithful partner of the images.
like i said, you can't get away by just saying "you can't finish it."
i told you, your crying there ain't gonna do any good.
the victims, every one of them talked their heads off about movies before being killed.
if ourjob is to materialize my predecessor's intentions and if the murder's goal is to hinder us then i can't say for the life of me that he's being efficient.
because, there is no relationship whatsoever between seeing it and describing it in words.
to watch a movie, to have watched a movie to talk about a movie one has watched, and to talk about watching a movie.
they say all of lenin's ideas were formed while he was outside russia.
in those days, the russian people suffered from hunger but lenin himself was riding a bike in the mountains near zurich.
from here to there, and from there to here, we'rejust moving.
what a movie always protests is "a different place and a different space."
the evil hands of the faceless killer began to reach out toward the other members of the staff.
the next day, kawai the composer who had been frightened by the shadow of death and gone into hiding was found drowned in yugawara, where he had run away.
yet, the movie had to be propelled forward without a moment to spare.
however, on that day i was beginning to understand the true nature of the strange feeling that had constantly clung to me since i first set foot in this studio.
and, hiding something important tamiko, my assistant, was probably keeping a watch over me.
and, it's possible because of his obsession with the production handawara came back as a zombie.
with the ability to swallow them all, a movie can be an incomplete system.
what's important isn't a narrative consistency between cuts that are connected together.
l-i took this job 'cause i heard it was an entertaining film.
but the very person who set up this whole thing is absent.
the true inventor of the movies was louis aime augustine le prince.
on september 16, 1890, after visiting his siblings in dijon, he got on a train going back to paris and nobody ever saw him again.
now that the story has been developed around the mystery that's the only way it can come to an end.
although, whether it will be the confession from the mastermind of this whole thing, or a mystery-solving clue is yet to be known.
you and i, who are appearing in this movie in order to materialize his intentions, are nothing but characters in the story.
the one who remains standing in the end to tell the truth it's neither you or me.
i forced you all to play along with such an obsession and i'm sorry about that.
he never returned to normal, but his work is going out into the world.
you can skip the passages on his garden, unless you're keen on growing heartier beets.
are you sure this is how you wanna spend your vacation?
xander has a piece of you that oz just can't touch.
i guess now it's just about showing oz that he comes first.
i don't wanna hurt you, angel, but you have to understand.
cruelty is the only thing you ever had a true talent for.
i hate that it's so hard, and that you can hurt me so much.
i know everything that you did because you did it to me.
it's what we have to do and we can do it together.
but if you're too much of a coward for that, then burn.
if i can't convince you that you belong in this world, then i don't know what can.
but do not expect me to watch, and don't expect me to mourn for you, because...
it's gonna be sunny and warm with temperatures continuing in the high 70s throughout the holiday weekend.
* remember christ our savior was born on christmas day *
he's still kinda twitchy when it comes to the subject of angel.
it must be that whole "angel killed his girlfriend and tortured her" thing.
i thought you slept outside to avoid your family's drunken christmas fights.
yes, and that was a confidence i was hoping you would share with everyone.
faith and i don't really hang out or talk or make eye contact lately.
do you really wanna let her spend christmas eve all by herself in that dingy little motel room?
are you sure this is how you wanna spend your christmas vacation?
yeah, this is actually the most exciting thing i've got planned.
xander has a piece of you that oz just can't touch.
i guess now it's just about showing oz that he comes first.
you grabbed me, and i thought, "who would go to so much trouble to arrange them like that?"
but you see... that's what makes you different than other beasts.
they'd be holed up somewhere summoning the spirit of the first.
well, i heard a few things, you know, from the underground.
apparently there's been a lot of migration out of sunnydale from the lower inhabitants.
something's scaring them off... and these are things that aren't easily scared.
* too much of anything is not good for you, baby *
you ever have that dream where you're in a play... and you really don't know your lines, and you kind of don't know the plot?
angel, you have the power to do real good, to make amends.
but if you die now, then all that you ever were was a monster.
and while most of southern california is enjoying a balmy christmas... an extreme cold front has sprung up out of nowhere around sunnydale, where they are reporting heavy snowfall for the first time in, well, ever.
sunnydale residents shouldn't expect to see the sun at all today.

- i think what pacey's actually saying is that we're not exactly the school dance type.
- we'd rather watch a movie about a high school dance than actually set foot in an over-decorated gym.
'cause i really want to see who's responsible for kevin bacon's rougueish, devil-maker, hair do.
- you mean you would rather watch a movie about something than doing it yourselves?
you're going to the homecoming dance to hit on somebody else's boyfriend?
- well, my guidance counselor told me to set goals for myself.
- well, how about acknowledging me when you see me outside, huh!
- promise me we will never air a relationship crisis about anything like that.
- i think because we wanted to ease into the subject... to make the transition from friend to lover..unconfusing.
- ah, if we are confused about the transition from friend to lover,
- no, actually we were talking about the dance, and, hey, if you guys don't mind, i'd really like to invite my brother jack to come along.
you know, he's kind of a loner and i think it would be good for him.
- well, i know things got a little out of hand the other night, and, well,
i'm not sure what the segway is here, but your mother and i... after much talk, after much consideration, have decided...
- your mother and i have decided to spend some time apart.
- well, it looks like you two have given this quite a bit of careful thought.
- so my dad drove off leaving my mom crying over the kitchen sink.
god, what i wouldn't give now for them to go back to their coffee table sex antics.
in fact, i don't even think we should be having this conversation.
- did i mention that you weren't supposed to follow me?
i'm not going to apoligize for it, man, cause truth is,
i'd do it again so let's just not make this into a high school romp alright?
- well, if you need a boost you came to the right place.
i know about 800 guys who would line up to replace brett if he exited the picture.
i never realized just how big our house was until tonight.
i, um, i can still call it our house, can't i?
- use who i am against me to divert from the fact you screwed up.
- i said i was sorry what else do you want me to say?

there's only one hirogen in sick bay with the doctor, but the corridors outside are heavily guarded.
that's our first objective-- disable the interfaces-- but we'll need help.
the battle is concentrated here in holodeck 1, but the fighting has spilled out onto decks 5 and 6.
and it looks like a group of holographic americans is invading deck 7.
we think it's a secret compound the nazis built after they took over the city.
what i don't understand is how they managed to camouflage it so well.
it's heavily guarded, but with your help, i can get close enough to set off some explosives.
my orders are to blow the entire compound before the germans send in reinforcements.
i saw technology in there you can't begin to imagine-- warheads powerful enough to destroy this entire valley if they're accidentally detonated.
call for an air strike, may be the last call you make.
we're going to need something a lot more effective than these old firearms.
i believe i can enhance these weapons using borg technology, but i'll have to access cargo bay 2.
there's not a day goes by when i don't think to myself,
"l'm going to get 'em back safely even if i die trying."
well, by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there won't be much of a trophy left, will there?
perhaps i should kill you and find someone who will cooperate.
with the safety protocols off- line, the pursuit is just as challenging.
oh, i understand what you're trying to do, but then...why have you been torturing us?
why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation after another?
i've been studying your behavior as i do with all my prey, but your holodecks allowed me to go further-- to explore your culture, your history.
you will do as he says... as long as i tell you to.
i don't know how much longer i can stand being trapped in here.
the blazing white circle of the sun that sanctified that blood.
no one can deny us, no power on earth or beyond-- not the christian savior, not the god of the jews.

i will hunt down and kill every member of your crew.
well, by then this ship will be damaged beyond repair and there won't be much of a trophy left, will there?
your holodeck technology might offer us an alternative-- a new way of life.
instead of scattering ourselves across the quadrant in pursuit of prey, we could simulate the hunt and give ourselves a chance to rebuild our civilization.
oh, i understand what you're trying to do, but then...why have you been torturing us?
why have you thrown my crew into one brutal simulation after another?
i'll call a cease-fire and we can try to contain the damage.
i want my ship back, but in return, i will give you what you need to create the holodeck technology.

general o'neill's helicopter is unharmed and on it's way again –
we know the ancients on earth were suffering from a plague.
maybe some of them were trying to start over- seeding life in a new galaxy.
this isn't just some other civilization we're talking about, these are the gate builders.
the potential wealth of knowledge and technology, it outweighs anything we've come across since we stepped through the stargate.
but the benefit to humanity is far greater than the risk, general.
and it is a risk that every one of my expedition members is willing to take.
we could be on our way to discovering an entirely new ancient civilization.
best case scenario, we meet actual ancients who are willing to help us.
and i think people who don't wanna go thru the stargate are equally as whacked.
now if you can't give me a 'yes' by the time we reach mcmurdoch, i don't even want you.
i'm going to another planet, in another galaxy, by means of a device called a stargate.
millions of years ago there was a race of beings we call the ancients they created a network of these stargate throughout our galaxy, in order to travel freely among their worlds we don't know why, but the left for another galaxy somewhere between 5 and 10 million years ago taking their entire city along with them.

so if we are able to achieve a stable wormhole, we're not gonna risk shutting the gate down.
now every one of you volunteered for this mission, and you represent over a dozen countries.
you are the world's best and brightest, and in light of the adventure we are about to embark on,
in time, a thousand worlds bore the fruit of life in this form.
then one day our people step foot on a dark world where a terrible enemy slept.
the enemy fed upon the defenseless human worlds like a great scourge, until finally only atlantis remained.
this city's great shield was powerful enough to withstand their terrible weapons, but here we were besieged for many years.
in an effort to save the last of our kind we submerged our great city into the ocean.
the atlantis stargate was the one and only link back to earth from this galaxy, and those who remained used it to return to that world that was once home.
there, the last survivors of atlantis lived out the remainder of their lives.
this city was left to slumber in the hope that our kind would one day return.
well the ancient greeks must have heard it from one of the surviving ancients.
i don't like the fact that they got their asses kicked.
two are entirely depleted and the third is reaching maximum entropy.
when it does, it'll die too and nothing can reverse that.
see here, and here, where the shield has already failed and the city is flooded.
it could have happened years ago, this section is probably more protected because of the stargate.
the malp reads full viability and no immediate signs of activity around the stargate, but its pitch black.
for now, we're going to use the tried and true system of identification for inbound gate travelers.
feel free to speak up, i'm just trying to break the ice.
these people can't help us, i'd rather not waste the time.
we may need a safe place to stay for a while.
our people have long believed that the wraith will come if we venture into the old city.
look, i don't care what they say, that city's worth a look.
not to mention the possibility there could be zpms there that they don't know or care about.
what if the wraith are the enemy the ancient hologram lady is talking about?
all the more reason for us to have a defensible position should we need to abandon atlantis.
and probably would have kept going for years more, but our arrival changed that.
now it's nothing more but a thin shell between the buildings and the water.
and when that number reaches a certain point they return to cull their human herd.
sometimes a few hundred years will pass before they awaken again.
the city is sacrificing parts of itself in order to maintain these main areas, but catastrophic failure is inevitable.
not in my wildest dreams did i hope to find the lost city of the ancients so completely untouched, so pristine... and we have no choice but to walk away from this?
life support systems are working, but the planet's atmosphere is breathable, not withstanding the inevitable allergens.
so now could our naquada generators supply enough power to the shield for defensive purposes?
i'm acutely aware of that major, but thank you for reinforcing it.
when can you tell me where the wraith took colonel sumner and the others?
if i'm not back in 20 minutes, blow the cells and get out.
you're the only one who can fly these people out of here.
- we can't go out 'cause i wasn't wearing any pants?
you're still too immature to understand you can't go around like that?
but that guy bengt who was the king of the class then, he'd became nothing.
and those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class they weren't noteworthy at all anymore.
then i usually pour in more milk, but then the glass isn't big enough.

you should be glad you're not someone who has it easy who has no problems, because those people are often uninteresting.
but if you are a lesbian or it's also called homosexual, then maybe two woman like each other.
instead of like with mum and dad where it's a man and a woman.
1. that i won't have to have a party 2. that elin will look at me
3. that elin will fall in love with me i love elin!
and those girls who were regarded as the prettiest in the class... ..they weren't noteworthy at all anymore.

why don't we go someplace we can get some room service?
you know, i don't usually do this on company time, but you look a lot more educational than my management performance seminar.
now, he happens to inform me that if this ben dyson genius were to be kidnapped,
dyscape has 4 million dollars allotted to the immediate payout of ransom money.
police are now on the scene at 351 park circle, where computer giant ben dyson was kidnapped earlier today.
found dead in his apartment was mrs. patricia hornbeck, wife of senator rupert hornbeck.
we are fully prepared to meet the kidnappers' demands by tomorrow, as specified in this note, and to deliver the 4 million dollars in cash to whatever location they specify in exchange for mr. dyson.
a call is supposed to be made to this office at 8 p.m. tonight.
we are glad to be of assistance to the authorities as much as we see fit, but we will not,
i repeat, will not in any way stall, mislead, or trick the kidnappers.
clearly, you know that you're the last person to see mrs. hornbeck alive.
i'm very sorry that you have to recap the incident only hours after it happened.
i beg you all, from the deepest... part of my soul, to find these degenerates.
i want them prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
that's only if you assume we're not going to get him.
giving you all the credit in the world, i still look at it both ways.
i don't know what your angle is, and frankly i don't give a damn.
if smearing the names of stand-up citizens is your investigation, then maybe chief bleeker could find you a job in one of the tabloids.
anyway, we were going to hit this supermarket that junior worked at.
i didn't really know him, but jiminy said he was a stand-up guy.
i was starting to see little future in the relationship, so i broke in alone and met junior by the liquor boxes.
meat freezer connected with the regular storage area, and he'd chosen to hide out there during close-up.
so what else could junior and i do but get drunk?
we spent the night swapping stories, made a deal to change the world.
i'll never forget the fresh smell of blood and the rawness of flesh.
it was right then and there that i knew i was in love.
i don't know what ever gave you the idea you were dealing with a child.
i'm not sure dyson would be amused by your incompetence and disregard.
just give me a straight yes or no and i'll play dumb with this whole scam.
i ain't looking to get promoted and i ain't looking to get killed.
and if this woman is involved, she is some kind of genius.
i don't know about you guys, but you are on your own.
you know, like i thought, they'd do it like in the movies.
you know, they put the top layer in and fill the rest with newspapers.
i just wonder what it feels like, i mean, besides the fear and the bad uncertain aspect.
i wonder if you get any sense of inner revelations, or, i don't know, empowerment?
i mean, because after all, you know, you are going to spend years in therapy after this ordeal, right?
hey, what's that short story of that scientist who spends all that time creating the first computer, the most perfect, complicated machine.
and he works and he works until finally it's done, and...
and he turns it on, and... the first question he asked the computer is "is there a god?", and the computer says...
i'm starting to think life isn't much of a bargain to begin with.
the more i live, the less i learn, the less i know, the more i regret.
i've done things i never dreamed of doing and lived to tell.
maybe it's true that we can all get a fresh start somehow.
i want them to stand trial with all of that means.
then i make a new law which we can call it.
you must think that you die because you think we are crazy.
i want to know what you feel, but fear and insecurity and so on.
my love life's not much better than yours, but you don't see me going off the deep end.
did it ever occur to you that this recent antique buying binge is nothing but a way of sublimating your frustrated sexual desires?
people would call me and say, "marty, when's the next marty party?"
"isn't it time for another marty party?" "had a great time at the last one".
and at first i said no way, but then i thought a lot of other guys do it.
what better place to try it than here where nobody knows who i am.
i don't think i've ever seen a face more purely happy than right now.
little alice, how i wish you could wake up right now and see how beautiful your mother looks.
can't take two steps without seeing my reflection somewhere, getting older, and fatter.
whoever said fat people age slower must be skinny as hell!
then they stick a little vacuum in your navel, and suck out all the fat.
i know a woman who had the vacuum thing done on herthighs.
he lives on the top floor of an old building... that is still a distinguished central adress.
the furnishings are quietly modern... parquet floors, simple furniture, functional lighting.
let's say he goes haywire for a little power... or a medal or money... a form of power.
it'd be a shame if women followed men in their folly.
you wake up one day, look in a mirror and say:
"l've aged." you go outside... and the young call you mister.
you like good food, you get fat... you get lazy, stop going out.
still, despite the physical decay... you feel as energetic as a boy.

this is the alleged murder that has caused such an uproar in the unites states and around the world.
this scene occurred in a hospital room of army capt. lucas johnson.
president thompson has been working around the clock to reach an acceptable compromise with the taelon synod.
ladies and gentlemen, the american companion da'an and president of the united states mr. thompson.
obviously, the companions won't be too favorable upon you for helping to convict one of their own.
are you suggesting that i might alter my testimony to help rho'ha?
you argued that our refusal to allow rho'ha to be tried in a human court would damage our relations with the people of earth.
however, once we agree to let the trial proceed, we are obligated to abide by the result.
our defense will be that you acted in self-defense, because major macintire threatened to kill you.
will the human jury believe that a taelon was truly in fear for his life from a human?
but i could never have committed such a violent act without being under the influence of capt. johnson's unrestrained rage.
i am truly ashamed for having caused the death of this human being.
you'd have to go back to o.j. simpson trial of 1995 to find a case that has captivated the entire world as this one has.
jonathan, why have you never told me that you had a son?
it is a circus atmosphere here today on day one of the rho'ha trial.
the voir dire process has been completed and a jury has been selected.
we are told that the jury will consist of seven women and five men.
however, the defense has filed a motion concerning the makeup of the jury.
your honor, the constitution guarantees a trial by jury of your peers.
certainly a jury comprised solely of humans could not be considered the defendant's peers.
your honor, when this crime was committed, the defendant was living and working here on earth.
so, when the defendant killed major macintire his peers were human.
furthermore, i exercise my preemptory challenges to reject potential taelon jurors at question.
i am loath to upset the complex procedures involved in selecting a jury.
i'd say the same thing to my own son, but he's not a target for some lunatic looking to make a name for himself.
hey, i'm not arguing, but you've always been there to protect me.
if all the human members of the jury are in favor of a conviction and only zo'or wants to hold out for an acquittal, the public will not be satisfied.
i can assure you that the synod has instructed zo'or to exercise his judgment in accordance with human principles.
then why was it so important to have a taelon on the jury?
why do you continue to question my strategy in this case?
this is my solemn promise... no one... shall sit in judgment... over you.
captain, did you see what motivated rho'ha to attack major macintire?
so, if i had done the same, then yes, i would be responsible.
captain, how would you react to the endangerment of one of your soldiers?
and the most solid defense arguments today were made not by lead counsel ronald sandoval, but surprisingly by second sheriff william boone.
mr. boone elicited testimony suggesting that the defendant may well have acted in self-defense, in the killing on major macintire.
trust me, he'll jump at the chance to discredit the taelons if it helps him win.
this is our chance to show the world what the taelons are doing.
i have one goal, and that is to prove to the world that we are a nation of laws.
and that true freedom can only exist where everyone, including the taelons, are bound by those laws.
do you think the judge is going to declare a mistrial?
well, i can't really comment on that right now, can i?
and the stunning revelations in the rho'ha trial today have reverberated throughout the world.
concerned citizens are demanding to know if there's truth to the allegations of secret taelon experiments.
chief justice hill has ruled that no additional evidence on the alleged taelon experimentation can be admitted.
the judge agreed with the defense contention that all of mr. doors's evidence was uncorroborated.
yet major macintire, a decorated si veteran, did not have time to fire even a single shot, even though according to the defendant's own testimony,
the major entered the room with his weapon drawn, ready to fire!
to act in self-defense, one must believe one's life is in danger.
a taelon would never have to kill a human in self-defense, because humans do not have the ability to kill taelons.
and the world was rocked not once but twice, as the most watched trial in history ended in a guilty verdict.
chief justice hill has scheduled the formal sentencing of rho'ha for tomorrow.
well, the people have spoken, and they said clearly that everyone is accountable under the law.
did the jury need to return a death sentence to prove that point?
yes, but rho'ha shouldn't be put to death if he wasn't in control of his actions.
i believe that your legal system allows for recourse to a higher authority.
with all due respect, your honor, it would be unconscionable to frustrate the will of the jury that has so clearly spoken!
i'm not inclined to quash a good-faith request by the defense to present arguments.
i was under the impression that the synod wanted me to defend rho'ha.
it was the synod's desire that we operate within the bounds of human custom in this instance.
for purposes of this current motion, my burden is to demonstrate the fact that capital punishment does not violate public policy.
as a matter of fact, capital punishment is exercised in cultures throughout the world, including the united states, where this crime was committed!
because i can see that much of the world agrees that capital punishment is an appropriate punishment.
so i'm not here to argue for or against capital punishment.
i will not be responsible for approving the death sentence of a being i do not yet understand.
at some future point, we may determine that the death sentence is appropriate for a taelon.
your honor, the defense requests that rho'ha be remanded to the custody of the taelons for a reasonable period, sufficient to arrange his affairs.
your honor, the defendant has been convicted of a capital offense...
before making my argument i'd like to come clean with my lack of objectivity.
in addition to being an attorney i'm a citizen of the united states.
isn't this embarrassing, suing the man your wife left you for?
more pathetic would be to sit home and feel sorry for myself.
i heard him say, "would you dance with me for the rest of your life?"
the song playing was by the supremes, "someday we'll be together."
you take her to coffee and say you ache for her.
then you drop off a song called "he'll have to go"...
if two people love each other so powerfully they'll be together.
stick laws, a court, a judge, an old girlfriend between them they will still find a way to be together.
if you're angry because the one you love loves another more i understand it more than you know.
but anybody who has ever been truly, truly in love knows that my client had no choice.

[narrator] there is a place that is above all others... a place where dreams are chased above the clouds, a place where only the strong and lucky survive.
the top of the world, where the wind is fiercest, is a desolate, deathly place, where humans cannot live.
we call mount everest "chomolungma," for the goddess who lives on the summit.
for 50 years or more, those who tried to climb to the summit failed or died.
before he passed away, my father warned me about the dangers on everest.
but i always felt kind of a hunger inside to live up to his legend, so i have to try it.
he trains every day, even when he's on vacation in utah.
[viesturs] well, i brought together a team of highly skilled climbers... to assist a scientist who's studying the geology of the everest region.
this year, paula, my fiancée, will be our base camp manager.
we're going to everest just two weeks after we get married.
araceli segarra has climbed high mountains before, but she is best known for her skills as a rock climber.
[segarra] i like to go to the beach and just hang out, but i prefer climbing mountains.
in 1953, katmandu was the point of departure... for my father and hillary.
on march 15, my teammates and i gather here to make final plans.
[narrator] the climbers have come to katmandu... to help a scientist from england, roger bilham.
roger wants the team to place instruments high on mount everest... so he can study its geology.
we have three tons of gear all told, and probably half to two-thirds of that might be food.
it's been in my dreams, you know, ever since i was a kid, to climb it.
[segarra] this cargo helicopter cannot fly as high as base camp, but it gives us a head start, up to 9,000 feet.
from there, we will walk over 30 miles to the base of mount everest.
the rock in between was squeezed and piled up, forming the himalaya.
india is still pushing further underneath asia, so every year, mount everest grows about a quarter of an inch higher.
in a village like khumjung, few houses are built to withstand such tremors.
we can't forecast earthquakes, but perhaps, if our team succeeds in making a g.p.s. measurement on everest... that will make our earthquake data more accurate.
[narrator] on a ridge at almost 13,000 feet... is the remote buddhist monastery known as thyangboche.
[jamling] forty-three years ago, my father... stopped at this monastery to seek blessings to climb mount everest.
[narrator] the sherpas believe the mountain gods... protect those who honor them, but pride and arrogance can anger the gods... and cause great suffering, even death.
[viesturs] with a train of 60 yaks to carry our gear... we headed for base camp, 5,000 feet up from here.
just surviving at 29,000 feet is a challenge in light of this medical fact.
a person taken directly from sea level to the top of mount everest... would be unconscious in a few minutes, and dead soon thereafter.
you think about the people who died for the mountain we are going to climb.
[viesturs] on april 2, we reached the foot of mount everest.
[narrator] ed is concerned that there are too many teams on the mountain, and some of them show a critical lack of experience.
from this base of operations, jamling is in charge of organizing the loads... and sending them up with the strongest sherpas... the summit team.
above that is the steep and icy lhotse face, which rises nonstop for 4,000 feet.
the third danger zone is the southeast ridge, near the summit.
the icefall is a frozen river, about 500 feet deep, that surges downhill almost four feet a day.
some of the gigantic ice blocks weigh over 40 tons, and if they suddenly break loose they can crush you in a heartbeat.
[viesturs] on the icefall we use ladders a lot, which can take a little getting used to.
[segarra, laughing] i like to get my falling done early, because later on i don't like to fall again.
the sherpas say that if you fall in the crevasse, you will fall all the way to america.
[viesturs] after we climb through the icefall, we head towards middle camp, where we spend where we spend a few weeks acclimatizing.
if you go too high too soon, you risk getting edema, which is where your lungs begin to fill with fluid, and that can kill you.
[narrator] at middle camp, the climbers must begin to drink more water, which they get by melting snow.
right now the summit is being blasted by freezing, hurricane-force winds.
[viesturs] almost all year storms and high winds make everest unclimbable, but some time in may you may get a week of calm, clear weather, which then allows you to sort of sneak up to the summit.
it was still very windy up high, so i chose to sit tight.
it's not easy, watching other teams going up... and then wondering if perhaps you're missing your only chance of reaching the summit.
of the 12 other teams here, the largest is led... by my good friend rob hall from new zealand, a very experienced everest climber.
the memory of may 8, and the days that followed, will haunt me forever.
[narrator] two days later, most of the same climbers set out for the summit.
late on that fateful day, a fierce storm... slammed into the upper part of the mountain without warning.
[viesturs] over two dozen climbers were scattered along the route to the summit, many of them caught high on the mountain... much too high to get down safely.
[narrator] in the final hour of daylight a few climbers... fought their way back to the chaos of high camp, but for the rest it looked grim.
as the wind chill dropped to a hundred degrees below zero, seventeen climbers were still trapped on the mountain... including rob.
when night fell, most of the climbers hunkered down... just hoping to survive the night.
when paula called me that night, she reminded me... that rob's wife jan was seven months pregnant.
we were all struggling to face the fact... that we had friends high on the mountain in the storm, fighting for their lives, and that perhaps some of them weren't going to make it.
he'd beaten the odds and survived a night... of arctic winds at 28,000 feet.
rob just couldn't find the strength to move, but he wasn't ready to give up.
[narrator] just above the high camp, a climber named beck weathers had been out in the storm for over 22 hours.
he had been left for dead by other climbers, and then, nearly blind, his hands literally frozen solid,
beck stood up, left his pack, and desperately tried to walk.
all i knew was that as long as my legs would run and i could stand up,
and i was gonna keep movin' till i either hit that camp, or walked off the face of that mountain.
[narrator] beck's teammates were certain he was lying dead in the snow, so they were pretty startled when he staggered into the high camp.
beck's life hung by a thread, but ed was determined to rescue him.
[viesturs] the camera team put down their gear... and followed me up the mountain into the storm.
he was so blind and so weak that we had to support him... and physically place his feet in each step.
even with our help beck just didn't have the strength to get through the icefall.
[narrator] a helicopter rescue at over 20,000 feet seemed out of the question.
up here the air is so thin that the blades have almost nothing to bite into.
the tragedies hit our team very hard, myself in particular because rob was a close friend.
it was very sad to think about his wife, who was seven months pregnant, and-and realize that my good friend wouldn't be there... to see his first child born.
almost all the other expeditions packed up and left, and we thought maybe we should get out of there too.
i sent word to the monastery, asking if i should abandon the climb.
seven days went by, and i felt my dream slipping away.
but then we got word about beck, and that made me feel lighter and stronger.
[viesturs] a few days after beck got back home to dallas, he began the long road back to recovery.
he would ultimately lose both of his hands to frostbite, but he never lost his spirit, never lost his will to live, and it was his remarkable recovery that lifted our spirits.
a climber must always treat the mountain with respect... and use caution in the face of danger.
[paula] i just wasn't ready, emotionally, to have ed trying for the summit again.
but first we had to ascend the lhotse face, which would be an exhausting two-day climb.
[jamling] the lhotse face is a steep wall of ice, 4,000 feet high.
after rocketing downhill for as much as a mile, they then plunge into a bottomless crevasse.
[segarra] up here we really start to feel the lack of oxygen, and that's the biggest danger on everest.
at 26,000 feet, it was quite a struggle to set up the g.p.s. receiver, and-and it worked.
i did not tell roger that we could see hundreds of rocks... that were once at the bottom of the sea.
ed wondered if paula had received the video he had sent down to base camp.
[viesturs] by the time you get this video i'll be heading for the summit.
i was gonna set out on the climb of my life.
it takes about 12 hours to get from high camp to the summit.
you have to start around midnight so you can get to the top by noon.
ed was going to climb without oxygen, so he started at 11:00 that night, an hour before the rest of us.
[viesturs] i knew exactly where i'd find rob lying frozen in the snow.
when i got there i sat down next to him and cried.
i wanted to hear his friendly new zealand accent one more time.
but then the voice i heard was paula's... the echo of what she'd said on the radio.
[paula] i said, " climb this mountain like you've never climbed it before."
and he said he was very choked up, but he said he thought about that all the way to the top.
[viesturs] just below the summit... is the most difficult pitch of the whole climb... the wall of rock and ice known as the hillary step.
when i got past that, i knew i was gonna make it.
[laughing] but they were the longest 100 meters in my life.
[narrator] after nine long weeks on the mountain, they made it.
araceli segarra became the first spanish woman to reach the top of the world.
[segarra] when i got to the top i was tired, but then i realized that i had really done it... and i started to feel happy.
[narrator] as the team began the two-day descent to base camp, they had time to reflect.
they had never expected to be swept up... in the disaster that would touch the whole world.
yet, even in the face of extraordinary hardship, they had always acted with courage and grace.
[paula] i've never been so glad to see someone in my life.
and jamling's prayer flag fluttered in the wind at the top of the world... and sent a different kind of message.

anyway, i just wanted to tell you thank you so much, and if there's anything that i can do to repay you, just let me know.
knowing that you were back on your way, searching, healing, following that golden, golden path of yours.
and may god, or whatever it is you believe in, smile upon your journey.
i wanted to start the day off with a funny joke.
trust me, my urine doesn't have that tasty zing to it.
i should put my program next to a laundry ball ad when i'm entirely working on beauty?
how can i be close to that kind of-- it's too vulgar.
you're a little nervous, like you always are when a plane takes off.
this time when it takes off, it's smoother than it's ever taken off.
you're thinking about your family and your friends and all the special moments that you shared with those people.
you're feeling blessed with the gift of life that you received.
oh, i'd love to really, but somebody has to pay the rent.
come on, ricky, one swim, then go sell things on television.
is it to lie in bed alone and call up a tv station so you can buy more things?
so you can collect as many things as possible in the little finger-snap of time you have on this planet?
wasn't she, before the series, a member of the groundlings, or lemmings?
all you have to do is attach the insta-clips to the key lift points on your scalp.
no, no, no, st-- [whimpering] what we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a beautiful woman who's trying to convince you that you're not enough.
that you're not beautiful enough-- oh my god, he's leaving it on.
even if they can afford it, they feel it was wrong to buy something for themselves.
why not put somebody on the air who makes them feel good about themselves for a change?
and she looked at me and she said, "to that one, it makes a difference."
"to that one, it makes a difference," that little girl said.
[g] today is the first day of the rest of your life.
but let's face it, the seat-warmers that you're sitting on are getting more out of life than you are.
he is clearly a student of the-- koran figures prominently in g's aphorisms.
and i'm sure he will tell you he's-- a student of the new testament.
listen, we're just sittin' around here-- i know it's sort of last minute.
we were-- wondering if i wanted to go out for a drink?
the only way we're gonna get out of this in one piece is to face it.
so, i'm sorry, but, ricky, kate, you're gonna have to resign.
it started so simply, and now it's become this whole, big production.
it's the hayman and newell circus with the g chants and the orchestras and the announcers.
but--no--but so does every religion that sells a crucifix or a star of david or a stick of incense is making money.
and, you know, everything that we sell, people are buying, i think, 'cause they feel closer to g.
he has the broadest appeal of any on-air personality we've ever had.
yeah, that's right, that's right, but, uh-- and i love the idea of a new g show.
we couldn't have gotten here without kate, and my deal would have to be in place, 'cause, that's right, you said the last show, if i made that work--
i also said to get g signed up, and have you done that, mr. on-the-ball?
this is the stereo that really does give you all kinds of features, but it does it in a compact size.
so if it's gonna go on a bookshelf, if it's gonna go--
but--but, uh--you know, really, take off, 'cause, you know, i'm gonna, you know--
i don't wanna change my mind, you know-- beautiful man, ricky.
and it wouldn't have been right of me to keep him here.
i mean, you don't know me, but this ls-- for once in my life,
but i might have messed it up just a-- just a little bit ago.
her name's kate, and, uh, she made me wanna do better-- to do what was right.
j' don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama j' j' 'cause i'll be standing on the side j' j' when you check it out j' j' you say your style of life's a drag j'
j' and that you must go other places j' j' but just don't you feel too bad j' j' when you get fooled by smiling faces j' j' but don't you worry 'bout a thing j'
j' don't you worry 'bout a thing, mama j' j' 'cause i'll be standing on the side when you check it j' j'out j'
j' when you get off j' j' your trip don't you worry j' j' 'bout a thing j' j' don't you worry 'bout a thing j'
j' yeah, everybody needs a change j' j' a chance to check out the new j' j' but you're the only one who's seen j' j' the changes you take yourself through j' j' but don't you worry 'bout a thing j'
j' don't you worry 'bout a thing, pretty mama j' j' 'cause i'll be standing in the wings when you check it out j' j'oh j' j' don't you worry 'bout a thing j'
j' don't you worry 'bout a thing j' j' don't you worry 'bout a thing j'
j' don't you worry 'bout a thing j' j' yeah j'
never let it rest until your good is better... and your better is best.
and then, you know, when crucial decisions are made... people get left behind.
in the early '60s, my father was in the eyeglass business.
and one day, my uncle, uh, comes to him... and he says, leo, we gotta make a change.
okay, come up with a name other than the four seasons pad.
that sounds like a sanitary napkin, or i don't know what.
- but, you know, based on everything i've just said... i think you can see that it's pretty obvious that a raise is kind of, uh... uh, kind of in order.
based on what you just said... i think it's pretty obvious that a brain scan is in order.
it's about making people feel they have to have it... when they don't really want it.
hayman, i'm giving you two weeks to get things moving, or you're history.
if you put all of the shopping channels together, there's no way you can tell them apart.
i know that if we can create a clear, dynamic identity... along with better sales techniques... we will quickly pull ahead of our competitors and easily reach our growth target.
oh, yes, i did. i came because the hospital just released me...
- and they informed me that you paid my doctor's bill...
and may god, or whatever it is you believe in, smile upon your journey.
- there's a door right at the bottom of the stairs.
trust me, my urine doesn't have that tasty zing to it. i know.
let's go out here and look at the sunlight and stand in the sun.
you're a little nervous, like you always are when a plane takes off.
this time when it takes off, it's smoother than it's ever taken off.
you're thinking about your family and your friends... and all the special moments that you shared with those people.
you're feeling blessed with the gift of life that you received.
and, listen, what better way to get it across than on tv?
you could help thousands, millions of people feel better about themselves, g.
is it to lie in bed alone and call up a tv station... so you can buy more things?
so you can collect as many things as possible... in the little finger-snap of time you have on this planet?
wasn't she, before the series, a member of the groundlings, or lemmings?
all you have to do is attach the lnsta-clips... to the key lift points on your scalp.
even if they can afford it, they feel it was wrong to buy something for themselves.
why not put somebody on the air who makes them feel good about themselves for a change?
there's two things you can do for me for my friend ricky hayman.
if you run into this man anywhere, if you see him anywhere... one thing is, go up to him and tell him... something nice about himself to build up his confidence.
- [ kate laughing ] - lf you see this man, give him a hug.
he really, really wants to be hugged, and he's not used to it.
you ever thought about using your drive time to cook a meal for your family?
do you feel the need to store your vegetables and lunch meats forever?
it's the hood buddy-- the air filter that uses the heat... of your gas-guzzling engine to cook fabulous meals while you drive.
lil squirt-- it's a festive fountain that gives your fanny... a kiss of refreshing mist.
correct me if i'm wrong, sir-- [ chuckles ] i don't wanna put words in your mouth.
- lt felt to me as if we had a deal.
the only way we're gonna get out of this in one piece is to face it.
so, i'm sorry, but, ricky, kate, you're gonna have to resign.
it started so simply, and now it's become this whole, big production.
it's the hayman and newell circus... with the g chants and the orchestras and the announcers.
- no, but so does every religion that sells a crucifix... or a star of david or a stick of incense is making money.
and, you know, everything that we sell... people are buying, i think, 'cause they feel closer to g.
this is the stereo that really does give you all kinds of features... but it does it in a compact size.
so if it's gonna go on a bookshelf, if it's gonna go--
it's chronic because of the decrease that we registered in your--
[ coughing ] i'm sorry, i got-- l got a little phlegm there.
no, but that was isolated. i didn't wanna do it. i'll tell you all about it.
i had a meeting with mcbainbridge this morning. i had this idea... which i alluded to last night, about phasing him out eventually... but he said my job depends on getting him to sign this contract.
yeah, well, i've gotten-- l've gotten... so that i don't wanna strangle you so much as i used to.
but-but, uh-- you know, really... take off, 'cause, you know, i'm gonna, you know-- l don't wanna change my mind, you know--
because i knew that he... would be happier in his heart... if he continued on his journey.
and it wouldn't have been right of me to keep him here.
i mean, you don't know me, but this is-- for once in my life... i wanted to do the right, the right thing.
i mean, he doesn't care about worldwide audiences, certainly... or fame or money, for that matter; that's me.
and i'm real, real... sorry... that i didn't do this before.
[ sighing ] not that doin' the right thing hasn't cost me.
never let it rest until your good is better... and your better is best.

i'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt here.
- you're obviously from out of town and look real unfamiliar.
wait till you get to just "r." the time you'll save will put hours on your life, trust me.
anyway, i just wanted to tell you thank you so much... and if there's anything that i can do to repay you, just let me know.
knowing that you were back on your way... searching, healing, following that golden, golden path of yours.
and may god, or whatever it is you believe in, smile upon your journey.
i know you like jokes. i wanted to start the day off with a funny joke.
trust me, my urine doesn't have that tasty zing to it. i know.
you know, it was really smart of you to get him in a good mood.
may make it easier for him to take last night's numbers.
i'm not gonna lock you in here... 'cause, well, frankly, i think it's illegal.
but, um, as a favour to me... uh, the guy who paid your medical expenses and has given you shelter... would you please...
i should put my programme next to a laundry ball ad... when i'm entirely working on beauty?
how can i be close to that kind of-- lt's too vulgar.
this time when it takes off, it's smoother than it's ever taken off.
you didn't even feel the plane leave the ground that time.
is it to lie in bed alone and call up a tv station... so you can buy more things?

wasn't she, before the series, a member of the groundlings, or lemmings?
all you have to do is attach the lnsta-clips... to the key lift points on your scalp.
i think this would be fantastic for a surprise birthday party.
- surprise parties-- you could say, "surprise!" - [ crew laughing ]
ever since you guys showed up, all i do is go backwards.
you know, it seems like no matter what i've done you get offended... or, you know, i make him mad and--
- survey after survey shows... that after people buy, they feel guilty.
even if they can afford it, they feel it was wrong to buy something for themselves.
- we think that g could give us that unique image that you're looking for.
- give me the deadest hour of the day. 2:00 a.m.?
- [ kate laughing ] - lf you see this man, give him a hug.
he really, really wants to be hugged, and he's not used to it.
you ever thought about using your drive time to cook a meal for your family?

whether you're a lover of jazz, gospel, classic or rock... you'll be able to select the kind of sound... that is going to fit whatever kind of music you enjoy.

i had a meeting with mcbainbridge this morning. i had this idea... which i alluded to last night, about phasing him out eventually... but he said my job depends on getting him to sign this contract.
oh, so all's fair, never mind what's good or right for anybody else.
i just can't believe i was right about you after all.
i never wanted to be wrong so much in my life.

this is the stereo that really does give you all kinds of features, but it does it in a compact size.
i had this idea, which i alluded to last night, about phasing him out eventually, but he said my job depends on getting him to sign this contract.
oh, so all's fair, never mind what's good or right for anybody else.
i just can't believe i was right about you after all.
i never wanted to be wrong so much in my life.
yeah, it's, uh, it's for six months with provisions for extending it if things are going well, and you're gonna be paid very well, of course.
but, you know, you can put some aside for your future, or--or, uh, give it to a charity.

because i knew that he would be happier in his heart if he continued on his journey.
and it wouldn't have been right of me to keep him here.
i'm just a, a regular, a regular type, but, um, i think i'm finally gettin' it.
that you never feel more whole and right than when you love another person and when you know that that other person loves you back.

each blade has been authenticated... by an actual 13th-century japanese warlord's direct descendent.
in the early '60s, my father was in the eyeglass business.
and one day, my uncle, uh, comes to him... and he says, "leo, we gotta make a change.
well, maybe he doesn't have to hear about it, because-- because, after all, if certain people hadn't waved to certain people... as well-intentioned and kind of dopey as it was...
i think we see now that it was very misguided; we'll talk about the whole thing.
wait till you get to just "r." the time you'll save will put hours on your life, trust me.
anyway, i just wanted to tell you thank you so much... and if there's anything that i can do to repay you, just let me know.
knowing that you were back on your way... searching, healing, following that golden, golden path of yours.
and may god, or whatever it is you believe in, smile upon your journey.
i wanted to start the day off with a funny joke.
trust me, my urine doesn't have that tasty zing to it.
you know, it was really smart of you to get him in a good mood.
may make it easier for him to take last night's numbers.
you're a little nervous, like you always are when a plane takes off.
this time when it takes off, it's smoother than it's ever taken off.
you're thinking about your family and your friends... and all the special moments that you shared with those people.
you're feeling blessed with the gift of life that you received.
and, listen, what better way to get it across than on tv?
you could help thousands, millions of people feel better about themselves, g.
wasn't she, before the series, a member of the groundlings, or lemmings?
all you have to do is attach the lnsta-clips... to the key lift points on your scalp.
i think this would be fantastic for a surprise birthday party.
- surprise parties-- you could say, "surprise!" - [ crew laughing ]
- survey after survey shows... that after people buy, they feel guilty.
even if they can afford it, they feel it was wrong to buy something for themselves.
- we think that g could give us that unique image that you're looking for.
- give me the deadest hour of the day. 2:00 a.m.?
you ever thought about using your drive time to cook a meal for your family?
do you feel the need to store your vegetables and lunch meats forever?
the only way we're gonna get out of this in one piece is to face it.
so, i'm sorry, but, ricky, kate, you're gonna have to resign.
- thanks, g. [ chuckles ] um-- - [ ricky ] good.
you're watching the, uh, the good buy shopping network... where the grass is always...
it started so simply, and now it's become this whole, big production.
it's the hayman and newell circus... with the g chants and the orchestras and the announcers.
- no, but so does every religion that sells a crucifix... or a star of david or a stick of incense is making money.
and, you know, everything that we sell... people are buying, i think, 'cause they feel closer to g.
- you said the last show, if i made that work--
- i also said... to get g signed up, and have you done that, mr on-the-ball?

i mean, you don't know me, but this is-- for once in my life...
but i might have messed it up just a... just a little bit ago.
her name's kate, and, uh... she made me wanna do better-- to do what was right.
you know what he needs is-- [ stammering ] a hug.
if you see this guy on the street, give him a hug.
okay, come up with a name other than the four seasons pad.
that sounds like a sanitary napkin, or i don't know what.
she went to an ivy league school, learned all sorts of fancy ways to sell things.
i want her to work closely with you for the next two weeks and see if you can get sales up 8% .
if you put all of the shopping channels together, there's no way you can tell them apart.
i know that if we can create a clear, dynamic identity, along with better sales techniques, we will quickly pull ahead of our competitors and easily reach our growth target.
i came because the hospital just released me, and they informed me that you paid my doctor's bill, yeah.
and i just wanted to come down and thank you personally, robert ricky.
the time you'll save will put hours on your life, trust me.
anyway, i just wanted to tell you thank you so much, and if there's anything that i can do to repay you, just let me know.
knowing that you were back on your way, searching, healing, following that golden, golden path of yours.
and may god, or whatever it is you believe in, smile upon your journey.
i wanted to start the day off with a funny joke.
trust me, my urine doesn't have that tasty zing to it.
now, uh, i'm not gonna lock you in here, 'cause, well, frankly, i think it's illegal.
but, um, as a favor to me, uh, the guy who paid your medical expenses and has given you shelter, would you please stay in the room?
i am trying to overcome a fear of flying, but for the moment with little results.
well, no--did you ever try halcyon and a double cuba libre?
this time when it takes off, it's smoother than it's ever taken off.
you didn't even feel the plane leave the ground that time.
oh, i'd love to really, but somebody has to pay the rent.
come on, ricky, one swim, then go sell things on television.
is it to lie in bed alone and call up a tv station so you can buy more things?
so you can collect as many things as possible in the little finger-snap of time you have on this planet?
wasn't she, before the series, a member of the groundlings, or lemmings?
all you have to do is attach the insta-clips to the key lift points on your scalp.
no, no, no, st-- [whimpering] what we have here, ladies and gentlemen, is a beautiful woman who's trying to convince you that you're not enough.
that you're not beautiful enough-- oh my god, he's leaving it on.
ever since you guys showed up, all i do is go backwards.
you know, it seems like no matter what i've done you get offended, or, you know, i make him mad and--
survey after survey shows that after people buy, they feel guilty.
even if they can afford it, they feel it was wrong to buy something for themselves.
and, listen, let me just work with the guy and let me focus his message.
i think--we think that g could give us that unique image that you're looking for.
there's two things you can do for me for my friend ricky hayman.
if you run into this man anywhere, if you see him anywhere, one thing is, go up to him and tell him something nice about himself to build up his confidence.
you ever thought about using your drive time to cook a meal for your family?
do you feel the need to store your vegetables and lunch meats forever?
[g] today is the first day of the rest of your life.
but let's face it, the seat-warmers that you're sitting on are getting more out of life than you are.
he is clearly a student of the-- koran figures prominently in g's aphorisms.
and i'm sure he will tell you he's-- a student of the new testament.
listen, we're just sittin' around here-- i know it's sort of last minute.
we were-- wondering if i wanted to go out for a drink?
listen, i've been empowered by mr. john mcbainbridge to offer grace $5,000 on behalf of g and the good buy network, uh, as well as $5,000 worth of good buy products, including the, uh, new george foreman lean mean fat reducer grill machine
that's available only on wednesday nights on george's show here on our show.
you can be getting in touch with the part of you that lives instead of fears, the part of you that loves instead of hates, the part of you that recognizes the humanity in all of us.
and i tell you, that's where your fortune-- oh, there it is.
and, you know, everything that we sell, people are buying, i think, 'cause they feel closer to g.
and if they wear a g t-shirt, people think, oh, you know, what he's all about, what he's talking about, and they become better people.

carlo objects to being used as a pawn in the game as valente takes advantage of the couple's relationship, especially since he realises how much he still loves her.
in order to obtain information, barbara is forced to pretend that she wants to return to married life with her husband, who still adores her.
the carabinieri want the key to his private safe, where he keeps the accounts of all the illicit investments with the names of all involved.
mafia boss, solicitor torrisi, has a man, turi, in the baron's home as chauffeur and spy, who quietly keeps an eye on everyone and everything.
turi is fascinated by the lovely young american woman, but doesn't guess that she is working for the police.
the drug lab is set up in an old mill on turi's property.
francesco leans heavily on his influential friend, the politically ambitious cinisi, who is as yet unaware of the mafia connection.
but a chance encounter changes events, the french drug chemist marten catches barbara visiting the carabinieri and is mortally wounded in a fight with carlo.
francesco realises his bank, his reputation and his whole life is at stake and he plots with augusta to get rid of barbara, although he still loves her.
on the pretext of a romantic evening of reconcilliation, he drugs her champagne and when she collapses, takes her out of the house...
if elected i'll call for special laws and the allocation of extra police.
and i'll support the town planning bill to help deprive these criminals of funds and political cover.
it wouldn't be the first time you've made this kind of error.
find those responsible for this crime instead of dreaming up unlikely theories.
then lava flowed through the town and now there's only woods and snakes.
just bear in mind, it was fire that consumed that town.
i swear allegiance to my brothers, never to betray them, to help them at all times.
may my flesh burn like this holy picture if i do not honour this oath.
this year, there will be a lot of things that people won't expect.
battling in the biggest... ..toughest robot fighting arena in the world.
but it was the power of shockwave and the huge axe of thor that made it through the heats.
the two titans clashed, but thor didn't last and shockwave powered through to the grand final.
as you can see, it's filled with hazards - spikes, the flipper, the pit and fire.
and as if taking on each other wasn't hard enough, the teams must also contend with giant mechanised anger on wheels, designed to pulverise anything that gets in their way.
it's the only place where the teams are able to test their robots, due to the sheer power of the weapons.
here in the pits, the teams are busy checking and repairing their robots, ready for battle.
- but april's controlling the weapon in the arena, so if it goes horribly wrong, it's not my fault.
although, he'll have his finger on my thumb, so he's controlling my thumb!
now, dantomkia, which is a robot with some heritage as well, isn't it?
the original owner, mike, he named it after his three children -
loaded onto their trolleys, the teams must get up to the arena, arm the weapons and prepare to fight.
our man with a ringside view of the robots is, as ever, jonathan pearce.
this team of friends have the moves like brucie and the flipper bot made of tank-grade armour steel, one of the quickest robots in the competition.
aimee burch's role is team counsellor, rehabilitating the rest of the team after harrowing robot battles.
this flipper-rammer robot has green credentials, made of 30% recycled parts.
the team captain simon prepares for battle at home by pushing a wheelbarrow around at high speed.
for this group battle, it's the femme fatale of robot wars, matilda, with her fetching pink rear flywheel.
she'll be guarding her corner patrol zone, and if competitors cross the line they'll face the wrath of this metallic mistress.
let's bear that in mind as i turn to our other team.
we've learned an important lesson today, haven't we, about the value of mdf as shelving?
might as well have built it out of biscuit, that's how effective wood was.
you were like the first little piggy of this particular story!
i don't think catastrophic begins to cut it at this point.
we built a robot in five days and we made it work.
we really need a step up for next time if we want to last longer than 23 seconds.
watching overdozer being smashed to smithereens was really quite sad in many ways.
mdf, great to work with, easy to work with, but if you're fighting against military grade robots or military grade materials, you've really got to choose what you're making its stuff of really well.
glitterbomb, sadly, it looked like it had a problem with its hammer.
so it's off to war for our teams as they had up to the arena.
taking us through every destructive detail to their treasured robots is, of course, jonathan pearce.
a family team of engineers who're responsible for this eight-wheeled machine.
its interchangeable weapons are a very high pressure crushing jaw, or a vertical spinner.
it's a family affair with mum and dad putting full confidence in 15-year-old alex's driving skills.
of course, it's also got a weapon capable of flipping a small car at its disposal.
a team of teachers and students have a double-skinned steel and titanium armour.
the team described their machine as a nightmare in metal and as having no weaknesses.
captain suren, who works in the gas and oil industry, and his team promise that supernova will be a crowd pleaser.
but its disc is so powerful it could easily damage itself if used incorrectly.
overseeing this fight from the corner patrol zone for this group battle, sir killalot.
at 750 kilos, what he lacks in speed he makes up for in damage.
they have the ability to pick up an opponent weighing 300 kilos and carry it around the arena floor.
supernova back in the action and slamming in on big nipper.
tr2 with a little bit of a push and shove in there on supernova.
meanwhile, big nipper staying out of trouble and comes in behind tr2.
supernova started off very well, had a massive attack taking out orte.
but then, in trying to run away from sir killalot, it fell into the pit.
luck was on our side that time, next time it might not be.
with the group rounds complete, the four qualifying robots... ..will now fight each other in one-on-one battles.
amy, you are very much the counsellor for this evening, how would you describe their emotional state at the moment?
they've had a few moments with getting the robot fixed and sorted and ready for battle, but they're pretty cool.
i'm the team captain and designer and builder for king b remix team, from portsmouth.
my day job is actually a power electronics engineer, so big electrical systems is my thing.
we build this whole robot on the fact that we can pump a lot of power into the motors, into the system, and keep it under control.
sometimes though we have been known to overclock it a bit, and we set fire to motors.
now he loves to watch the others lose, says shane swan, the captain and driver.
will his team be the winning team, or will he have to take a long look at himself?
they can lift the robots up with a crushing power of about three and a half to four tonne, so they tend to pick up the robots,
we can sustain a lot of a lot of damage, so face power with power.
i'm graeme, we're from lancashire and our robot is big nipper.
my day job is a toolmaker, my brother is an electronics engineer, my dad is a weaver.
we like the idea of a crusher but we wanted to build something different so we thought, if it could pick the robots up, it would be a good idea.
we got all the materials from the local scrapyard, mostly titanium.
i would have never have been able to build the robot as it is.
the strategy that we have in the arena is go full speed and attack, attack, attack!
if anything is going to go wrong, it's going to be dad's welding.
with a place in the final at stake, over to you, jonathan.
have they got enough of it to keep up this punishing pace in the robot wars arena?
big nipper into the clutches of dead metal and down comes a circular saw onto that armament.
the weapon seem to be lacking a bit in power, but that could be because it's so cold today.
it didn't work in the first fight, so anything's an improvement.
for some reason, we didn't have enough power so we need to look at that but i think what we'll do is put the other weapon on.
dantomkia and tr2 are both on three points, with king b remix and
next to face each other in the head-to-heads, it's the top-of-the-table clash between dantomkia and tr2.
dantomkia make final adjustments to their robot in the knowledge that a victory here could put them through to the final.
and, of course, one of the first-ever self-righting srimech system we saw in robot wars, using the weaponry and they've done it again well there.
slammed onto the arena wall, but bounce up they come again, like tigger.
the lifter didn't work properly, so we couldn't lift them up.
you couldn't lift it up and you couldn't do anything with it.
yes, the spinning disc is working and it's cutting through the front of king b remix!
they're into the corner there now and i don't think they'll get out.
after the fourth head-to-head, tr2 are still leading with six points.
big nipper join dantomkia in second place with three points, whilst the initially laidback team from portsmouth, king b remix, have yet to score.
and they can also use that axe when it comes into play.
haven't seen a lot of that, we won't see much more of king b remix.
i think actually it was the repair we had to quickly do last night.
- when you see the robots that are out there now, in the pits, it's scary.
so king b buzz out of the competition after failing to score a single point.
but tr2 head to the final on the back of a winning streak.
whoever's got the best drive system and the best driver is going to do well.
now, i think alex is proving that he's got the skills to drive this machine well.
tr2 score the maximum nine points, winning all of their battles.
dantomkia and big nipper are in second place on three points and must now fight it out to see who will join tr2 in the final.
dantomkia very quick out of the traps to take on big nipper.
there you can see the grinder of big nipper up to speed, might have caused damage there.
he's a difficult robot but, you know, we're treating every fight as our last fight now and just going hell for leather, what the hell.
so, congratulations to dantomkia and tr2 on making it through to tonight's final.
they also proved to be a tour de force in the head-to-heads when it came to shaming big nipper and king b remix, claiming their rightful place in the final.
when they first met it was a well matched battle as the two powerful flippers went head-to-head.
dantomkia the heavier and quicker machine but they do have that vulnerable ground clearance.
but there's a hit from the floor flipper on tr2 and has that caused damage?
this is worthy of the grand final itself and the winners go through to that grand final.
and it's tr2 on the offensive, again getting in underneath dantomkia and every lift, every shove, surely is causing damage.
tr2 might have got a bash from the floor flipper but, i tell you what,
dantomkia certainly did and now i don't think there's enough power in dantomkia to self-right.
you're just jealous because you aren't as in love as me and marie.
i really don't think you can compare a two-day infatuation... to a 20-year marriage.
i bet marie and me have kissed more in two days... than you have in your whole marriage.
you know, i don't think i've ever seen you guys kiss.
that was the scene outside the city courthouse today where, after weeks of litigation the joker's criminal record has been wiped clean by his one-time gangland rival, king barlowe.
as followers of this remarkable story know, gotham's most notorious criminal was recently willed a huge fortune in cash, jewels and gold.
i was king's bodyguard for 10 years, and he left me zip.
armed with his newfound wealth, the joker put together a pricey defense team to polish his less-than-sterling reputation.
i subjected him to a thorough psychological examination assessing his subconscious reflex responses to the most provocative of stimuli.
and i can safely say he is a criminal no more.
then you must realize, as mr. barlowe's sole beneficiary you owe us a tidy bit of inheritance tax.
now, 250 million minus uncle sam's current state and federal percentages...
if you're playing this tape you probably figured out you've been had.
yeah, i left you some cash, but only 10 million which, knowing you, you've already blown.
if i don't pay my taxes, i'll go to jail but if i admit barlowe duped me, i'll look like a fool.
you could raise cash by pulling one of your classic routines.
and you couldn't spot trouble with this one over here, right?
look, if i can watch a movie about three divorced women who drive across canada, you can deal with the seats.
i'm just saying, if you wait too long, this opportunity could go bye-bye.
then it could be, hey, another 31 years before this opportunity comes again.
when carrie suggested fixing you guys up, i admit, i was against it.
but i was wrong, and i told her like a french whore!
i think you like spence being miserable because it makes you feel better about your own life.
honey, i'm not sure, but i think you just insulted yourself.
would you rather have toothpicks shoved under your fingernails or take the subway, at rush hour, naked?
i'm gonna go with the toothpicks, just for everyone else's sake.
i'm only telling you this because, you know, you're my friend, man, i love you.
i'm just saying, if you wait too long, this opportunity could go bye-bye.
i read this somewhere, and it stuck with me ever since.
it's the first sentence of a really thick book... that was assigned reading... for the advanced placement english class at my school.
your father won't support this unless we have a plan... and i don't mean hanging around california... and getting a suntan, if you know what i mean.
we gotta figure out something you can do to further yourself.
with rita gone... there'd be no more monthlies from uncle mickey.
no more plush shag carpeting... fancy dinette sets, or swimming pools.
i used to think the good life... was somewhere just outside the window of my father's car... but now i see it's on the inside.
sure, we didn't know where we were going to live... but we knew where we were going.

i'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit, and i want you all to take a smell so you know when someone is smoking mari-ja-uana near you.
mmkay, take a smell, pass it on, and when it gets back up to me, we'll finish talking about it.
i, i really thought it was important for the kids to know the smell of marihuana, mmkay?
it was an error of judgement mr. mackee, but i'm afraid i have to let you go for it.
we searched each one of those kids, but came up empty.
we had to let them go home, and one of them now has have a lid of jamaican grass because of you!
- i know, drugs are bad because if you do drugs, you're a hippie, and hippies suck.
- look children, this is all i'm going to say about drugs:
i'm sorry but we just can't throw caucasian babies on an outbound train.
- but my parents are going to cut off his ding-dong.
ok, i, i'm just gonna go over here for a while.
anyways, i need you guys to help me so that my parents don't realize ike is gone.
if we don't find him, so help me, you're going to be grounded for a month.
all this time, look out for your little brother kyle, take care of your little brother kyle, and he wasn't even really my little brother.
i don't want to go to rehab, i haven't even done drugs in weeks.
we were wrong for shunning you mr. mackee, and we apologize.
the problem with drugs is that people forget to stop doing them.
there is a time and a place for everything mr. mackee, and it's called college.
well, screw you guys, i don't want to be in your penis chopping family anyway.
and so now children, your school counselor is back to tell you first hand

he eliminates his targets - all evil men - because they deserve to die.
in the world of professional killers, this vigilante is considered to be the king of killers.
i gave you that assignment to kill mrs chu... and you repair her drainpipes!
she needed my help - besides she reminded me of my mom.
each of you has an account at a swiss bank with a balance of $5m.
please enter your four-digit private code - your id for your account.
i've filed all the details regarding the death in your computers.
you've all received the same information to ensure a fair deal.
if they are the same person, then he is worth 100 million dollars.
if there's official evidence that either one doesn't exist or is already dead, the full reward is for the remaining target.
lastly, i want to make this clear - we do not encourage lawbreakers.
we won't be held responsible should you become involved in any illegal activities - you'll also be disqualified.
but we do have some videos, recorded days before the murder occurred.
they also gave us a video recorded the night of the murder.
he wanted to spend some time in south east asia, so he came to hong kong to see his old friend. 50 thousand's fine.
of course not, he comes out in a rash if he doesn't kill regularly.
i decided to study law just so i could bail you out.
one time our teacher asked us to write about our fathers.
i'll come back and build a lovely big house for her.
but i don't even have enough money to build a toilet.
ok, although this is unconfirmed, i think i know who the killer is.
for the past four years, there's been an assassin in southeast asia, called the angel of death.
then later on, he told the story to someone at the antique shop.
he finally ended up selling his banknotes for $2,000, then he called me up again.
by then i felt so guilty taking money from that old man, that i just gave him my bank account number and i said:
"deposit the money when you read of tsukamoto's death in the papers."
but then tsukamoto did get killed, so the old man deposited the money.
what makes it worse is that i wasn't the one who killed him.
a fire broke out at a five storey building in wanchai, this afternoon.
the fire started at unit 504 on the 5th floor of the chiu chow building.
i can be like a father to you from now on.
thanks a lot, sir, but i've decided to break up with david, anyway.
i'll wind up dead anyway, so we may as well go.
if you hadn't been in charge of this hunt, i'd have killed you long ago.

throughout tokyo today, the vtczx road traffic information transmission system sent out incorrect information.

it's reasonable to see the wired as an upper layer of the real world.
in other words, physical reality is nothing but a hologram of the information that flows through the wired.
here in the real world, god exists only as a concept.
but in the wired, there may be a sort of deus-like embodiment.

i wouldn't have shot the goddam tree if you hadn't rolled into me.

we need to find out what they intend to do with it.
if our previous experience is any indication, they will try to destroy earth.
if species 8472 attacks earth... the federation won't have any defenses against them and i don't need to remind you that we have no way to warn starfleet command.
voyager may be the last defense against an all-out invasion of earth.
the last 8472 i met tried to dissolve me from the inside out.
it was only trying to get to know you better, harry.
have the doctor extract them from your bloodstream, grow them in a petri dish, whatever it takes.
if we do engage 8472, i don't intend to run out of firepower mid-battle.
"any and all attempts to make first contact and achieve nonmilitary resolution must be made."
in this case, we made first contact over a year ago and we barely got out of it alive.
no, i don't want to risk shutting down their life support.
if we can end this without casualties, so much the better.
we haven't been in contact with earth for over four years.
explain why you attacked our realm, hand in hand with the borg.
at the time, we didn't realize the borg had started the war against you.
we forged a temporary alliance with them because we thought you were the threat.
i've used the tricorder data holo-images and astrometric scans to extrapolate a cross-section of the interior.
i believe they used a combination of holographic projection and particle synthesis.
see if you can find a way to penetrate their defenses.
he may look human, he may sound human, he may even smell human, but there's no question-- he's alien.
throughout human history, weapons of mass destruction were often designed in the hopes that they'd never be used.
and yet, in earth's third world war, nuclear weapons accounted for 600 million casualties.
high-minded ideals are one thing, but your actions tell a very different story.
you infiltrated our re-creation, captured and killed one of our people.
you know, we could keep this paranoid debate going all day.
you have no reason to trust us, and we have no reason to trust you.
explain why you attacked our realm, hand in hand with the borg.
at the time, we didn't realize the borg had started the war against you.
we won't be returning to fluidic space for another day or two.
thank you, but the real earth is a long way from here.
questions remained about the deadly spill inside ecs(environmental containment systems), a private firm specialized in hazardous materials clean up.
we obtained exclusive fire department for it, taking immediately after a container of deadly mzt foam ruptured during routine storage.
ecs is engaged in a full and thorough investigation of this tragedy.
our hearts go out to the family of those employees' ....
i read my orientation pack that the company ... seventy-five million dollar profit last year.
yeah, and that taiwan is a tanker we just pump three belgian crew.
that's when two people actually meet instead of typing to each other on the computer keyboard.
so if it was a date, how can you be sure that those are your underpants?
but the mzt took about twenty seconds to turn their insides into...
i heard the alarm, and i arrived there with strickland but the time we got in there
... a tank in the case of three thousand and rising fast.

i just, uh, came down here to make clear that no ecs employee... under any circumstances, is to discuss the mztaccident with the press.
they're makin' a meal out of, uh, dan healy's suicide attempt.
the mzt took about 20 seconds to turn their insides into mush.
i hit the alarm, and i ran in there with strickland... but by the time we got in there... it had already eaten through them.
i came here to tell you that i think your father is innocent.
i guess that's why he jumped in front of a bus.
jean mikhail lived with his family... on the little farm they built near lyon.
and his work only mattered to him in so far... as it helped his wife, greta, and his two sons.
we've obtained exclusive fire department footage... taken immediately after a container... of deadly mzt foam ruptured during routine storage.
three ecs workers were killed when the concentrated pesticide... burned through their lungs and paralyzed their nervous systems.

but in the pain of that war, the future was born.
a future that would one day... have a name whispered on a hundred worlds.
a story about great deeds... about armies of light and soldiers of darkness.
about the places where they lived and fought... and loved and died.
but as a culture grows decadent... it becomes intrigued by art... by trinkets, by eccentricity.
and the humans had art and trinkets... and eccentricity to spare.
i suggest you give her a little of this before she eats.
i brought it from centauri prime when i heard she was ill.
we've made trade deals and mutual defense treaties... with the league of non-aligned worlds.
most of the races have been very receptive to our advances.
if you force the issue, the rangers may pay the price.
ignore my request, and we shall all pay the price for their stupidity.
earth herself would stand on the very edge of complete destruction.
and the irony is... the terrible truth that no one knows, but that i will tell you... is that the blood of many who died in that war is on my hands.
majesty, i know it is not my place to speak... but you have endured so much these last few years.
you cannot bear the blame for the war between the humans and the minbari.
valen led our people to victory... in the great war against the shadows.
before he went away... he gave us the prophecy that they would return again in 1,000 years.
the workers need to know why they should stop building bridges... and start building ships, guns and weapons.
and the warriors need to know why they may be called upon to serve... and to die.
then let them appear to give us something to believe in.
if the vorlons do not see the danger, then perhaps the danger does not exist.
valen said the shadows... would first return to their homeworld of z'ha'dum before moving against us.
so, why not send an expedition to z'ha'dum... to determine if they have indeed returned?
it's a sad state of affairs when a fine diplomat has to resort to cheating... at poker.
i can't think of any other way the man could've beat me.
i have an opportunity for you, commander, and i suggest you take it.
we're sending out a mission to the border of minbari space.
sir, we're picking up a silhouette at the edge of scanner range.
i thought this area was supposed to be well outside the minbari transfer points.
besides, if it is them, i want to see if we can get a look at them.
captain, our orders were to avoid any first contact situation... unless authorized to do so.
they are to bring back information on the minbari and that's what we'll do.
if we bring back a profile on a warship... they'll be handing out medals by the bucket.
you said you wanted to get as much information on their ships as possible.
what if they want to capture our ships for the exact same reason?
they swore revenge and began a holy war... that could only end in the complete extermination of mankind.
the incident you have just seen has been repeated at half a dozen bases... in just the last few days.
now we know the minbari use a caste system... including a warrior caste.
and we think they're fighting in a way consistent with that structure... taking out our warriors first, and coming back for the rest later.
they intend to eliminate our defensive capability all the way to earth.
then, with no one to stop them, they'll head back out again... and finish the job of wiping out every last man... woman and child of the human race.
and they use stealth technology we have not been able to beat yet.
we called you here because we wanted you to see the situation for yourselves.
we want you to go back to your units and make them understand two things:
one, we need a victory against these forces, any victory... to increase morale.
when we drove the centauri from our world after 100 years of occupation... we seized many of their weapons.
we took them apart, studied them, learned to turn their own weapons... against them, and we are willing to sell them to you.
and if they should learn that the weapons came from us... we endured slavery for 100 years.
a slave is immune to the fear of dying... because to die is simply to end the cycle of pain.
i should think you would be more pleased by the progress of the war.
what pleasure can be found in beating an enemy... that never had the slightest chance of defeating us?
they have come to us in secret, to prepare for the coming war.
they say... we'll need allies... in particular, a race that is so far unknown to us called humans.
if we do not end it soon, more time will be lost.
this great war must be stopped before it starts... or millions of lives will be lost.
the worst cases of radiation poisoning will be brought here for treatment.
when this goes on-line, it will be the best facility of its kind anywhere.
soon we will hit colonies and stations closer to the homeworld of the humans.
every day that passes sees more death... and every death will make it that much harder to intervene.
i appreciate the compliment, delenn, but... how do i do this?
if i attempt to contact them directly... the grey council will hear of it and interfere.
but, sir... that minbari cruiser only left because it figured we were dead.
if we send a distress signal... it'll come back and finish us off.
get us behind one of those asteroids, let them think we're trying to evade.
if they want to finish the job, let them come to us.
just in case, i will go along, since i am fluent in minbari and english.
i don't have to tell you how important this mission is, commander.
i had every window in the palace blocked off because i was afraid... that if i came around a corner and saw this, unprepared... that i would break down and cry.
and yet i spend all of my time here in this room... looking at it.
we've lost contact with lo... and must conclude that they too have fallen to an advanced force.
our military intelligence believes... that the minbari intend to bypass mars and hit earth directly... and the attack may come at any time.
we therefore can only conclude... that we stand at the twilight... of the human race.
in order to buy more time... for our evacuation transports to leave earth... we ask for the support of every ship... capable of fighting... to take part in a last defense of our homeworld.
we believe that anyone who joins this battle... will never come home.
but for every ten minutes... we can delay the military advance... several hundred civilians... may have a chance to escape to neutral territory.
though earth may fall... the human race must have a chance... to continue elsewhere.
no greater sacrifice has ever been asked... of a people that i ask you now... to step forward one last time... one last battle... to hold the line against the night.
but the war has taken on... a life of its own.
and it will continue to its bloody end... no matter our feelings.
for the next 10 years... one question would obsess 100 worlds:
why did the minbari surrender at the battle of the line... on the very eve of victory?
but shortly after the war ended... the earth president made a decision.
the senate has approved funding to construct on the babylon station... located in neutral space between several governments.
together, we stood on the eve of destruction... as a result of a terrible, terrible mistake.
a mistake which none of us can afford to make again.
but in the pain of that war, the future was born.
a future that would one day have a name whispered on a hundred worlds.
a story about great deeds about armies of light and soldiers of darkness.
about the places where they lived and fought and loved and died.
but as a culture grows decadent it becomes intrigued by art by trinkets, by eccentricity.
and the humans had art and trinkets and eccentricity to spare.
i suggest you give her a little of this before she eats.
i brought it from centauri prime when i heard she was ill.
we've made trade deals and mutual defense treaties with the league of non-aiigned worlds.
most of the races have been very receptive to our advances.
even at the height of the centauri republic when we were expanding in all directions we never opposed the minbari.
if you do not bother them, they will not bother you.
many minbari would die in the war, but before its end earth herself would stand on the very edge of complete destruction.
and the irony is the terrible truth that no one knows, but that i will tell you is that the blood of many who died in that war is on my hands.
majesty, i know it is not my place to speak but you have endured so much these last few years.
you cannot bear the blame for the war between the humans and the minbari.
i was telling you about how lenonn, head of the ania-shok what the humans would one day call the rangers was brought before the grey council.
long ago vaien led our people to victory in the great war against the shadows.
and most of those are old and tired from years of watching, waiting.
weary of being mocked by certain members of this council and by the warrior caste who think of us as an embarrassment and who do not believe in the prophecy of vaien.
the workers need to know why they should stop building bridges and start building ships, guns and weapons.
and the warriors need to know why they may be called upon to serve and to die.
then let them appear to give us something to believe in.
if the vorions do not see the danger, then perhaps the danger does not exist.
vaien said the shadows would first return to their homeworld of z'ha'dum before moving against us.
so, why not send an expedition to z'ha'dum to determine if they have indeed returned.
we can rely on the reports of others, or see for ourselves.
my whole life i have heard of z'ha'dum in whispers and legends.
we will take only a few support vessels sworn to secrecy to avoid the panic copiann fears.
and we'ii travel indirectly stopping at various outposts until we are ready for the final jump.
i didn't say anything then, and i am not saying anything now.
it's been a iong day and i must go to my sanctum and meditate on this in private.
i can't think of any other way the man could've beat me.
i have an opportunity for you, commander, and i suggest you take it.
we're sending out a mission to the border of minbari space.
the ships involved will survey the disposition of their forces and determine if the minbari have any hostile intentions towards us.
the lexington is an old patrol ship that'ii never fight again if captain sterns has anything to say about it.
he wants to finish his tour and retire with his parts and pieces still in working order.
and i don't really feel comfortable with the situation on the prometheus.
sheridan, you are the most stubborn man i have ever seen.
i was only thinking of what you said earlier and remembering that from time to time aliens have come to us pretending to be vorions.
since no one alive has ever seen them, it's easy to be deceived.
i don't want to put more strain on the engines than we have to.
besides, if it is them, i want to see if we can get a look at them.
now take us in at oblique angle, keep the scanners on the maximum.
if we do this right, they're not even going to know we're here.
if we bring back a profile on a warship they'ii be handing out medals by the bucket.
we handled the diigar, and we can handle a few stray ships.
i've told them to go to maximum power on the scanners so we can verify.
there's no reason to concern dukhat with it until we know more.
wanted us in range of their scanners, so they could shut us down.
you said you wanted to get as much information on their ships as possible.
what if they want to capture our ships for the exact same reason?
then we want to make sure that does not happen, commander.
they've tried to contact us, but we do not understand their language.
as is our custom, we are approaching with gun ports open.
deienn, we need to strike back, but the council is divided.
do we follow them back to their base and take revenge or do we wait, try to find out what happened?
with the death of their leader, dukhat, the minbari went mad.
they swore revenge and began a holy war that could only end in the complete extermination of mankind.
every attempt we've made to communicate with them has been rebuffed.
they are moving methodically through the outer colonies wiping out our defense structures and leaving the colonies vulnerable.
and we think they're fighting in a way consistent with that structure taking out our warriors first, and coming back for the rest later.
they intend to eliminate our defensive capability all the way to earth.
then, with no one to stop them, they'ii head back out again and finish the job of wiping out every last man woman and child of the human race.
since the first engagement, we have not won a single battle from the enemy.
we called you here because we wanted you to see the situation for yourselves.
we want you to go back to your units and make them understand two things:
one, we need a victory against these forces, any victory, to increase morale.
two, that unless we find a way to defeat the minbari the human race ends with the current generation.
when we drove the centauri from our world after 100 years of occupation we seized many of their weapons.
we took them apart, studied them, learned to turn their own weapons against them, and we are willing to sell them to you.
and if they should learn that the weapons came from us we endured slavery for 100 years.
a slave is immune to the fear of dying because to die is simply to end the cycle of pain.

no greater sacrifice has ever been asked... of a people that i ask you now... to step forward one last time... one last battle... to hold the line against the night.
but the war has taken on... a life of its own.
and it will continue to its bloody end... no matter our feelings.
for the next 10 years... one question would obsess 100 worlds:
why did the minbari surrender at the battle of the line... on the very eve of victory?
but shortly after the war ended... the earth president made a decision.
the senate has approved funding to construct on the babylon station... located in neutral space between several governments.
together, we stood on the eve of destruction... as a result of a terrible, terrible mistake.
a mistake which none of us can afford to make again.
but in the pain of that war, the future was born.
a future that would one day have a name whispered on a hundred worlds.
and the humans had art and trinkets and eccentricity to spare.
but it was none of those traits that would cause so much death and pain.
i suggest you give her a little of this before she eats.
i brought it from centauri prime when i heard she was ill.
we've made trade deals and mutual defense treaties with the league of non-aligned worlds.
most of the races have been very receptive to our advances.
if you force the issue, the rangers may pay the price.
ignore my request, and we shall all pay the price for their stupidity.
and most of those are old and tired from years of watching, waiting.
weary of being mocked by certain members of this council and by the warrior caste who think of us as an embarrassment and who do not believe in the prophecy of valen.
then let them appear to give us something to believe in.
if the vorlons do not see the danger, then perhaps the danger does not exist.
valen said the shadows would first return to their homeworld of z'ha'dum before moving against us.
so, why not send an expedition to z'ha'dum to determine if they have indeed returned.
we can rely on the reports of others, or see for ourselves.
my whole life i have heard of z'ha'dum in whispers and legends.
we will take only a few support vessels sworn to secrecy to avoid the panic coplann fears.
and we'll travel indirectly stopping at various outposts until we are ready for the final jump.
i didn't say anything then, and i am not saying anything now.
it's been a long day and i must go to my sanctum and meditate on this in private.
i can't think of any other way the man could've beat me.
i have an opportunity for you, commander, and i suggest you take it.
we're sending out a mission to the border of minbari space.
the ships involved will survey the disposition of their forces and determine if the minbari have any hostile intentions towards us.
i was only thinking of what you said earlier and remembering that from time to time aliens have come to us pretending to be vorlons.
since no one alive has ever seen them, it's easy to be deceived.
besides, if it is them, i want to see if we can get a look at them.
captain, our orders were to avoid any first contact situation unless authorized to do so.
now take us in at oblique angle, keep the scanners on the maximum.
if we do this right, they're not even going to know we're here.
if we bring back a profile on a warship they'll be handing out medals by the bucket.
we handled the dilgar, and we can handle a few stray ships.
wanted us in range of their scanners, so they could shut us down.
you said you wanted to get as much information on their ships as possible.
what if they want to capture our ships for the exact same reason?
then we want to make sure that does not happen, commander.
delenn, we need to strike back, but the council is divided.
do we follow them back to their base and take revenge or do we wait, try to find out what happened?
with the death of their leader, dukhat, the minbari went mad.
they swore revenge and began a holy war that could only end in the complete extermination of mankind.
and we think they're fighting in a way consistent with that structure taking out our warriors first, and coming back for the rest later.
they intend to eliminate our defensive capability all the way to earth.
and they use stealth technology we have not been able to beat yet.
we called you here because we wanted you to see the situation for yourselves.
we want you to go back to your units and make them understand two things:
one, we need a victory against these forces, any victory, to increase morale.
when we drove the centauri from our world after 100 years of occupation we seized many of their weapons.
we took them apart, studied them, learned to turn their own weapons against them, and we are willing to sell them to you.
if they capture any of the equipment they will assume it came from the centauri attack them, and we win by default.
and if they should learn that the weapons came from us we endured slavery for 100 years.
if you are seeing this message, it is because i am dead.
i leave this in trust of the vorlons to give it to the right person, at the right time.
they say we'll need allies in particular, a race that is so far unknown to us called humans.
if we have not already done so by now i hope that you will work with the vorlons to find these humans and bring them into the battle on our side.
we have lost too much valuable time already due to this distraction.
if we do not end it soon, more time will be lost.
the worst cases of radiation poisoning will be brought here for treatment.
when this goes on-line, it will be the best facility of its kind anywhere.
our intelligence reports indicate the humans have made a deal with the narns to buy weapons.
through the narns, we can arrange a meeting in neutral territory.
if we send a distress signal it'll come back and finish us off.
if we sit here and do nothing, we're just as dead.
and if any member of the press corps asks about the morality of sending out a distress signal and hitting the enemy remind them the minbari do not take survivors.
they were on a mission to murder the surviving crew of the lexington.
he's had a fair amount of physical contact with the minbari before the war.
he can verify these individuals are who they say they are and be on hand in case things go badly.
i don't have to tell you how important this mission is, commander.
it's been only a few months but there are millions of lives at risk in the inner colonies.
my orders were to prevent the narns from using the war to establish closer ties with the humans.
my spies learned of the narn mission to the epsilon system.
at the point that i am describing 50,000, maybe 60,000 humans had died in the minbari war.
with their one chance for peace ruined and lenonn dead the war escalated.
i had every window in the palace blocked off because i was afraid that if i came around a corner and saw this, unprepared that i would break down and cry.
and yet i spend all of my time here in this room looking at it.
we've lost contact with lo and must conclude that they too have fallen to an advanced force.
our military intelligence believes that the minbari intend to bypass mars and hit earth directly and the attack may come at any time.
we therefore can only conclude that we stand at the twilight of the human race.
in order to buy more time for our evacuation transports to leave earth we ask for the support of every ship capable of fighting to take part in a last defense of our homeworld.
we believe that anyone who joins this battle will never come home.
but for every ten minutes we can delay the military advance several hundred civilians may have a chance to escape to neutral territory.
though earth may fall the human race must have a chance to continue elsewhere.
no greater sacrifice has ever been asked of a people that i ask you now to step forward one last time one last battle to hold the line against the night.
if you wish to finally destroy earth i will not watch, i...
- delenn we were using the triluminary to probe the human.
you cannot expect to hear all of the stories at once, you know.
but shortly after the war ended the earth president made a decision.
the senate has approved funding to construct on the babylon station located in neutral space between several governments.
together, we stood on the eve of destruction as a result of a terrible, terrible mistake.
a mistake which none of us can afford to make again.
the babylon station is a place to work out our problems peacefully.
if we are wise, what is born of that pain... matures into the promise of a better world... because we learn that we can no longer afford... the mistakes of the past.
but in the pain of that war, the future was born.
a future that would one day... have a name whispered on a hundred worlds.
a final refuge for dreams... and our last best hope for peace:
but as a culture grows decadent... it becomes intrigued by art... by trinkets, by eccentricity.
and the humans had art and trinkets... and eccentricity to spare.
i suggest you give her a little of this before she eats.
i brought it from centauri prime when i heard she was ill.
we've made trade deals and mutual defense treaties... with the league of non-aligned worlds.
most of the races have been very receptive to our advances.
if you force the issue, the rangers may pay the price.
ignore my request, and we shall all pay the price for their stupidity.
earth herself would stand on the very edge of complete destruction.
and the irony is... the terrible truth that no one knows, but that i will tell you... is that the blood of many who died in that war is on my hands.
majesty, i know it is not my place to speak... but you have endured so much these last few years.
you cannot bear the blame for the war between the humans and the minbari.
valen led our people to victory... in the great war against the shadows.
before he went away... he gave us the prophecy that they would return again in 1,000 years.
the workers need to know why they should stop building bridges... and start building ships, guns and weapons.
and the warriors need to know why they may be called upon to serve... and to die.
then let them appear to give us something to believe in.
if the vorlons do not see the danger, then perhaps the danger does not exist.
valen said the shadows... would first return to their homeworld of z'ha'dum before moving against us.
so, why not send an expedition to z'ha'dum... to determine if they have indeed returned?
it's a sad state of affairs when a fine diplomat has to resort to cheating... at poker.
i can't think of any other way the man could've beat me.
i have an opportunity for you, commander, and i suggest you take it.
we're sending out a mission to the border of minbari space.
sir, we're picking up a silhouette at the edge of scanner range.
i thought this area was supposed to be well outside the minbari transfer points.
besides, if it is them, i want to see if we can get a look at them.
captain, our orders were to avoid any first contact situation... unless authorized to do so.
they are to bring back information on the minbari and that's what we'll do.
if we bring back a profile on a warship... they'll be handing out medals by the bucket.
you said you wanted to get as much information on their ships as possible.
what if they want to capture our ships for the exact same reason?
they swore revenge and began a holy war... that could only end in the complete extermination of mankind.
the incident you have just seen has been repeated at half a dozen bases... in just the last few days.
now we know the minbari use a caste system... including a warrior caste.
and we think they're fighting in a way consistent with that structure... taking out our warriors first, and coming back for the rest later.
they intend to eliminate our defensive capability all the way to earth.
then, with no one to stop them, they'll head back out again... and finish the job of wiping out every last man... woman and child of the human race.
and they use stealth technology we have not been able to beat yet.
we called you here because we wanted you to see the situation for yourselves.
we want you to go back to your units and make them understand two things:
one, we need a victory against these forces, any victory... to increase morale.
when we drove the centauri from our world after 100 years of occupation... we seized many of their weapons.
we took them apart, studied them, learned to turn their own weapons... against them, and we are willing to sell them to you.
and if they should learn that the weapons came from us... we endured slavery for 100 years.
a slave is immune to the fear of dying... because to die is simply to end the cycle of pain.
i should think you would be more pleased by the progress of the war.
what pleasure can be found in beating an enemy... that never had the slightest chance of defeating us?
they have come to us in secret, to prepare for the coming war.
they say... we'll need allies... in particular, a race that is so far unknown to us called humans.
if we do not end it soon, more time will be lost.
this great war must be stopped before it starts... or millions of lives will be lost.
the worst cases of radiation poisoning will be brought here for treatment.
when this goes on-line, it will be the best facility of its kind anywhere.
soon we will hit colonies and stations closer to the homeworld of the humans.
every day that passes sees more death... and every death will make it that much harder to intervene.
i appreciate the compliment, delenn, but... how do i do this?
if i attempt to contact them directly... the grey council will hear of it and interfere.
but, sir... that minbari cruiser only left because it figured we were dead.
if we send a distress signal... it'll come back and finish us off.
get us behind one of those asteroids, let them think we're trying to evade.
if they want to finish the job, let them come to us.
just in case, i will go along, since i am fluent in minbari and english.
i don't have to tell you how important this mission is, commander.
i had every window in the palace blocked off because i was afraid... that if i came around a corner and saw this, unprepared... that i would break down and cry.
and yet i spend all of my time here in this room...
i've just been informed that our midrange military bases... at beta durani and proxima 3... have fallen to the minbari advance.
we've lost contact with lo... and must conclude that they too have fallen to an advanced force.
our military intelligence believes... that the minbari intend to bypass mars and hit earth directly... and the attack may come at any time.
we have continued to broadcast our surrender... and a plea for mercy.
but for every ten minutes... we can delay the military advance... several hundred civilians... may have a chance to escape to neutral territory.
though earth may fall... the human race must have a chance... to continue elsewhere.
we are almost within range of the homeworld of the humans.
the grey council should be assembled... to see the end of our great campaign.
we will keep him close to us one way or another.
for the next 10 years... one question would obsess 100 worlds:
you cannot expect to hear all of the stories at once, you know.
but shortly after the war ended... the earth president made a decision.
together, we stood on the eve of destruction... as a result of a terrible, terrible mistake.
a mistake which none of us can afford to make again.
it'd be nice if he didn't keep such tough people at his side.
so what did spopovitch and yamu come to the tenkaichi tournament for?
once you turned super saiyan, your energy became their greatest target.
both myself and kaioshin-sama knew that babidi would probably do so, so we slipped in as well.
when you take a good look at it, this is such a waste!
i'm going to give them a piece of my mind when i see them at school.
seven years ago, during the fight with cell, those strange people there at the ring were you guys, huh?
that child who was there together with them was you, gohan-kun, right?
majin boo's revival should be conducted outside the spaceship, in order not to damage it.
let's watch and wait a little longer, until that time comes.
of his own power, he's certainly helpless, but he uses fearsome magic, so you must not underestimate him.
it's strong enough that he made dabura one of his henchmen.
no, we believe he probably takes hold of the evil and greed in his victim's hearts, and uses it to steer them as he pleases.
in that sense, dabura is the most suitable henchman there is.
this doesn't appear to be the level where i can help out.
that and not many days have passed since you got married and all...
the united states leads the united nations into a war against communism in asia.
in winter, under attack from the chinese communists, the un troops are thrown into full-scale retreat.
it was a rout exactly like the one that napoleon faced leaving russia.
we ran head long, helter-skelter, pell mell, trying to get to pusan, trying to get back to japan.
kim ll sung understood that to resolve the problem of unifying the two koreas was very difficult - that he would need help.
of course the help he was hoping to get would come from the soviet union.
his secret agenda to seek stalin's permission to invade the south.
stalin, pre-occupied with crisis in berlin, rejected kim's request to invade.
stalin was now confident that the united states lacked the will to respond to events in asia.
in april 1950 he finally gave approval for kim ll sung to invade south korea.
june 25th 1950, the north korean army launches its surprise assault on the south.
i remember vividly, even today, the day the war broke out.
we believed that we had to fight for our motherland, for our people, for our leader kim ll sung.
we believed it would be better to liberate the south and to unify korea.
exactly what that action was to be and how far it was to go, was not something we had planned on.
we had not worked out a contingency plan for a war started by north korea with south korea.
the feeling at that time was that a military operation of this magnitude could not possibly have been taken without the support of the russian military.
in other words it was concluded right at the beginning that this was a movement this was something happening in the context of the cold war.
i do believe he was at this point he felt that he was infallible.
the nearest troops to korea were the american occupation force in japan - few of whom were ready for combat.
the us task force sent to korea didn't imagine their stay would be for long.
as a matter of fact, we were told to take our athletic equipment and leave everything else behind because we'd only be gone for maybe six weeks.
general macarthur took a gamble to turn the tide of the war.
with the un forces driven back to a tiny enclave at pusan, a vast seaborne invasion, 150 miles behind enemy lines, would attempt to sever and then roll back the north korean advance.
my house was located in a hillside and there was a crossfire between the
un forces and the north korean people's army on the northern side.
rhee's jubilant army was the first to cross the 38th parallel into north korea.
when we counter-attacked across the 38th parallel every one of us, soldiers and people, thought now the drive was on to unify the whole korean peninsula.
across this border, the chinese leadership followed the war with alarm.
they feared the american army in north korea would invade the chinese mainland.
if north korea was defeated, only the yalu river would separate us from the americans.
we couldn't accept this nor the risk of american aircraft disrupting the reconstruction of our country.
macarthur was surprised to be summoned to wake island in mid-pacific for a meeting with president truman.
macarthur assured his commander-in-chief there was no possibility of china entering the war.
mao ordered the chinese army, called the people's volunteers, to enter korea.
haifa million chinese began to cross the yalu river and waited - for the un forces to approach the border.
we had everything that we would have had had we been at home.
it was just a very nice day and that was the last nice day we had.
the first aim of the volunteers going into korea was to defend our homes and country, the motherland.
we couldn't allow others to cross the yalu river and invade us.
mao believed that greater motivation could defeat an enemy with superior arms.
because our war was a just war the enemy could be defeated.
our bravery and our strategy developed during the years of the liberation struggle would help defeat the enemy.
the reaction when china came in was that we had a whole new war, a whole new situation.
un forces across north korea were thrown back, abandoning vehicles and equipment.
we had people on top of the trucks, on the running boards, just heading south.
we are fighting in korea for our own national security and survival.
we have committed ourselves to the cause of a just and peaceful world order through the united nations.
it went on and on and on just like that - the president not being able to shut this thing off.
and until people began to think that maybe we were going to use the atomic bomb.
british prime minister clement attlee was sufficiently alarmed to fly to washington for crisis talks.
my aim in these talks is to align our policies in the new and troubled situation in the world and to find the means of upholding what we both know to be right.
and when i opened it i just thanked god that he was 'missing in action'.
as far as knowing when he became a prisoner, that wasn't for another year.
i never knew from letter to letter if he was alive.
you know, so i always held out hope that he would come home but i never could say that he would come home.
at the beginning of 1951, seoul fell again to the communists.
general matthew b. ridgway was appointed by macarthur as the new field commander.
we must never let the enemy know they were fighting russians.
when the us deployed the f-86 saber, they slowly won back mastery of the skies.
and so we used all of those things from time to time on ground ground attack.
macarthur now called for the bombing of chinese cities and for the pursuit of the war in mainland china.
to make sure that the precious lives of our fighting men are not wasted;
to see that the security of our country and the free world is not needlessly jeopardized and to prevent a third world war.
general macarthur so that there would be no doubt or confusion as to the real purpose and aim of our policy.
by the summer of 1951, the two sides had fought themselves to a stalemate in the hills of korea - almost at the point at which the fighting had begun a year earlier.
one in three american pows held by the north koreans, died during the first winter.
a lot of them were lost to dysentery, diarrhea, severe beatings, malnutrition.
you'll spill your blood for the profiteering warmongers on wall street.
why have you come here to lay down your young lives?
the dockyards and shipyards were used to rebuild, recondition the ships.
japanese electronics, which are probably now the top of the world, really got their start in the korean war.
soviet and north korean leaders came to believe it was impossible to win this war.
because on the side of south korea was the whole world and on the north korean side was the soviet union and china.
the chinese, the north koreans and the un backed the agreement.
the south korean president, syngman rhee, opposed the truce and refused to sign.
i mean, he no longer had the facial structure that he had when he left.
this man that i had waited for, for 33 months, and then he comes home and i don't really know him.
an estimated half a million chinese soldiers had died in the war.
the volunteers demonstrated to the rest of the world that the chinese were ho longer the
first of all, the man and woman have to love each other very, very much.
and then the man puts his seed into the woman, and the seed and the egg go together and that turns into a baby.
so it's not so much the time you begrudge, it's the principle?
it's just because he's so good that he wants to do it again.
the cause of death is still unknown, hence this administrative autopsy.
we're waiting on the results of your autopsy, but we have sufficient reason to believe that this was a homicide.
mr. takayama placed a phone call to asakawa reiko just before he died.
but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama's girlfriend.
according to her she just happened to stop by his apartment, where she found him already dead.
it'd be stranger to think that some sort of foul play was not involved.
his body didn't look like one that'd suddenly died from heart failure.
did he ever mention anything to you about chest pains, or lack of energy?
yesterday morning, what made you decide to suddenly go to takayama ryuji's apartment?
asakawa reiko took her son and disappeared to... where, i wonder?
the police think that asakawa reiko was driving when she noticed that her son sitting in the back seat was dead.
she took her attention from the road and that's what caused the accident.
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time.
i now know that one week earlier, the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu.
she watched it, and was sure that she too would die one week later.
thus, aided by takayama ryuji, she began her investigations, trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape.
i don't know why... but even asakawa's son saw the video.
from her information, the videotape was created by a girl named yamamura sadako, via her powers of psychography.
sadako's mother, yamamura shizuko, was reportedly clairvoyant, which had the press all up in arms.
she was branded a fraud, a charlatan, and ended up committing suicide.
but as it turns out, her daughter sadako was even more powerful.
she had a miserable life, was treated like some sort of monster.
so to save her child, she went to her parent's house and showed it to her father.
she even brought a vcr so she could copy the tape.
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan.
he's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish.
the retinas take in genetic data that's encoded on the tape, kind of like how computers use optical communication to send and receive information.
the data is then restructured inside the body, creating a virus.
all i did was read that notebook, but i can see the images in my head so clearly.
you're saying the virus is generated not just by the video, but also by writing?
if you use one of my fertilized eggs, it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular division.
once this is put back into takano mai's womb, we're all finished.
according to one of the pathologists there were no external injuries to speak of.
the cause of death is still unknown, hence this administrative autopsy.
we're waiting on the results of your autopsy, but we have sufficient reason to believe that this was a homicide.
if that's the case the court would order a second autopsy...
you have to use a rendering of the amino acids in dna.
you plug the numbers into this chart and then use the resulting abbreviation.

did he ever mention anything to you about chest pains, or lack of energy?
yesterday morning, what made you decide to suddenly go to takayama ryuji's apartment?
asakawa reiko took her son and disappeared to... where, i wonder?
it looks like she'd gone back to her parents' house after all.
though they'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them...
thus, aided by takayama ryuji, she began her investigations, trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape.
i don't know why... but even asakawa's son saw the video.
from her information, the videotape was created by a girl named yamamura sadako, via her powers of psychography.
sadako's mother, yamamura shizuko, was reportedly clairvoyant, which had the press all up in arms.
she was branded a fraund, a charlatan, and ended up committing suicide.
but as it turns out, her daughter sadako was even more powerful.
she even brought a vcr so she could copy the tape.
but one week later, her son died of a heart attack.
i want your copy so i can get rid ot it.
i want to get rid of all the videotapes, and then i want to die.
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish?
if i did that, it might "brighten" you up a little, huh?
right before he died, he "saw" that things would turn out like this.
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan.
the retinas take in genetic data that's encoded on the tape, kinda like how computers use optical communication to send and receive information.
the data is then restructured inside the body, creating a virus.
all i did was read that notebook, but i can see the images in my head so clearly.
you're saying the virus is generated not just by the video, but by writing?
after all, humanity is the result of tiny organisms undergoing complicated changes, evolving into what we are now.
and now it's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level.
according to one of the pathologists there were no external injuries to speak of.
the cause of death is still unknown, hence this administrative autopsy.

but the first person to find his body was mr. takayama's girlfriend.
according to her she just happened to stop by his apartment, where she found him already dead.
this is dr. andou, who was in charge of the autopsy.
this is takano mai, the first person to discover the body.
there was nothing to make us think it was suicide or murder.
what i want to ask you about is mr. takayama's health.
we'd use our knowledge of various medical terminologies to come up with our codes...
but the ones that takayama made were always the hardest to solve.
it looks like she'd gone back to her parents' house after all.
though they'd denied any knowledge of her whereabouts when we contacted them...
thus, aided by takayama ryuji, she began her investigations, trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape.

he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan.
he's trying to get me destroy that video in exchange for granting my wish.
all this time, you've blamed yourself for letting your son die.
but being afraid to die is nothing to be ashamed of.
there were times when i thought it was just an excuse.
when he said he regretted bringing a child in this world.
all i did was read that notebook, but i can see the images in my head so clearly.
you're saying the virus is generated not just by the video, but by writing?
i put my own genetic information onto the videotape using nensha, or psychography.
that information went from your body into mai's. cursed the videotape, you saw it.
if you use one of my fertilized eggs, it should mature to the same age as when the person died within 2-3 weeks if you use hormones to quicken the rate of cellular division.

it'd be stranger to think that some sort of foul play was not involved.
his body didn't look like one that'd suddenly died from heart failure.
did he ever mention anything to you about chest pains, or lack of energy?
yesterday morning, what made you decide to suddenly go to takayama ryuji's apartment?
asakawa reiko took her son and disappeared to... where, i wonder?
the police think that asakawa reiko was driving when she noticed that her son sitting in the back seat was dead.
she took her attention from the road and that's what caused the accident.
four people died of a heart attack at exactly the same time.
i now know that one week earlier, the four of them had watched a videotape at a lodge in izu.
she watched it, and was sure that she too would die one week later.
thus, aided by takayama ryuji, she began her investigations, trying to uncover everything she could about the videotape.
i don't know why... but even asakawa's son saw the video.
from her information, the videotape was created by a girl named yamamura sadako, via her powers of psychography.
sadako's mother, yamamura shizuko, was reportedly clairvoyant, which had the press all up in arms.
she was branded a fraund, a charlatan, and ended up committing suicide.
but as it turns out, her daughter sadako was even more powerful.
she had a miserable life, was treated like some sort of monster.
so to save her child, she went to her parent's house and showed it to her father.
she even brought a vcr so she could copy the tape.
i want your copy so i can get rid ot it.
i want to get rid of all the videotapes, and then i want to die.
you want me to inject you with some of that protein from the glowing jellyfish?
if i did that, it might "brighten" you up a little, huh?
right before he died, he "saw" that things would turn out like this.
he thought that he could use me to stop yamamura sadako from carrying out her plan.
the retinas take in genetic data that's encoded on the tape, kinda like how computers use optical communication to send and receive information.
the data is then restructured inside the body, creating a virus.
it's a picture of the virus they took from yoshino's neck.
there's a virus with a completely different structure mixed in with the others.
we are lucky that it has such a low chance of contagion.
i have to study this virus in more detail, find out how it works.
and the fear that sadako experienced will spread across this world.
and the people who read it...the virus will develop inside their bodies.
after all, humanity is the result of tiny organisms undergoing complicated changes, evolving into what we are now.
and now it's time for that evolution to proceed to the next level.
i'm telling you about a procedure that needs to be done.
the parents are waiting if you would like to join us.
look, don anspaugh and legal mandated the terms of your situation, not me.
those terms do not include me having to justify a procedure.
your bleeding has slowed, but we need to observe you for a little while.
i'm gonna come back and do another pelvic exam to make sure the bleeding's stopped and that the cervix is closed.
a pocket of pus has collected around the tonsils and we have to get it out.
we'll numb it first and we'll use a needle to draw out the infected fluid.
when you have parents sign consents an attending needs to witness that.
i performed a procedure on a 7-month-old baby addicted to heroin.
it'd probably be a good idea if the family stayed here.
mrs. fernandez, your husband fell 20 feet onto a concrete surface.
i was diving the wellsburt, a shipwreck out in lake michigan when i felt this slice.
what's weird, though, at that depth your blood comes out looking green.
first you're gonna take the tourniquet and tie it into a slipknot, like that.
ms. knight, the films came back on that woman who dropped the weight.

[box] we found the car at the bottom of a ravine.
it may take as long as a week to make a positive identification.
i thought i might come and stay for a little while, mama.
you need to deposit your social security check, ma, so you can have some money.
this guy fits every description that we've ever heard of him.
if she's so fuckin' innocent, john, why does she keep running?
but i must say i was terribly disturbed when i read your version of the little cinder girl.
there are those who swear perrault's telling with its fairy godmother and magic pumpkins would be closer to the truth.
just be the little angel i know is in there somewhere.
and don't chew on the bones at dinner and give yourself away.
the sooner you leave, the sooner we can celebrate your return.
perhaps by then, the three of you will know each other better.
(woman) it would be ten years before another man would enter her life.
a man who was still a boy... ... in many, many ways.
if he is to become king, he must accept his responsibilities.
a sapling cannot grow in the shadow of a mighty oak, francis.
i am on my way to genoa and i find my salvation on the highway!
sir, you are the founder of forward thinking and my father is the king of backward.
we're so looking forward to celebrating the engagement to your own spanish rose.
yes, well, there have been several new developments with regards to spain.
sweetheart you were born to privilege, and with that comes specific obligations.
forgive me, mother, but marriage to a stranger never made anyone in this room very happy.
well, we must work extra hard to make sure the manor is spotless.
we cannot have a royal bottom sitting on a dirty chaise, can we?
if love is what you seek i suggest you find it before then.
five days hence, at the stroke of midnight you will announce your engagement to the girl of your choice or...
(henry) do you really think there is only one perfect mate?
(henry) do you really think there is only one perfect mate?
and if you find them, are they really the one for you or do you only think they are?
what if the person you're meant to be with never appears?
ten courtiers were speaking of her today and how the prince fell all over himself.
(rodmilla) we should find out who she is and bury her.
and i-i suppose if you saw him again y- y-you'd simply...
i'd walk right up to him and say "your highness, my family is your family. "
do you think that after this morning i'd let you go anywhere?
(sighs) do you honestly think these games and intrigues are going to win you a crown?
because he deserves to hear the truth from the one he loves.
a bird may love a fish, signore but where would they live?
perhaps it was unfair of me to put so much pressure on you about the marriage contract.
i just thought it was time to make some changes in your life.
i must say, i've never seen you quite this dedicated in your chores.
what makes you think i do any of this for you?
but i would feel like a king if you, danielle de barbarac would be my wife.
how was i to know he'd run out of the side door?
choose your words wisely, madame for they may be your last.
a woman would do practically anything for the love of her daughter, your majesties.
(danielle) i want you to know that i will forget you after this moment and never think of you again.
but you, i am quite certain will think about me every single day for the rest of your life.
(woman) my great-great-grandmother's portrait hung in the university... ... up until the revolution.
by then, the truth of the romance... ... had been reduced to a simple fairy tale.
throughout these hard times, i have sheltered you... clothed you, and cared for you.
all that i ask in return... is that you help me here without complaint.
why, here i am on my way to genoa... and i find my salvation on the highway.
sir, you are the very founder of forward thinking... and my father is the king of backward.
well, then, pray, tell me your cousin's name... so that i might call upon her to learn who you are.
for anyone who can quote thomas more... is well worth the effort.
sweetheart... you were born to privilege... and with that comes specific obligations.
forgive me, mother, but marriage to a complete stranger... never made anyone in this room very happy.
if love is what you seek... then i suggest you find it before then.
for five days hence, at the stroke of midnight... you will announce your engagement... to the girl of your choice... or i will announce it for you.
and if you do, are they really the one... or do you only think they are?
and what if the person you're supposed to be with... never appears, or she does, but you're too distracted?
if so, when the two of them are walking side by side... were they both the one for you, and you just met one first... or was the second one supposed to be first?
is everything just chance... or are some things meant to be?
i want to know about this comtesse... everyone keeps talking about.
there must have been ten courtiers talking today... about how the prince fell all over himself.
yes, but we must never feel sorry for ourselves, must we?
no matter how bad things get... they can always get worse.
they're defined by their status... as your title defines you, yet it is not who they are.
you have been born to privilege... and with that comes specific obligations.
listen, henry... perhaps it was unfair of me... to pressure you as i did... about the marriage contract.
i just thought it was time... to make some changes in your life.
one minute, they're spouting sonnets... and the next, you're back to being the hired help.
although, i must say i've never seen you... quite this dedicated in your chores.
by then, the truth of the romance... had been reduced to a simple fairy tale.

sweetheart... you were born to privilege... and with that comes specific obligations.
forgive me, mother, but marriage to a complete stranger... never made anyone in this room very happy.
if love is what you seek... then i suggest you find it before then.
for five days hence, at the stroke of midnight... you will announce your engagement... to the girl of your choice... or i will announce it for you.
i shall need to know... what the competition is, every move he makes... his agenda... and any other tidbits you might dig up.
he's playing tennis... with the marquis de limoges tomorrow at noon.
when my daughter is queen... perhaps we might come to a new arrangement.
i would've given anything... to see you all dressed up like a courtier... speaking to the prince like a lady.
and if you do, are they really the one... or do you only think they are?
and what if the person you're supposed to be with... never appears, or she does, but you're too distracted?
if so, when the two of them are walking side by side... were they both the one for you, and you just met one first... or was the second one supposed to be first?
is everything just chance... or are some things meant to be?
yes, but we must never feel sorry for ourselves, must we?
no matter how bad things get... they can always get worse.
the prince would be your brother-in-law... and you, comtesse de lancret... would be bringing them breakfast in bed.
yes, but then they would move into the palace... and i could stay with the manor, turn things around.
i guess it's because when i was young... my father would stay up late and read to me.
he was addicted to the written word... and i would fall asleep... listening to the sound of his voice.
in all my years of study... not one tutor ever demonstrated the passion... you have shown me in the last two days.
you have more conviction in one memory... than i have in my entire being.
it is a strong woman... who can keep her wits about her... with you trying to steal her heart.
yes... and what a clumsy thief i turned out to be.
one minute, they're spouting sonnets... and the next, you're back to being the hired help.
although, i must say i've never seen you... quite this dedicated in your chores.
did you or did you not... lie to her majesty the queen of france?
choose your words wisely, madame... for they may be your last.
and you and your horrible daughter... are to be shipped to the americas... on the first available boat... unless by some miracle... someone here will speak for you.
there seem to be quite a few people out of town.
my great-great grandmother's portrait... hung in the university up until the revolution.
by then, the truth of the romance... had been reduced to a simple fairy tale.
the sooner you leave, the sooner we can celebrate your return.
perhaps by then, the three of you will know each other better.
a man who was still a boy... ... in many, many ways.
i signed a marriage treaty with the king of spain and that boy will obey me, or there will be hell to pay!
i am on my way to genoa and i find my salvation on the highway!
sir, you are the founder of forward thinking and my father is the king of backward.
then, pray, tell me your cousin's name so i might call upon her to learn who you are.
anyone who can quote thomas more is well worth the effort.
forgive me, mother, but marriage to a stranger never made anyone in this room very happy.
marry gabriela by the next full moon or i will strike at you in any way i can.
i shall need to know who the competition is, every move he makes his agenda and any other titbits you might pick up.
he's playing tennis with the marquis de limoges tomorrow at noon.
when my daughter is queen perhaps we might come to a new arrangement.
i'd have given anything to see you all dressed up like a courtier.
then i suppose the penalty for being wealthy is having to live with the rich.
i'll bet he's quite charming once you get to know him.
i thought we could all go as one big happy family.
that is, if you complete your chores in time, mind your manners till then.
and i-i suppose if you saw him again y- y-you'd simply...
i'd walk right up to him and say "your highness, my family is your family. "
because he deserves to hear the truth from the one he loves.
a bird may love a fish, signore but where would they live?
perhaps it was unfair of me to put so much pressure on you about the marriage contract.
i just thought it was time to make some changes in your life.
i must say, i've never seen you quite this dedicated in your chores.
what makes you think i do any of this for you?
i kneel before you not as a prince but as a man in love.
but i would feel like a king if you, danielle de barbarac would be my wife.
choose your words wisely, madame for they may be your last.
a woman would do practically anything for the love of her daughter, your majesties.
i want you to know that i will forget you after this moment and never think of you again.
but you, i am quite certain will think about me every single day for the rest of your life.
my great-great-grandmother's portrait hung in the university... ... up until the revolution.
by then, the truth of the romance... ... had been reduced to a simple fairy tale.
but if you played no part then sign your testimony and we're finished.
but if you fail to do so then i'll have my answer.
your honour, in light of your decision, the defence has no choice but to temporarily accept the defendants guilty.
i am asking the high court to postpone the trial until the complete clarification of the case.
i can still see his face when the insurer stood in front of the court and said he is now convinced no crime was committed and that the company will pay the widow the life insurance!
because the husband signed for a 10000 pengo sum, in the case of death resulting from an accident.
this was the money which they wanted to withhold at first.
yes, there's a paragraph of the new traffic law that states:
i rang the company president that night, asking him which would be his choice.
the prosecutor's version or mine, because if he listens to him, he pays 25000 to the employee,
furthermore, i told them that in the beginning, after looking at the evidence,
i felt it necessary to accept a guilty plea, in order to obtain a more moderate sentence.
in it you declare... that you renounce any further claims regarding the accident.
a favour to the insurer for having been so kind to us.
and i am asking you, madam, to sign this cheque of 5000 for me.
i consider that this would be a reasonable bonus for the effort i've invested in you case.

it was only a matter of moments before he invited her to his farm upstate... to view his latest work.
if i could get him to show at the gallery, it would be an incredible coup.
i discovered that gilles was recently divorced... with a five-year-old daughter, beatrice... who lived with her mother in paris.
he was passing through new york on his way to brazil... to supervise construction of a new hotel.
i think you should give up your life here... and move with me to paris immediately.
i thought you were spending the next six months in brazil.
mario's family has one of those gorgeous palazzos... on the grand canal in venezia.
and we are all going there next week for the film festival.
the most powerful woman in new york is not tina brown, or diane sawyer or even rosie o'donnell.
it's the hostess at balzac, which had become the only restaurant that mattered.
do you realise if she were a man, not only would we be eating right now, but they'd be sending over free drinks.
listen, i know a great thai place around the corner where the owner's son always sends over a complimentary mee krob.
her life was a blur of rich men, designer clothes and glamorous resorts.
she didn't actually work for a living, yet possessed a dazzling sexual power that she exploited to her full advantage, which presented a certain conundrum.
no, i'm just saying that men and women are equal opportunity exploiters.
what if you sense that someone is giving you a professional advantage

as i struggled with the dilemma of how to manage my new-found money...
charlotte arrived at the secluded connecticut home of the painter neville morgan, in an attempt to secure his latest work.
the canvases you're about to see are what i consider to be the apotheosis of every great idea i've ever had.
it's the closest i've ever come to pure universal god force.
just because venice was sinking didn't mean my morals had to go down with it.
and as for gilles and the $1,000, i figured there was nothing to be done.
but from that moment on, we never had a problem getting a table at balzac again.
a couple of weeks later, we were all there to celebrate charlotte's coup.
hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbagemen.
dad, is this another one of those situations that could be solved by a simple apology?
now what are we going to do, just let the trash pile up?
hey, i'd rather live in a dump than in a world run by snooty garbagemen.
uh, hate to be a fussy freddy and all... but maude's folks are here, and, uh, they're a tad touchy about odors.

if you look off to your left... you'll see a real old west hitchin' post... possibly used by bandits, possibly during some exciting adventure.
and these planks below us were often used as a sidewalk... by people who may or may not have been bandits.
well, dr. hibbert said you have to build up your strength.
besides, nothing's too good for a wonderful, generous man like you.

you've just come, how do you know what we are talking about?
i've come in for quite a long time, i heard everything.
kui is calling for help, but he won't pay and doesn't have face.
no one is going to help, so do you want us to help?
he just wanted to scare us, did he scare the sit out of you?
sir, i didn't call the police, it's ox who did it.
after that, we went back to the arcade, then we knew the robbery.
i was in the toilet and saw that bastard... and that sushi boy, and a woman, many people were there.

loi, she's been coming here for a week and you're giving her all this free food.
i've been coming here for over a year and i get squat...
this is the twentieth century, can't we talk it over peacefully?
if you have so much time, why don't fix up my car, mr. big balls.
he said, as far as producing biochemical weapons are concerned the americans are no match for the iraqis.
this guy drank half a bottle of this soft drink and now look...
he had too many bottles to drink, i mean he drank a bottle of expensive wine.
he thought he was doing me a favor by finishing it, not letting it go to waste.
open wide, here, drink more... i think he only fainted, right?
whatever, let's just put him into the car before the cop comes back.
do you think when we get older we'll be like kui?
no power, no money, just an old man who gets kicked around by young guys?
hey you over there, who else is still in the mall?
some girls who work in the beauty parlor and the sushi boy.
we have good jobs, but today's our day off so we're minding the shop for our dad.
we're actually on our way to volunteer at the hospital to help the elderly.
survivors should hide themselves in a safe place from the zombies.
do not drink any soft drink as it may contain a biochemical substance.

i was in the toilet and saw that bastard... and that sushi boy, and a woman, many people were there.
that was the only really strange thing... that i ever experienced here, on the farm, and i had already been there a couple of months.
until the night... the strange woman came and sat on lukas' bed.
likewise, when someone dies, a lot of times in the end there's another death.
you are aware... that you're committing a terrible sin... if you conceal anything, right, reverend?
and he made love to the peasant girls, especially to emmy, but actually, he chased after all the girls in the village.
"if it gets hard on me, there's got to be a reason for it,"
i hereby bequeath to the... following persons that which they deserve:
firstly, the reverend, for he is as good a christian... as good a christian as my ass is divine:
"...for nobody would dare kill him, even if it was my dying wish.
thirdly, foreman, for he is a mean bastard who can't find a woman,
why work a lifetime for someone else, someone who doesn't pay enough?
then you get chased off like a dog... when you're old and can't work anymore!
i don't think i really understood until now... that i'm a real farmer who owns something!
and if anyone in the whole world, tries to tell me what to do,
he wants to be a farmer, the foundling and his womenfolk...
they'll probably have to sell anyway... since they don't have 3,000 schillings to pay out our shares.
the farmers got angry... and they didn't forgive us, and they probably thought to themselves:
we'll get them back for that, the foundling and that shameless hussy.
a farmer from viechtwang stated for record that... the doctor had told rosalind... she would die soon on account of her heart.
then she left without saying goodbye, and that same night she killed hillinger.
when the old elephant died, the circus people went to the city for a new one.
and then evening came... and they just happened to ask us... if they could spend the night.
we never even thought... that it was an unusually unusual thing:
for example, if you have a dream, you don't think anything of it... when an elephant appears.
the next day she went to the police and reported him.
herr hillinger, franz, address 362 kirchham, forced me to have intercourse with him and used violence...
and she took the brooch... because she'd paid dearly for it back then.
now they're going to hang her, but at least it won't be for nothing, this time.
they got married, even though farmer obermeier refused to let them.
when farmer pucher wouldn't pay herta and sigrid higher wages, they left to go work in the factory.
so the farmers decided... that the one-seventh farmers were responsible for the unrest, and that all this had to stop.
and the reverend said... that we were living in sin and corruption.
and i thought a lot about rosalind, the murderess... and about emmy and lukas.
and it got me a little scared... because there was so much fate involved... in such a short time period.
she hid up here for seven months... and then she gave birth.
and not until then did she let herself be put in prison, even though it was unjust.
danninger, we don't want any handouts from anyone, we just want what's rightfully ours.
and we all worked very hard this year, and we had a good harvest, and everything is much better than when the farmer was still...
then you head for passau and you keep going north... until you get to the sea.
and then you ask for a ship going to new york.
no bells tolled, and they wanted to bury him in secret during the week... so no one would be able to attend.
but everyone went in spite of that, all the peasants, and nobody fed the animals that day.
emmy and florian and myself, we left the farm after that.
but there were only three cows left anyway, and the stable boy was a hard worker and with old nane...
that was the only really strange thing... that i ever experienced here, on the farm, and i had already been there a couple of months.

i should tell you about the book, the hidden world of country fire stations.
you want to come out on a few calls, take some action shots.
the suits say they've had an anonymous complaint about a bogus call–out scam, which they're taking seriously.
now, i had to tell them i know who the hoaxer is, and he will call up later today to explain it was all a joke.
no, they've got a "beep beep" one in penfold high street, and it drives everyone barmy.
current thinking's away from the classic zebra and more towards the push–and–beep crossing.
your father and i have always favoured holding one's hand up and walking at one's own speed.
i'm sorry, i don't want to call the police, but the ancient laws of trespass are on my side.
it's supposed to be 100 times lighter and stronger than steel.
that's raw trinium, which is too brittle for manufacturing because of its impurities.
we commissioned sg-11 to extract more trinium samples from the planet.
as of this morning they are 48 hours overdue for the weekly check- in.
our preliminary tests show it was made of pure forged trinium.
if native americans are on this planet, they've come a long way technologically.
so sg-11 was taken by surprise before the second charge went off.
my first conclusion, but there were no footprints leading away from the mine.
how is it that you remove the impurities from the ke so that it won't crumble?
well, first we ask the spirits to ask the mountain for the ke.
i thought you were gonna show me your mining methods, george.
we intend to, but first you need a brief medical exam.
i don't like the idea of lying to tonane's people any more than you do.
but the next time the goa'uld attack, we might not be so fortunate.
sir, i am all for getting the trinium, but there has to be an alternative.
is anyone at the pentagon or along the chain of command... .. remotely concerned about their aboriginal rights, repeating history,... .. that annoyingly pesky moral stuff?
if we lose contact,... .. destroy this place... .. and return home with the others.
anyway, like i was saying, this is, uh, a storeroom... .. and the reason we store things is so that we always have them on hand, like this.
from what i overheard, they won't destroy the base until they've found tonane.
we must convince the aliens we'll make no more attempts to extract their trinium.
and so would mine, if i were to do as you asked.
i have made a promise to this one... .. so that we could save your life.

before the man became legend, before the legend became myth, came the greatest adventure of all.
i'll tell ya, listen, you guys have no idea how many times, when i was a kid,
i just wish that i had a normal father like everyone else.
that's why i became an athlete, to rub their noses in it.
well, i beat the best that their cities have to offer, and they cheer!
yeah, uh, that's what i wanted to talk to you about.

the rumour was they had an affair, and she tried to break it off.
i hope you're not going to the dance tonight, cos i'm organising a boycott.
do you realise that the girls have to ask the guys?
that's where the original teacher died back in 1955, and that teacher last night.
that's the hot spot where all the bad mojo is coming from.
no, the, er... ..the spirit is too angry - too, too powerful.

george bush at last decided it was time for a summit with mikhail gorbachev.
"i said, 'i want to meet gorbachev and i want to do it soon.
i felt it was important, but we had different feelings inside our administration, still some wariness about the reality of the change... and what gorbachev's heartbeat really was... what his pulse really was."
"the george bush administration spent a long time deciding what their policy should be.
bush and gorbachev would meet to try to end the cold war.
but for gorbachev, beset by problems at home, the question was:
but finally, gorbachev and bush agreed to meet in the mediterranean on board ship.
"we finally hit upon malta because it was a nice peaceful harbor, a place that they never had bad weather, and nobody would get seasick."
and we saw a little storm developing toward gibraltar and it really stayed right over malta."
"the world changed dramatically between president bush's first overture to gorbachev in, i believe, august and december when we actually met.
it was clear that sooner or later the regime would collapse, but nobody knew exactly when or how.
in this sort of situation, a snowball can start an avalanche."
present that day was alexander dubcek, the communist leader deposed by soviet tanks in the prague spring of 1968.
"it was a clear sign that the regime was starting to give up.
ceausescu and his wife escaped by helicopter an aide held a gun to the pilot's head.
"it was important to call on the whole population of romania to get out on the streets, so that they could paralyze the country.
"it reassured me to know ceausescu was dead even though we are humanists and i am a poet.
if he hadn't died, then we would have died and that's the truth."
"we rightly chose freedom, democracy, glasnost and pluralism, but we got one thing wrong.
people judged the state of the country by what they could or couldn't buy in the markets and shops."
we should have allowed freedom of trade... but gorbachev didn't dare."
making the transition to a market economy was hard but they did allow the opening of moscow's first mcdonald's.
it was a complete break with the practice of lenin and stalin.
of the 15 republics of the soviet union, the russian federation was the largest, most were responding to gorbachev's loosening control with demands for national freedom.
in the baltic states of estonia, latvia and lithuania, annexed by stalin in 1940, the demand was total independence.
in january 1990, gorbachev had gone to vilnius, the capital of lithuania, to argue that the soviet union must not be broken up.
despite gorbachev, the other baltic states, estonia and latvia followed lithuania's lead and also demanded independence.
"he was trying to dam a river that was in full flood.
russia, richest of the republics would be yeltsin's road to power.
"gorbachev would never really acknowledge that the soviet union would break up.
gorbachev was still the man the west could do business with.
at their meetings, gorbachev asked bush for help in his economic difficulties.
bush warned gorbachev not to use violence if the baltic states pushed for independence.
"it looked like the soviet union was coming unstuck a little bit.
at that point, i think we started to believe we were in a race to try to finish the business of ending the cold war with gorbachev still in power."
the red army was pulling out of an eastern europe it had dominated for decades.
gorbachev had accepted that a united germany could belong to nato.
"we called the agreement between gorbachev and kohl 've day 2' because it really was, that was the end of the cold war."
- soviet ties, secretary of state baker succeeded in persuading shevardnadze to a joint condemnation of the invasion.
"the minister has indicated that there was some difficulty on the part of the soviet union in coming to this agreement."
"russia, where yeltsin and his radical democrats were taking over, had practically declared independence from the soviet union.
they adopted law after law that replaced the laws of the soviet union."
yanayev declared: 'i am a communist to the depths of my soul'.
vilnius, lithuania, on the 11th and 12th of january 1991 crack soviet troops entered the capital to take back public buildings for the soviet state.
lithuanians flocked to defend their parliament and the radio and television stations.
in the early hours of january the 13th, soviet tanks attacked.
if lithuania were allowed to break free, there would be nothing to stop the other republics doing the same.
"some people tried to push the tank back with their bare hands.
in seeking to end the cold war, he was doing them all a favor.
but, in spite of the smiles and the handshakes they turned him down flat.
gorbachev had drafted a new union treaty, loosening the ties between the soviet center and the republics.
when it was due for signature in august, hardline communists were appalled:
i was amazed by the fact that we only had four days left to the end of the soviet union."
on august the 18th, a delegation arrived in the crimea, where gorbachev was on holiday.
"well, let me make a few comments about these momentous and stunning events.
while we are still watching the situation unfold and it still is unfolding, all is not clear
it seems clearer all the time, that contrary to official statements out of moscow, that this move was extraconstitutional."
in moscow, confused and concerned people began to gather at the russian parliament building, the white house.
no one knew where or how gorbachev was, or what was really happening.
boris yeltsin, gorbachev's enemy and rival, defended him, and the constitution.
on the evening of the 19th, nervously, the plotters held a televised press conference.
the soviet people have been told about the state of emergency.
"we were defending a free russia, and the symbol of free russia was yeltsin.
we joined hands and waited for the tanks in dead silence."
"today we have adopted the tricolor as the national flag of russia."
the next day in the russian parliament, yeltsin rammed home his victory.
"the world is a far safer place now that the cold war is over.
no leader of a small country is worrying and saying to his cabinet:
"those of us who experienced what i would call 'the fever of the cold war'
the permanent state of alarm about the prospect of a nuclear war,
could it all have been avoided when east and west were comrades, back in 1945?
"we missed our chance, because there were so many suspicions, on both sides.
"i can't imagine any circumstances under which we could have gotten along with uncle joe stalin.
i can imagine no circumstances under which we could have worked out our problems with russia earlier than we did, or in a different way.
i've come to the conclusion we did it pretty goddamn well."
millions who might have died in nuclear conflict lived and prospered.
but there were costs, human and material, and a price to pay.
the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons left a continuing mark.
"the legacy of the cold war really means that the cold war is still going on.
it's going on because the air, water and soil are polluted.
the cold war was a clash of ideologies, and the big cold war loser was marxism-leninism.
the communist dream of a better society, that would outlast the west came to nothing.
"communism as a system went against life, against man's fundamental needs,
against the need for freedom, the need to be enterprising, to associate freely against the will of the nation.
gorbachev had done as much as anyone to end the cold war.
he called bush and told him this was his last day in office.

i never wanted you to have those powers in the first place.
those are clever words for a man about to be an appetizer.
cocky words for a man who can't get a simple book out of a house.
so why don't i just become you, and i'll reach her?

it kind of celebrates the time that the railroad first came to town about 200 years ago.
is that it, 120 meals a day, and you want me to be your janitor?
first of all, cooking the guards' food is gonna pay him a whole lot more...
when dwayne stops for the track blocker, you'll subdue him and his brakeman by brandishing your weapon.
in the meantime, i'll be brandishing louis and the other canuck in the mail car, and they'll fill them bags with the prize money under the watchful eye of my revolver.
in the meantime again, dwayne and the brakeman will be running for their lives up the open track.
you got to scream and shout and get them to run, but don't forget to come pick me up.
and so he took the money bag and picked it out.
ok, but the only thing you two guys are certain of is that they were black?
rolf, why don't you let me remind you of something there.
remember the turk, that convict that was determined to take you, kill you, blow you away?
i know all about him, and i'm up to my nuts in this thing.
i even got this wonderful polarski girl climbing up my ass, asking me a whole lot of big, fancy washington questions.
warden sorenson can put you in his jail the public defender told me i can get probation, the judge can hand out any sentence he wants.
tell me that you put the truck on those tracks, and i'll put you in a safe federal facility where your life will not be in danger.
now, if you put that boy in sorenson's jail, then you can just kiss his ass good-bye.
because even two weeks will be as good as a death sentence.
wait... wait a second, you're not showing proper respect for this court.
this is a court of law, ah, this is not a soapbox.
you'd probably be a lot better off if i did, 'cause your life is hell right now, isn't it?
someone has a big bag of cash out there with your name on it, and you know where it is.
eh, you know, so you don't have to go to the gladiators, ha ha ha!
hey, you know you got a lot of tension in these shoulders, there.
i heard the warden gave you special orders said any con can do what they want with him.
anything that can look like he fell down a flight of stairs.
♪ i don't want to hug you unless you're hugging me back ♪
♪ i don't want to hold you unless you're holding me back ♪
and it's not because i like these other punks better than you, it's just that...
now i got a whole new set of problems, thanks to you and this other mutt.

all of a sudden i hear screaming outside, so i tear out, stark nude, and a church bus is broke down, and there's three vamps feasting on half the baptists in south boston.
so i waste the vamps, and the preacher's hugging' me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden the cops pull up, and they arrested us both.
i figured this was my chance to meet the infamous buff and compare notes.
so, b, did you really use a rocket launcher one time?
there's this big daddy vampire out in missouri who used to keep 'em as pets.
so he's got me rasslin' one of 'em - it must've been 12ft long...
you'll never be bored here, faith, cos this is sunnydale, home of the big brewing' evil.
i don't know how big and evil it is, but two people have disappeared from the sunset ridge district.
and over here we have the cafeteria, where we were mauled by snakes.
and this is the spot where angel tried to kill willow.
and over there is where spike and his gang nearly massacred us on parent-teacher night.
and up those stairs i was sucked into a muddy grave.
well, i... hadn't definitely 100 per cent said no for all time.
it's just, you know, you don't enter into these things lightly.
all i'm sayin' is we stay local, where the humans are jumpin' and the cotton is high, but we live global.
you get the hankerin' for the blood of a 15-year-old filipina,
well, some things i'd be happy to see you share - like the slaying.
i mean, two of you fighting is safer than one, right?
i'm five by five, b, livin' entirely large, actually wondering about your problem.
well, i may not sleep in the nude and rassle alligators...
but it was... it was too late and i had to.
so i told him that i loved him, then i kissed him, then i killed him.
there was someone a while ago, and the ring sort of confused me, but i liked what you said about friendship a lot.
and buster keaton, big fun, and i'm capable of big fun, though there's no way you could know that about me.
wow, if i knew i was gonna go on this long i probably would've brought some water.
what i'm trying to say is, if you'd still like to go to the film festival, and i would understand if you didn't, i'd pretty much love to go with you.
and this is the spot where angel tried to kill willow.
and over there in the lounge is where spike and his gang nearly massacred us all on parent-teacher night.
there are 2 things that i don't believe in... coincidence and leprechauns.
it's entirely possible that they both arrived here by chance simultaneously.
so i told him that i loved him... and i kissed him... and i killed him.
i don't know if that helps with your spell or not.
one, that you pass a make-up test of every class you skipped out on last year.
two, that you provide, in writing, one glowing letter of recommendation from any member of our faculty who is not an english librarian.
so it's about 118 degrees and i'm sleepin' without a stitch on.

so i waste the vamps, and the preacher's hugging' me like there's no tomorrow, when all of a sudden the cops pull up, and they arrested us both.
wow, they should film that story and show it every christmas.
not the horny thing - yuck - but the two-slayer thing.
there was one, then buffy died for two minutes, so then kendra was called, and when she died faith was called.
my watcher went off to some retreat thing in england, so i skipped out.

they say kids don't learn anything in school nowadays, but i've learned to be afraid.

you get the hankerin' for the blood of a 15-year-old filipina,
i'm on the net and she's here the next day, express air.
i'm running a computer check on every hotel, rooming house and youth hostel in town.
meanwhile, as soon as the sun goes down, we're out in force.
well, i may not sleep in the nude and rassle alligators...
maybe it's time you started, cos something in your bottle needs uncorking.
maybe over a cup of coffee, or maybe at the buster keaton festival playing on state street all this weekend.
you know, come to think of it, i don't think i've given a fair chance to buster keaton.
so i told him that i loved him, then i kissed him, then i killed him.
i don't know if that helps with your spell or not, giles.
and buster keaton, big fun, and i'm capable of big fun, though there's no way you could know that about me.
wow, if i knew i was gonna go on this long i probably would've brought some water.
or at least in the state of pre-readiness to make conversation.
or to do that thing with your mouth that boys like.
one glowing letter of recommendation from any member of our faculty who is not an english librarian.
3... that you complete an interview with our school psychologist who must conclude that your violent tendencies... are under control.
um... this new girl seems to have a lot of zest.
i've been having a little problem with the binding spell for acathla.
you get the hankering for the blood of a 15-year-old filipina.
and i'm on the net and she's here the next day.
the guy in the retro shop said that it represents friendship.
and that's something i would very much like to have with you.

on domitilla's cell phone --- to call home, you have to press speed dial, 1, and then send.
speed dial, 2, and send, to call me in the studio.
he goes to a doctor, makes the visit, and he'll order the tests.
can someone have them prescribed and do it in a private laboratory?
the city of rome is owned by siblings siddhartha and domitilla.
a plane is waiting for them tomorrow to show them their possessions.
prati and flaminia are outside the walls and i want them, otherwise what sort of rome would it be?
we need a big house there for us to live in.
look, my head's exploding with things i have to think about.
i have to go in that door, and you can't stay here alone.
i used to think that one's self was our "outside", the face,... our shape, whether you're handsome or ugly.
now it seems to me that our self is our "inside".
i've noted your wish for autonomy,... your maturity,... your impulse to solve the issue alone.
but now we need to inform the adults in your life.
and the fact is that nowadays, the news about the hiv is given by a psychologist.
she's an elegant lady, she knows the right way to tell you.
do you remember i used to take you to school in the morning, and that we'd go to a bar to pick up a croissant?
i used to finish working in the studio and go get you, and we'd come home.
when someone gets sick, and with the traffic, he did not arrive in time at the hospital, and he dies.
if i die, i want to see heaven, if the others die, you can't see any life in them.
all recognize the seriousness and promise complete reconnaissance activity around the ferries.
we do not know who the smugglers are or even which ferry.
as a single man you have very little chance of being accepted.
and, it's not because of the boy, it's because of the girl.
maybe we can finally get closer to gorzi and his organization.
we will inform you as soon as we notice even the slightest movement.
okada was secretly sent away to a remote island, and sada never knew.
okada lived during sada 's lifetime, but did they meet and part like this?
one night i was writing to him when tatsuzo came in.
""i wish i knew what happened regardi ng what i asked you about."
i had met a man who could care for me and really excite me.
i loved him and didn 't want to be apart from him.
for two weeks, from april 24 to may 7, we moved from inn to inn.
normally people would get tired of each other, but i actually grew more and more fond ofhim.
except every time i try to retool this to accept my brother's coordinates...
each world, i keep hoping for a physicist to help me, but with every slide, we just get farther and farther away.
when i threw the switch, it wiped every human being off the face of the earth.
funny thing, i've traveled all over, and somehow i always end up back here.
i'd listen to old records, watch old movies, just to hear a voice that wasn't my own.
the device you built must've been a lot more powerful than mine.
if the world he slid everyone to already had people on it, we'll need some way to differentiate the ones from here so we can slide them back.
i might be able to adapt this to detect a trace sliding signature in their cells.
god saw what became of the world, and he made a terrible rain.
and he told noah, "bring the animals two by two. "
he said we're all made of star stuff, and it's up to us to blaze across the sky
and burn ourselves into the world, so we'd never be forgotten.
now, this can take this world back to the way it was, or at least closer.
you blow it to pieces, and it'll stay hell here forever.

you know, for 26 years i was only with my husband.
since i left him 5 years ago, there hasn't been anyone.
but for me... you represent the ideal man, the one i've dreamt of.
but by definition, the ideal man exists only in the mind.

so we catch a cab together and we talked the entire way home.
and we got along really well, and she just was so great.
the guys and i thought we'd have a little fun judging the events today.
so we thought we'd let you, our faithful and horny audience,
the situation in the styrian village of hornberg is coming to a climax.
after the arrest of the mayor the department of finance is demanding strict control of property sales in the entire region.
therefore, we have to be pretty smart, disciplined and on our toes.
we always have to look out for each other and ourselves.
if she was virgin then you made her into a whore, faggot.
and without any shame you dragged your friend into it, pimp.
she said for that money she would sleep with me, not him.
later she told me that if i had money she would sleep with me anywhere.
i can't keep the wench on board, for the rest of her life.
let's say we sailed to black sea and dropped her off in constantia.
whenever we go to shopping we just have to carry it over to breakfast the next day.
kamil, let's have something with rak- and the fish for tomorrow evening
the goal keeper i stood in front of never got scored on.
in those days it was dream to get rich playing football.
when she didn't like the money he offered, she pointed me out.
she said for that money she would sleep with me, not him.
they say they're in love with the girl and then plot to kill her.
you were out of sorts so i thought i'd keep an eye on them.
steal the money from those guys' pockets, five counts of robbery.
having pulled all this shit we can't look the cops in the eye and say "sorry, it was an accident." they'll draw blood.
therefore, we have to be pretty smart, disciplined and on our toes.

we've shown you how to run wire through a frame wall before the drywall is up.
next, we'll show you how to run wire through an existing wall.
i've taught him to run all kinds of wire through walls, including computer wire for schools.
so, you need that rat before you can use your mouse.
tim is going to reward him with a piece of cheese at the bottom.
you can see by the complexity of this wall, it'd be hard to do this by hand.
you might as well just put him in a dress and give him a bus pass.
look, a lot of states have passed nighttime driving laws because teenagers have more accidents after dark.
i've driven with him at night and he's a good driver.
i just want him to have more experience before we send him out in the dark.
so you're saying that i was right not to let randy drive at night?
no, i'm just saying you should treat each child according to his individual needs.
i was hoping once you got here, things would turn around.
then it would be safe enough for my billy to come back and live with me.
i'm an officer of the federal court, you son of a bitch.
you kill me and you'll have the whole damn union army come down on you.
when my husband was killed i swore on his grave i would not become a victim.
and that his dreams, everything we worked so hard for they wouldn't be taken away from us.
these men risked their lives to bring this man to justice.
i want 1 2 good men who give a damn about this town to step forward and see justice done.
i don't think we're gonna have to worry about it for a while, though.
even the centauri have to realize that babylon 5 is vital to the peace process.
well, she said she'd say yes if the minbari said yes first.
she's not gonna stick her neck out if it's not gonna happen.
this has to be done in secret until the first prototype rolls off the assembly line.
but the hyperspace routes from here to minbar are not safe we've got centauri all over the map, we've got firefights every inch of the way.
well, it's the way that they're refusing to return the bodies that makes me think there's something else going on behind the scenes.
you, as the chief medical officer of the alliance you could put pressure on them into returning the bodies.
i mean, what if they're not releasing the bodies because our people are still alive and they're just torturing them for information?
i mean, you could find out who died in space and who died elsewhere.
g'kar, the regent either ordered the war directly or allowed others to act on his behalf.
either way the only way to stop this war is to go up against the regent himself.
in order to do that without being executed, i have to have supporters.
now, when the word gets out that the prime minister is being held without charge in a cell in the royal palace, the people will be outraged.
i just wanted to get a personal report on the progress of the centauri conflict.
with the help of the white star fleet, we are holding our own, mr. president.
with the depletion of our forces after our last experience with the centauri we would've suffered even greater casualties without the assistance of the white star fleet.
am i correct in that each of your governments is primarily engaged in defending your own borders?
you can't just fight a war to fight a war and honk off your neighbors.
there have to be definitive and, to their minds, achievable goals.
our first goal should be to draw a line in space contain their forces and then...
- we will win the war more quickly by attacking the centauri homeworld, as they have attacked ours!
fortunately, the white stars and other warships can jump in and out on their own.
it looks like i was worried about you when i should've been worried about us.
and there is no one more fond of the regent than i am.
it was i who recommended him for the position after the death of emperor cartagia.
the vorlons gave me information on them in case i ever ran across one.
i understand a few years ago one was found by the psi corps.
it's an organic device used to control a ship from a long distance.
you put two or three of these onboard a starship and you don't even need a crew.
but it's possible that one of these races sold the stuff to the centauri.
with the cooperation of a few others in charge of the military the regent could run an offensive war without the military knowing about it.
and i did it just a few moments before i came to see you.
the last thing i will ever have to do for them.
i don't think we're gonna have to worry about it for a while, though.
even the centauri have to realize that babylon 5 is vital to the peace process.
well, she said she'd say yes if the minbari said yes first.
she's not gonna stick her neck out if it's not gonna happen.
this has to be done in secret until the first prototype rolls off the assembly line.
but the hyperspace routes from here to minbar are not safe we've got centauri all over the map, we've got firefights every inch of the way.
well, it's the way that they're refusing to return the bodies that makes me think there's something else going on behind the scenes.
you, as the chief medical officer of the alliance you could put pressure on them into returning the bodies.
i mean, what if they're not releasing the bodies because our people are still alive and they're just torturing them for information?
i mean, you could find out who died in space and who died elsewhere.
g'kar, the regent either ordered the war directly or allowed others to act on his behalf.
either way the only way to stop this war is to go up against the regent himself.
in order to do that without being executed, i have to have supporters.
now, when the word gets out that the prime minister is being held without charge in a cell in the royal palace, the people will be outraged.
i just wanted to get a personal report on the progress of the centauri conflict.
with the help of the white star fleet, we are holding our own, mr. president.
with the depletion of our forces after our last experience with the centauri we would've suffered even greater casualties without the assistance of the white star fleet.
am i correct in that each of your governments is primarily engaged in defending your own borders?
you can't just fight a war to fight a war and honk off your neighbors.
there have to be definitive and, to their minds, achievable goals.
our first goal should be to draw a line in space contain their forces and then...
- we will win the war more quickly by attacking the centauri homeworld, as they have attacked ours!
fortunately, the white stars and other warships can jump in and out on their own.

the last thing i will ever have to do for them.
if this continues, we may have no choice but to quarantine the centauri.
we'll have to try and limit them to parts of the station where they won't run into anyone they're currently at war with.
figured i'd stop by and bring you up to speed on the latest from mr. garibaldi.
we've had reports, unconfirmed but reliable that the centauri have begun targeting enemy jumpgates.
and i've stationed half our fighters outside the station the other half are standing by in hyperspace.
i don't think we're gonna have to worry about it for a while, though.
even the centauri have to realize that babylon 5 is vital to the peace process.
i don't think they'll come after us until the white star fleet gets into it.
the white stars are authorized to fire at any centauri warship engaged in combat with alliance vessels.
any hope of neutrality babylon 5 had until now just went up in smoke.
the problem is we've been using them against everything from medium-size cruisers to full-blown destroyers.
so far they've been able to hold their own against ships five, six times their size and that's commendable, but we can't keep doing that.
she's not gonna stick her neck out if it's not gonna happen.
so you would like me to contact the grey council and propose this.
not terrific conversationalists and their table manners can make you go blind in one eye but really tough behind the weapons consoles.
but on the occasion that we've destroyed one of their ships we have always returned their bodies to them.
that's unfortunate, vir, and i feel for you but what are we supposed to do about it?
well, it's the way that they're refusing to return the bodies that makes me think there's something else going on behind the scenes.
you, as the chief medical officer of the alliance you could put pressure on them into returning the bodies.
and a telepath, a good one could find out what they're hiding and where and why.
and while it pains me to be in here i think that i may do more good in here than out there.
g'kar, the regent either ordered the war directly or allowed others to act on his behalf.
either way the only way to stop this war is to go up against the regent himself.
in order to do that without being executed, i have to have supporters.
since time is precious to us all, i won't keep you.
i just wanted to get a personal report on the progress of the centauri conflict.
with the help of the white star fleet, we are holding our own, mr. president.
several incursions on brakiri space have been beaten back in just the last 24 hours.
what does seem strange to me is that we are reacting and not acting.
we have the resources to be more aggressive to strike at their holdings in a more meaningful way.

it's one of those areas of catholicism that's frankly a bit mad.
the whole catholic thing's a bit of a puzzler, isn't it?
i don't know why you're finding it so easy to drop off.
today you're going to be taking a photograph of me kicking bishop brennan up the arse, and he won't like that.
i might have a way you can kick him up the arse and get away with it.
if you did, that would make you the most intelligent person in the world.
so when you kick him up the arse, carry on like nothing happened.
he'd never believe that you'd be brave enough to kick him up the arse.
it's just that i can see another visión of you, your grace.
the bits of fluff are arranging themselves into a bishop formation.
what i gather is that father dick byrne has told bishop brennan of a miraculous image that's been appearing in the skirting boards of the house here.
he told bishop brennan that in the wood grain you can see what appears to be a perfect likeness of...

(whimpering) it's just that i can see another vision of you, your grace.

well, i suppose the company, the fresh air, the view from my window of that great pile of sludge but number one on the list is the matter of you kicking me up the arse.
yes, i think that is the one i would prioritise. (growling)

this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earliertoday, l.a. county fire-fighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
well,this country's becoming a haven for criminals... so what do you expect?
decent hard-working americans like my dad... are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
putting out afire in afucking nigger neighbourhood... he shouldn't have given a shit about.
he got shot by afucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare cheque.
derek vinyard was quietly releasedfrom chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
there's overtwo million illegal immigrants... bedding down in this state tonight.
this state spent three billion dollars last year... on services forthose people who had no right to be here.
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it... who fired these guys and is making a killing... because he hired 40 fucking border jumpers.
i see this shit going on... and i don't see anybody doing anything about it... and itfucking pisses me off.
it's like an expression of rage... by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
it's like we had in watts orthe riots in chicago in '68.
it's people grabbing any excuse they can find... to go and loot a store, nothing more.
the fact that these people ripped off the stores... in their own communities, all that reflects... is that they have no respect forthe law at all... and certainly no concept of community... or civic responsibility.
one in every three black males... is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence... or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
he's high as a goddamn kite... driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
he gets pulled over by a bunch of cops... and he attacks them.
and there's some yahoo there with a video camera... who turned it on halfway through... so that all we see is them hitting him.
you got powell and koon cracking him with billy clubs... and briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull... so it looks severe,you know?
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
but instead, he just attacked afew cops... so, suddenly, it's hands across america... forthis fucking total son of a bitch.
i willfucking cut your shylock nose off... and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner... with yourjewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.
i know it's a boring job... but it's betterthan that last shit they had me doing.
i spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
no matter how fast you get through them... they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
throwing them around like that... ain't gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!
when she comes to visit you... whatever you do, no matterwhat... don't let her leave here in afight, man.
don't let herwalk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the nextweek... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
you've been talking about... what's going on with me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.

derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
i hate tabitha soren and her zionist mtv fucking pigs... telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton... 'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
they're in a better position to make that call than you are.
we, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority... to make those calls, because we acknowledge... that their job is difficult and dangerous.
i don't respect laws that let rodney king back on the street.
second, i am not a member of a low-rent... disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
if that fucking monkey had run some kid over... everybody would have a very different opinion.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
we're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation... to help this struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome... these historical injustices.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved... and we all know that.
i understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums... and the larges with the larges, all right?
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i know i ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though.
as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at...
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now... working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
so when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk.
every time i stepped out of my cell... every time i got in that shower...
i figured it was only a matter of time... before they made a move.
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted-- if i hit the social significance... or whatever you're looking for... but for what it's worth, thanks a lot.
i saw a car cruising by the house last night... when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me today, give a look around the street.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best... so if you can't top it... steal from them and go out strong.
because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
everything you do right now has something to do with derek.
he's been doing outreach work with gangs, both in and out of the can.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard was sent up for murdering two crips who were trying to jack his car.
l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard was shot and killed battling a blaze at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home right now and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son, derek, has agreed to talk with us.
derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second.
look, i know this is tough, but, um, how do you feel right now?
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him things could get very ugly down by the beach.
he said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared in their own neighborhood.
for a while there, he really made it like it was ours again.
he said it would make it too hard for him and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow.
three years without him, just wondering and then at 7:00 this morning we picked him up outside the gate.
[singing] my eyes have seen the glory of the trampling at the zoo
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
that's the best shit i've heard come out of your mouth.
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.
a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store.
the fact these people ripped off stores in their own communities reflects that these people have no respect for the law.

i will fucking cut your shylock nose off and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner with your jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit!
all you do is put the mediums with the mediums and the large with the large.
it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
a lot of hard talk around here and not a lot of follow-through.
i think you'd better chill out on the preaching bullshit, okay?
i don't know what a nigger is, but we'll hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
she comes to visit you whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
she comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
it's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love.
i think if you asked derek why it all went the way it did, and where it all started he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
listen, too i saw a car cruising by the house last night when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me, look around the street, all right?
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best so if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong.
on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights... in plain english.
i am not disputing the fact that the child is confused... and harbors some sick ideas... but i am not ready to give up on him yet.
your first assignment... is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
come on, sweeney. lt took me a week to read "mein kampf."
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.

derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if you win, we will walk away... but if we win, no bitching, no fighting.
right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit... and get your black asses out of here.
my eyes have seen the glory... of the trampling at the zoo.
we've washed ourselves in nigger's blood... and all the mongrels, too.
i hate tabitha soren and her zionist mtv fucking pigs... telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton... 'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
you do anything he tells you to do. i mean it.
i don't want you getting in trouble in school... trying to impress me, taking this shit in there.
they're in a better position to make that call than you are.
we, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority... to make those calls, because we acknowledge... that their job is difficult and dangerous.
i don't respect laws that let rodney king back on the street.
second, i am not a member of a low-rent... disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
but instead, he just attacked a few cops... so, suddenly, it's hands across america... for this fucking total son of a bitch.
i will fucking cut your shylock nose off... and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner... with your jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved... and we all know that.
i understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums... and the larges with the larges, all right?
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i know i ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though.
as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at... i'll tell you.
that's all we gonna do is hate some niggers all day.
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
when she comes to visit you... whatever you do, no matter what... don't let her leave here in a fight, man.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
it's hard to look back... and see the truth about people you love.
i think if you asked derek why it all went the way it did... and where it all started... he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
everything's equal now, but i got two guys watching my back... responsible for my life who aren't as good.
they only got the job because they were black... not because they were the best.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted-- if i hit the social significance... or whatever you're looking for... but for what it's worth, thanks a lot.
listen. i saw a car cruising by the house last night... when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me today, give a look around the street.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best... so if you can't top it... steal from them and go out strong.
he needs my help, and i'm gonna give it to him.
if you come near danny again... i will feed you your fucking heart, cameron.
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
no matter how fast you get through them... they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
throwing them around like that... ain't gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now... workin' next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
so when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk.
you've been talking about... what's going on with me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i mean, do you know what you're asking me to do?
yes. i'm asking you to do whatever's in your power to do.
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
well, this country's becoming a haven for criminals... so what do you expect?
decent hard-working americans like my dad... are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
putting out a fire in a fucking nigger neighborhood... he shouldn't have given a shit about.
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare check.
derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
i hate tabitha soren and her zionist mtv fucking pigs... telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton... 'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
they're in a better position to make that call than you are.
we, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority... to make those calls, because we acknowledge... that their job is difficult and dangerous.
i don't respect laws that let rodney king back on the street.
second, i am not a member of a low-rent... disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
if that fucking monkey had run some kid over... everybody would have a very different opinion.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
we're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation... to help this struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome... these historical injustices.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved... and we all know that.
i understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums... and the larges with the larges, all right?
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i know i ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though.
as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at...
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.

don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
so when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk.
every time i stepped out of my cell... every time i got in that shower...
i figured it was only a matter of time... before they made a move.
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted-- if i hit the social significance... or whatever you're looking for... but for what it's worth, thanks a lot.
i saw a car cruising by the house last night... when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me today, give a look around the street.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best... so if you can't top it... steal from them and go out strong.
on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights... in plain english.
i am not disputing the fact that the child is confused... and harbors some sick ideas... but i am not ready to give up on him yet.
i want you to analyze and interpret all the events... surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective... concerning life in contemporary america.
for some time now, he's been doing outreach work... with gangs both in and out of the can.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard... was sent up for murdering a couple of crips... who were trying to jack his car.
he's the biggest distributor and writer... of white power literature and videos in l.a. county.
he promotes white power bands, he writes reviews... and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns.
essentially, he used derek to recruit... a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids.
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
look, i know this is tough, but how do you feel right now?
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare check.
derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him... things could get very ugly down by the beach.
if you win, we will walk away... but if we win, no bitching, no fighting.
right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit... and get your black asses out of here.
my eyes have seen the glory... of the trampling at the zoo.
we've washed ourselves in nigger's blood... and all the mongrels, too.
what don't you like about them... and say it with some fucking conviction.
i hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
there's over two million illegal immigrants... bedding down in this state tonight.
this state spent three billion dollars last year... on services for those people who had no right to be here.
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it... who fired these guys and is making a killing... because he hired 40 fucking border jumpers.
i see this shit going on... and i don't see anybody doing anything about it... and it fucking pisses me off.
it's like an expression of rage... by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
it's like we had in watts or the riots in chicago in '68.
it's people grabbing any excuse they can find... to go and loot a store, nothing more.
the fact that these people ripped off the stores... in their own communities, all that reflects... is that they have no respect for the law at all... and certainly no concept of community... or civic responsibility.
one in every three black males... is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence... or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
he's high as a goddamn kite... driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
he gets pulled over by a bunch of cops... and he attacks them.
and there's some yahoo there with a video camera... who turned it on halfway through... so that all we see is them hitting him.
you got powell and koon cracking him with billy clubs... and briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull... so it looks severe, you know?
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
but instead, he just attacked a few cops... so, suddenly, it's hands across america... for this fucking total son of a bitch.
i will fucking cut your shylock nose off... and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner... with your jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.

they only got the job because they were black... not because they were the best.
anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
everything you do right now has something to do with derek.
i want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective concerning life in contemporary america.
whatever you wanna say, danny i'll be the only one reading it.
but if it's not on my desk tomorrow morning you are a ghost at venice beach high.
he's been doing outreach work with gangs, both in and out of the can.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard was sent up for murdering two crips who were trying to jack his car.
he runs everything out of his house down by the beach.
no white gangs in venice beach before cameron alexander and derek vinyard hooked up.
this kid vinyard, well, he's got a lot of baggage as you'll see in this tape that we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard was shot and killed battling a blaze at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home right now and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son, derek, has agreed to talk with us.
derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second.
this country's becoming a haven for criminals, so, what do you expect?
decent, hardworking americans like my dad are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him things could get very ugly down by the beach.
he said it would make it too hard for him and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow.
three years without him, just wondering and then at 7:00 this morning we picked him up outside the gate.
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
we're taking down the zog machine jew by jew, by jew
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
that's the best shit i've heard come out of your mouth.
you do anything he tells you to do. i mean it.
i don't want you in trouble in school, trying to impress me taking this shit in there, all right?
there's over 2 million illegal immigrants bedding down in this state tonight.
this state spent $3 billion last year on services for people who had no right to be here in the first place.
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.
one in every three black males is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
i don't respect laws that let monkeys like rodney king on the street.
second, i am not, as you well know a member of a low-rent, disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
we're hung up on this notion we have some obligation to help the struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.
all you do is put the mediums with the mediums and the large with the large.
it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
a lot of hard talk around here and not a lot of follow-through.
i think you'd better chill out on the preaching bullshit, okay?
i don't know what a nigger is, but we'll hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
the job i had on the outside wasn't much better than this one.
but at least i gotta go home at night and lie down next to this sweet smell.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best so if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong.
look sweeney, did you bring me in here to talk about derek?
because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
and for some time now, he's been doing outreach work with gangs, both in and out of the can.
at 3 years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard was sent up for murdering a couple of crips who were trying to jack his car.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard was shot and killed battling a blaze at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home right now and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son, derek, has agreed to talk with us fro a moment.
derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second.
look, i know this is tough but how do you feel right now?
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him, things could get very ugly down by the beach.
my eyes have seen the glory of the trampling at the zoo
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
that's the best shit i've heard come out of your mouth.
because the government cares more about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't even citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.
that's a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store, nothing more.
another fact, these people ripped off the stores in their own communities all reflects the degree to which these people absolutely have no respect for the law at all.
i mean he is a multiple felon by his own admission.
he's high as a goddamn kite, driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
we're so hung up on this notion we have some obligation to help the struggling black man.
you know, cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.
everyone's turning looking the other way while our country rots from inside out.
in christ, lincoln freed the slaves, what, like, 130 years ago.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved and we all know that.
i understand you just got out but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums and the large with the large, all right?
look, it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
there is a lot of hard talk around here and not a lot of follow-through.
i think you'd better chill out on the preaching bullshit, okay?
i don't know what a nigger is, but you know we'll hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
i go, "what you doing?" you know what he tells me?
he goes, "lt's better than the pig i just tried to fuck."
she comes to visit you whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight, man.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
god, man.you've been talking about what's going on in me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know so much about what's going on inside me?
but after a while, i just put my head down and read the stuff that sweeney sent me and i kept to myself.
the last 6 months in that place, i was like a ghost.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best so if you can't top it, steal from them and go out strong.
you told them to do a report... on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights... in plain english.

it's people grabbing any excuse they can find... to go and loot a store, nothing more.
the fact that these people ripped off the stores... in their own communities, all that reflects... is that they have no respect for the law at all... and certainly no concept of community... or civic responsibility.
one in every three black males... is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence... or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
he's high as a goddamn kite... driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
he gets pulled over by a bunch of cops... and he attacks them.
and there's some yahoo there with a video camera... who turned it on halfway through... so that all we see is them hitting him.
you got powell and koon cracking him with billy clubs... and briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull... so it looks severe, you know?
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
but instead, he just attacked a few cops... so, suddenly, it's hands across america... for this fucking total son of a bitch.
i will fucking cut your shylock nose off... and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner... with your jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
no matter how fast you get through them... they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
throwing them around like that... ain't gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!
that's all we gonna do is hate some niggers all day.
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
when she comes to visit you... whatever you do, no matter what... don't let her leave here in a fight, man.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
you've been talking about... what's going on with me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
it's hard to look back... and see the truth about people you love.
i think if you asked derek why it all went the way it did... and where it all started... he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
everything's equal now, but i got two guys watching my back... responsible for my life who aren't as good.
they only got the job because they were black... not because they were the best.
anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i want you to analyze and interpret all the events... surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective... concerning life in contemporary america.
for some time now, he's been doing outreach work... with gangs both in and out of the can.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard... was sent up for murdering a couple of crips... who were trying to jack his car.
he's the biggest distributor and writer... of white power literature and videos in l.a. county.
he promotes white power bands, he writes reviews... and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns.
essentially, he used derek to recruit... a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids.
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
look, i know this is tough, but how do you feel right now?
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare check.
derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him... things could get very ugly down by the beach.
what don't you like about them... and say it with some fucking conviction.
i hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
there's over two million illegal immigrants... bedding down in this state tonight.
this state spent three billion dollars last year... on services for those people who had no right to be here.
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it... who fired these guys and is making a killing... because he hired 40 fucking border jumpers.
i see this shit going on... and i don't see anybody doing anything about it... and it fucking pisses me off.
it's like an expression of rage... by people who feel neglected and turned away by the system.
it's like we had in watts or the riots in chicago in '68.
it's people grabbing any excuse they can find... to go and loot a store, nothing more.

you got powell and koon cracking him with billy clubs... and briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull... so it looks severe, you know?
if that fucking monkey had run some kid over... everybody would have a very different opinion.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
we're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation... to help this struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome... these historical injustices.
he needs my help, and i'm gonna give it to him.
if you come near danny again... i will feed you your fucking heart, cameron.
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i spent two years in the kitchen scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
no matter how fast you get through them... they gonna keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
throwing them around like that... ain't gonna do a damn thing but give you a heart attack!
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now... workin' next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
so when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk.
you've been talking about... what's going on with me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know what's going on inside me?
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
anyway, we're gonna try to pick things up and start over.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i mean, do you know what you're asking me to do?
yes. i'm asking you to do whatever's in your power to do.
look, did you bring me in here to talk about derek?
because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
i want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective concerning life in contemporary america.
whatever you wanna say, danny i'll be the only one reading it.
but if it's not on my desk tomorrow morning you are a ghost at venice beach high.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard was sent up for murdering two crips who were trying to jack his car.
bob taught vinyard back in high school and he's followed the case closely.
essentially, he used derek to recruit a slew of insecure frustrated and impressionable kids.
this kid vinyard, well, he's got a lot of baggage as you'll see in this tape that we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
we're at the vinyard home right now and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son, derek, has agreed to talk with us.
derek, if you could come down here, please, for just a second.
this country's becoming a haven for criminals, so, what do you expect?
decent, hardworking americans like my dad are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
putting out a fire in a nigger neighborhood he shouldn't have given a shit about.
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer who probably collects a welfare check.
derek vinyard was released from chino earlier this morning after serving three and some-odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
we're taking down the zog machine jew by jew, by jew
and i hate tabitha soren and all her zionist mtv fucking pigs telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
there's over 2 million illegal immigrants bedding down in this state tonight.
this state spent $3 billion last year on services for people who had no right to be here in the first place.
it's about decent, hardworking americans falling through the cracks and getting the shaft.
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
one in every three black males is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
i don't respect laws that let monkeys like rodney king on the street.
second, i am not, as you well know a member of a low-rent, disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
if that monkey had run some kid over everybody would have a different opinion of this matter.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved and we all know that.
i understand you just got out but no one's gonna hurt you.
it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i spent two years in the kitchen, ha, scrubbing hot-ass pots and pans.
no matter how fast you get through them, man they'll keep bringing them in and bringing them in.
throwing them around ain't gonna do a thing but give you a heart attack.
i know i ain't the one getting mad at them damn sheets, though.
as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at?
the job i had on the outside wasn't much better than this one.
but at least i gotta go home at night and lie down next to this sweet smell.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
you've been talking about what's going on in me since i was in high school.
how the fuck do you know so much about what's going on inside me?
but after a while i just put my head down read the stuff that sweeney sent me, and i kept to myself.
the last six months in that place i was like a ghost.
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.
the mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
because what happened to him has nothing to do with me.
everything you do right now has something to do with derek.
all right, your first assignment is to prepare for me a new paper due tomorrow.
oh, come on. lt took me a week to read mein kampf.
i want you to analyze and interpret all the events surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective concerning life in contemporary america.
whatever you wanna say, danny i'll be the only one reading it.

derek vinyard was released from chino earlier this morning after serving three and some-odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
he said it would make it too hard for him and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow.
three years without him, just wondering and then at 7:00 this morning we picked him up outside the gate.
[singing] my eyes have seen the glory of the trampling at the zoo
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
and i hate tabitha soren and all her zionist mtv fucking pigs telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
you do anything he tells you to do. i mean it.
i don't want you in trouble in school, trying to impress me taking this shit in there, all right?
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.

cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.
all you do is put the mediums with the mediums and the large with the large.
it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
a lot of hard talk around here and not a lot of follow-through.
i think you'd better chill out on the preaching bullshit, okay?
i don't know what a nigger is, but we'll hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
she comes to visit you whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
she comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
listen, too i saw a car cruising by the house last night when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me, look around the street, all right?
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.
the mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."

it's like we had in watts or the riots in chicago in '68.
it's people grabbing any excuse they can find... to go and loot a store, nothing more.
the fact that these people ripped off the stores... in their own communities, all that reflects... is that they have no respect for the law at all... and certainly no concept of community... or civic responsibility.
one in every three black males... is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence... or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
he's high as a goddamn kite... driving 120 miles an hour down the highway.
he gets pulled over by a bunch of cops... and he attacks them.
and there's some yahoo there with a video camera... who turned it on halfway through... so that all we see is them hitting him.
you got powell and koon cracking him with billy clubs... and briseno's kicking him in the back of the skull... so it looks severe, you know?
if that fucking monkey had run some kid over... everybody would have a very different opinion.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
we're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation... to help this struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome... these historical injustices.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved... and we all know that.
i understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums... and the larges with the larges, all right?
i know it's a boring job... but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
i know i ain't the one getting mad at them sheets, though.
as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at... i'll tell you.
that's all we gonna do is hate some niggers all day.
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
when she comes to visit you... whatever you do, no matter what... don't let her leave here in a fight, man.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
it's hard to look back... and see the truth about people you love.
i think if you asked derek why it all went the way it did... and where it all started... he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.
everything's equal now, but i got two guys watching my back... responsible for my life who aren't as good.
they only got the job because they were black... not because they were the best.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted-- if i hit the social significance... or whatever you're looking for... but for what it's worth, thanks a lot.
listen. i saw a car cruising by the house last night... when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me today, give a look around the street.
derek says it's always good to end a paper with a quote.
he says someone else has already said it best... so if you can't top it... steal from them and go out strong.
you told them to do a report... on any book that related to the struggle for civil rights... in plain english.
i am not disputing the fact that the child is confused... and harbours some sick ideas... but i am not ready to give up on him yet.
i want you to analyse and interpret all the events... surrounding derek's incarceration.
how these events helped shape your present perspective... concerning life in contemporary america.
for some time now, he's been doing outreach work... with gangs both in and out of the can.
three years ago, a local kid named derek vinyard... was sent up for murdering a couple of crips... who were trying to jack his car.
he's the biggest distributor and writer... of white power literature and videos in l.a. county.
he promotes white power bands, he writes reviews... and in his spare time, this guy even writes hate columns.
essentially, he used derek to recruit... a slew of insecure, frustrated, and impressionable kids.
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county fire-fighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
look, i know this is tough, but how do you feel right now?
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare cheque.
derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.
i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him... things could get very ugly down by the beach.
if you win, we will walk away... but if we win, no bitching, no fighting.
right here in front of everybody, pack up your shit... and get your black asses out of here.
my eyes have seen the glory... of the trampling at the zoo.
we've washed ourselves in nigger's blood... and all the mongrels, too.
what don't you like about them... and say it with some fucking conviction.
i hate the fact it's cool to be black these days.
i hate tabitha soren and her zionist mtv fucking pigs... telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton... 'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
they're in a better position to make that call than you are.
we, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority... to make those calls, because we acknowledge... that their job is difficult and dangerous.
i don't respect laws that let rodney king back on the street.
second, i am not a member of a low-rent... disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
if that fucking monkey had run some kid over... everybody would have a very different opinion.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
we're so hung up on this notion that we have some obligation... to help this struggling black man.

as a matter of fact, the only sheets i get mad at...
don't know what a nigger is, but we gonna hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now... workin' next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy.
don't let her walk out with a bad attitude... 'cause if you do, you spend the next week... wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else... you know what i'm saying?
so when she come to see you, it's nothing but sweet talk.
every time i stepped out of my cell... every time i got in that shower...
i figured it was only a matter of time... before they made a move.
after awhile, i just put my head down... and read the stuff that sweeney sent me... and i kept to myself.
last six months in that place, i was like a ghost.
it won't be easy, but we're all together again... and i feel good.
i'm not sure if this paper is what you wanted- if i hit the social significance... or whatever you're looking for... but for what it's worth, thanks a lot.

come on, sweeney. lt took me a week to read "mein kampf."
this kid vinyard, he's got a lot of baggage... as you'll see on this tape we've gotten courtesy of nbc.
earlier today, l.a. county firefighter dennis vinyard... was shot and killed battling a blaze... at a suspected compton drug den.
we're at the vinyard home now... and lieutenant vinyard's oldest son derek... has agreed to talk with us for a moment.
derek, if you could come down here please for a second.
well, this country's becoming a haven for criminals... so what do you expect?
decent hard-working americans like my dad... are getting rubbed out by social parasites.
putting out a fire in a fucking nigger neighborhood... he shouldn't have given a shit about.
he got shot by a fucking drug dealer... who probably still collects a welfare check.
derek vinyard was quietly released from chino... early this morning after serving three and some odd years.

save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton... 'cause it ain't gonna fucking happen.
you do anything he tells you to do. i mean it.
i don't want you getting in trouble in school... trying to impress me, taking this shit in there.
they're in a better position to make that call than you are.
we, as society, grant cops a certain amount of authority... to make those calls, because we acknowledge... that their job is difficult and dangerous.
i don't respect laws that let rodney king back on the street.
second, i am not a member of a low-rent... disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
they'd be focused on rodney king and not on these officers.
but instead, he just attacked a few cops... so, suddenly, it's hands across america... for this fucking total son of a bitch.
i will fucking cut your shylock nose off... and stick it up your ass before i let that happen.
coming in here and poisoning my family's dinner... with your jewish, nigger-loving, hippie bullshit.
those niggers got exactly what they deserved... and we all know that.
i understand you just got out, but no one's gonna hurt you.
all you gotta do is put the mediums with the mediums... and the larges with the larges, all right?

i think this is something we gotta keep an eye on.
if something happens to him things could get very ugly down by the beach.
he said white kids shouldn't have to walk around scared in their own neighborhood.
for a while there, he really made it like it was ours again.
he said it would make it too hard for him and that if we came, he wouldn't see us anyhow.
three years without him, just wondering and then at 7:00 this morning we picked him up outside the gate.
[singing] my eyes have seen the glory of the trampling at the zoo
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
that's the best shit i've heard come out of your mouth.
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.
a bunch of people grabbing any excuse they can find to go and loot a store.

she comes to visit you whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight.

if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
she comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
it's hard to look back and see the truth about people you love.
i think if you asked derek why it all went the way it did, and where it all started he'd still say it started when our father was murdered.

[singing] my eyes have seen the glory of the trampling at the zoo
we washed ourselves in niggers' blood and all the mongrels' too
and i hate tabitha soren and all her zionist mtv fucking pigs telling us we should get along.
save the rhetorical bullshit, hillary rodham clinton because it ain't gonna fucking happen.
you do anything he tells you to do. i mean it.
i don't want you in trouble in school, trying to impress me taking this shit in there, all right?
the government cares about the constitutional rights of a bunch of people who aren't citizens of this country!
on the statue of liberty, it says, "give me your tired, your hungry, your poor."
he went under, and now some fucking korean owns it, who fired these guys and is making a killing because he hired 40 fucking border-jumpers.
i see this shit going on and i don't see anybody doing anything about it.
one in every three black males is in some phase of the correctional system.
is that a coincidence or do these people have a racial commitment to crime?
i don't respect laws that let monkeys like rodney king on the street.
second, i am not, as you well know a member of a low-rent, disorganized bunch of rednecks like the fucking kkk.
we're hung up on this notion we have some obligation to help the struggling black man.
cut him some slack until he can overcome these historical injustices.
all you do is put the mediums with the mediums and the large with the large.
it's a boring job, but it's better than that last shit they had me doing.
a lot of hard talk around here and not a lot of follow-through.
i think you'd better chill out on the preaching bullshit, okay?
i don't know what a nigger is, but we'li hate them.
my cousin derek is in the pen right now working next to a nigger, driving him nigger crazy."
she comes to visit you whatever you do, no matter what, don't let her leave here in a fight.
don't let her walk out of here with a bad attitude.
if you do you spend next week wondering if she's getting her fuck on with somebody else.
she comes to see you it's nothing but sweet talk through that glass.
i stole a tv from a store that was right next door to a doughnut shop, all right?
i run out, the store owner's running behind me, yelling, bam.
listen, too i saw a car cruising by the house last night when i pulled out of there with seth.
if you get home before me, look around the street, all right?
though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection.
the mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
as soon as i turn this over, kung lao is twenty-four hours away from being mine.
will you align your forces with mine to destroy kung lao?
join me in this and i will reveal the secret to taking the life force... the souls of your victims.
you must realise that by adding your secret to my powers... there will never be a question as to which of us is...
what's wrong with having a little fun once in a while?
if i'm expected to take this seriously, then so are you.
since i lost jen, my life's been one battle after another.
i'm supposed to be getting others ready for mortal kombat, but frankly...
do you think it's possible there might be someone out there who's as good... or, dare i say it, better than you?
yes, of course it's possible, but you always said it rested on me.
kung lao still has a few more hours before it is final.
give me the secret and i'll bide my time in the parallel realm waiting for kung lao.
as soon as i turn this over, kung lao is twenty-four hours away from being mine.
will you align your forces with mine to destroy kung lao?

what's wrong with having a little fun once in a while?
if i'm expected to take this seriously, then so are you.
in due course. i need all my energy to keep the illusion alive.
when the twenty-four hours have passed... and kung lao is trapped in my alternate realm... then i will give you what we agreed.
like i said, lhis is just one of many realms... and we have been brought back here together to make things right this time.
to be with jen, all i have to do is... stay?
a dead plaintiff is rarely worth as much as a living, severely maimed plaintiff.
however, if it's a long, agonizing death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.
a dead adult in his 20s is worth less than a middle-aged one, a dead woman less than a dead man, single adults less than married, black less than white, poor less than rich.
but the perfect victim is a white, male, professional, 40 years old, at the height of his earning power, struck down in his prime.
they call us ambulance chasers, bottom feeders, vultures preying on the misfortunes of others.
if that's true, why do i lie awake worrying about my clients?
i'd make sure everyone knew not to disturb me during that hour.
because that would be my time, my own private time, which no-one, if they had any sense of self-preservation, would dare interrupt.
the lawyer who shares his client's pain does his client such a grave disservice he should have his license to practice taken away.
it clouds his judgement, and that's as useful as a doctor who's frightened of blood.
he performed no real investigation, did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.
and he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
to be honest, your honor, i had to look it up.
i'll be honest, so did i. do you know why, mr cheeseman?
we have to show how the toxic solvents these factories dumped on the land there, were drawn into the city wells here and well h over there, and then pumped into east woburn homes.
so i'll need to inspect and map the debris, drill some monitoring wells, conduct seismic tests, and so on.
the nature of the contour here means there's an effect, named after me, actually...
in the shop, mr roberts, you used solvents to clean brushes?
you know, it's important, because if there is something wrong, we need to disclose it to the authorities.
we need to get them out there and have it cleaned up.
please inform your client that he's obligated to answer my question.
let the record show that the witness emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
he just said, go out and dig a trench... 30 feet long.
load the barrels onto the truck, drive out and dump it into the swimming pool.
start with jimmy anderson, countless trips to hospital, futile chemotherapy treatments.
then the others, ending with jared aufiero, dying on the highway.
unless you've proven that poisons reached the wells, there's no case.
and therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
look for it where it is, at the bottom of a bottomless pit.
mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
"yes" to question one regarding trichloroethylene contamination, requiring the case against grace to go to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered "no" to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
we are going to take a break now, until after lunch.
once again, i remind you not to talk to anyone about your deliberations here...
i wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.
instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht.
how can you even begin to compare what you've lost to what we've lost?
listen, the minute you put money on the table, things turn ugly.
you know how sometimes you get so close to something that you lose sight of it?
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i...
i should've been looking for someone who helped him clean it up.
why did you rent two dump trucks and a front loader in october '81?
it takes longer, it costs more, its outcome is even less promising.
only five cases in 50 will win in appeals court, odds as easy to calculate as they are discouraging.
i have the evidence but not the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in this case.
i have no money, no partners, and, it seems, no clients any more.
the woburn case has become what it was when it first came to me... an orphan.
i'm forwarding it on to you, knowing you may not want it any more than i did at first.

they call us ambulance chasers, bottom feeders, vultures preying on the misfortunes of others.
if that's true, why do i lie awake worrying about my clients?
and they begin the same way, with a declaration of war - the complaint.
when you're a small firm and they're big, steeped in history and wealth, with persian carpets on the floor and harvard diplomas on the walls, it's easy to be intimidated.
the lawyer who shares his client's pain does his client such a grave disservice he should have his license to practice taken away.

he performed no real investigation, did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.
and he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
in the shop, mr roberts, you used solvents to clean brushes?
what would you've done with that stuff back in the 1970s and '80s?
a lot of people in my neighborhood are dead, or dying, mr chessman, from something.
look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them in the air, half would land heads and half tails, right?
you knew when you moved to woburn that its water didn't taste good?
yeah, but lots of places the water doesn't taste so good.
you were optimistic about his future and suddenly he became ill and died.
and they said that was expected - that anybody with a disease like leukemia could die any minute.
let the record show that the witness emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
what exactly do you intend to say to me by pouring water on my table?
you said tce - as it is commonly known... to those who know it.
mr riley, would you mind if i checked your statements today against your records - invoices, purchase orders and formulas?
the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
you do that by spending more money than you should, forcing them to spend more money than they should.
as if that could somehow bring dead children back to life.
every credit card application we send, we get more in the mail.
the terrain of east woburn was actually shaped 12,000 years ago, during the end of the last ice age.
at this time, an immense glacier, over a mile thick, covered what is now new england.
mr riley, you own the property referred to here as the 15 acres?
no, it's currently owned by a non-profit corporation called the wildwood conservancy.
i don't think the indigent wildlife has heard about this, mr riley.
i've been there several times and haven't seen any living thing.
now... my plan is to present the jury with some simple questions.
how you answer these three questions, will determine whether this trial continues.
how can you even begin to compare what you've lost to what we've lost?
listen, the minute you put money on the table, things turn ugly.
you know how sometimes you get so close to something that you lose sight of it?

a dead plaintiff is rarely worth as much as a living, severely-maimed plaintiff.
however, if it's a long, agonizing death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.
and, and you have to ask yourself, why is this an orphan?
why has it been kicked from firm to firm before it ended up on your desk?
and then she'll start to cry again, and then you'll start to cry again.
and then she'll be mad at me again, so i'll do it.
which means that we can only take on so many cases at once.
and we have to be very careful about the ones we do because, frankly, we can't afford to lose.
i was wondering if i could talk to you about something.
uh, do you think we could get together for a drink or a...
now, the matter before us seems to be a simple one.
your honor, i'm sorry, but i don't think it is simple.
if i took 100 pennies and threw 'em up in the air, about half of 'em would land heads and the other half tails, right?
now if i looked around closely, i'd probably find some heads grouped together in a cluster.
you know, it's, uh, it's important because, uh, if there is something wrong out there, we need, we need to disclose it to the proper authorities.
we need to get 'em out there and have it cleaned up.
so you were aware when you moved to woburn that its water didn't taste so good.
yeah, but, a lot of places the water doesn't taste so good.
has any doctor ever told you that you've had any dysfunction of your immune system?
no, but, uh, when my son died, they told us that that was why he died.
let the record show that the witness has emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
what exactly do you intend to say to me, mr. riley, by pouring a glass of water on my table?
the point is, everybody in the firm's working only on this case.
that means we have no money coming in, just going out.
i understand that you've had a chance to think about things since your first deposition.
he says that you said he should just pour it into the pit.
is that how you remember it, now that your memory's been refreshed?
vinnie said go out there and dig a trench, oh, 20, 30 feet long.
out of the 780,000 cases filed each year, only 12,000, or 1.5 %, ever reach a verdict.
the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
these chemicals never reached wells g and h almost half a mile away, and we will show that.
and they never made anyone sick, and we will show that too.
we want to try to understand what's going on in the groundwater system.
(ashtray clatters) the place we have to start is the soil itself.
and i know a lot of y'all ain't gonna believe this, but i got to share this with you.
if somebody wrote a check tomorrow for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving one penny.
unless you've proven that any poisons actually reached the wells, there's no case.
and, therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
now we have to see where we are before we can move on.
and before we subject these families to more trauma than is necessary...
that's not how you made all that money all these years, is it?
you want to know when this case stopped being about dead children?
with respect to w. r. grace, the jury has answered yes to question one regarding trichloroethylene contamination requiring that we proceed further in the case against grace to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered no to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination, which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
i wanted to reach across the table and strangle him with his tie.
but instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about sailing his yacht in long island south.
and that says to every two-bit personal injury lawyer in boston,
"hey, let's run off to woburn and sign up every jerk with a head cold."
i got, uh, i got a couple bucks and some bus transfers.
i've got a savings account from when i was 12 years old.
our expenses, what we actually paid out trying this case comes to $3.5 million.
now, subtracting that and the 28 % in fees from the $8 million we got from grace, and dividing it equally among you, comes out to $375,000 per family.
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison when what i should have been looking for is someone who helped him clean it up.
was there a personal reason why you rented two dump trucks and a front loader back in october of '81?
i have the evidence, but no longer the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in the beatrice case.
i have no money, no partners, and, as far as i can tell, no clients anymore.
♪ i don't know why you treat me so bad ♪ ooh, ooh
♪ think of all the things that we could have had ♪ ooh, ooh
♪ all the changes that you put me through ♪ ooh, ooh
♪ the sixteen candles burning on my wall ♪ ooh, ooh
however, if it's a long, agonising death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.
a dead adult in his 20s is worth less than a middle-aged one, a dead woman less than a dead man, single adults less than married, black less than white, poor less than rich.
there's a report here from state inspectors saying that the water from two city wells is contaminated - or was before they shut them down - with something called...
i can't pronounce this... trichlorethylene...ethylene, which the epa lists as a probable carcinogen.
i'd make sure everyone knew not to disturb me during that hour.
because that would be my time - my own private time, which no-one, if they had any sense of self-preservation, would dare interrupt.

he just said, go out and dig a trench...30 feet long.
load the barrels onto the truck, drive out and dump it into the swimming pool.
the idea of civil court and personal injury law by nature - though no-one says it,
least of all the personal injury lawyer himself - is money.
so when you ask me would i be upset if someone desecrated it -
iand that's part of the town that i love - my answer to your question, mr schlichtmann... is yes.
now... my plan is to present the jury with some simple questions.
how you answer these three questions, will determine whether this trial continues.
you know how sometimes you get so close to something that you lose sight of it?
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i...

mrs anderson, our firm is very small, three attorneys, that's it.
which means that we can only take so many cases at once and we have to be very careful about the ones we do because, frankly, we can't afford to lose.
and they begin the same way, with a declaration of war - the complaint.
when you're a small firm and they're a big one, steeped in history and wealth, like they always are with their persian carpets on the floor and their harvard diplomas hanging on the walls, it's easy to be intimidated.
maybe listen to a game out at fenway if one was on.
i'd make sure everyone knew i didn't want to be disturbed me during that hour or so of solitude.
ah, listen, i was wondering if i could talk to you about something.
- do you think we could get together for a drink or a...
in fact the lawyer who shares his client's pain, in my opinion, does his client such a grave disservice he should have his licence to practice law taken away.
it clouds his judgement, and that's as beneficial to his client as a doctor who recoils at the sight of blood.
he performed no real investigation, he did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.
and he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
i'll need to inspect the land, map out the location of debris, drill some monitoring wells, conduct seismic tests, and so on.
and you're talking about you and a couple of assistants, or something?
you see it's actually quite exciting because the nature of the contour here means there's an effect - which is named after me, as a matter of fact, where the flow of the aquifer goes against the gravitational pull...
in the grace paintshop, mr roberts, i imagine you used paint thinners and solvents to clean your brushes and things?
there's a lot of people in my neighborhood that are dead, or dying, mr chessman, from something.
look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them up in the air, about half of them would land heads and the other half tails, right?
you know, it's important, because if there is something wrong out there, we need to disclose it to the proper authorities.

the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
and you do that by spending more money than you should, which forces them to spend more money than they should.
and only fools with something to prove end up ensnared in them.
now when i say prove, i don't mean about the case.
these chemicals never reached wells g and h - almost half a mile away...and we will show that.
and they never made anyone sick, and we will show that, too.
every credit card application we send in, we get two more in the mail.
here's one from some bank i never heard of in north dakota.
to understand what's going on in the ground water system, the place we have to start is the soil itself.
now these are actual soil samples so the sample c, the aberjona river valley...
i can't not object when you phrase questions improperly, not just from a craftsman's point of view...
he is deliberately trying to destroy the rhythm of my case.
... and the sad part of it is, they're robbing themselves of the blessing of giving.
and i know a lot of y'all ain't gonna believe this but if somebody wrote a cheque tomorrow for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving one bit.
start with jimmy anderson - countless trips to hospital, futile chemotherapy treatments.
and then the other kids, one by one, ending with jared aufiero, dying on the highway.
unless you've proven that any poisons actually reached the wells, there's no case.
and therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
your honor, the jury came into this courtroom expecting a human drama.
and instead, for three months, we've been giving them lessons in geology.
now... my plan is to present the jury with some simple questions.
...indeed how you answer these three questions, will determine whether or not this trial continues.
and it's not going to have anything to do with dates or ground-water measurements or any of that crap, which nobody can understand anyway.
it's going to come down to people, like it always does.
come on, you've been around long enough to know that a courtroom isn't a place to look for the truth.
you're lucky to find anything here that in any way resembles the truth.
as far as truth and justice and... and dead children go?
if you want to talk seriously about a settlement offer, let's get the decision-makers together and talk seriously.
oh, if you're really looking for the truth, jan, look for it where it is - at the bottom of a bottomless pit.
mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
"yes" to question one regarding trichlorethylene contamination, requiring that we proceed further in the case against grace to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered "no" to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
we are going to take a little break now, a breather, until after lunch.
once again, i remind you not to talk to anyone about your deliberations and... thank you for your service.
so you intend to go forward with your claims against grace, no matter how long it takes?
we have to get out of this case as fast as we can.
they want us to come to new york and sit down with, uh, their executive vice-president, al eustis.
so before we do that we need to know what our squeal point is.
instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht at long island sound.
you know, sometimes i actually prefer the little one, the 35-footer.
and that says to every two-bit personal injury lawyer in boston,
hey, let's run up to woburn and sign up every jerk with a head-cold.
so 10 million is some mythic struggle, but eight is just another lawsuit!
if they're willing to pay eight, gordon, then it's not enough, is it?
our contingency fee, as you know, as you agreed to... as is customary is forty percent, but jan suggested, and we all agreed to reduce that to twenty-eight percent or 2.2 million dollars.
our expenses...what we actually paid out trying this case - comes to 3.5 million dollars.
do you know how sometimes you get so close to something that you lose sight of it?
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i... what i should've been looking for was someone who helped him clean it up.
was there a personal reason why you rented two dump trucks and a front loader back in october of '81?
or is this just part of your job at the tannery?
the appeals process is even more byzantine than the trial it's appealing.
it takes longer, it costs more, its outcome is even less promising.
i have the evidence but no longer the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in the beatrice case.
i have no money, no partners, and, as far as i can tell, no clients any more.
the woburn case has become what it was when it first came to me - an orphan.
i'm forwarding it on to you, in all it's unwieldiness even as i know you may not care to adopt it any more than i did at first.
a dead plaintiff is rarely worth as much as a living, severely maimed plaintiff.
however, if it's a long, agonizing death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.
a dead adult in his 20s is worth less than a middle-aged one, a dead woman less than a dead man, single adults less than married, black less than white, poor less than rich.
but the perfect victim is a white, male, professional - 40 years old, at the height of his earning power, struck down in his prime.
they call us ambulance chasers, bottom feeders, vultures preying on the misfortunes of others.
if that's true, why do i lie awake worrying about my clients?
and they begin the same way, with a declaration of war - the complaint.
when you're a small firm and they're big, steeped in history and wealth, with persian carpets on the floor and harvard diplomas on the walls, it's easy to be intimidated.
the lawyer who shares his client's pain does his client such a grave disservice he should have his license to practice taken away.
it clouds his judgement, and that's as useful as a doctor who's frightened of blood.
he performed no real investigation, did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.
and he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
to be honest, your honor, i had to look it up.
i'll be honest, so did i. do you know why, mr cheeseman?
we have to show how the toxic solvents these factories dumped on the land there, were drawn into the city wells here and well h over there, and then pumped into east woburn homes.
so i'll need to inspect and map the debris, drill some monitoring wells, conduct seismic tests, and so on.
the nature of the contour here means there's an effect - named after me, actually...
in the shop, mr roberts, you used solvents to clean brushes?
you know, it's important, because if there is something wrong, we need to disclose it to the authorities.
we need to get them out there and have it cleaned up.
please inform your client that he's obligated to answer my question.
let the record show that the witness emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
he just said, go out and dig a trench... 30 feet long.
load the barrels onto the truck, drive out and dump it into the swimming pool.
the sad part is, they rob themselves of the blessing of giving.
if somebody wrote a cheque for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving.
start with jimmy anderson - countless trips to hospital, futile chemotherapy treatments.
then the others, ending with jared aufiero, dying on the highway.
unless you've proven that poisons reached the wells, there's no case.
and therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
look for it where it is - at the bottom of a bottomless pit.
mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
"yes" to question one regarding trichloroethylene contamination, requiring the case against grace to go to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered "no" to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
we are going to take a break now, until after lunch.
once again, i remind you not to talk to anyone about your deliberations here...
i wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.
instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht.
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i...
i should've been looking for someone who helped him clean it up.
why did you rent two dump trucks and a front loader in october '81?
or is this just part of your job at the tannery?
the appeals process is even more byzantine than the trial it's appealing.
it takes longer, it costs more, its outcome is even less promising.
just about any bet at any table in any casino anywhere in the world... is better than that.
i have the evidence but not the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in this case.
i have no money, no partners, and, it seems, no clients any more.
the woburn case has become what it was when it first came to me - an orphan.
however, if it's a long, agonizing death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.
a dead adult in his 20s is generally worth less than one who is middle-aged.
and, and you have to ask yourself, why is this an orphan?
why has it been kicked from firm to firm before it ended up on your desk?
which means that we can only take on so many cases at once.
and we have to be very careful about the ones we do because, frankly, we can't afford to lose.
and i'd make sure everyone knew i didn't want to be disturbed during that hour or so of solitude.
because that would be my time, my own private time, which no one, if they had any sense of self-preservation at all would dare interrupt.
what they're saying with this motion is that they know the law and i don't.
what they're saying is that they're real lawyers and i'm not.
uh, specifically on the fact that, uh, mr. schlichtmann had absolutely no evidential grounds on which to bring this suit, only his knowledge that my client, uh, the w. r. grace corporation has a lot of money.
uh, he performed no real investigation, he did no research of any consequence, uh, except perhaps to review profit statements, and, uh, he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
be sure we weren't polluting the air and things of that nature.
well, then you must know then that over the years certain chemicals were deposited on the ground in back of the plant.
has any member of your family had any illness out of the ordinary?
you don't have to answer any of these type of questions.
if i took 100 pennies and threw 'em up in the air, about half of 'em would land heads and the other half tails, right?
now if i looked around closely, i'd probably find some heads grouped together in a cluster.
you know, it's, uh, it's important because, uh, if there is something wrong out there, we need, we need to disclose it to the proper authorities.
we need to get 'em out there and have it cleaned up.
has any doctor ever told you that you've had any dysfunction of your immune system?
no, but, uh, when my son died, they told us that that was why he died.
mr. facher, please inform your client that he's obligated to answer my question.
let the record show that the witness has emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
what exactly do you intend to say to me, mr. riley, by pouring a glass of water on my table?
this is how silicone is put on leather to waterproof it.
he says that you said he should just pour it into the pit.
is that how you remember it, now that your memory's been refreshed?
vinnie said go out there and dig a trench, oh, 20, 30 feet long.
and load the barrels onto the truck, drive it out there, dump it into the swimming pool.
out of the 780,000 cases filed each year, only 12,000, or 1.5 %, ever reach a verdict.
the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
trials are a corruption of the entire process, and only fools with something to prove end up ensnared in them.
now when i say "prove" i don't mean about the case.
these chemicals never reached wells g and h almost half a mile away, and we will show that.
and they never made anyone sick, and we will show that too.
every credit card application we send in, we get two more in the mail.
here's one from some bank i never heard of in north dakota.
well, you know, i don't think the indigent wildlife has heard about this, mr. riley.
i've been out there on several occasions, and i've yet to see a single bird or any other living thing.
and the sad part of it is, they're robbing themselves of the blessing of giving.
and i know a lot of y'all ain't gonna believe this, but i got to share this with you.
if somebody wrote a check tomorrow for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving one penny.
ain't nobody gonna rob me of the blessing i get from giving!
we count his trips to the hospital, the futile chemotherapy treatments.
then the other kids, one by one, ending with jarrod aufiero dying in his father's arms on the highway.
unless you've proven that any poisons actually reached the wells, there's no case.
and, therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
now we have to see where we are before we can move on.
and before we subject these families to more trauma than is necessary...
my plan is to present the jury with some simple questions.
indeed, how you answer these three questions will determine whether or not this trial continues.
you want to know when this case stopped being about dead children?
the minute you filed the complaint, the minute it entered the justice system.
with respect to w. r. grace, the jury has answered yes to question one regarding trichloroethylene contamination requiring that we proceed further in the case against grace to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered no to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination, which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
they want us to come to new york and sit down with, uh, their executive vice president, al eustis.
so before we do that, we need to know what our squeal point is.
but instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about sailing his yacht in long island south.
you know, sometimes i, uh, sometimes i actually prefer the little one.
i got, uh, i got a couple bucks and some bus transfers.
i've got a savings account from when i was 12 years old.
our expenses, what we actually paid out trying this case comes to $3.5 million.
now, subtracting that and the 28 % in fees from the $8 million we got from grace, and dividing it equally among you, comes out to $375,000 per family.
do you know how sometimes you can get so close to something that you lose sight of it?
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison when what i should have been looking for is someone who helped him clean it up.
was there a personal reason why you rented two dump trucks and a front loader back in october of '81?
or was this just part of your job at the tannery?
i have the evidence, but no longer the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in the beatrice case.
i have no money, no partners, and, as far as i can tell, no clients anymore.
a dead plaintiff is rarely worth as much as a living, severely maimed plaintiff.
however, if it's a long, agonizing death, as opposed to a quick drowning or car wreck, the value can rise considerably.

but the perfect victim is a white male professional, 40 years old, at the height of his earning power, struck down in his prime.
they call us ambulance chasers, bottom feeders, vultures who prey on the misfortunes of others.
if that's true, why do i lie awake worrying about my clients?
there's a report here from state inspectors that says that the water from two city wells is contaminated... or was before they shut them down... with something called...
i can't pronounce this... trichlorethylene... ethylene, which the epa lists as a probable carcinogen.
and... and you have to ask yourself, why is this an orphan?
why has it been kicked from firm to firm before it ended up on your desk.
mrs anderson, our firm is very small, three attorneys, that's it.
which means that we can only take so many cases at once and we have to be very careful about the ones we do because, frankly, we can't afford to lose.
and they begin the same way, with a declaration of war - the complaint.
when you're a small firm and they're a big one, steeped in history and wealth, like they always are with their persian carpets on the floor and their harvard diplomas hanging on the walls, it's easy to be intimidated.
maybe listen to a game out at fenway if one was on.
i'd make sure everyone knew i didn't want to be disturbed me during that hour or so of solitude.
ah, listen, i was wondering if i could talk to you about something.
- do you think we could get together for a drink or a...
in fact the lawyer who shares his client's pain, in my opinion, does his client such a grave disservice he should have his licence to practice law taken away.
it clouds his judgement, and that's as beneficial to his client as a doctor who recoils at the sight of blood.
he performed no real investigation, he did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.
and he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.
i'll need to inspect the land, map out the location of debris, drill some monitoring wells, conduct seismic tests, and so on.
and you're talking about you and a couple of assistants, or something?
you see it's actually quite exciting because the nature of the contour here means there's an effect - which is named after me, as a matter of fact, where the flow of the aquifer goes against the gravitational pull...
in the grace paintshop, mr roberts, i imagine you used paint thinners and solvents to clean your brushes and things?
there's a lot of people in my neighborhood that are dead, or dying, mr chessman, from something.
look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them up in the air, about half of them would land heads and the other half tails, right?
you know, it's important, because if there is something wrong out there, we need to disclose it to the proper authorities.
we need to get them out there and have it cleaned up.
so, you were aware when you moved to woburn that its water didn't taste good.
yeah, but a lot of places the water doesn't taste so good.
you were optimistic about his future and suddenly he became ill and died.
and they said that was expected... that anybody with a disease like leukemia could die any minute.
let the record show that the witness has emptied a glass of water on the conference table.
what exactly do you intend to say to me, mr riley, by pouring water on my table?
he says that you said he should just pour it into the pit.
is that how you remember it now that your memory's been refreshed?
then he said, go out there and dig a trench... 20, 30 feet long.
...and load the barrels onto the truck, drive out there... dump it into the swimming pool.
the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
and you do that by spending more money than you should, which forces them to spend more money than they should.
and only fools with something to prove end up ensnared in them.
now when i say prove, i don't mean about the case.
these chemicals never reached wells g and h - almost half a mile away...and we will show that.
and they never made anyone sick, and we will show that, too.
every credit card application we send in, we get two more in the mail.
here's one from some bank i never heard of in north dakota.
to understand what's going on in the ground water system, the place we have to start is the soil itself.
now these are actual soil samples so the sample c, the aberjona river valley...
i can't not object when you phrase questions improperly, not just from a craftsman's point of view...
he is deliberately trying to destroy the rhythm of my case.
... and the sad part of it is, they're robbing themselves of the blessing of giving.
and i know a lot of y'all ain't gonna believe this but if somebody wrote a cheque tomorrow for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving one bit.
start with jimmy anderson - countless trips to hospital, futile chemotherapy treatments.
and then the other kids, one by one, ending with jared aufiero, dying on the highway.
unless you've proven that any poisons actually reached the wells, there's no case.
and therefore, no need to make these families, who've already suffered so much, relive their suffering all over again by putting them on the stand.
your honor, the jury came into this courtroom expecting a human drama.
and instead, for three months, we've been giving them lessons in geology.
now... my plan is to present the jury with some simple questions.
...indeed how you answer these three questions, will determine whether or not this trial continues.
and it's not going to have anything to do with dates or ground-water measurements or any of that crap, which nobody can understand anyway.
it's going to come down to people, like it always does.
come on, you've been around long enough to know that a courtroom isn't a place to look for the truth.
you're lucky to find anything here that in any way resembles the truth.
as far as truth and justice and... and dead children go?
if you want to talk seriously about a settlement offer, let's get the decision-makers together and talk seriously.
oh, if you're really looking for the truth, jan, look for it where it is - at the bottom of a bottomless pit.
mr foreman, members of the jury, have you reached a verdict?
"yes" to question one regarding trichlorethylene contamination, requiring that we proceed further in the case against grace to a second stage of this trial.
in regard to beatrice, the jury has answered "no" to question one in all its points pertaining to contamination which renders questions two and three inapplicable, ending the case against beatrice.
we are going to take a little break now, a breather, until after lunch.
once again, i remind you not to talk to anyone about your deliberations and... thank you for your service.
so you intend to go forward with your claims against grace, no matter how long it takes?
we have to get out of this case as fast as we can.
they want us to come to new york and sit down with, uh, their executive vice-president, al eustis.
so before we do that we need to know what our squeal point is.
instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht at long island sound.
you know, sometimes i actually prefer the little one, the 35-footer.
and that says to every two-bit personal injury lawyer in boston,
hey, let's run up to woburn and sign up every jerk with a head-cold.
so 10 million is some mythic struggle, but eight is just another lawsuit!
if they're willing to pay eight, gordon, then it's not enough, is it?
our contingency fee, as you know, as you agreed to... as is customary is forty percent, but jan suggested, and we all agreed to reduce that to twenty-eight percent or 2.2 million dollars.
our expenses...what we actually paid out trying this case - comes to 3.5 million dollars.
do you know how sometimes you get so close to something that you lose sight of it?
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i... what i should've been looking for was someone who helped him clean it up.
was there a personal reason why you rented two dump trucks and a front loader back in october of '81?
or is this just part of your job at the tannery?
the appeals process is even more byzantine than the trial it's appealing.
it takes longer, it costs more, its outcome is even less promising.
i have the evidence but no longer the resources or the gambling spirit to appeal the decision in the beatrice case.
i have no money, no partners, and, as far as i can tell, no clients any more.
the woburn case has become what it was when it first came to me - an orphan.

what would you've done with that stuff back in the 1970s and '80s?

look, if i took a hundred pennies and threw them in the air, half would land heads and half tails, right?

yeah, but lots of places the water doesn't taste so good.
you were optimistic about his future and suddenly he became ill and died.
and they said that was expected - that anybody with a disease like leukaemia could die any minute.
let the record show that the witness emptied a glass of water on my conference table.
what exactly do you intend to say to me by pouring water on my table?
you said tce - as it is commonly known... to those who know it.
mr riley, would you mind if i checked your statements today against your records - invoices, purchase orders and formulas?
the whole idea of lawsuits is to settle, to compel the other side to settle.
you do that by spending more money than you should, forcing them to spend more money than they should.
as if that could somehow bring dead children back to life.
every credit card application we send, we get more in the mail.
the terrain of east woburn was actually shaped 12,000 years ago, during the end of the last lce age.
at this time, an immense glacier, over a mile thick, covered what is now new england.
mr riley, you own the property referred to here as the 15 acres?
no, it's currently owned by a non-profit corporation called the wildwood conservancy.
i don't think the indigent wildlife has heard about this, mr riley.
i've been there several times and haven't seen any living thing.
the sad part is, they rob themselves of the blessing of giving.
if somebody wrote a cheque for the total budget of my church, it wouldn't affect my giving.
start with jimmy anderson - countless trips to hospital, futile chemotherapy treatments.
then the others, ending with jared aufiero, dying on the highway.

once again, i remind you not to talk to anyone about your deliberations here...
i wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.
instead, i sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht.
how can you even begin to compare what you've lost to what we've lost?
listen, the minute you put money on the table, things turn ugly.
i kept looking for someone who saw riley dumping barrels of poison, when i...
i should've been looking for someone who helped him clean it up.
why did you rent two dump trucks and a front loader in october '81?
or is this just part of your job at the tannery?
the appeals process is even more byzantine than the trial it's appealing.

i think the only thing you need pumped is the air out of your head.
first, let me just congratulate you on your choice of sexual activity... because, sweetie, the world is not ready for you to reproduce.
before you go, if there's another e. coli crisis in the cafeteria...
i want you to have the biggest, juiciest burger on me.
now what exactly happens when i say "bloody mary" five times?
the person standing next to you wonders how you got into college in the first place.
so is this what you do for your free time, damon?
hang out in the dark by yourself, waiting to scare people like a freak.
i'm sure most of you... grew up thinking this did happen to girls... in all your hometowns... but it didn't.
you see, the baby-sitter... and the man upstairs... is what we call an urban legend.
police suspect her assailant was probably hiding in the back seat.
in the meantime, the search continues for michael mcdonald... the proprietor of this gas station where she was last seen.
this is the end of your rotten life, you motherfuckin' dope pusher!
it was easy for him because he really didn't believe it was coming.
damon is the best practical joker on this campus, all right?
he once convinced a freshman he was the middle hanson brother to get laid.
then my big question is, what is he gonna do next?
maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum or ram a gerbil up a celebrity's ass.
if it makes you feel any better, i don't wanna talk about tash.
i just wanted to know... if you can tell me a little bit about this.
michelle wanted to play a practical joke... so she turned the headlights off... and waited for the first car to pass by and flash us.
when someone finally did... she made a u-turn and... started chasing him... flashing her high beams, laughing.
i was laughing, too, at first... then we started going really fast.
i wanted to tell her to stop... but i just sat there.
the one you and your friend decided to have a little fun with that night.
david and i were gonna get married... that summer... right after graduation.
you weren't driving, but it was your car... and you were there, natalie!
now... didn't you tell me... that you were having a little difficulty... forgiving yourself?
i think the only thing you need pumped is the air out of your head.
first, let me just congratulate you on your choice of sexual activity... because, sweetie, the world is not ready for you to reproduce.
before you go, if there's another e. coli crisis in the cafeteria...

i'm sorry, but i can't understand a thing you're saying, doll.
now, if i remove the gag... you have got to promise me... that you won't scream.
david and i were gonna get married... that summer... right after graduation.
he didn't have enough money to buy me a ring yet so... he got me this instead... the night you took him away from me!
so if this is an urban legend... at what point do we get to the twist?
the river was such a mess 'cause of the storm... it washed away the body.
i think the only thing you need pumped is the air out of your head.

i'm sure most of you... grew up thinking this did happen to girls... in all your hometowns... but it didn't.
you see, the baby-sitter... and the man upstairs... is what we call an urban legend.
police suspect her assailant was probably hiding in the back seat.
in the meantime, the search continues for michael mcdonald... the proprietor of this gas station where she was last seen.
this is the end of your rotten life, you motherfuckin' dope pusher!
it was easy for him because he really didn't believe it was coming.
damon is the best practical joker on this campus, all right?
he once convinced a freshman he was the middle hanson brother to get laid.
then my big question is, what is he gonna do next?
maybe put spider eggs in bubble gum or ram a gerbil up a celebrity's ass.
if it makes you feel any better, i don't wanna talk about tash.
i just wanted to know... if you can tell me a little bit about this.
michelle wanted to play a practical joke... so she turned the headlights off... and waited for the first car to pass by and flash us.
when someone finally did... she made a u-turn and... started chasing him... flashing her high beams, laughing.
i was laughing, too, at first... then we started going really fast.
i wanted to tell her to stop... but i just sat there.
the one you and your friend decided to have a little fun with that night.
david and i were gonna get married... that summer... right after graduation.
you weren't driving, but it was your car... and you were there, natalie!
now... didn't you tell me... that you were having a little difficulty... forgiving yourself?
dwarfed by the vast expanse of the open ocean, the biggest animal that has ever lived on our planet.
a blue whale, 30 metres long and weighing over 200 tonnes.
its heart is the size of a car, and some of its blood vessels are so wide that you could swim down them.
its tail alone is the width of a small aircraft's wings.
the ocean's largest inhabitant feeds almost exclusively on one of the smallest - krill, a crustacean just a few centimetres long.
gathered in a shoal, krill stain the sea red, and a single blue whale in a day can consume 40 million of them.
despite the enormous size of blue whales, we know very little about them.
their migration routes are still a mystery, and we have absolutely no idea where they go to breed.
you can fly across it non-stop for 12 hours and still see nothing more than a speck of land.
this series will reveal the complete natural history of our ocean planet from its familiar shores to the mysteries of its deepest seas.
it's regulated by the path of currents carrying nutrients, and the varying power of the sun.
in this first programme, we will see how these two forces interact to control the distribution of life from the coral seas to the polar wastes.
water vapour rising from it forms the clouds and generates the storms that ultimately will drench the land.
the great waves that roar in towards the shores are dramatic demonstrations of its power.
out in the open ocean, unimpeded by land, such swells can become gigantic.
it's only when an ocean swell eventually reaches shallow water that it starts to break.
as it approaches the coast, the water at the bottom of the swell is slowed by contact with the seabed.
the top of the swell, still travelling fast, starts to roll over and so the wave breaks.
isolated sea mounts like this one create oases where life can flourish in the comparatively empty expanses of the open ocean.
but all the creatures that swim beside it would not be here were it not for one key factor -
these fish live mostly in the cold waters south of the cape, but each year the coastal currents reverse.
the warm agulhas current that flows down from the north has been displaced by cold water from the south, and that has brought up rich nutrients.
they in turn have created a bloom of plankton, and the sardines are now feasting on it.
as the sardines travel north, a whole caravan of predators follow them.
these three-metre sharks cut such great swathes through the sardine shoals that their tracks are visible from the air.
harried by packs of predators and swept in by the action of the waves, the sardine shoals are penned close to the shore.
common dolphin are coming in from the open ocean to join the feast.
there are over a thousand of them in this one school.
thanks to the dolphins, the sardines have come within the diving range of the gannets.
hundreds of white arrows shoot into the sea, leaving long trails of bubbles behind each dive.
they are being released by the dolphins working together in teams.
they use the bubbles to corral the sardines into ever tighter groups.
the sardines seldom cross the wall of bubbles and crowd closer together.
bubble netting in this way, enables the dolphins to grab every last trapped sardine.
just when the feasting seems to be almost over, a bryde's whale.
the survivors head on northwards, and the caravan of predators follows them.
nutrients can also be brought up, though less predictably, by rough weather.
particularly near the poles, huge storms stir the depths and enrich the surface waters, and here, in the south atlantic, the seas are the roughest on the planet.
and very rich seas they are, too, for here, the cold falklands current from the south meets the warm brazil current from the north, and at their junction is food in abundance.
these black-browed albatross are duck-diving for krill that has been driven up to the surface.
most of the time, the birds of the open sea are widely dispersed, but these feeding grounds are close to an albatross breeding colony, and a very special one.
this is steeple jason, a remote island in the far west of the falklands.
nutrients by themselves are not enough to generate these vast assemblies.
the heat and light from the sun is also essential for the growth of the microscopic floating plants - the phytoplankton.
and it's the phytoplankton that is the basis of all life in the ocean.
every evening, the disappearance of the sun below the horizon triggers the largest migration of life that takes place on our planet.
at dawn, the whole procession returns to the safety of the dark depths.
the moon, too, has a great influence on life in the oceans.
each month, it waxes and wanes as it travels round the earth, and this monthly cycle also triggers events in the ocean.
the pacific coast of costa rica on a very special night.
at first, they come in ones and twos, but within an hour, they are appearing all along the beach.
they are all female ridley's turtles, and over the next six days or so,
400,000 will visit this one beach to lay their eggs in the sand.
at the peak time, 5,000 are coming and going every hour.
the top of the beach gets so crowded that they have to clamber over one another to find a patch where they can dig a nest hole.
a quarter of the world's population of ridley's turtles come to this one beach on a few key nights each year.
by synchronising their nesting, the females ensure that six weeks later, their hatchlings will emerge in such enormous numbers that predators are overwhelmed, and a significant proportion of baby turtles will make it to the water.
but why do the females use a cue from the moon to help synchronise their nesting?
part of the answer to that becomes clear at dawn on the following morning.
the day shift of predators are arriving for their first meals.
vultures have learnt that the returning tide can wash freshly laid eggs out of the sand.
the risk of eggs being exposed by the surf may be partly why turtle arribadas tend to occur around the last or first quarter of the moon.
it's on such days as this when the moon is neither full nor new, that the tides are weakest and the sea is likely to be calmer.
so it's easier for the female turtles to make their way through the surf, and harder for eggs to be washed out of the sand and taken by vultures.
the moon's monthly cycle and its influence on the tides triggers many events in the ocean, from the spawning of the corals on the great barrier reef to the breeding cycles of fish, but there's an even longer rhythm
that has the most profound effect of all - the annual cycle of the sun.
the sun's position relative to the earth changes through the year, and it's this that produces the seasons.
in the north, spring comes as the sun begins to rise higher in the sky.
off the coast of north west america, the seas are transformed by the increasing strength of the sun.
here in alaska, the coastal waters turn green with a sudden bloom of phytoplankton.
herring that have spent the winter far out to sea time their return to the shallow waters to coincide with this bloom.
they come in vast numbers and initiate one of the most productive food chains in all the oceans.
this herring bonanza provides the majority of their food for the year.
stellar and californian sea lions also return from the open ocean each year to feast off the herring.
after the females have spawned, the males release their sperm in vast, milky clouds.
soon, the excesses of the herrings' sexual spree creates a thick white scum on the surface.
through the season, curds of sperm clog the shores for hundreds of miles from british columbia in the south to alaska in the north.
after a few days, this gigantic spawning comes to an end, and the herring head back out to deeper waters, leaving behind them fertilised eggs plastered on every rock and strand of vegetation.
they time the spawning so that two weeks later, when the eggs hatch, the annual plankton bloom will be at its height, and the fish fry will have plenty to eat.
in the meantime, these eggs provide food for armies of different animals below and above the surface.
millions of birds arrive to collect a share of the herrings' bounty.
some of it is easily gathered, for millions of eggs have been washed up onto the shore.
further out in the bay, huge flocks of ducks have gathered.
they're mostly surf scoters - diving ducks that can feed off the bottom several metres down.
there are such huge quantities of eggs, that even a big animal like a bear finds it worthwhile to collect them.
the spawning of the herring is a crucial event in the lives of many animals all along the coast.
they will not come back until the herring also return next year.
as the herring spawning finishes, other migrants are starting to arrive offshore.
krill are feeding off it, and these whales are feeding on the krill, skimming it from the surface with the filter plates of baleen that hang from their upper jaws.
grey whales make one of the longest migrations of any marine mammal - a round trip of 12,000 miles or so from their breeding grounds off mexico along the entire coast of north america up to the arctic ocean.
they travel close to the coast, with the males and non-breeding females leading the way.
the last to start are cows that have just given birth.
the mothers stay with their young, and even a strong calf only travels at a couple of knots.
they stick even closer to the shore, often within just 200 metres.
the killers have no trouble in overtaking the calf and its devoted mother.
normally, they continually call to one another, but now they have fallen silent.
the grey whale and her calf have no idea that they've been targeted.
catching up with the grey whales is the easy part for the killers.
at first, the killers avoid getting too close but just stay alongside.
they know that the calf, going at this speed, will eventually tire.
a calf separated from its mother will not be able to defend itself.
time and again, the black fins of the killers appear between the grey whales.
at last the killers succeed, and now they've got the calf on its own, they change their tactics.
they leap right onto the calf, and try to push it under.
the mother, bereft, has to continue her migration north on her own.
she leaves behind the carcass of a calf that she cherished for 13 months in her womb, for which she delayed her own journey to find food.
the 15 killer whales spent over six hours trying to kill the calf, but having succeeded, they've eaten nothing more than its lower jaw and its tongue.
valuable food like this will not go to waste in the ocean.
before long, the carcass will sink to the very bottom of this deep sea, but even there its flesh will not be wasted.
over a mile down, in the total darkness of the deep ocean, the body of another grey whale, a 30-tonne adult.
these scavengers, over half a metre long and as thick as your arm, are only found in the deep sea.
they have been attracted by the faint whiff of decay suffusing through the water for miles around.
with their heads buried in the whale's flesh, they breathe through gill openings along their sides.
they're very primitive creatures - not even true fish for they lack jaws.
they feed, not by biting, but by rasping off flesh with two rows of horny teeth.
in just a few hours, a hagfish can eat several times its own weight of rotting flesh.
sleeper sharks live over a mile down, and grow to over seven metres long.
they can go for months without food, slowly cruising along, waiting for rare bonanzas such as this one to arrive from above.
a whole range of different deep-sea scavengers will feast on this carcass for a long time before all its nutriment has been consumed.
18 months later, all that is left is a perfect skeleton stripped bare.
for most of the year, these squid live at a depth of around 500 metres.
they are part of these breeding schools for a few weeks.
just one school was estimated to contain animals that weigh around 4,000 tonnes.
wave after wave rise from the depths, and soon the seabed in the shallows is strewn with dense patches of egg capsules several metres across.
as each female adds another capsule to the pile, the males fight to fertilise its contents.
the squid make their huge journey into the shallows because their eggs will develop faster in the warmer water here, and when the young emerge, they will find more food more easily than they would in the ocean depths.
many have died, but some will have returned to their home in the deep.
they will not return to the light of the sun until the next time they are driven up by the urge to spawn.
over 60 per cent of our planet is covered by ocean more than a mile deep.
that, the deep sea, is by far the largest habitat on earth and it's largely unknown.
a sperm whale takes a breath, its last for over an hour.
it's about to leave the warm, well-lit surface waters and dive far down into the cold, dark depths of the deep ocean.
at the surface it took in air at the same pressure as we breath it.
but it's going to look for food at more than 1,000 metres down, where pressure is 100 times that on the surface, crushing the whale's lungs to just one per cent of their volume.
for us to follow the whale, we need the very latest submersible.
a reinforced acrylic sphere with walls 12 centimetres thick protects a pilot and our cameraman from the enormous pressure below, and allows the submarine to dive to just over 900 metres.
we are entering the twilight zone, a weird world of gloom where many animals have become completely transparent.
in this twilight, and animal needs to see, and yet, as far as possible, must avoid being seen.
this impressive cutlery set and its huge eyes make phronima a powerful predator.
even really complex animals have become transparent in the twilight zone.
squids are among the most advanced of invertebrates, but this one never meets a hard surface in its entire life, so its body need not be as robust as that of its shallow water cousins.
there's a rich variety of jellies that live nowhere else but in the deep sea.
500 metres down, and in even the clearest tropical waters only the faintest vestige of the sunlight remains - so little that our eyes can't detect it, but others can.
survival in the twilight zone is all about seeing, yet not being seen.
hatchet fish are masters of the game of hide and seek.
they have the large, sensitive eyes needed for seeking prey but their bodies are flat... and their sides are highly silvered.
head on, they are just visible, thin though they are, but as soon as they turn, their mirrored sides reflect the remnants of blue light from the surface, and they disappear into the gloom.
viewed from the side, whole shoals can hide in this way, but what about from below?
the tubular eyes of many of the predators, even in this gloom, are able to distinguish their prey silhouetted against the faint glimmer of light from above.
hatchet fish, however, have a way of confusing any eyes that might be searching for them from below.
the enormous yellow lenses enable their owner to distinguish between light produced by photophores and sunlight.
so, one device for escape is countered by another equally subtle one for attack in an evolutionary arms race that has been waged for millions of years.
relative to body size, these are the largest teeth in the ocean.
they are so big that their owner can't close its mouth.
with food in such short supply at this depth, dark zone predators have to be able to deal with a meal of any size.
many animals here are dark red, like this deep sea jelly.
caught in the lights of the submersible, it's a spectacular firework display of colour.
normally, no red light penetrates as deep as this, so animals with red pigment appear completely black down here, perfectly concealed.
predators here, however, don't just rely on vision - many have tiny eyes.
instead, their thin, rod-like bodies are lined with organs sensitive to tiny movements in the water.
it's covered with hundreds of sensitive antennae, which detect the movements of any prey careless enough to stray too close to this motionless predator.
but this, surely, must be the strangest of all the deep sea fish yet discovered.
it's called the gulper eel because it can engulf a meal of almost any size.
hanging motionless in mid-water, its enormous gape enables it to deal with passing prey, whether it's small, or large.
it's difficult to be sure, but then, this monster does have another giant flashing lure much closer to its mouth.
these fish are called anglers because they use their lures in much the same way as fly fishermen use their imitation flies.
a satisfying meal for a fish with a highly extendible stomach.
attracting a mate in this endless darkness can be even harder than finding food.
the tiny males are just a tenth the size of the females.
their only purpose is somehow to find a mate in the darkness.
she releases chemicals into the water which the males scent with a special white organ in front of their eyes.
having found a partner, the male bites at her belly with specially designed teeth.
her blood circulating in his body provides him with all the sustenance he needs.
in return, she gets a continuous, reliable supply of sperm - a brilliant solution to the problem of finding a mate in the vast emptiness of the deep sea.
to help in the constant battle between predators and prey, some fish in the dark zone have developed headlights.
these light-producing photophores beneath their eyes may be used to search out prey in the darkness.
the most sensitive eyes in the ocean belong to an ostracod called gigantocypris.
it's the size of a pea, but that's enormous for an ostracod.
the brightest lights come from the bioluminescent tips of their two front tentacles, but it's only in the dark of the deep sea, that you can really appreciate the full complexity of their displays.
it's not just their tentacles but their whole bodies that are covered in photophores.
the rest may be camouflage, providing counter shading for the squid as they journey up into the twilight zone.
every night in the season, hundreds of thousands of squid journey up into the shallow water to spawn.
before dawn, they will return to the depths, leaving their eggs to develop in the shallows.
the daily cycle of the sun has a profound influence on life in the deep ocean.
as the sun sets, it triggers the largest migration of living organisms on our planet.
one thousand million tonnes of animals travel up from the dark zone into richer, shallower water every night.
an enormous variety of different animals join the convoy or feed off it as it passes.
many will travel up hundreds of metres towards the surface, and, at dawn, finding themselves at risk from predators, the visitors return to the safer darkness of the depths.
the sun's rays only have a direct effect in the top 100 metres or so of the ocean.
it's only here that photosynthesis can take place and coral reefs can flourish.
so they depend second-hand on the energy captured from the sun by organisms in the surface waters.
travelling close to the sea floor, we're going to take a journey to the very bottom of the deep sea... to a world completely separate from the mid-water above.
at around 300 metres, the drop-off levels out, and we move out onto the continental slope.
this stretches for about 150 miles from the coast, sloping in a gentle gradient, down to a maximum depth of 4,000 metres.
water temperatures down here drop below four degrees centigrade and the pressure can reach up to 400 times that of the surface.
without the lights of the submersible, it would be completely dark.
the water is crystal clear because there's so little organic matter.
only three per cent of any food in the surface waters reaches the continental slope.
the deep sea floor is dominated by echinoderms - sea cucumbers, brittle stars and sea urchins.
there are literally millions of them, marching across the sea bed, hoovering up any edible particles in the sediment.
they come in all shapes and sizes, and though they are thinly spread, these are among the most numerous animals on the planet.
their spikes are good for locomotion and defence, but perhaps not quite so good when it comes to mating.
finding a mate in this largely empty sea floor could be a problem, so some urchins stay together in herds to be sure that they're never too far from a potential partner.
rocky outcrops provide good anchorage for animals that rely on food that might drift past.
these crinoids or sea lilies look like plants, but are, in fact, animals.
their long stalks ensure that their umbrella of feeding tentacles are positioned to best effect in the current.
particles are swept onto the arms, and carried down to a mouth in the middle of the umbrella.
these sudden movements swat away tiny amphipods that try to steal the sea lily's captures.
coral reefs are not supposed to exist in total darkness, but recently, a new kind of coral was found as deep as 2,000 metres.
in the cold waters of a norwegian fjord, there was a deep sea reef 30 metres high and 200 metres long.
this coral gets no energy from the sun, so it has to be very efficient in catching food.
its polyps are far larger than those of shallow water corals.
their three-centimetre-long tentacles can catch far larger prey than other corals can.
this necessity to capture every particle of food that comes within reach in this near desert has radically changed many animals.
most tunicates are filter feeders, but this one has become a predator and its greatly enlarged siphon has been converted into a trap.
most sea cucumbers stay firmly on the bottom, but not this extraordinary deep sea species.
its skirts of skin allow it to swim hundreds of metres above the sea floor.
eventually, it will descend and, with luck, will land on fresh feeding grounds.
this has to be the most extraordinary animal design of all.
it's a polychaete worm and, normally, you would expect the long, pulsating body to be stick firmly in the sediment.
this worm, alone in its group, swims in the open water.
propelling itself with its yellow frill, it moves about and so finds new sources of food, or maybe succeeds in escaping from a predator.
this is chimaera, a close relative of the sharks, less than a metre long.
sensory pits on its chin help it hunt prey on the bottom, while its surprisingly large eyes may help it spot bioluminescence.
very few people have glimpsed these sharks from submersibles, and we know almost nothing about their behaviour.
the body of a tuna is a substantial meal, but just occasionally, a really gigantic corpse drifts down to the deep sea floor.
it's only been on the bottom for six weeks, but already it has attracted hundreds of hagfish.
these ancient scavengers are nearly always the first to discover a fallen body, and are attracted from miles around.
they lack jaws and rasp at the flesh with two rows of horny teeth on either side of their sucker-like mouths.
next to arrive, a sleeper shark - a real deep sea specialist.
unlike the hagfish, it has powerful jaws, so is able to rip off huge chunks of meat.
sharks, hagfish and a whole succession of different deep sea scavengers will feast on the carcass for years before all its nutriment is gone.
eighteen months later, when we returned to this whale, all that was left was a perfect skeleton stripped bare.
it was almost as if a museum specimen had been carefully laid out on the sea floor.
at first, the skeleton seemed totally abandoned, but even after so long, there was still some flesh left in the head.
hagfish have a skeleton of cartilage and are so flexible that they tie themselves into knots and so get a better purchase on the flesh they feed on.
most remarkably, and in huge abundance, polychaete worms were collecting the last edible fragments.
these are a new species that so far have only been found on the fallen bodies of whales.
scientists have discovered 178 different animals on a single whale vertebra, most of which have been found nowhere else.
this whale, lying over a mile down, was not filmed from a submersible with an acrylic sphere.
the viewing ports have to be tiny - any larger, and the submersible would implode under the enormous pressure down here.
alvin can dive to 4,500 metres, three miles below the surface.
mostly it's completely flat, but in places it's gashed by massive trenches hundreds of miles wide.
the deepest of these is the mariana trench, which drops to over seven miles below sea level.
there are just five manned submersibles world-wide that can reach the abyssal plain, and between them so far, they have explored less than one per cent of it.
there are a thousand times fewer large animals down here than on the continental slope, but in places, hundreds of brittle stars cross the sea bed in search of food.
they forage near the sea floor and use their battery of sensory pits to follow odour trails from rotting carcasses.
rattails can travel long distances across the abyssal plain in search of food, but others down here prefer to sit and wait.
this deep sea octopus is about the size of a beach ball and has been nicknamed dumbo.
an umbrella of skin between its tentacles and its extraordinary flapping ears allow dumbo to hover effortlessly over the sea floor as it searches for food.
right in the middle of the abyssal plain lie the largest geological structures on our planet... the mid-ocean ridges.
rising almost two miles off the sea floor, the ridges extend for over 28,000 miles, the largest mountain chain on earth.
when submersibles finally succeeded in reaching the ridges in the 1970s, they found an extraordinary world with mile upon mile of once molten rock that had welled up from the deep in the past and had now solidified.
they discovered towering chimneys, pouring out water as hot as molten lead.
disaster is very close when surrounded by such enormous temperatures and pressures.
and here, where the very water is loaded with hydrogen sulphides poisonous to normal life processes, they found living creatures.
there were swarms of white crabs, and, most spectacular of all, dominating the chimney were hundreds of bright red tubeworms, each two metres long and four centimetres wide.
until these creatures were discovered, all life on earth was thought to be dependent on the sun, but here, in the complete darkness of the deep, they had discovered a rich density of life that derived no energy from the sun.
they were packed full of specialised bacteria that are able to derive energy from the sulphides that pour from the vents.
the worms' plumes were bright red with haemoglobin that carries sulphides and oxygen down to the bacteria.
just as green plants are the basis of life for animals living in the sun, so these bacteria and other microbes are at the foot of the food chain on which over 500 species depend.
crabs and shrimps feed off bacteria and even try to steal pieces of tubeworm plumes.
since the vents were first visited by biologists in 1979, a new species has been described every ten days.
at the top of the food chain, fish that never stray far from the vents, but they or their descendants will move eventually, for we now know that individual vents are rarely active for more than a few decades.
such a density of life living in such harsh conditions in the middle of a vast and otherwise barren abyssal plain astounded the biologists who first saw it.
it seemed to them that here was evidence of how life on this planet, which certainly started in the sea, might have begun.
deep sea submersibles made an even more extraordinary discovery in 1990.
over half a mile down, at the bottom of the gulf of mexico, they came across what appeared to be an underwater lake, over 20 metres long, with its own sandy shore.
around its edge, there even seemed to be a tide line, but this couldn't be, of course, this was underwater.
in fact, the lapping edge was created by a thick soup of salty brine far heavier than the surrounding sea water, and the sand was made up of hundreds of thousands of mussels.
once again, in the midst of a totally barren sea bed, an extraordinarily rich oasis of life totally independent of the sun's energy.
the source of energy this time was not sulphides but methane bubbling out of the sea bed, and once again, the mussels carried special bacteria capable of fixing the methane's energy.
just like the hot vents, a complete ecosystem had developed based on the bacteria.
there was an enormous variety of completely new species - shrimps, weird squat lobsters, and bright red polychaete worms.
these oases were called cold seeps and were surprisingly similar to the hot vents.
the geological processes in the sea floor that produce methane also tend to result in the release of hydrogen sulphides.
it was hardly surprising, then, when, not far from the brine pool, they found tubeworms... extensive fields of tubeworms that stretch for hundreds of metres.
this new species also uses bacteria to fix energy from sulphides, but it extracts them directly from the ground.
while hot vent tubeworms may be the fastest-growing invertebrates in the sea, these appear to be far slower - all the more reason to protect your gills from biting amphipods.
the energy sources exploited by the hot vent animals may suddenly fail, but here, life can enjoy a more stable geological future.
to discover within ten years two completely new ecosystems, both totally independent of the sun's energy, has been quite extraordinary.
so far, we have explored just one per cent of the deep ocean floor.
simply finding them is an immense challenge... but we are about to follow them as they search for their food in this little known part of the seas... the open ocean.
striped marlin - voracious predators that can grow to three metres long.
they hunt mainly in daylight, searching the tropical oceans from close to the surface down to depths of 100 metres or so.
normally, the fish they feed on are widely dispersed, but sometimes their prey gathers in dense shoals, like these sardines.
within a few short days, waters that once swarmed with food will have been cleaned out.
the hunters must move elsewhere and once again search the seemingly featureless open ocean.
a manta ray - immense, five metres across from the tip of one wing-like fin to the tip of the other.
it's travelling economy, wasting as little energy as possible as it glides through the waters of the tropics.
the remora fish that accompany it travel more economically still by hitching a lift.
their host is searching for food - plankton, the minute fish and invertebrates that float near the surface.
it needs lots of them and may cruise for days before it finds a good feeding ground.
dusk, at the edge of a pacific island, 3,000 miles from the nearest continent.
any surviving eggs will be so dispersed that they are not worth collecting.
but other perils await them as they join the clouds of eggs and larvae and tiny fish that drift through the surface waters of the open ocean.
in three years, they could be nearly two metres long and weigh 200 kilograms.
perhaps only one in a million will live as long as that.
as they hover facing into the wind, they pick out morsels from near the surface, including eggs.
only a tiny percentage of the developing eggs will survive long enough to hatch.
these newly emerged tuna are only three millimetres long, and although they can swim, they're still very vulnerable.
it will be many weeks before they can swim strongly enough to make any real headway in the ocean.
these shimmering comb jellies - sea gooseberries - trap their prey with sticky, net-like webs.
one ill-timed fin stroke could bring certain death to a hatchling fish.
there are many kinds of these comb jellies - all of them very effective hunters.
by dawn, most of the nocturnal feeders will have returned to the depths.
the boundaries between these masses of moving water form invisible barriers that can trap plankton and nutrients carried up from the depths.
so, parts of the ocean become rich with food for days or even weeks at a time.
the immense schools travel along the boundaries of the currents, seeking the spots where the plankton is thickest.
as the position of the current boundaries changes constantly, so does both the supply of plankton and the numbers of fish.
a small pod of pacific spotted dolphin, 20 miles from the coast of panama.
like all predators, they seek parts of the ocean where their food is thickest.
they cover as much as 100 miles in a day, and while they travel, they play.
they have detected the sound of schooling fish from hundreds of metres away, and start to track down the shoals using sonar, leaving their toys behind them.
the noise of the attack alerts another predator - a sailfish, one of the fastest fish in the ocean.
it has detected rapid vibrations in the water, and is searching for the cause.
sailfish rely on eyesight for their final approach, so they hunt mainly in daylight.
when sailfish become excited, they change colour, lighting up with blue stripes.
since mackerel eyes are especially sensitive to blue and ultraviolet, these colours confuse them, making them easier to catch.
far below, a blue shark returns from a squid-hunting trip in the cold darkness
as it ascends, it detects the smell of oils and proteins shed into the water by the panicked mackerel.
the trail leads both the shark and its attendant pilot fish towards an easy meal.
scraps and casualties float in the wake of the passing mackerel school.
throughout the ocean, predators and prey are locked in a deadly three-dimensional contest of hide and seek, played out over immense distances.
as a result, they can survive in much colder conditions than any other tuna, and they travel thousands of miles away from their spawning grounds in the tropics to hunt in cold seas where the food supply is richest.
ocean travellers come in many guises - and few are stranger than this... a crab that spends much of its life afloat.
and turtles, like these olive ridleys, migrate thousands of miles every year.
the ocean is full of such wanderers riding the currents and doing their best to avoid enemies while they search for food and a safe place to breed... which is exactly what these rays are doing - forming the two-mile high club,
they seem to be on every large predator's menu, so their whole life is spent on the run in the open ocean.
they don't scatter their eggs but lay them on pieces of flotsam like this palm frond.
any piece of floating debris can serve as a shelter under which baby fish can hide.
the only drawback is that predators like this wahoo check up on who's hanging about in the shadows.
the triggers, in fact, tend to claim all the prime residences.
out here, even discarded netting can provide valuable shelter, so, in a bizarre twist, a wrecked trawl net like this can end up as a sanctuary for fish until it finally sinks.
it's a giant kelp plant, ripped from rocks off the coast of california.
now, it's floating above thousands of metres of water, held up by its gas-filled floats.
rather surprisingly, it has the record as the heaviest bony fish in the sea.
sunfish spend much of their time at depth, where they feed on jellyfish, but it's cold and dark down there so from time to time, they seek a little rest and recuperation and warm up near the surface.
the sunfish turn their heads as a clear invitation to their personal hygienists.
the half-moons nip off and eat every parasite they can find.
if the half-moons don't do the job, there is another rather drastic treatment available here.
gulls rest on the floating kelp... and if the sunfish send the right signals, the gulls will investigate.
if they can't, they will be eaten or die and sink down into the abyss.
but the open ocean is not entirely devoid of permanent shelter.
a volcano is erupting from the sea floor and it's still growing.
it has formed an island some 70 miles from the coast of new zealand.
some juvenile reef fish have already arrived, carried here by a lucky current.
now they are growing up in the shelter of the weeds around the island's fringes.
more plankton and juvenile fish are being swept by currents straight towards the island, but now there's a welcoming committee.
schools of trevally and blue maomao are patrolling the surface water.
the pacific ocean, however, is peppered with over 23,000 islands, as well as countless other submerged mountains - sea mounts - whose summits do not break the surface.
juvenile fish for their first few months would do well to avoid such places.
these yellow-fin tuna, however, are now more than six months old and 40 centimetres long -
big enough to be able to eat fry, so sea mounts for them are promising feeding grounds where they may hunt for several months.
the water coming from the depths carries both nutrients and plankton to the surface.
numerous reef fish take up permanent residence, feeding where the currents are strongest and the plankton most dense.
giants come here from the open ocean - hammerhead sharks, and in great numbers.
during the day, they circle the sea mount looking for small fish at the reef edges... but not in order to eat them.
they do eat reef fish... but they prefer to hunt at night, when the reef fish are sleepy and easier to catch.
far better to rest by day and allow the cleaners to do their work.
trigger eggs are good food, and the planton feeders gather what they can before the current sweeps them away.
this community is here because of the nutrients and plankton the sea mount deflected into the surface waters.
these small fish can already feel the vibrations of the approaching predators.
swimming at speed, they have formed into a ball, and now they must wait for whatever comes.
the speed of this attack is so great that groups of anchovetta are splintered from the main fish ball.
before long, the currents will shift, and the ocean will become once more a blue tropical desert, plankton-free, and the hunters will have to move on.
it's on its way to its breeding grounds in the mediterranean.
pilot whales normally hunt in small family groups, but in mid-summer they head for traditional socialising grounds, where they will assemble in super-herds several hundred strong.
there is seldom enough prey in any one place to feed such numbers... so small groups leave the super-pod and set off on hunting expeditions.
this group will be away from the main herd for many hours.
half a million of these birds breed on the azores every year and scour the nearby ocean for food.
there's insufficient wind to support gliding flight, and since flapping is a waste of energy, they sit out the calm, clustered in rafts and riding the gentle swells.
the hunting dolphin prevent the mackerel from escaping downwards, and both predators gorge themselves.
soon, the diving birds outnumber the dolphin and even drive them away from their meal... but another squadron of predators arrives to replace the dolphin - adult yellow-fin tuna.
despite the arrival of the giant fish, the shearwater continue to press home their attack unfazed.
eventually, the tuna move on, leaving the shearwaters to battle among themselves.
as long as a predatory fish or a dolphin remains at the scene, the mackerel can't escape to safety, but when the little skipjack tuna start to move away, gradually the bait ball sinks into the depths towards safety.
the shearwaters follow it down to the very limit of their breath-holding ability, perhaps as deep as 15 metres.
for much of the year, it is dark and cripplingly cold.
yet, there is life here at both ends of the earth - the arctic and the antarctic.
it's february, and as the earth tilts on its axis, the sun's rays creep slowly northwards and the arctic emerges from its harsh winter.
the arctic is a frozen ocean surrounded by continents, and when the surface of the sea between the continents freezes from shore to shore, land predators walk out onto it to hunt.
it's early march, and the sea is still covered with ice...
but there are patches of open water - polynyas - that never freeze over.
here they have permanent access to the air, but they can also retreat to the sea to shelter, to hunt.
other sea mammals overwinter in polynyas as well - in this one, a young bowhead whale.
there is no food here, but a whale must breathe, and the only place it can do so for miles around is in this tiny hole.
it's living entirely on its reserves of fat, but now, they're dangerously low.
a whale would be a huge prize for any meat-eating hunter, and these belugas, trapped by the ice, are within reach of polar bears.
well aware of the danger, the belugas stay submerged as long as they can, but they can only hold their breath for about 20 minutes.
day by day, as the hole gets bigger, it becomes increasingly difficult for the bear to land a whale.
keeping its fur in good condition and free from salt is important for warmth, and the bear uses snow like blotting paper.
these belugas have been attacked by many bears over the last six months, and some have been caught.
it may have taken a long time and a lot of patience, but a catch when it's made brings abundant rewards of energy-rich blubber.
gulls rely on bear kills at this time of the year, and the colour of blood staining the ice attracts them from a long way away.
the remaining belugas still have a long wait before they're released from their prison and the threat of slaughter.
arctic foxes also rely on the polar bears to hunt on their behalf.
they're the jackals of the north, and scavenge from bear kills whenever they can.
their pups are born with white coats which camouflage them very effectively against the snow.
harp seals have a very short nursing period - a necessity on this unstable pack ice - but suckling is intensive.
ringed seals are comparatively small, so they can give birth to their pups in little caves or lairs under the snow.
here, a pup is out of sight and protected from bad weather.
in late march and into april, female bears emerge from winter dens with their new cubs.
the mother has not eaten for at least five months and she's hungry - very hungry.
if she doesn't succeed in catching a regular supply of seals, her milk will fail and her cub will die.
bears have an extraordinarily sensitive sense of smell and can detect seal pups hidden in the snow from two kilometres away.
as the days go by, the sun rises higher and remains above the horizon even at night.
the female bear continues to hunt until her cub is too tired and can't keep up.
only one in 20 hunts is successful, but this mother must find a seal pup soon if her cub is not to starve to death.
as spring turns into summer, the sun's heat begins to melt the sea ice.
now, the ocean is accessible and the arctic's summer visitors return.
migrating birds arrive from the south to nest and feed on the seafood now within their reach.
brunnich's guillemots are the northern equivalent of penguins, but they have retained the power of flight for they need to reach cliff ledges where their nests will be safe from predatory bears and foxes.
nonetheless, they are as at home in the water as in the air.
the cracks - or leads - form useful corridors of open water for air-breathing animals.
belugas, migrating to their feeding grounds, use these leads to penetrate the ice-covered seas and reach areas where their preferred food, arctic cod, has spent the winter.
the males regularly dive to about 500 metres to find fish.
the females and young, which have smaller lungs, only go to about 350.
in the summer, they store enough energy to last them through the following winter when food will be less abundant.
as the ice melts away, the polar bears are forced to head for land.
they are excellent swimmers, and can cover 100 miles of continuous open water if need be.
off east greenland, there is little ice left by august, so walruses haul out to rest on land.
at this time of year, they are moulting, getting rid of their old, scarred, parasite-ridden skin.
a bathe in cold water brings some relief from the itching... but even there, the odd scratch is irresistible.
once they find a clam, they suck its flesh from the shell with their powerful, muscular mouths.
walruses can feed for about five minutes at this depth before they have to return to the surface to breathe.
some are so young - born only a week or so ago - that they need help.
they swim on their mothers' backs so that they can breathe more easily.
a combination of warm fresh water and vigorous rubbing against the gravel does the trick.
they remain here for days or even weeks, so it's likely that socialising is also important to them.
thin sheets of ice form at the surface and pile up, layer upon layer, gradually creating an impenetrable barrier.
by late november, the arctic ocean is sealed once again by ice.
temperatures are still hovering at a numbing minus 50, and the returning sun has virtually no warmth.
very few animals can survive such extreme conditions... but emperor penguins can.
only by huddling together can they survive the appalling winter months.
they take it in turns to bear the brunt of the gales.
they can only live here at all because antarctica is surrounded by the great southern ocean and no land predators have been able to reach it, so, unlike arctic animals, they're not threatened by polar bears.
the sea is still frozen, but one seal, nonetheless, manages to stay here, even throughout the winter -
the continent of antarctica is so isolated and so high - almost 5,000 metres in places - that it's considerably colder than the arctic.
ice slides slowly down from its centre towards its rim in immense glaciers.
during winter, the continent effectively doubles in size as the sea freezes over.
ice forms around its shores and extends outwards for hundreds of miles around the entire land mass.
during these dark months, they feed by scraping algae from the ice.
remarkably, they also shrink in size and revert to their juvenile form to save energy.
as the temperature rises in spring, the ice begins to melt, and little air bubbles trapped within it are released.
microscopic algae grow around these bubbles and the krill now graze on them, gathering them up with their beating legs.
as the sun's rays grow stronger and penetrate deeper into the water, floating algae begin to flourish,
and krill leave the dwindling ice and gather in swarms as they harvest this new crop.
far to the north, beyond the blanket of sea ice, chinstrap penguins have been overwintering in the open ocean.
the occasional iceberg gives them the chance of a rest - if they can get onto it.
this is zavodovski island, which has the largest penguin colony in the world.
about two million chinstraps breed here, and they come to this island for a good reason.
but then again, living on an active volcano is not without its risks.
unlike the emperors, these penguins are able to lay their eggs on the bare ground.
little wonder so many choose to brave the mountainous waves in order to get here.
further south, near the continent, the blanket of sea ice is beginning to break up.
icebergs are gigantic fragments of ice that have broken away into the sea from the front of glaciers.
during the winter, they were frozen into the sea ice, but now they're set adrift once more.
they have travelled thousands of miles from their winter breeding grounds in the tropics to gather the food that becomes available here in summer.
in just four months, they accumulate enough fat to provide them with energy for the whole of the rest of the year.
krill swarms are very patchy, but once found, feeding is easy.
humpbacks engulf hundreds of thousands of them in a single gargantuan mouthful.
when the going is good, the whales feed continuously, each eating up to two tonnes of krill in 24 hours.
further south, near the continent, the sea ice is still sound.
these have been feeding out at sea, and are now ready to make their way back to the colony to feed their chicks.
instead of heading straight for the ice edge, the penguins hesitate some distance from it.
in winter, they may be as much as 100 miles from it, but as the summer progresses and the ice melts, the edge comes ever closer to the colony.
so by the time the chicks are fledged and ready to take their first swim, the water is close by.
this colony is in the lee of a headland, and that prevents the ice from being broken up by ocean currents.
the returning adults are so full of food that they can barely walk, but with no predator to threaten them now, they can take their time.
somehow, in this mêlée of 60,000 or so penguins, a parent has to find its chick.
it returns to the place where it last left its chick in the hope that it might still be close by... but chicks tend to wander, so the adult has to call to it.
the chick responds, and they slowly home in on one another.
the plaintive entreaties of the chick stimulates the adult to regurgitate a mouthful of fish.
with the return of one parent, the other is free to go to sea to feed for itself.
aware of the leopard seal's presence, the penguins press together at the ice edge unwilling to be the first to risk diving in.
occasionally, the seal comes out onto the ice and attempts to grab one...
but its most successful strategy by far is to lie in wait.
encouraged by the absence of the seal, the remaining penguins make a break for the open sea.
in time, their chicks will fledge, and when the antarctic autumn is near its end, these adults will walk across the newly-formed ice to endure yet another winter on the frozen sea.

in 1650, an enterprising cleric in ireland even tried to calculate the exact moment of creation.
by following the chronology of the bible archbishop ussher declared that the blessed event occurred on october 23, 4004 b.c. at precisely 9:00 a.m.-- only 6,000 years ago.
as for the origins of earthquakes and volcanoes they might well lie beneath our feet but hell seems an unlikely place.
and so as the 20th century dawns scientists have a good idea of what isn't true but few hard facts about what is.
its age and origins lie at the center of a great controversy.
most scientists of the time believed that the earth was formed from material torn from the sun.
then, as the earth cooled, its crust contracted buckling, cracking and collapsing.
geologists thought the parts that were left higher became the continents...
and the parts that were lower filled with water and became the oceans.
lord kelvin, the great british physicist, is determined to settle the matter of the earth's age once and for all by using this theory of a cooling planet.
the now-80-year-old physicist has been at the forefront of scientific discovery in europe for over 50 years.
at the age of 23 he became the youngest professor ever appointed at glasgow university and devised the absolute temperature scale that still bears his name.
the only possible answer to the dichotomy here between huge thicknesses of sediment and very, very small deposition rates was enormous quantities of time.
so when lord kelvin said definitively that the earth could only be 98 million years old what he was doing, in fact was ignoring hundreds of years of work by geologists and, in fact, even when they protested
t.c. chamberlin of the university of chicago a scientist of great dignity and authority rejects kelvin's most basic assumption that the earth was hot when it formed.
and he developed what he called the imal hypothesis which is that the earth had accreted from small bits of dust, rock and small planets in the solar system...
in the early history of the solar system that had come together collapsed under gravitational attraction to form a solid, cold earth.
the other issue that chamberlin raised was kelvin's assumption that the only source of heat in the earth was the original heat from when the earth first formed and maybe, but maybe not.
in london in 1904 at the royal institution of great britain a physicist is about to suggest that radioactive minerals exist throughout the earth's crust.
the physicist, ernest rutherford, plans to say that the heat from such radioactivity throws off all of kelvin's calculations.
now, as he was about to say this-- and that's why physicists love to tell this story-- he looked up and saw that lord kelvin was sitting in the back of the room and he said, "oh, god, what am i going to do?"
and he remembered at the last moment in's estimate and he remembered for the age of the earthkelv
and having seen kelvin's eyes snap open as he mentioned the word "kelvin"
he saw kelvin beam from ear to ear as he established that the earth was old, but that kelvin had been correct.
once you know this rate which is not hard to figure out physically by watchin real time you can go to a rock sample, break it open and measure the relative amounts of different kinds of lead and uranium in it
and determine from this how long it's been since the rock cooled.
that's 45 times older than lord kelvin's earth and 750,000 times older than the earth of archbishop ussher.
in turn-of-the-century berlin the mysteries of the earth begin to intrigue another scientist.
almost as a hobby, wegener develops a theory that the continents, once connected drifted apart over time.
but he's an experimental meteorologist, not a geologist so he spends the next two years in greenland gathering weather data.
for it to get to be science, you have to make the idea real.
there were particular kinds of fossils found only in certain parts of the world which wegener found very puzzling to explain how they got where they were.
but the only other place in the world where these animals had been found was in south africa.
and here is a specimen belonging to the very same species which was found in western south africa.
these two areas are noways 5,000 miles apart with the atlantic ocean between them.
so what could be the explanation as to how they came to be in those two places?
far above the arctic circle in the frozen islands of spitsbergen there are large deposits of coal but scientists believe that coal is formed in tropical climates.
wegener also discovers that great rock sheets-- lt of ancient glaciers-- wegener also discovers that great rock sheets--resu stretch for miles across tropical south africa.
putting all the clues together wegener suggests that the continents were once joined in a massive supercontinent called pangaea, or "all earth."
the continents must have moved throughout geological time drifting across the ocean floor.
injured early in the war before the worst of the casualties he continues to work out his theory while his wounds heal.
the result isthe origin of continents and oceans his argument for continental drift.
continents don't just get up and skate around like pats of hot butter on a skillet.
they were able to show that when there was a major earthquake the earth just rang like a bell.
it pulsated, and long waves traveled round the surface of the earth for hours and hours after a major earthquake.
now, existing physical theory said that anything that was strong enough or rigid enough to behave that way when there was an earthquake had to be far too strong to allow continents to move round at the surface.
wegener didn't know what made the continents move and frankly, i don't think he thought that was his problem.
he felt that that was something that other people would have to work on.
ner the new expedition is plagued frand his team.shes wege over a month behind schedule as they rush to establish three bases before winter.
on september 21, wegener sets out to resupply one of the bases.
for the next 30 years they struggle to prove wegener was right and to find the mechanism that could move continents only this time they turn their attention away from the ground below to a place far more mysterious.
this is where scientists seek the ultimate answer-- the deep ocean floor, as alien as another planet.
in the 1930s, geologists use world war i submarines to learn as much as they can about this new frontier.
one of the pioneers is harry hammond hess a young graduate student, fresh from princeton.
if you went into his office you'd see his desk literally piled that high with papers-- letters, minutes of this, minutes of that.
i was with him one occasion, and he was looking for something and he came across an unopened letter.
something went wrong and the submarine went way below its designed maximum depth...
and only drastic action by the captain actually saved their lives.
in the mass or density of sea-floor crust by measuring the force of gravity with a specially created device.
the delicate pendulums are slightly more attracted by denser rocks-- rocks exerting a greater gravitational pull.
it's so sensitive, it can only be operated in deep, still water far beneath the turbulent surface of the sea.
the measurements reveal something surprising-- large areas along the margins of continents where the sea floor seems much less dense than expected.
an officer in the naval reserve he travels to next day to report for active duty.
by 1943, he's the captain of a transport ship in the pacific.
he ended up the war taking in marines onto some of those horrific landings on the western pacific islands.
throughout the war, he ran his echo sounder and he came back with an enormous volume of soundings of the floor of the pacific.
core samples of the ocean floor are taken in the middle of the atlantic.
analysis of the rock reveals that the earth's crust gets progressively older on either side of an undersea mountain range called the mid-atlantic ridge.
hess suggests that the reason the ocean floor is young at mid-ocean ridges is that that's where new crust is being created.
and so hess argued that, in fact, not only was crust new crust in the oceans formed at the surface but it traveled along horizontally and then dipped down back into the interior of the earth again a process called subduction.
because, of course, he knows that wegener was severely criticized 30 years before for an idea that was not that different.
so by calling it geopoetry he's taking a kind of moderate stance:
hess's theory suggests that the sea floor moves due to circulating currents deep inside the earth.
the material beneath the crust is kept hot by the constant decay of radioactive elements causing convection currents that move the ocean floor along.
new crust is created at mid-ocean ridges and destroyed at deep ocean trenches, hess suggests-- a never-ending conveyor belt moving at a snail's pace through the ages.
his paper is greeted skeptically by the geologi but at cambridge university, in 1963 geophysicists fred vine and drummond matthews uncover new evidence that supports hess's theory-- evidence based on rock magnetism.
they, with a brilliant piece of lateral thinking looked at the ocean floor south of iceland-- but in other places as well-- and south of iceland you've got part of the mid-ocean ridge in the atlantic and there was a feature of the ridge
which had been known for a long time, but no one had understood and that was that there were curious magnetic stripes on the ocean floor, parallel to the ridge crest.
throughout geological history, here had been times when the earth's magnetic field had reversed meaning the north pole had become the south pole and the ad become the north pole.
since rocks are like little magnets, they would point in the direction of the prevailing magnetic field and then, as the crust split apart if there had been a magnetic reversal in the meanwhile this next set of rocks would point in the opposite direction.
and they were able to show that the width of these magnetic stripes was proportional to the known durations of these noepochs in geological history.
furthermore, the stripes were generally symmetrical on either side of the ocean ridge as harry hess's sea-floor spreading idea would have suggested.
in an effort to monitor the tests of other countries the united states and britain set up a worldwide network of seismometers which also detect earthquakes.
now geologists can map the locations of earthquakes with unprecedented acacy.
if we look over here in the pacific, you can see that these necklaces of oceanic islands and the deep ocean trenches that lie against them are associated with earthquakes, too.
you put this all together and what you get is plate tectonics the idea that the earth's crust can be broken up into large pieces, or plates that consist of both continents and also pieces of oceanic crust moving together over the face of the earth.
but that's enough to reshape the earth, build mountains trigger earthquakes and create volcanoes.
volcanoes erupt where the crust splits apart or where it subducts, and molten rock is forced up from below.
mountains, like the himalayas, form where plates carrying continents collide, crumpling up the land over millions of years.
and earthquakes occur along the boundaries of tectonic plates like the san andreas fault.
charles darwin's theory of evolution was still being fiercely debated decades after his death in 1882.
where wegener conceived a new theory about the evolution of the continents
"light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."
then, in 1871, he published the descent of man leaving no doubt that he thought that man, too, had descended from more primitive animals.
and was thought to have lived a few huthis skull was foundter, estimated to be 20,000 to 30,000 years old.
it was named for the cave in france where it was discovered:
but was any of these fossils the humanlike ancestor who first evolved from the apes on the road to modern man?
in 1909, some amateur scientists believe they have found the answer.
solicitor and part-time geologist charles dawson examines the fragments and decides they are parts of a human skull.
by the summer of 1912, dawson and a small team spend weekends digging for more fossils.
one day they find three pieces of a human skull and an apelike jawbone with two teeth that look human.
they share the evidence with arthur keith, a distinguished anatomist who is determined to trace the ancient origins of the british.
the crown knights arthur keith and two others for their work on piltdown and britain is proud to be seen as the birthplace of modern man.
but in 1924, the preeminence of the british is threatened by a surprise coming out of africa.
a lime worker named debruyn had been collecting baboon skulls for some years.
one day he notices a strange skull, and sends it off to anatomist and new dean of the medical school in johannesburg professor raymond dart.
dart was already something of a heretic in science and i think it appealed to something in his makeup that he was going to overturn some of the fixed ideas of the time.
one of the fixed ideas was that the discovery was oin the wrong continent.as
and here is the lovely little face of the child with its small canine.
we have a full house of deciduous teeth, baby teeth still busy erupting.
tthey felt that darto, ithad not proven the caseke.to nor that hecouldprove the case on a child.
"give us an adult, and we might listen to your case."
the british are adamant that piltdown, not taung, is the missing link.
although dart continues to believe he's right he admits, "it's no good being in front if you're going to be lonely."
on his first visit to dart broom kneels before the taung skull to pay homage.
widely recognized for his work classifying mammals in south africa broom likes to flaunt authority.
guided by dart's students, broom visits the sterkfontein lime deposits near his home.
within days, he finds fossil fragments and shows them off during a lecture.
britain's august natural history museum is all a dither over a scandal concerning the piltdown man.
one of the most famous fossil skulls in the world is declared to be in part a hoax.
there wasn't an opportunity to really study the specimen in depth until the early 1950s, when the piltdown was on display.
a fellow by the name of weiner had an opportunity to see it.
we don't know who actually perpetrated this or for what reason.
some people think it was to embarrass other english scientists into believing that this was a bona fide human ancestor.
the development of the great rift valley, for example that's been going on for tens of millions of years has formed a series of collection places...
lakes and basins and rivers for animals to fall into and become fossilized...
i happened to glance over my shoulder and spotted a piece of elbow and recognized it immediately as coming from a human ancestor.
this wasn't a baboon or an antelope or any other kind of animal.
the immediate question was, are we dealing with a child like dart was with the taung baby?
well, when you look at the teeth, you see that the permanent molars, the adult molars, have erupted.
we think lucy's skull might have looked something like this with a receding forehead and a prominent face.
and with a brain case no larger than a chimp's this was no smart ape.
as we look back and explore and discover fragments of our ancestry...
we see that it wasn't a direct line from dart's taung child or from lucy or whatever directly to us...
it's a link to our past, but even more importantly it's a link to the natural world.
and this is a tremendous blow to people who think of themselves as theinnacle of evolution, the chosen species...
that we are not necessarily here because of some preordained idea...
that we have gotten here through the same process as all other life.
20th-century paleoanthropologists got more than they bargained for but it was even harder for science to uncover the fundamental rules that govern the evolution of life itself.
how could ancient animals and plants like these fossilized ones evolve into the incredible variety of species we see today?
the first breakthrough occurred in 1900 when the work of an obscure augustinian monk named gregor mendel was rediscovered 35 years after his death.
mendel demonstrated that the physical characteristics of pea plants like this one were inherited according to certain rules.
eventually, he could even predict which offspring would be short or tall darker or lighter in color depending on the characteristics of previous generations.
but mendel had no idea how these traits were carried from one generation to another.
according to darwin species evolve through a process called natural selection.
when traits-- like the size of a fin-- are passed down from one generation to the next ariation, are passed down from oor mutation, may occur.xtm v when this mutation helps an organism adapt to its environment
and if the accumulated variations are large enough a whole new species can arise.
as the 20th century dawns, many scientists find it hard to accept the randomness of natural selection.
and no one understands how mutations actually work or how traits are passed down through the generations.
in 1904, a biologist named thomas hunt morgan begins a series of experiments he hopes will uncover evolution's secrets.
what he had trouble with, as did many of his contemporaries was the question of how you could get two species by selecting small, minute variations from one original parental population.
the experience of practical animal and plant breeders like dog breeders or horse breeders which he was familiar with from kentucky and so on suggested that though you could make many improvements in these organisms by selection no one had ever produced a new species that way.
his uncle was brigadier general john hunt morgan called the "thunderbolt of the confederacy"
who had commanded the daring band of guerrilla soldiers known as morgan's raiders.
as a boy, morgan felt a strong attraction to the countryside around lexington.
he saw the great swaths cut into the hills to prepare for the coming railroads and was fascinated by the exposed layers of sedimentary rock and the abundance of fossils.

hugo de vries, a dutch biologist discovers what appears to be a new species of plant growing right alongside its parent originally thought to be produced by a single large mutation.
when morgan read de vries's work he felt that might be the answer to the problem that he didn't think darwin had solved which is how you get from one species to a second very different species and so he became very interested in de vries's work.
for several years, he didn't get any fruit flies that looked substantially different from their parents and he was just about to give up the experiment.
in fact, he wrote to a colleague in europe and said, "i've just about had it with these fruit flies.
"it's been several years of work and i'm just going to abandon it and go on to something else."
and just shortly after that he discovered in his culture one white-eyed male fruit fly.
no one really knew how traits were passed on whether there were any patterns or laws.
it was clear that like begets like that offspring look somewhat like their parents but sometimes they look like their grandparents or sometimes their great-grandparents or sometimes like no one in the family.
but some short plants reappeared in the next generation in a ratio of about three tall to one short.
mendel concluded that among those three-quarters that were tall two contained both tall and short characteristics but the tall was masking the short.
although mendel laid out genetics very clearly in 1865 it really didn't catch on.
i think the paper was largely ignored for the next 35 years.
i think the reason is that although this abstract concept was an interesting one hard-headed biologists would say
"well, where are the genes, can you show them to me?"
omosomes" after the greek word for colorr since these structures absorbed dye readily and stood out clearly under the microscope.
they found that a particular configuration of chromosomes seems to have a role in determining sex and since the white eye only shows up in males
morgan did not go as far as to say that this factor for eye color was actually physically a part of the chromosome just that it always appeared with it in the offspring.
within a year, morgan had found several other characteristics that also seemed to be sex-linked and at that point he was willing to say that the factors determining these particular traits were actually physically part of the chromosome itself.
very few research projects at that time were done in groups and morgan's group of young undergraduates d then, later, and morgan's group of graduate studentstes an became the prototype of a whole new way of doing science.
compared to the european tradition where the professor in charge of a lab was very austere, very stand-offish would maybe come through the lab once a day and talk to a few people about what they were doing.
and they became convinced now that you were dealing with a material particle that was indeed passed on from generation to generation during the period of cell division.
this gave them a sense that now they were gaining an understanding and in such fashion that you could alter it in the laboratory and predict the outcomes.
morgan's work convinces him that evolutionary change does not require large-scale mutations.
he has observed so many small variations in drosophila over the years that he comes to believe, like darwin lander:
morgan gave rise, in his lab at columbia to a whole school of geneticists that laid down all of the fundamental rules of heredity that shaped the rest of the century including all the fundamental rules we apply today in human genetics.
but what the genetic material was how it was organized in the chromosome precisely how the chromosomes replicated and how you replicated the genetic material and what it actually does in the developmental process-- that was a black box.
maybe there's something new a new principle that we don't know.
is it like that michelangelo-- is it a spark that has to go from one finger to another or what is it that makes something alive?
by the 1940s, scientists know that genes contain dna short for deoxyribonucleic acid.
either proteins, which do most of the work of the cell or dna must contain the secret of heredity.
all smart, right-thinking people at that time knew that dna was an utterly boring structural molecule that couldn't possibly contain heredity.
proteins had to be the stuff that contained heredity because proteins were very variable and very interesting.
she defied her father, a london banker who thought education was unhealthy for women and had wanted her to be a social worker.
instead, franklin has become an expert x-ray crystallographer and her latest photograph of dna suggests a helical, or spiral shape.
as a boy, he starred onthe quiz kids a chicago radio show and by age 22 he'd earned his ph.d.
working with watson is british physicist francis crick of whom watson will write
crick had studied physics at university college, london but at 35 has yet to complete his doctorate.
as they recall 20 years later somehow it's a match made in heaven.
i cut some things out of cardboard and made the right shapes and then pasted things on which would indicate hydrogen atoms.
then i think i went off and played tennis and it wasn't until the following morning i came in and i started to put them together in pairs.
the base pairs connect to each other between two ladder-like chains of sugars on the outside all of it twisted like a double corkscrew.
watson and crick publish their findings innaturein may 1953 sending shock waves throughout the scientific world.
he asked, "what do you think of the paper by watson and crick?"
i said i'd never heard of these papers so he reached behind to a stack of reprints he had on a shelf behind his desk and he threw the whole heap of reprints-- because jim watson had sent him a bunch of reprints
of the two papers-- at me and his floor is covered with these neat little reprints and he said, "read it carefully.
the most important discovery in biology in ten years"-- later i wondered why he didn't make it 50 years--
she had died of cancer several years earlier at the age of 37.
with the discovery of the structure of dna comes an understanding of how chemical molecules can pass on the code of heredity.
normally, the copy is exact and parental characteristics are passed on.
but with billions of pairs to duplicate the occasional error is inevitable.
but then selected upon to all the variationse that change the simplest plant cell to a sequoia tree.
and that is the basis of all the diversity on the planet earth.
our dna is only one percent different from that of a chimpanzee.
in fact, we're closer to chimps than chimps are to apes.
it is now believed that humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancestor only five to eight million years ago.
through dna analysis we can even trace our ancestry back two billion years to bacteria and yeasts.
human dna and yeast dna are still so similar that human dna can repair yeast cells which can no longer divide.
when human dna is implanted in them the defective yeast cells begin dividing again.
that tells us better than any fossil record ever could that we must have a common evolutionary ancestor a common great-great-great- great-great-grandparent with a yeast cell that goes back all those billions of years.
a measly three billion letters of dna-- just the amount of information you could put on a single c.d. rom-- contains enough to specify all of the remarkable diversity within a human body and amongst humans.
that's a discovery that would have astounded biologists only a few decades earlier.
but there's still the question of how life started but tin the first place.estion the bible suggests that life sprang fully formed from the hands of god.
but in time, the meteors were less frequent the earth cooled, oceans formed and somehow, somewhere, life managed to gain a foothold.
probably around three-and-a-half to four billion years ago the first step from non-life to life was taken.
what miller's experiment showed us was at least some of the basic building blocks clearly could arise on their own by chance and it led to an exploration of what else could arise by chance and how could the things that were easiest to arise by chance
give rise to more things and more things and how could you get a system that could sort of bootstrap itself up going?
in that kind of atmosphere it's very easy to make organic molecules and it's easy to see how to get the ball rolling for the origin of life.
but the consensus opinion right now is that the early atmospheoxid e-rich not methane-rich, and in that kind of atmosphere it's much, much, much harder to make organics.
a miniature submarine, nicknamed alvin sets out to explore an area of the atlantic ocean where new, molten sea floor is pushing apart the earth's tectonic plates.
alvin's crew discovers large plumes of super-heated water streaming from the ocean floor at nearly 700 degrees fahrenheit.
ght out of harvesting the chemical energy from these vents.thou that the best source of energy at the beginning might be the sun but we now understand there are other sources of energy.
it's possible that the ear might have been the source y used by early life.
yet another theory suggests that the precursors of life didn't originate on earth at all.
this theory gains credibility when a meteorite is recovered in australia in the fall of 1969.
the meteorites that actually would be big enough to see if you could look at them, burn up in the atmosphere.
but if you're smaller than that, if you're microscopic in size you can enter the earth's atmosphere and just get gently slowed down and not get burned to a crisp.
could life have begun simply because a comet or meteoroid happened to approach the earth in just the right way at just the right time?
the evolution of life is propelled by random events so why not life's origins?
es of iridium the alvarez team finds in italy er 65-million-year-old come from rock strata 65 miridium layersld.on oth are found in other parts of the world like here in southern colorado.
this date happens to coincide with the time in earth's history when the dinosaurs went extinct after thriving for more than 150 million years.
it's a daring idea with enormous implications for our own origins.
if the dinosaurs had not gone extinct we probably would not be here.
there was no consensus on whether the craters were volcanic or actually derived from impact.
when the tide shifted in the late '50s and '60s toward the belief that, indeed, almost all of these features toward the belief that, indeed, almost all of these featureshe result of meteorite impact it brought a phenomenal new understanding
manned exploration of the moon in 1969 confirmed that moon craters were not the result of volcanoes-- which had been widely believed since the time of galileo-- but the result of frequent, often massive asteroid impacts.
and if the moon had been a target why not the earth?
it's hard to conceive just how powerful a blast it must have been and what devastating effects it had.
imagine the impact of a typical nuclear warhead multiplied a 100 million times.
as the evidence grows, more scientists are swayed but many remain skeptical.
if such an impact occurred, they ask, then where is the crater?
so what are we to make of the tremendous importance of random factors in evolution?
well, for one ths that things didn't have to work out the way they did that, for example, humans didn'thaveto evolve.
if that big meteorite 65 million years ago had missed, we might not be here at all.
that should give us a certain humility that our presence here is not a foregone conclusion.
i think that's the hardest thing to understand the hardest thing to appreciate about life about most of the forces shaping the origins of everything is that there are steady chemical and physical laws at work every day-- they come to work every morning
these chemical laws, these physical laws-- and yet the outcomes of them are shaped in really mysterious ways by chance.
i think it should give us a lot of pause about what actions we take in the future.
humans are now such an important force on this planet that we have the ability tobea random event to carry out extinctions, to greatly shape the earth and i think we are the first major random event that can actually think about the consequences of its actions.
in a universe so affected by chance we will always be surrounded by mystery.
no matter how great our discoveries there will always be something new...

a 16-year-old girl with the exact same rare blood type as steven's came into the er in liver failure.
now, i can't help but to think that if god meant for steven to die tonight at christmas then it must be so that this girl can live.
do you know how many parents i've had to talk to tonight?
well, if it's more than two dozen, then we're not the only ones giving out the things.
i need someone to be the threatening voice on the telephone.
for that and collecting the ransom, i'm willing to pay ten percent.
i don't need you to kidnap anyone because nobody's going to be kidnapped.
my stepdaughter, odette, is simply going to disappear for a few days.
look, i love my father, i really do, but i'm not going away to that school.
i figure 500 grand will get me through till my 18th birthday.
you make sure your husband finds this sunday morning in the paper.
it has a lock of odette's hair and a ransom note.
i buy a ticket using cash in the name anne hardaway.
when i get to miami, i check into the airport holiday inn.
they received a call from the girlfriend wondering where she was.
this morning, malroux received a ransom note and a lock of her hair tucked inside the sunday paper.
you still haven't told me what it is you called me down here for.
sooner or later the press is gonna get a hold of this.
so the district attorney doesn't want to jeopardize this girl's situation if we break this story too soon.
we're not just talking about kidnapping, we're talking about a murder case.
there's a body of the girl in the trunk of my car.
it needs to be taken care of or somebody's gonna find it.
maybe you should listen to the rest of your tape, sweetheart.
in all of this excitement, mr. barber i don't remember hearing whether you were in or out.
i bet you were, maybe, a spelling bee champion in school.
he owns that boat and he owns that big house out on cranleigh key.
not when i could spend the next 20 years of my life in prison.
cops get a hold of you, they're gonna question you till your ears bleed.
it has a lock of odette's hair and a ransom note.
that and a phone call should convince him that this is the real deal.
what would you do if some jerk-off put a dent in your door?
well, i would ignore it... because now, not only are we late, we have a witness.
yeah, well, the shock came when that $10,000 ended up in an account with my name on it.
so instead of a pulitzer prize, i end up serving two years of a four-year sentence.
i got a call early this morning from a banker acquaintance of mine.
seems this malroux was especially anxious to get his hands on $500,000 in small bills as soon as possible.
they received a call from the girlfriend wondering where she was.
and this morning, malroux received a ransom note and a lock of his daughter's hair tucked inside the sunday paper.
so you still haven't told me what it is you called me down here for.
sooner or later the press is gonna get a hold of this.
you guys act like you got the biggest kidnap case since the lindbergh baby.
no offense, but you might be off on a wild-goose chase.
all i can tell you, he was no pro, that's for sure.
whole thing's sloppy, half-assed, and from what i know already, not very well thought out.
told you they'd be all over this like shit on a stick.
well, it's time for you to earn your keep, my friend.
well, we sent the ransom note and the drop-off instructions to the fbi.
we're just gonna have to wait and see what they come up with.
i need someone to be the threatening voice on the telephone.
for making the call and for collecting the ransom, i'm willing to pay...
you know, i'm not surprised you're mixed up in all this, donnelly.
a snake can't change the fact that it crawls on its belly for a living.
i can't believe that you killed her and odette malroux just for the ransom money.
listen to you, barber, a guy so broke his fucking cash bounces.
that's got an "x" on the end of it, too, by the way.
i bet you were, maybe, a spelling bee champion in school.
i don't need you to kidnap anyone because nobody's going to be kidnapped.
my stepdaughter, odette, is simply going to disappear for a few days.

guys who want to play in the big leagues, but just don't have the talent.
my advice to you, harry, is don't go in the deep end if you can't swim.
for my article, when you said that my sentences ran on too long, did you mean that i put too many thoughts into one sentence, or that people just like short sentences?
because i read that once in a book that my high school english teacher gave me, who was no one to judge, because he was hitting on me the year i grew boobs.
i have worn some pretty silly clothes on the runway before.
yeah, and there's certainly no shame in promoting quality marine products.
wow, it reminds me of a really wild bicentennial costume party back in '70...something.
i went as the statue of liberty, and this guy in a jimmy carter mask said,
because i read that once in a book that my high school english teacher gave me, who was no one to judge, because he was hitting on me the year i grew boobs.
shannon, if you look in the back of my desk drawer,

[imitates jimmy carter] "i have lust in my heart for you,"
so we had a quickie in the coat room and split without ever knowing who the other one was.
on mexico's sea of cortez a marine biologist prepares to encounter an animal local fisherman fear more than sharks.
he is exploring a nether-world between fantasy and fact, pursuing a legendary monster of the deep that does, in fact, exits...
around the world, strange carcasses drift ashore, and fishermen catch huge creatures they have never seen before.
bit by bit, the secret life of this strange animal is becoming known.
we can study its anatomy and the behavior of its smaller relatives - the bizarre and wonderful creatures called cephalopods.
if they did live anywhere where a man lived, they would make mince-meat of him in no time.
fiction has always branded the giant squid a ferocious enemy of man, and some of its close relations can be terrifying indeed.
master of the deep ocean, the sperm whale knows what we cannot, but recently scientists have found a way to learn its secrets.
"whales were known to feed on squids, so it made sense to me try to use the sperm whale as our "hound dog" to lead us to the giant squid.
"we really don't know very much about what happens to whales once they leave the surface.
so we're working with a mystery that is hunting a mystery."
descend with us now into the dark and mysterious world of the sperm whale and its fearsome quarry, architeuthis, the giant squid.
their stories summoned up a fantastic variety of monsters that threatened them.
these ominous creatures were often blamed when disaster struck- as it frequently did.
smithsonian zoologist dr. clyde roper is engrossed in the study of cephalopods, such as octopuses, cuttlefish, and squid - and he welcomes the notoriety of the giant squid.
"people have to have their monsters, for some reason, and, uh, of course squid make a perfect monster because i really think that, um, especially for many young people today that the giant squid has become the new dinosaur."
it glares upon the world with the largest eyes in the animal kingdom.
clyde roper has a life-long passion for the giant squid, and is determined to see one alive in its natural habitat.
it all began when he was a teenager, working as a lobster fisherman in new hampshire.
"it doesn't take very long, when you're working on, on cephalopods...
a report, by a french warship, of an encounter with a giant squid fired the imagination of novelist jules verne.
his classic 20,000 leagues under the sea was published in 1870.
the terror of the giant squid may be fictional, but its mystery is very real.
once in a while, a giant squid carcass will be washed ashore.
often, these are juvenile squid - more bizarre and pathetic than threatening.
only an expert can tell its species, and that it could have grown to may times this size.
in modern times, more and more giant squid have been caught by fishermen as they work in deeper water.
they are almost always dead, or nearly so, when brought aboard.
from such fragmentary evidence, scientists conclude that giant squid live in deep water and that they are predators.
they are believed to live only a few years and to grow very rapidly - no one knows how large.
the biggest actually measured was almost 60 feet and weighed about a ton.
it is the world's largest and most powerful invertebrate, portrayed as a villain in many tales of the sea.
at any rate, i think the reputation is certainly not deserved at all.
"because they're so interesting, on their own account, that we don't need to make things up about them.
"squids are really exciting to me because they have wonderful adaptations for the, for their life in the sea, and these include things like:
like photophores or light organs, where they can flash and glow, uh, different colors;
they are fast animals; they're powerful; some like cat's claws to, to collect their prey; uh, some of really are fascinating animals."
squid are weird and wonderful - they, and their close relatives, have been called "aliens from inner space."
indeed, they ride the underwater currents with a serenity that seems almost supernatural.
squid are remarkably intelligent, and their primary nerve fibers are the largest in the animal kingdom - a hundred times the diameter of humans.
this allows cuttlefish and squid to transform their appearance - in less than a second.
these changes in appearance provide camouflage and a dramatic means of communication.
from seductive yearnings to aggressive warnings, all can be conveyed by resplendent displays of light and color.
the advanced nervous system gives them lightning reflexes and a deadly attack
below, is monterey canyon, the deepest submarine fissure along the continental united states and probably the most carefully observed deep water in the world.
scientists from the monterey bay aquarium research institute have been studying life in canyon on a regular basis for more than a decade.
any day, they could discover a living architeuthis and they have observed many remarkable squid.
they have also observed species of squid never before seen alive in their natural element.
moroteuthis, a slender and very large squid, which grows up to 15 feet;
like the giant squid, almost nothing is known about its behavior.
it's a remarkable contortionist, presenting to its enemies a ball of spikes.
the spikes are soft however and probably are used only for detection.
these tentacled couplings are anything but random - as males compete savagely for females.
many die naturally soon after mating... if they don't fall victim to the countless predators that pursue them.
for safety, roper will deploy a protective shelter where he can find refuge if he needs to.
this time of year, dosidicus still have a few feet to grow.
but already, some are six feet long and, at times, they feed like starving piranhas.
roper has never seen dosidicus this big before, but he's eager to have the experience.
"they have, a, a, an incredible reputation and, uh, many of the fishermen say they would rather fall into a uh, into the water with, uh, sharks in a feeding frenzy rather than in a, a feeding frenzy of humboldt squid
because they have been known to kill people when they fall into the water with them.
a hungry squid immediately begins to feed on the one that is hooked and defenseless.
dosidicus often prey on one another - one thing that could account for the rapid growth of those survive.
for roper, the chance to see them in the wild is a priceless opportunity.
like smaller squid, dosidicus shows vivid flashes of color when aroused or threatened.
roper wants a close-up look- not easy when the object of study can deploy two tentacles, eight arms lined with powerful suckers, and a razor sharp beak
and all this is concealed at times by clouds of dense ink, deployed by squid to confuse their enemies.
having a squid inside the shelter was not part of the plan.
roper tries to give it room to escape but gets a sharp nip from the departing squid anyway.
i was impressed at how incredibly powerful it is and how it swims...
clyde roper is not the first scientist to be caught up in the thrill of the hunt for big squid.
"and to see the funnel so expanded and, and moving out so fast, it was great."
in the nineteen sixties, in fishing villages throughout newfoundland, curious posters appeared.
the reward for a giant squid was the brainchild of the late frederick aldrich.
an expert on mollusks, dr. aldrich found himself in a region where giant squid are a proud part of local history.
and it was the first of many giant squid stranded or caught by newfoundland fishermen.
but examining the dead was not enough for frederick aldrich - he went after a live one.
"fred was really one of the first people to actually want to go out and try to find giant squid.
"i think fred liked the mythology and he liked the, the, the giantness, the bigness of it all.
in 1989, aldrich managed to mount a deep sea expedition to look for the giant squid.
it was an enterprise that has been compared to parachuting at night into an area of the united states picked at random - and hoping to see a grizzly bear.
the fact that i didn't see one does not effect my understanding of these animals whatsoever.
i never really held out much hope that i would see one, because 'oh, lord, the ocean is so big and my ship so small.
the brief expedition ended and aldrich died a few years later.
as deep water technology has improved, there have been more and more expeditions that could encounter a giant squid.
this is the biggest shark ever seen in the deep sea.
a pacific sleeper shark that turned up in japan's suruga bay.
well over 23 feet in length, it loomed so large the camera couldn't see it all.
after investigating the sub for five suspenseful minutes, the giant went way, leaving observing scientists excited - and a bit relieved.
once dismissed as mere sensationalism, the search for the giant squid continues to gain impressive proponents today.
one is dr. malcolm clarke, a specialist in sperm whales and oceanic squid.
many of, uh, the fish are very beautiful to look at, uh, and, uh, have wonderful silvery sides, they make pretty lights.
uh, that's the beauty - you need a few big-teethed, big stomached monsters to go along with it.
little was known about sperm whale biology despite centuries of killing them.
only dwindling populations put scientists aboard whaling boats to study the huge animals.
this proved that squid are the sperm whale's primary source of food.
and clarke amassed a huge collection of beaks - as many as eighteen thousand from a single whale.
clyde roper and malcolm clarke undertake the grim task of examining the carcasses and discover evidence of their common passion, the giant squid.
the skins of sperm whales are like weathered maps of ancient battles.
and, uh, if they're squeezed by the jaws, with these teeth, and there's a big, very powerful tongue right at back of the jaws to, to push it down the throat.
experts on both whale and squid, clarke and roper are uniquely to execute a new strategy in the search of arthieuthis.
"whales were known to feed on squid right from the very beginning, in the earliest days of, uh, of the whale hunting expeditions, and some of those were actually giant squid.
so it made sense to me to try to use the sperm whale as our 'hound dog' to, to lead us to, to the giant squid and that quest has brought on this current expedition."
they, and the other scientists on this expedition, are combining their search for the giant squid with research on the squid's most formidable enemy.
hydrophones can detect the sounds of sperm whales from several miles away
a distinct series of clicks is called a "coda" used for communication.
deciphering the sounds is a challenge for behavioral experts like cornell university's kurt fristrup.
by regulating its temperature, the whale may be able to control their buoyancy.
this would allow them to conserve energy on their long dives to hunt for squid.
they stay in close contact with their mothers, but their ability to dive is limited.
a mature female needs more than half a ton of food a day... and her food source - large oceanic squid- may be thousands of feet below.
the mother can go down more than half a mile a plunge deep into the unknown.
"we really don't know how sperm whales locate their prey, how they hunt, how they locate their prey and how they actually consume their prey.
somehow sperm whales "see" the world around them through a panorama of reflected sounds.
this certainly helps them navigate underwater, but can they detect and catch soft-bodied squids?
"when they swim through the water they disturb all the little organisms that are in the water, and these little organisms, because they're disturbed, set off a glowing or flashing.
"perhaps the whales then key on these strips of bioluminescence or streaks of bioluminescence and will be able to home in on the squid in that way.
"so, it's a little difficult to know exactly what it is and that's just one more thing we could see if we could get down into the sea with these giant whales."
to follow whales into the deep has long been a favorite theme of poets and a dream of engineers.
in early experiment, cameras were strapped to the backs of sea turtles before being risked in the wild.
"what motivates me is the, the possibility of discovering totally new phenomena of nature, seeing things we've never seem before."
with sperm whales, every step from deployment to retrieval has been fraught with difficulty.
"it's only through, you know, really carefully engineering and then some trial and error and experience the field that we've, that we've finally been able to succe in the way that we have."
after years of experimentation, crittercam is finally ready for serious field work in the azores.
the scientists are hopeful that the camera can survive a deep water dive, and be located and recovered afterwards.
"um, underwater it weights nothing, of course, so that, uh, it just floats right back after it's released from the animal.
floats back at about this orientation and, uh, will stick out of the water about this far."
at the moment, they appear to want a little time to themselves.
"we spend a lot of time on the water trying to get close to the whales, a lot of time on the water, and you have to do that because the whales are only at the surface of a few minutes every hour.
they'll be off you, uh, starboard bow, about a hundred and fifty meters.
uh, there's a whole gaggle of them, they're a social group.
three or four small ones and a couple of large ones.
"what we've found, for the most part, is that the whales tend to be quite curious about us.
if we're quiet in their environment, we've found that, as often as not, they tend to actually come over and investigate us.
the system is launch and we are riding in a pod of whales.
the clicking noises are made by the whales, and for the first time we can see exactly how their sounds relate to their behavior.
it's a revelation how close the whale are in their constant calling and with their bodies touching one another.
then, as dolphins join the array, it's like an undersea dance.
they sometimes ride the subsurface waves generated by the forward thrust of the whales these mountains of movement.
calves only gradually learn to dive as deep as their mothers.
the clicking sounds appear to be coming from more than one whale.
no one has conclusively identified these sounds with sperm whales before.
now the whales are over nine hundred feet deep and a strange thing happens.
they almost stop and one moves back as if inspecting crittercam... it's head and eye are just to the right off camera.
there is a long moment of consideration and then, apparently satisfied, the whales speed up again, going deeper still.
1200 feet at this depth the pressure is enormous over five hundred pounds per square inch.
until the 1960's, no conventional submarine could descend this deep without being crushed like an eggshell.
the, the camera is pointing right down, uh, right down into the skin of the, of the whale that's, uh, that's carrying the crittercam.
"there see, now i'm hearing that, hearing that buzz which is...
or have actually picked up a prey organism and they're zeroing-in on the prey and getting closer and closer to it.
"now they're starting to move again and, uh, have turned and turned back towards the surface because now we can see, uh, the lighted, uh, the background that's lighted.
"we were able, for the very, very first time, to enter into the deep-sea domain of the sperm whale.
by playing these instrument on the whale, um, we were able to get down to many hundreds of meters deep and how the animal actually behaves down in those depths."
but the sperm whales seem blissfully unaware of our efforts to enter and understand their world.
they have appointments to keep far below, which we can still see only our imagination.
one day, in the not too distance future, a whale may bring us a living portrait of architeuthis
and one of the last great challenges in natural science and photography will be met.
but for the moment, we must contemplate these great whales as we always have, fascinated by their physical powers, tantalized by the secrets they hold in their great brains.
two-thirds of our planet lies in the deep ocean, and that mysterious realm is their home.

ladies and gentlemen, the main contest this evening is between, in the blue corner weighing in at 88 and a half kilos, alan lefevre.
and his opponent this evening, in the red corner weighing in at 88 kilos, julot gaultier.
but i never quite managed to live up to the standard that he set.
you know, it always struck me as rather odd that a man can be glorified for pillage and murder.
of course, it doesn't really become a problem until i lose.
then i have to do sordid things like write bad checks.
they stripped me of my command in front of my men.
some of them had been with me for nearly 15 years.
we are being sent to fort bernelle, the last french stronghold between us and abd-el krim.
this self-proclaimed arab leader has taken his forces deep into french territory destroying 9 other outposts.
and so did 19 other brave legionnaires who died for us today.
so,when i give an order it's not because i like the sound of my own voice, i do it for the benefit of the whole company, not just the individual.
this is what awaits them if they continue invading our country.

then bring it back here as fast as you can so i can drink it in peace.
walk you to your doorstep, promise to call, then run like hell for a cab, but what i'd like to do is skip directly to the run like hell for a cab, because if you think i'm hard to take now,
you don't wanna be around me for even five minutes in a karaoke bar.
look, you don't have the market cornered on crazy, you know.
i mean, i've-- i've had two failed marriages, there's a long list of women who still refuse to talk to me, and the longest relationship i have is with the woman who runs the dry cleaning on the corner.
i should have my head examined for going out with a great-looking guy who treats me well.
besides, i've gone out with enough type a guys to know what the a stands for.
i want you to go down to goodwill and buy some clean clothes.
then i want you to go to the y and take a shower.
and when you're all finished and you think that you are really clean,
i want you to go back in and take another shower.
okay, people, you have to say goodbye to a blind man when you leave the room.
otherwise, it's just plain inconsiderate, because if you leave a brother here, talking to himself for hours-- jake.
then take the splash of vermouth out of the doubled pork chops, put it in the glass, turning it into a free-range vodka martini.
then bring it back here as fast as you can so i can drink it in peace.
walk you to your doorstep, promise to call, then run like hell for a cab, but what i'd like to do is skip directly to the run like hell for a cab, because if you think i'm hard to take now,

that is why each year we choose our new junior analysts with tremendous care.
the smythe-bates man or woman has a high g.p.a., a record of athletic achievement and ties of tradition to our firm through some... of the more prominent fraternal organizations on campus.
i sincerely wish that we had a place for all of you, but that's not the case.
five of you will be chosen, and out of the five finalists, the student who most closely resembles the ideal employee... will be chosen for the position of junior analyst at smythe-bates.
now, what that proves is what the average joe on the street already knows.
the more money they have, the more money they can spend.
can you please talk to the coach and try and get me some time on the ice?
i need a sport, or i'm not gonna get the smythe-bates job.
it's supposed to be twice as fast and twice as cheap.
and with the debt that shamada's carrying from that last buyout,
- how did you fail to qualify for the final competition?
you know, i've been workin' four jobs just to pay my tuition, and, uh, i don't know, i just blew my final exam.
it's just that this drug, man, it's the best thing that ever happened to me.
i mean, i feel like for the first time in my life, i'm on top of the world.
i really don't give a damn about them fraternities, you know?
i'm just doin' it 'cause it's a means to an end.
i'm just tryin' to get this job and help my family out.
see, i've always been like a father... to my little sister and my brothers.
this is stratford university radio coming to you live... from baxter rink, where the panthers are set... to open their season against brownstone u.
that's right, chet, and the only questions this year are... how badly will they stink, how consistently will they stink... and will they ever not stink?
and with just two minutes left in the game, stratford still has a one-point lead.
and rookie darryl witherspoon is just this close to a shutout.
it's gonna take a lot to convince that board of mine... to pick you over the other five candidates.
you know, playing hockey and becoming a kappa, that helps, but now they have such high expectations.
the board's gonna make its decision five days after the final competition.
bob bellweather wants to spend some quality time with each of the candidates.
[tim] "taste it once, and the spell of its enchantment will never let you be."
"taste it once, and the spell of its enchantment will never let you be."
"love is a bright star glowing in the far southern skies."
"look too hard, and its burning flame will always hurt your eyes."
when i get this job, gonna be a whole lot more where that came from.
you know, janice, whenever i get angry about their daddy leaving,
[voice echoing] of your brain has compensated... by allowing you the use of only four of your given senses at any given time, with the missing one constantly switching.
so, if you can see, smell, taste and hear, you can't feel anything.
your final test before you enter the kappa brotherhood is a tricky one.
remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
chet, the panthers haven't beaten astoria in 30 years, but with witherspoon in net this charged-up stratford crowd... has found a reason to believe.
[chet] and astoria takes the face-off and races down the ice... towards star goalie witherspoon.
now, in structuring a portfolio for your client, what are the three most important rules?
well, first thing i'd do is talk to my client about his long-term goals.
the effect of taxes defined by the laffer curve cannot be considered as valid...
the leverage gained by buying on the market will multiply your returns...
if the poison pill doesn't work, you got a proxy war that's gonna depress your price.
[proctor] at this point, we would excuse three of our contestants.
mr. auseppe, why would the federal reserve have resorted to this?
i believe that would be in order to maintain a constant rate of growth... while avoiding incurring any excess inflation.
well, i think start-up industries in emerging markets... are the kind of low-risk, high-gain strategy i would pursue.
ah, so the rich get richer off the sweat of the poor, right, scott?
i was just willing to do anything to become a smythe-bates man, even the wrong thing.
i want you to know i do deserve the job, even though i didn't earn it honestly.
you are a smythe-bates man too, so you're going to have a second chance.
at the point of graduation, you'll be given a job in the mail room.
why don't you let me move you over to the east side, to a deluxe apartment, hmm?

the smythe-bates man or woman has a high g.p.a., a record of athletic achievement and ties of tradition to our firm through some... of the more prominent fraternal organizations on campus.
because we regard the junior analyst position not as a stopping point, but as a stepping stone to greatness.
now, class, i would like for you to extend a very warm welcome to my old friend,
i sincerely wish that we had a place for all of you, but that's not the case.
five of you will be chosen, and out of the five finalists, the student who most closely resembles the ideal employee... will be chosen for the position of junior analyst at smythe-bates.
their employees spent 50 percent more than they did the previous year.
now, what that proves is what the average joe on the street already knows.
so what happens to your average workin' joe when wicks morton goes down?
i don't think they're gonna end up in the checkout line.
this drug has not been shown to be toxic in rats... and should be similarly nontoxic in human beings, theoretically.
potential side effects may include nausea, insomnia, headaches, flaking of the scalp, intestinal cramping, constipation, rectal burning, rectal itching, rectal swelling... and dizziness.
get to know each other a little better... over a glass of something with alcohol in it, right?
if you don't drink, we could have a yoo hoo or somethin'.
you see what you want and you go after it, and i like that.
but we're not here for you to put on your resume so you can get the smythe-bates job.
actually, i read in the papers, there's this japanese firm coming out with this new chip.
it's supposed to be twice as fast and twice as cheap.
- well, uh, darryl's case... has already been decided, i'm sorry to say.
scott, uh, we sit on the board of this fraternity, and we endow it as well.
i'm just doin' it 'cause it's a means to an end.
i'm just tryin' to get this job and help my family out.
see, i've always been like a father... to my little sister and my brothers.
well, my father's pushing me to take pre-law classes, but what i really love is my 20th century poets course.
i don't want you to think that i'm just tryin' to get into your panties.
i mean, i'm pretty sure they're really nice panties, but i just wanna take it a little slow.
where'd this kid come from, and who the hell is he?
ten seconds now left in the game, and here comes trouble.
it's gonna take a lot to convince that board of mine... to pick you over the other five candidates.

- goods and services... are exempt from the discounting which classical theory demands.
the effect of taxes defined by the laffer curve cannot be considered as valid...
the leverage gained by buying on the market will multiply your returns...
for our primary analysis, equity can't be considered in the same tier as secured debt.
well, i think start-up industries in emerging markets... are the kind of low-risk, high-gain strategy i would pursue.
ah, so the rich get richer off the sweat of the poor, right, scott?
at the point of graduation, you'll be given a job in the mail room.
doesn't sound like much, but if you work hard, in a year you'll make a fine junior analyst.
touch that champagne bottle one more time, i'm gonna use your little ass as a cork!

so, when do you start your new job on wall street?
smythe-bates has long enjoyed a reputation... as one of the world's premier investment firms.
that is why each year we choose our new junior analysts with tremendous care.
the smythe-bates man or woman has a high g.p.a., a record of athletic achievement and ties of tradition to our firm through some... of the more prominent fraternal organizations on campus.
because we regard the junior analyst position not as a stopping point, but as a stepping stone to greatness.
- i logged quite a bit of nap time in that back row.
i sincerely wish that we had a place for all of you, but that's not the case.
all right, class, in the case study that we were examining last week...
now, the markets are up, but consumer spending... and corporate profit margins are down.
now, what that proves is what the average joe on the street already knows.
the more money they have, the more money they can spend.
can you please talk to the coach and try and get me some time on the ice?
i need a sport, or i'm not gonna get the smythe-bates job.
it's supposed to be twice as fast and twice as cheap.

what do you think of this possible irving genetic wilcom merger, scott?
well, uh, irving stock just hit a five-year high, so i'd say the outlook's pretty rosy.
sir, i realize that i'm last on your list, but i want you to know i would do absolutely anything to get this junior analyst position.
it's gonna take a lot to convince that board of mine... to pick you over the other five candidates.

doctor, i'm pretty sure what you're saying... would make a whole lot more sense if i could hear you!
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to madison square garden, the home of your new york knicks.
your final test before you enter the kappa brotherhood is a tricky one.
remember, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
tonight, your panthers face off against the mighty team... from astoria university for a chance to lead the division... in something other than tuition.
chet, the panthers haven't beaten astoria in 30 years, but with witherspoon in net this charged-up stratford crowd... has found a reason to believe.
now, in structuring a portfolio for your client, what are the three most important rules?

mr. auseppe, why would the federal reserve have resorted to this?
i believe that would be in order to maintain a constant rate of growth... while avoiding incurring any excess inflation.
mr. thorpe, if you were to be given control... of the smythe-bates venture capital fund, where would you take it over the next five years?
well, i think start-up industries in emerging markets... are the kind of low-risk, high-gain strategy i would pursue.
ah, so the rich get richer off the sweat of the poor, right, scott?
maybe you should pay a visit... to one of those emerging markets you're so eager to exploit.
this last question is not a simple one, so i suggest that you choose your answers very carefully.
now, looking at this chart, what should the federal reserve choose to do?
i was just willing to do anything to become a smythe-bates man, even the wrong thing.
i want you to know i do deserve the job, even though i didn't earn it honestly.
you are a smythe-bates man too, so you're going to have a second chance.

at least she didn't tell you that the sight of you gives... her dry heaves or that you're a self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish..
- look, obviously she has opinions about me that she hasn't been honest about.
- i was, um, cleaning out my closet this morning and...
i found the costume that you wore in the movie, and... um, and i was just thinking about how good you looked in it...
and i was just thinking... you know i hope joey was happy with her performance in the movie.
so i guess i'm asking, i'm surprised we haven't discussed this, what did you think of my movie.
um, i was wondering, uh, the thing is mrs. ryan, i really could use some advice.

you and i know everything about each other and i really need your advice.
correct me if i'm wrong, dawson, but you don't know the answer to any of those questions.
in fact, i bet you don't even know when i was born!
and i just need to, we gotta open this thing up and explore some new possibilities.

- dawson, i'm not going to let you off the hook for what you did.
i mean, it was wrong of you to go inside of my head and take my thoughts and my feelings without my consent.
- ...and because becoming sexually active is a very serious business,
i think that it's time you and i talked about it.
my condition prevents me from engaging in any undue physical exertion.
please excuse abigal morgan from gym this semester... as she suffers from pelvic reposis signed dr. james fife, m.d.
- all i can say is thank god it was you.
i mean, can you imagine if... it was just some unexpecting date i just brought home?
at least she didn't tell you that the sight of you gives... her dry heaves or that you're a self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish..
- look, obviously she has opinions about me that she hasn't been honest about.
- i was, um, cleaning out my closet this morning and...
i found the costume that you wore in the movie, and... um, and i was just thinking about how good you looked in it...
and i was just thinking...you know i hope joey was happy with her performance in the movie.
so i guess i'm asking, i'm surprised we haven't discussed this, what did you think of my movie.
um, i was wondering, uh, the thing is mrs. ryan, i really could use some advice.
- my advice is to avoid the big d at all costs, man.
so you take the anaquated knowledge of infidelity and monogamous out of marriage and

- we partied one weekend in atlantic city before he had to ship out...crazy.
- i can't believe you have eyes for dawson leery, i mean you have lived, sister.
- speaking of partying... since you're not hanging out with forrest gump and company anymore...
i was thinking we could do some serious partying of our own.
- look, i'm about 2 seconds away from blowing it with joey.
you and i know everything about each other and i really need your advice.
correct me if i'm wrong, dawson, but you don't know the answer to any of those questions.
in fact, i bet you don't even know when i was born!
and i just need to, we gotta open this thing up and explore some new possibilities.

- my father's had that book in a drawer since i was born.
- all i can say is thank god it was you.
- c'mon joey we've spent most of our waking, and sleeping for that matter, moments together.
yes, i think it's fairly safe to say that i know everything there is to know about you.
at least she didn't tell you that the sight of you gives... her dry heaves or that you're a self-centered, self-absorbed, selfish..

i've cleaned out the entire marital aid section at the pleasure palace... and my victoria secret credit card..is maxed.
- i was thinking something more along the lines of renewing your wedding vows.
it's just that telling a girl that i'm dying so that she'll go out with me, that's just not funny.
- why you would be interested in someone who's so mentally deficient that she would... actually believe that she would actually believe there's such a thing as a heart stripe.
oh, god i would throw my mother off a bridge to go out with somebody like this.
- we partied one weekend in atlantic city before he had to ship out...crazy.
- i can't believe you have eyes for dawson leery, i mean you have lived, sister.
- speaking of partying...since you're not hanging out with forrest gump and company anymore...
i was thinking we could do some serious partying of our own.
- you mean like steal a pack of cigarrettes from 7-11 and hide behind the bleachers and smoke em?
you know why i ride the fine line between insecurity and self-confidence?
correct me if i'm wrong, dawson, but you don't know the answer to any of those questions.
it has nothing to do with the driver's test and it certainly has nothing to do with roadtripping to maine.
i came to this dark realization that everyone in capeside has either written me off... demanding me unworthy of their time or their concerns and... the conclusion that i came to today, on my 16th birthday... is that my best friend in the world looks at me the very same way.
i thought i could be pacey witter, the guy who throws a good party but no, i'm still pacey witter... the guy who's failing biology, but now i'm a year older.
- you know, maybe you're just pacey witter the guy who's still trying to figure it out.
- listen pacey, i've been a really lousy friend lately and there is no excuse... for forgetting your birthday but it's not because i've written you off, alright?
this joey thing has been so incredibly confusing and complicated and..
a lost soul who has finished his battle somewhere on this planet.
a pitiful soul who could not find his way to the lofty realm where the great spirit awaits us all.
all the more reason for us to keep our hands off the planet.
in truth vicious, are you not the one that is worrying?
it appears you don't have the authority to make your own decisions in this matter.
no matter who they are, those who go against the will of the van ... will be severely punished.

there's a time and a place and a way of doing things.
frankly, i don't care for the attitude of some of these rangers.
he's led such a clean lifestyle he doesn't have the stamina to deal with life.
now, i, on the other hand, will be out in a minute to show you how the game is supposed to be played.
apparently, it's something they only do certain times of the year as part of their religious ceremonies.
you may not believe this but it was the most beautiful sound i had ever heard.
i couldn't make out the words, but i knew that it was full of sadness and hope and wonder and a terrible sense of loss.
i looked at londo and, this is the amazing part there was a tear running down his face.
john's wish was to see his dear friends one more time the way they are.
and for david to remember his father the way he was, not...
when he leaves us i will need someone to take his place as head of the rangers.
they would prefer a human in this role... to maintain the balance we've created.
all the air locks were sealed, but there was no trace of him inside.
some of the minbari believe he'll come back someday but i never saw him again in my lifetime.
it taught us that we have to create the future or others will do it for us.
it showed us that we have to care for one another because if we don't, who will?
and that true strength sometimes comes from the most unlikely places.
mostly, though, i think it gave us hope that there can always be new beginnings.

the americans have intercepted a series of messages from istanbul to an island in the south pacific.
you're going to have to land and meet me at a rendezvous point on foot.
i am sending you all the information you'll need to avoid the sensors.
we have to penetrate the sensor grid and avoid the dominion patrols.
find a man in an alien jungle, then walk him out without getting caught.
you know, you go through a lot of ups and downs in my business.

nikolai was afraid but i would lay in my tent for hours, just listening.
i remember being seized by the urge to just rip off my clothes and run into the night and live in the forest and become something wild.
i have heard that story since i was a boy but i never understood it, i mean really understood it, until i was standing in the jungle with my heart pounding in my chest, and i found that even i could not stand against my own heart.
i had to go back and it did not matter what the consequences were.
they did emphasize several times that he is very important to them and that we should send someone to the badlands as soon as possible.
so, with the defiant gone and most of the runabouts off on exercises with the ninth fleet...
first, i have something that you want, badly-- information on the founders.
i know how many of them there are in the alpha quadrant where they are, and what they're doing.
it'll be at least two days before they know i'm missing.
all you have to do is get me off the planet.
now, there are transporter scramblers protecting soukara so you can't beam me aboard your ship.
you're going to have to land and meet me at a rendezvous point on foot.
there's the base... the rendezvous point... and the dominion sensor perimeter.
there's a valley about 20 kilometers north of the rendezvous point.

you heard the story of the first two klingon hearts and how nothing could stand against them and how they even destroyed the gods that had created them.
i have heard that story since i was a boy but i never understood it- i mean really understood it- until i was standing in the jungle with my heart pounding in my chest and i found that even i could not stand against my own heart.

well, i'm sure you've got some celebrating to do, so off you go.
i learned when you were kids to stay out of it whenever you started fighting.
i'd just wait till the whole thing ended, usually in tears, and then i'd take you both out for ice cream.
when they brought him back the next morning, we couldn't fight because of his headaches.
i suppose that was part of his plan to keep harmony in the family.
well, the other gift was left in frasier's squash bag, which is exactly like mine.
and i guess today the waitress must've mistaken frasier for me.
niles, i think this whole pursuit of you has been brought on by a panicked reaction to schenkman dumping her.
you know, give her a few days, she'll probably realise that herself.
oh, daphne, thanks again for taking dad over to niles' for me.
i mean, i would do it myself, but since you are going out...
i guess i was feeling insecure, a little nervous about getting close to you.
i don't blame you for being angry, and i wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave.
okay, as you can see we've got a wide selection from the animal kingdom.
we have our medium sized animals and... we have our cuter ones.
they're going to be showing the original invasion of the body snatchers.
hey, i'll tape it for you if you show me how to program this vcr.
excuse me, but am i the only one here who can see this hork-bajir footprint?
will somebody fill it in before it makes the front page?
and when we do, i'm gonna take that yeerk inside of his head and squash it like a bug.
at least now we know that the yeerks need some sort of a booster treatment every three days.
yeah, you'd think that elfangor would've given us an instruction manual, or somethin'
you mean before or after he went toe to toe with visser three?
remember, when you acquire it's dna, it'll go into a trance.
how about that moment before the trance when it rips his arm off?
yeah, i'd give anything to be just a regular kid again.
but, no, now i get to change my shape more often than i change my underwear.
yes, i have taken one of your andalite bodies as my host.
your andalite morphing technology has been so very useful to me.

that means that it's, like, 75% chance of no baby at all?
i was thinking, what are the odds if you stuff 200 of them in there?
we're kind of using all the money we have to do it this one time.

i remember the last time they met was during the cuban missile crisis.
you've watched him training, david, and we can now show you at home some of the footage of that training.

it is man's fate... that he not only rejoices in what he sees... but is displeased by his faults... physical and mental.
man's urge to civilize compels him to strive for the improvement... not only of his material conditions... but of himself, as well.

the idea that life, society, the family can be cultivated like a garden in which the weeds must be distinguished from the useful plants... is something that galton wants to develop into a science.
"since the achievements of darwin... we perceive the world in a new light", the german art journal pan proclaims.
"and only a modern aesthetic based on his theory... can accurately reflect the aspirations of our times..'
to reject clothing... is to be liberated from the decay of modern society... and demonstrates racial consciousness.
"for the human body to achieve perfection", says ungewitter... to create out of homo sapiens, the ideal living work of art... we must enlist the services of conscious human breeding."
"if man could be induced to fall in love intelligently... if human matings could be placed on the same levels as horse breeding... the most progressive revolution in history can be achieved".
says charles davenport... the father of the eugenics movement in the united states.
the movement gains momentum... through an aggressive campaign against blacks and immigrants.
nowhere else does the practice of eugenics score such early successes.
the institute places particular emphasis... on anthropological measurements and racial attributes.
despite this, race hygiene would be integrated... into swedish social policy.
a "passion for social justice"... preserving the physical and mental health of the swedish stock is the rallying cry.
race hygiene is seen as central... to the wellbeing of modern society.
in sweden, race hygiene theories merge with... the vision of the welfare state.
social engineers are responsible for organizing society for the greater good.
its task is also to safeguard the future taking practical measures to save the human race from racial mixing, degeneration and doom.
when germany's first institute of race biology opens in 1927, in berlin, anthropology is accorded a leading position.
another american, raymond pearl... denies that there is any evidence supporting eugenics.
he argues that 90% of all highly gifted individuals... have parents with average, or even below-average abilities.
kammarer dedicates his life... to establishing the validity of the lamarckist theory.
"the trends of the parents are formed by its experiences...' and affects the characteristics of its descendants."
his experiments set out to prove... that acquired characteristics are inheritable.
" these characteristics, acquired through the environment... 'are passed on to the next generation."
in the film, kammerer, in the guise of professor zange... is rescued by a soviet government minister.
"we have to find zange and bring him to the soviet union."
the film is an attempt to halt the advance of mendelism... considered counter-revolutionary by the kremlin.
"mendelism makes us slaves of the past... while lamarckism makes us captains of the future".
"but the dream of a perfect order is also a religious idea... for which people will go to their deaths.
eugenics, creating through the efforts of many generations... a higher human being, is worth the sacrifice.
eugenics is the religion of the future... and it awaits its prophets."
notions of degeneration and decay... play a subordinate role in russia.
and while artists of the avant garde craft symbolic constructions of society in the future, the pioneers of science will supply that society with a new, more efficient human being.
"if our civilization's best elements are to survive... human husbandry... based on the principles of scientific agriculture... is necessary", the american eugenics society proclaims.
herrman joseph muller... one of the foremost geneticists of the day... is also a fervent advocate of eugenics.
muller, a communist... has a different understanding of the goal of eugenics.
as an outsider, he witnesses the development and decay of the eugenics movement.
a movement he disdains... not only because of its reactionary and racist tendencies... but also its banality and popularism.
muller doubts that the goals of capitalism... can be reconciled with those of eugenics.
"proportionate to the importance of the eugenics revolution... would be its danger if misused", says muller.
as a member of the committee, aiding intellectuals and artists... surviving the war... he is able to convince prospective participants.
along with the committee's food packet... dried fish, bread and oil... the participant receives a questionnaire.
filiptchenko hopes to obtain data... faced by the practical tasks of eugenics.
many of russia's most prominent scientists and artists... participate in the study:
the eugenics movement in the soviet union... focuses on the brain and intellectual capacity.
at the institute for brain research in moscow, brains of the intellectual elite are studied.
they find their research subjects among the living... as well as the dead.
the ancestry of russian geniuses is charted... and family trees drawn up.
in germany, the body, its condition and potential... its ugliness and beauty... eloquently mirrors the conflicts of modern society.
the allegedly degenerate human being... is contrasted with the image of classical beauty.
it is in madhouses and asylums the advocates of race hygiene... were to find frightful evidence in their struggle against decay and ugliness.
the repugnance and loathing... conjured up by the imperfections of the human body... become arguments for methods of race hygiene.
"that is in all extreme movements... where psychopaths can play a destructive role...
hitler is the first politician with real influence... to have understood the central significance of race hygiene... and is willing to fight for it."
the mendelists protest that if the lamarckists were right... how could the oppressed lower class ever assert itself... against the aristocracy... which, over the centuries, has accumulated desirable traits?
the adherents of lamarckism reply that hard work has made the lower classes strong... while wealth has made the aristocracy lethargic and degenerate.
the cadence of the life and the rhythm of work will be harmonized.
to aid in this task, to promote useful characteristics... geneticist alexandre serebrovki... wants to employ eugenics.
he is convinced that his findings in the area of poetry... and cattle breeding... can be applied to people.
a five year plan can be completed in two and a half years...
serebrovski claims... describing a gigantic project for the improvement of man.
"with artificial insemination... a gifted father can produce ten thousand children", says serebrovski.
because love is a private matter... while procreation is the responsibility of society.
progress requires healthy and gifted children... and society has the right to make demands on the quality of the product."
the leader of the doctors of the reich of germany, leonardo conti:
bad nativity, negative selection and miscegenation... are the main causes of ruin to the people.
a home for unwed mothers was just located here... founded by the lebensborn society.
here, unmarried women considered racially pure... could give birth in solitude far from the disapproving eyes of society.
positive eugenics requires the subordination of sexuality to the quality of offspring... and the separation of reproduction and love.
wild rumours and fantasies... about human breeding farms by the ss flourished.
thus, creating the new german man... uncovered a paradox which challenged burgeoise morality.
it was also in direct conflict... with one of the pillars of nazi ideology:
the vision of positive race hygiene was relegated to the arts
the image of man was not burdened by its inherent paradox.
the scientific and artistic avant-garde... have been forced to adapt to the ideals of the party.
the idea of the "'new soviet man"... has been reduced to a socialist archetype of the commitment to work in the spirit of progress.
the lysenko method promises that each sprout will grow as a potato.
as early as 1927, geneticist alexander serebrovski... had tried to stop the advance of lamarckism.
the article describes herman joseph muller's discovery... that x-rays cause genetic mutations.
according to serebrovski... this finding demonstrates the falsity of the lamarckian theory.
insisting that 'true eugenics can only be a product of socialism' and promises stalin that it will be possible in only a few generations to bestow the gift of genius on practically every individual... to raise the masses to the level at which now stand our most gifted individuals."
"with artificial insemination... the reproductive material of the most transcendentally superior individuals the one in fifty hundred thousands, can be used.
german racial policy results in the endless purging of inferior human material.
400.000 germans are forcibly sterilized, a 100.000 murdered... before the race hygiene project... culminates in the policy of mass extermination.
in sweden, the race hygiene impulse has taken the form of an accelerated sterilization program.
eight thousand people have been deprived of the ability to have children
"these sciences that still speak the stammering language of hypotheses... and have not liberated themselves from the power of imagination.
they belong just as much to the poet as they do the scientist.
what tremendous fresco remains not to be painted... what colossal human comedy and tragedy to be written
the material with which the question of heredity provides us seems infinite."
as political and social utopian theories lose ground the biological ideal acquires a new lease of life.
visions on genetics and its social implications... occasionally assume utopian proportions.
in man's effort to define himself... he continually encounters new obstacles to overcome.
the idea of controlling the future by means of genetics... remains a dream.
man, who he is and what ultimately shapes him is shrouded in mystery.
man has created a civilization which isolates him from nature and imprisons him in the conflict between pressing forward and longing for the past
a civilization driven by the concept of endless progress... that knowledge can eternally open new doors.
the idea of improving himself through biological means... has accompanied man for thousands of years.
what is biological necessity... and what can be moulded by environment and upbringing?
the genetic code, the human recipe is a logical structure which can be mapped and recorded.
as a multi-purpose information terminal, the navi has come into wide use even among grade-schoolers.
however, activity within the wired is currently limited by the machine.
in the real world, it didn't matter if i was there or not.
when i realized that, i was no longer afraid of losing my body.
we saw someone die right in front of us yesterday, but we're acting like it's something we saw in a movie.
i know we were there last night, but it didn't seem real.
rumor has it that the psyche chip is mass-produced in factories in taiwan.
rumor also says that it was designed by a group called the knights.
well, i heard that you have to watch out for static electricity.
so i thought it'd probably be safest if i took off my clothes.
i can't say i didn't know about it, but i don't remember taking part in it.
i get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly, but i don't remember selling my soul cheaply.
i'm guessing the same guy who could rip out a 200-pound satellite dish and scale down the side of the building
- maybe all the stories i heard about hagerty are true
now, he's going to walk around and dictate a bunch of new rules?
the next thing you know, we won't be allowed to pee in the shower!
and to show him i really mean business, haha, a wreath!
yeah, you don't want to mess with a man who carries a wreath
hey guys, i think you'd better take a look at what's in this file
third generation west point, top of his class, fought in three wars, green beret, cia!
part of me was afraid of what i would find when i got there
the thing i felt most, stronger than fear was the desire to confront him
- what possible benefit could there be from a ban on welcome mats?
i once owned a building filled with welcome mats - astro-turf, rubber, coconut weave
cars, trucks, trees, hats, so they got their scam... but that's where you come in.
they need a lot of authentic sounding people... such as yourself who need a buck.
so, like every other whore in this town, myself included... you lend whatever little bit of truth you can scrounge up... to this total systematic sham!
thereby exonerating the viewer from having to confront... the fact he's spending his life face-to-face with shit.
mickey, the last thing i want... is to interfere with any possibility... for happiness in your life.
believe me, eddie, this was not a possibility... for happiness in my life.
so i took her in, then figured i don't need her.
and maybe you guys need her... because i figured, you know, hey, you're desperate guys.
i'm going back to my wife and kids sooner or later... and i don't hide that fact from anybody.
i think that fact was crucial... to the development of this whole thing.
the loneliness in some form of total, unusual insanity... is creeping up on me.
i'm starting to think that maybe if we had a kid... everything, or at least the main things, might be ok.
sometimes i want to have a kid... then sometimes, like for the last month or so...
i see this little baby with a big gun to my head.
i could kick your fucking eyes out... and never think about it a second time... so why do you take these chances... that risk ruining both our lives?
this is the very point i think artie was just making.
there's her mother going into combat... in the back seat with this horse.
she looked like she'd gotten hit in the back of the head... with a rock.
i am telling this guy that drugs are and have been... as far as i can remember... an ever-present component of my personality.
i am a drug person... and i would not, if i were him, consider that anything unusual.
'cause i'm curious about the patterns of bullshit... by which people pull the wool over their own eyes.
so could you just give me kind of just a... a little hint as to the nature of the delusion... with which you hype yourself about this guy?
you maybe have some misconceptions... about how smart you are, that's all.
certain facts being pointed out is all that's going on here.
i am normally the kind of person who allots a degree of energy... to being on the lookout for creeps, eddie.
i am not so dumb as to be ignorant... of the vast hordes of creeps running loose in california... but because this guy is on your recommendation...
i did my best to set you up nicely, phil... and you got to fuck it up.
i'm some kind of very, very unusual jerk is what i figure.
this chick, she's harassing me... we're balling away... and she starts going, "faster, faster...
"slower, higher." do this, do that... literally to the point where i said...
is it just one big blur... in which everything that resembles something else... just automatically is put on the same level... in your hierarchy?
the only thing they have in common... is they're both restaurants!
what do you want... some kind of dualistic trip where everything comes in twos?
you just can't tell the difference between 'em... so you just pull on this taut wire between people... who might need some definitive reaction from you... in order to know.
you don't do a hundred miles an hour... down that narrow crease in the high ground... because you're anxious to get home.
a hundred miles an hour down mulholland... on a star-filled night is not the way to longevity.
i've indulged in nothing even remotely sarcastic... and i want that understood.
if i've been a little flip... it's to put some humor into what could be... a totally and utterly mor...
all the necessary information... that might deter you gets locked away.

why don't you wait up for phil, why don't you, eddie?
wouldn't that be great if phil came by to keep you company?
now, sources close to the investigation tell us... the boy admits to bludgeoning to death...
i mean, there is you... and there's these other items... all these other items, like death.

and i read stuff about buddhism, and buddhists are no idiots.
there are things i don't understand, but those guys have really cool things to say.
max schreck and jeanine bouvier, you are making a life-long pact before god and before man by uttering one sole word.
we have all uttered this word which has bound our lives.
- snakes... like this one... are one example of a species that have survived millions of years.
they have built-in sensors... that enable them to survive the perils found in nature.
on the food chain, a mouse is lower than a snake.
but to a truly magnificent creature like the snake, a mouse...
well, um, thank you, mr. blankenship, for that, um, enlightening demonstration.
okay, now, class, uh, for your first assignment, i want you all to pair off.
there are 18 quotations from mr. doors in the last 2 weeks alone, and you say you have absolutely no connection to him?
i told you i publish an independent electronic journal of opinion.
your anonymous author advocates the theft of military hardware for the coming species war.
now some members of the judiciary would say that is a crime, miss hagar.
she runs an anti-companion web site with direct communications with doors!
why don't you tell him that i asked to speak to my lawyer.
well, that's unclear, but the human brain's a very fragile instrument.
is the anti-virus programmed to attack the cvi currently implanted in agent sandoval's brain?
he speaks your name as if seeing you as you once were.
probably just an effect of the drug, but we won't know for certain until tomorrow.
it's more important than ever that i return sandoval to you for re-implantation.
sandoval's cvi had additional information about the taelon race and their mission.
the implication is that the taelon race faces some sort of time constraint here.
would this information still be inside of sandoval's mind with the cvi gone?
we have shown your technologists how to focus the electromagnetic pulse through taelon shielding.
with this weapon, an enemy can be rendered both deaf and dumb, without the direct loss of life.
you know, it's not like we were very close or anything.
i don't think i've talked to him in like, ten years.
that's why i'm convinced there had to be inside help at the lab.
agent sandoval, what may i inform the synod about the theft of this weapon?
i have been informed about the death of capt. marquette's father.
she should be removed from this case, and allowed the proper time to grieve.
my friend, if you're looking for a fence, go to a pawn shop.
you have an enviable reputation as a man who can sell anything to anyone, even the most rarefied of objects.
you know how hard it was for your father to really let people in.
but he did tell me how proud he was of you.
look, if we want to get this weapon back, we have to move quickly.
sandoval is working around the clock to find it, and he will.
cmdr. boone has removed me from the iw weapon investigation on your order.
have i given you any reason at all to question my judgment or ability?
well, maybe he was trying to toughen you up, get you ready for the real world.
he wasn't interested in us, he was interested in control, even if it killed us.
human science has long sought to capture and replicate neural intelligence within the form of artificial intelligence.
we have taken the first step in enabling your technicians to fulfill that goal.
he experienced only about four minutes of zero gravity... couldn't see where he was going because there was no forward-facing window... and he splashed down just 302 miles from where he had started.
those 15 minutes in the spring of 1961 were just a taste... of other longer flights america's first astronaut planned on making.
if you ask me, shepard's flight wasn't such a big deal, anyway.
just a few more guys to meet and greet, then it's all business.
we have a logging crew to check for hydrocarbons in the well... which gives us a rough idea of its potential.
they have a probe they'll be lowering down to take a look at--
alan shepard may only have flown in space for 15 minutes... but he's given this program seven years... of commitment and expertise.
and it gives me great pleasure to introduce... a great pilot and a great astronaut... and a good friend...
the general consensus is that either it goes away on its own, or it doesn't.
i don't even feel the symptoms anymore, but every time i think i've beat it... some doctor tells me otherwise.
look, why don't you just take some time and think about it?
if you have other questions, i'd be glad to answer them.
there are a number of steps that pings automates... that on an ags abort must be performed manually... like pitching you over, switching the guidance systems... separating the stages and throttling up to 100%.
now, of course, the ags computer only has a fraction... of the pings's 39-kilobyte capacity.
you never orbited the earth... never set foot in a gemini or apollo capsule, or never served as backup.
so why don't we make you the command pilot for the next lunar landing?
guess he just stayed at the top of the rotation this whole time, huh?
did you hear that they offered mcdivitt a spot on al's crew?
i'm much younger than alan shepard, and i'm in excellent physical condition.
but there's been a lot of empire building going on, and politics.
we'll create a tease, a little piece of film we can put in the beginning.
go into that it was a rough comeback... and it seemed like you wouldn't make it, and you finally did.
- maybe i'll ask... something about apollo 13, which at one point was going to be your mission.
and the same thing with apollo 1, if you hadn't been grounded at the time.
america's first astronaut, alan shepard, now 47... prepares to become the oldest american to fly in space.
it's been a long road back to flight status for al... made possible by an experimental ear surgery.
so tell me, given your medical history... limited space experience, would you have chosen yourself... to rescue the space program after the near-tragedy of apollo 13?
well, jules, i certainly feel more than up to the task.
we thought you might be interested in knowing', we have a dr. house down here.
he'll be monitoring the progress of the mission for the next few minutes.
we get that during the descent, this turns into a bad day.
i don't know how quickly they can come up with it.
it just so happens to have a genuine six-iron on the bottom of it.
in my hand, i have that white pellet familiar to millions of americans.
there would be others, including one... when, in the midst of worldwide unrest...
americans were hoping to send three human beings... on the very first voyage from the earth to the moon.
the enemy very deceitfully has taken advantage... of the troops... in order to create maximum--
i'd point out to you the time has come... when we ought to unite... when we ought to stand up and be counted... when we ought to support our leaders, our government... our men and our allies until aggression is stopped.
i want, more than any human being in all the world... to see the killing stopped.
to be killed and to kill... in fighting which is not in the interest of the country... it represents is the ultimate tragedy.
it is the biggest rocket anyone has ever seen... a behemoth intended to transport men beyond the influence of the earth.
not 1968 but, god willing, next year... a rocket just like the one out on pad 39a... will be taking men to the moon.
as a veteran of every manned launch of america's space program...
i can tell you that the mood here at the cape... is a bit subdued.
scattered violence broke out in some sections of the city... within two hours of dr. king's death.
i may not get there with you... but i want you to know tonight... that we as a people will get to the promised land.
martin luther king... dedicated his life... to love and to justice... between fellow human beings.
for those of you who are black... you can be filled with bitterness... and with hatred... or we can make an effort... and replace that violence... with an effort to understand... compassion and love.
may the angels take you into paradise... and the martyrs come to welcome you on your way.... and lead you into the holy city, jerusalem.
my brother need not be idealized... or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life... but to be remembered simply as a good and decent man... who saw wrong and tried to right it... who saw suffering and tried to heal it... saw war and tried to stop it.
those of us who loved him... and who take him to his rest today... pray that what he was to us... what he wished for others... will someday come to pass for all the world.
as he said many times... in many parts of this nation...
any information how fast they can get the next one up?
if they're actually attempting a flight to the moon... they'll have a window in early october.
take only the command and the service module to the moon... and back before the new year.
in one hail mary pass, we'd accomplish so many mission objectives that--
we can make sure the flight plan has several decision points... go or no-go's that will minimize the risks.
it may sound strange, but this is the least risky of any apollo flight.
the soviet news agency tass... announced the recovery of the zond 5... an unmanned spacecraft that landed in the indian ocean... three days after circumnavigating the moon.
the first to send an unmanned spacecraft around the moon... and return it safely to earth.
the recent success of apollo 7's shakedown flight... has turned this command module... from a space capsule into a moon ship.
russians do feel that zond 5 prepared them for a manned orbit of the moon.
they could go as early as-- ...russian technology is the dress rehearsal for a team of cosmonauts--
frank borman, jim lovell and william anders are on the verge of making-- ...an historic flight in late december.
this is a nasa bombshell... an electrifying announcement that, while only made today... has obviously been in the planning stages for quite some time.
the american spacecraft will not merely go around the moon and return... but rather, using a series of maneuvers... the crew will park themselves in lunar orbit for a day.
i am announcing today my candidacy-- ...take him to his rest today.
mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord!
number one window is clean but has some lint on it.
this is no time to be listening to a "how to speak french" tape.
if we have contaminated food, we have a very serious problem.
we aren't going to abort the mission because of some bad pudding.
before he tapes all of our filters... over the lens where i look back at you all...
command module pilot jim lovell has a message for a special someone.
frank, before you get started, i have a message here from susan.
she says, "the custard is in the oven at 350." over.
anytime we send human beings into space, the bottom line is it's a risk.
well, i appreciate your honesty, chris... but i know what a free return trajectory is.
he flew for the achievement found in a job well-done... and because his country needed him.
that the moon has taken his life and the lives of his friends...
jim lovell and bill anders saddens us... and makes this world a lesser place.
it is better that he is gone now for he could not have lived with... the knowledge that the mission that was his command had failed so tragically."
i know my own impression is that it's... a vast, lonely... forbidding-type existence... or expanse of nothing.
it certainly would not appear to be... a very inviting place to live or work.
the vast loneliness... of the moon up here is awe-inspiring, and it makes you realize... just what you have back there on earth.
the earth from here is a grand oasis from the big vastness of space.
god created the heaven and the earth... and the earth was without form... and void... and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters... and god said, 'let there be light.'
the crucial four-minute burn of the sps engine... to begin astronauts borman, lovell and anders on their long voyage home... takes place here on the far side of the moon.
out of sight but certainly not out of the minds of mission control... and all of us here.
we will not know apollo 8's status until the spacecraft... comes from around the far side of the moon... and acquisition of signal is achieved.
if the astronaut radio voices, telemetry data... comes later than 38 minutes after loss of signal... it means quite simply that the engine did not get a good burn... and apollo 8 is still in orbit around the moon.
they not only had to have the acumen of pilots and engineers... they also had to have knowledge and practice... as physicists, astronomers, geologists... and, if possible, as historians... and even poets and artists.
the reasons to demand such disciplines of the astronauts was simple--
you will find no better record of what it is like to be on the moon... than in the experiences and recollections... of the men who went there.
if god is found in the details of our world... then the details must be discovered and interpreted... by the men who make the voyage... from the earth to the moon.
you might be watching for a place where you think the rake might help you.
yeah, i think we could probably do a rake here, joe.
what do you think the best way to sample it would be?
i think probably to break up a piece of clod underneath it.
the xenolith is an aggregate of rocks... formed as slow-cooling crystals at great depth... and brought to the surface by impact or a volcanic eruption.
when silica content is low in plutonic magma... a cyanide-like rock is likely to be formed... thus producing a feldspathoid.
doing field geology... is like solving the mystery of the dead cat.
if you bring me a dead cat, all i can tell you is it's dead, and it's a cat.
which is why we didn't have many dinner guests in our home.
but gosh, if granite gets made way down below... how the heck did it get here?
not just which rocks you plan to bring back... but their context.
that and knowing which ones to pick up in the first place... is what might separate you guys from those little robots.
you know, the ones some jaded soul thinks should have your job.
you see, you have to become our eyes and ears... out there.
and for you to do that... you first have to learn the language... of this little rock here.
ever since galileo and his telescope... the moon has been getting closer and closer.
or maybe the moon is more like a sister... formed alongside the earth... out of the same magical dust.
or perhaps... a big old stray asteroid made the mistake... of wandering a bit too close to our gravitational influence... and doomed itself to circle us for all eternity... like some faithful dog.
the apollo 15 mission as we know it has been scrubbed.
we're moving straight into the "j" missions... which, as you know, mean longer stays on the surface... an upgraded lem, better suits and backpacks... and ultimately more science.
so when we're confronted with a new survey site... what do we do?
we go to the highest place we can find... and figure out the big picture.
a bunch of layers on the far wall of the canyon.
to the right, there's a lot of dirt... with green stuff sloping down.
over to my right is a large-- well, it's a huge--
no, no, it's like... a huge breccia-like boulder... right in the side of the wall.
at my six o'clock, open end of the canyon, there's a ridge--
okay, houston, at my nine o'clock is a thick layer... of uniform, horizontal beds.
we spend money and manpower on a revised checklist... and procedures... and we add weight in the form of consumables... all so we can add another time-consuming item... to a flight plan and training schedule... that's already filled beyond capacity?
i think you'd see the value if you joined us on a field trip sometime.
we are not leaving this room or breaking for lunch... until we agree on a landing site for apollo 15.
now, then... we have a deadlock between marius hills on the one hand... and hadley rille in the appenine mountains on the other.
we have been barking over this bone for six months now... with absolutely no movement... or, i might add, accommodation.
if we're going to launch in july, we must know today.
it's important because it may unlock... a stack of mysteries... about the origins of the moon.
because if you find this... you have probably found a piece of the moon's... primordial crust.
i can see from up at the top of the rille down... there's debris all the way.
looks like some outcrops directly... at about eleven o'clock to the sun line.
i guess one of the reasons we got here today... was because of a gentleman named galileo a long time ago... who made a rather significant discovery... about falling objects and gravity fields.
we thought... where would be a better place to confirm his findings... than on the moon.
oh, you were with us, professor... every step of the way.
we went to the moon as trained observers in order to gather data... not only with our instruments onboard... but with our minds.
i'd like to quote a statement from plutarch... which i think expresses our feelings since we've come back.
"the mind is not a vessel to be filled... but a fire to be lighted."
during their flight to the moon... the crew of apollo 13 made a live color television broadcast... back to earth that was largely ignored.
moments after the end of the tv show, an explosion occurred... which put the lives of the crew in danger... and made it impossible for any further pictures to be seen back home.
the remaining dramatic days of the flight played themselves out... by way of only the faint radio voices of the crew... the sketchy telemetry data from the crippled spacecraft... and the reports from the media that suddenly found itself... as blind to the events as the rest of the world... a world which had become bored with tv shows from outer space.
one of the biggest stories of the year became one with no tv pictures... only talking heads... all waiting to see whether three human beings would survive... a voyage from the earth to the moon.
people, we'll try to move this along as quickly as possible... because, obviously, we have matters to attend to in mission control.
i assume that deke slayton, chris kraft... and colonel james mcdivitt need no introduction.
mission control's across the courtyard 100 yards from here... where we aren't allowed to be.
unless we know what you know when you know it, we'll start getting paranoid.
we'll have a press pool of two... one print, one broadcast, rotated every two hours... in the visitors' gallery where they can monitor the flight director's loop.
we hear everything he hears... but no taping or broadcast of the flight controller's communications.
nobody put a gun to their head and made them do this.
don't the shareholders have a right to know the real cost of the space program?
freddo, i'm afraid this will be the last moon mission for a long time.
do you agree with commander lovell's assessment that... this will be our last flight to the moon?
i'm sure we've all been in situations... where we've found ourselves under pressure... and we make a comment that we might have phrased differently... under other circumstances.
having said that, there are... a lot of questions that we need answers to--
- no, i mean... to ambush a defenseless, old couple like that... is beneath the dignity of our profession.
i'd love to debate ethics in journalism right now, but i have a job to do.
from our houston bureau where emmett seaborn is following that story.
the astronauts of apollo 13 face new uncertainties... as they prepare for tomorrow's fiery descent through the earth's atmosphere.
your attitude looks good except in rolls... so we'd like you to do the following:
in minimal impulse pings, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch... which is about where you are now... to 008 degrees in roll... which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude... and to zero degrees in yaw, which is about where you are now.
apollo 13 is 45,000 miles from earth... and moving at 7,000 miles an hour.
its course now adjusted so we should see it land in the pacific... some five hours from now.
at 10:53, they will cast off the lunar lander... that has been their lifeboat ever since the power failed on the main ship... some 82 hours ago.
what we don't know in the final hours of this extraordinary mission... is how the damaged spacecraft will stand up to the trauma... of re-entry into the earth's atmosphere.
in just a few minutes, the astronauts aboard the crippled apollo 13... will jettison their service module... which was mysteriously damaged only two days into the mission... forcing them to abandon all hopes of a lunar landing.
with any luck, the crew will get a view of the damaged service module... to determine what may have caused the cataclysmic malfunction.
this is apollo control houston... at 140 hours, 15 minutes into the mission.
apollo 13 presently 34,350 nautical miles out from the earth... traveling at a speed of 12,846 miles per hour.
and, as the accelerating ship encounters the thickening air... friction will begin to build... generating temperatures of 4,000 degrees across the face of the heat shield.
if this energy generated by the infernal descent... were converted to electricity... it would equal 86,000 kilowatt hours... enough to light up los angeles for one and a half minutes.
as temperatures rise, a dense cloud of ionized gas will surround the ship... reducing communication to a hash of static for about three minutes.
if radio contact is restored at the end of this time, controllers will know... that the heat shield is intact... and the spacecraft did survive.
we just had one last time around the room... and everybody says you're looking great.
i know all of us want to thank all you guys down there... for the very fine job you did.
a remarkable end to a four-day ordeal... as the astronauts streak homeward--
we still have to wait for the drogue chutes and the main parachutes.
he had to develop special wax models so he could study the lighting effects... to be duplicated in the frescoes... and come up with a special slow-drying plaster.
he suffered constant deadline pressure from frustrated church officials... and the pope, who just wanted the ceiling finished.
the work itself was uncomfortable and unending... with wet paint and plaster dripping in the face of the man... who was not, after all, a painter, but a sculptor.
such challenges arise in all the great works of human imagination... be they the creation of our world rendered upon... the ceiling of a church... or the view of our world evident by making the voyage... from the earth to the moon.
wernher von braun briefed the head of the national advisory committee.
he presented the two best options for going to the moon.
we put the pieces together in orbit... and off we go.
these two methods-- these are the only ways of getting to moon?
you send up some ships to the moon... with all the extra fuel and supplies to get back.
that way, when the astronauts arrive... everything they need to get home is already there.
it looked like either earth orbit rendezvous... or direct ascent would be the way to go.
either way we go... the spacecraft that lands on the moon is going to look like that.
at chance vought industries in texas... an engineer named tom dolan hit upon an interesting idea.
you ever hear of a russian rocket guy named yuri kondratyuk?
in 1916 he realized something we seem to have forgotten today.
gettin' to the moon is going to be all about weight.
it's a little risky, but it could save a lot of weight.
i don't think there's a chance in hell... that lunar orbit rendezvous is the way we're gonna go... but it is interesting.
i'm afraid you're gonna have to tell your wives and kids the bad news.
you won't be seeing much of them for the next couple years... because we got the contract.
but the rubber balls you're gonna have to pay for yourself.
you know, if weight wasn't a factor, we'd have this thing done in a year.
we're gonna go with just the one docking hatch up top... and use a forward hatch for egress.
that means when they return they'll have to rendezvous and dock blind.
okay, one more thing. lt's no longer the lunar excursion module any more.
everybody feels that "excursion" sounds like it's gonna go out on a school trip.
but as long as people speak up about their mistakes, we've got a shot.
they try to sweep it under the rug... and we're not gonna go to new jersey, let alone the moon.
but mistakes and miscalculations were only a small part of it.
the real problem is that a lem isn't one spacecraft but two.
the lower half of the lem-- the descent stage-- contains the engine that astronauts will use to control their landing.
after the moonwalks, the descent stage will serve as a launch platform... for the ascent stage-- the cockpit of the lem-- which the astronauts will fly into lunar orbit... for their rendezvous with the command module.
lem 3 would be the first to be flown in space by astronauts.
we worked hand in hand with the astronauts... from the beginning of lem program.
they showed us what we were doing right... and what we were doing wrong.
from early on much of their attention was given to lem 3.
the crew assigned to take the lem 3 into space... on the first manned flight of a lunar module is as follows:
commander jim mcdivitt-- a gemini vet, one of the best pilots in the program-- command module pilot dave scott-- another gemini vet-- and flying right beside mcdivitt as his l.m.p...
before we can even undock the lem from the command module... we gotta make sure we can do an emergency transfer outside the craft.
which means, rusty... you're gonna have to do an e.v.a. on the plss backpack-- the first use of that.
god willing, the ascent engine lights-- first firing of that in space.
then rusty and i head back to you... for the first docking of a two-manned spacecraft.
the hardest part of getting the first lems to fly... was getting the thousands of systems and subsystems to work together.
most of the time it was like having a ballroom full of dancers... dancing different steps to music that wasn't quite right for any of them.
you know, this is so bad i can't even joke about it.
perhaps the main reason we were behind schedule and over budget... was because budgets and schedules are based on previous experience... with similar projects.
we didn't know how much it'd cost to build the lems or how long it'd take.
all we really knew was how much time we'd been given... and that was running out.
we were working as fast as we could-- 24 hours a day... seven days a week, and it wasn't enough.
in june, 1968 it was decided... that we'd ship lem 3 to nasa as she was and finish the work at the cape.
you know, i can't even remember when it was gonna cost a billion.
unfortunately, moving lem 3 to the cape... did little to ease the pressure we were under.
that's why we decided to send frank on this mission ahead of you.
but i wanted to see what you had to say about it... before i told frank.
two months later, frank borman, jim lovell and bill anders... took apollo 8 on its historic flight around the moon.
all that time, lem 3 was being worked on around the clock.
i should've been able to sit back in the span room in houston watch the show.
but in the early hours of launch day... the pressure in one of lem 3's fuel tanks was reading disturbingly high.
i managed to put the tank pressure problem out of my mind for a moment.
i tried to imagine what it was like in lem 3 just then.
rusty became the first person to enter a lem in space.
later that day, shortly after rusty and jim extended the landing gear... something happened which brought the mission to a grinding halt.
if rusty were to throw up in a suit, he'd likely asphyxiate and die... before jim could get him back into the lem and repressurize.
but if rusty didn't test the backpack... the lem couldn't undock from the command module.
the next day, as rusty and jim went through their checklist... the mood around nasa was pretty grim.
the mood lifted a little when one of jim's air-to-ground transmissions... made everyone smile.
i suggest on the next lem they give an extra go with a vacuum cleaner.
we got a few odds and ends floating around in here.
dave stood in the open hatch of the command module... to film rusty's test of the backpack.
when one of dave's cameras broke... he went back inside to fix it.
that gave rusty something unheard of on an e.v.a.: free time.
for three minutes there was nothing for him to do but look at the earth.
the only reason it was even a question is i didn't want you to kill yourself.
and i'll try not to for the rest of the mission.
when i said good-bye to lem 3, i felt like a proud parent... watching a child go off to college.
as i say good-bye to this lem, i feel like a parent of centuries past... saying farewell as his child embarks for the new world.
to some people, that might sound like i'm stretching the point.
a lem is not a child, it's a machine... and a machine doesn't have a soul.
apollo 11 might never have happened... were it not for three very specific people.
you've probably never heard of sergei korolyov... but without him the soviet union might never have put a man into space... nor stirred the competitive juices of his american counterparts.
wernher von braun was the german rocket scientist... who turned the weapons of world war two... into the giant saturn boosters of the space race 20 years later.
john f. kennedy brashly vowed to send a man to the moon and return him safely... long before it was known to be possible.
i can't go on the air without puttin' on my tie.
we'll be on the air from the moment you cross through the equigravisphere... right up through the big moment.
if everything goes according to plan... an event will take place today... that will forever mark the 20th day of the seventh month of the year.
i can guarantee that you'll remember this day... where you are and what you are doing.
it's a groovy trip, but there are more important things to do first.
it will be a revelation to all mankind... that the universe and the creation... is so much greater than anybody ever realized.
p-64-- will commence... pitching the lem forward from face up to about 30 degrees from vertical... allowing armstrong and aldrin to see the lunar surface.
as they approach the landing site the most crucial information will be... altitude, rate of descent, horizontal velocity... and propellant remaining.
if they get below about 80 seconds of fuel remaining... the "quantity" light will illuminate.
at that point they've got 60 seconds to decide whether or not to land... leaving them 20 seconds of fuel... to either get down or level off their descent and abort.
at six feet, if all goes well... probes extending from the landing gear will touch the surface... and they will get the "contact" light.
armstrong will then shut off the descent engine and they will drop... gently to the surface... and mankind will never be the same again, blah, blah, blah.
for the next three months... we will do everything in our power to see that these men land safely... which means, for the next three months we must do everything in our power... to kill them.
so, how many times have you "killed" the crew of apollo 11?
i understand the crew kept training in the simulators up to the last minutes.
armstrong and aldrin were in the simulator at the cape... right up till the day before the launch.
a lot of cockamamie theories about landing on it... and how it would be impossible.
but the point is, being the first to do it... you don't know exactly what's gonna happen.
i mean, how do you physically train for such a thing?
one way is to climb into an aircraft we call the flying bedstead.
your wife is named joan... and your life has been chronicled and featured... and photographed... ever since the mission of apollo 11 placed you in the world spotlight.
you're also gonna be the second man to walk on the face of the moon.
to be honest with you, buzz, i've been more concerned with the landing.
in gemini the pilot did the e.v.a. while the commander stayed on board.
i don't know how much attention he's prepared to give to the larger issue... of what we're doing and what it means to the world.
some measure of attention should be paid to the meaning of the task... by whichever one of us takes that first step.
and besides that, the way that hatch opens... it'd be damned difficult for the l.m.p. to get out first... unless you two switch places.
you'll both be wearing hard suits and backpacks, so that's not gonna happen.
you've trained to come back to earth... as the sole survivor of apollo 11, haven't you?
nobody likes to dwell on such things... but that is one of the scenarios that we practice in flight simulation.
what do you say we move the rest period till after the e.v.a.?
that way, if everything's shipshape we'll get out there as soon as possible.
the earth represents, well, everyone... because the mission is bigger than nations... or politics.
what is significant... is that... for the first time in the history of our civilization... a man is going to set foot on the moon.
that way the whole world can read it and maybe claim it as their own.
well, if that's the case, why don't we just let history record the rest.
at this moment the crew is preparing... for the challenges of the hours to come... more than likely with the attitudes of professional men anywhere... who have a long workday ahead.
neil armstrong, michael collins and buzz aldrin are mortal men... and yet their talents, their disciplines and their choices... have placed them here, in the third week of july, 1969... at a place and time unique in the cosmos.
these three men are on their way to a distant place... where no man has gone before.
with them go our dreams, our desires and our good wishes... but not only for their safe passage in return.
oh, neil, you'll be happy to know the russian newspaper pravda... is calling you the czar of the mission.
well, the czar is brushing his teeth right now, but i'll pass that along.
an ancient chinese legend says that a beautiful girl named chongo... has been living up there for 4,000 years.
she was banished to the moon because she stole the pill for immortality... from her husband.
a 30-second burn that drops the eagle to 10 miles above the lunar surface... and prepares them for their final descent.
we're only moments away from a flurry of activity... that will, if all goes well... find armstrong and aldrin safely on the moon.
we got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, but we're breathing again.
be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world.
only divine beings, or supermen... could withstand the rigors and distance of such a journey.
but then, early in the 20th century... mortal humans went aloft on mechanical wings... defying gravity and redefining the realm of possibility.
forever after... the moon became a goal within the grasp of those on earth.
for if man could build a machine to make him fly... he would eventually build one to take him to the moon.
when and how and who... was only a matter of time.
from december of 1968 to december of 1972... 24 representatives of the human race... voyaged to the moon... and half as many walked upon its surface.
the requirements to make the voyage a reality... were the qualities that make humankind unique.
our desire to achieve... our wherewithal and perseverance... our willingness to sacrifice time, energy and even life... in the long labor needed to solve the problems one by one... over the course of the endeavor.
most important of all was humankind's tendency... to imagine things that are not possible.
imagining that it could be done was the very first step taken... in the journey from the earth to the moon.
i was very energetic in 1902... and i was working for the great george melies... who i had met at the theatre houdin in paris.
he was beginning, then, to work with film... and i was in love with the magic that came out of his camera... which wasn't all that different from the ones... you use right now.
but the moon was in monsieur melies' eyes... and this is what he designed and built... at the star film studios... in montreal.
monsieur melies had constructed... the largest film studio in the world at that time.
between 1896 and 1913, he produced over 100 films... each more magical and inventive than the other.
actors, visual effects specialists... carpenters, costumes... all under the direct supervision... of monsieur melies.
this is beginning to sound strange to you... and you murmur about this.
and i say, this projectile... will actually journey... all the way from the earth to the moon.
i got out of the lm after gene did on the first e.v.a.
so that would make me the twelfth and final person... to make footprints up there.
it's not like i get stopped at restaurants because of it.
i will bet you $50 and a box of donuts... no one knows the names of the last two men to walk on the moon.
but if you didn't get a nasa paycheck... you never even knew their names.
eugene cernan was a veteran astronaut... who walked in space on gemini 9 in 1966.
exhausted and overheated in his pressure suit... he lost 15 pounds in the effort.
gambling that the apollo program... would remain funded by congress... he held out for command of apollo 17... rather than take the job of lunar module pilot... on john young's 16 flight.
harrison schmitt-- or "jack," as he is known-- went to the moon with a special relish.
the first and only scientist to go... he was a geologist by trade... and an astronaut by choice.
i always had some strong ideas... about where we were going on the moon... and forcefully suggested them.
jack had no problem picking up the phone... and calling the president of the united states... if he had an idea about where or what... we should be doing with apollo.
this is how it is when you are working with a genius.
but it was not during the filming... that melies worked his true magic.
eugene cernan, ronald evans and harrison schmitt... flying through the automated roll program of the spacecraft... begin america's-- and perhaps all of mankind's-- final voyage to the moon.
three men inside the command module america... with the lunar module challenger in tow.... journey now to the moon.
most of the world and much of america... views apollo 17 as an undertaking... either commonplace or wasteful.
regardless... to be here, once again, in the presence... of such glorious force... aimed at such a heavenly target as the moon... one can only marvel and ask...
okay, houston... as i step down to the surface at taurus-littrow--
no one on the planet earth saw gene cernan... first set foot on the moon's surface.
the apollo 17 tv camera would not be operative... until the lunar rover was deployed and powered up.
when it was... crystal-clear video pictures from the surface of the moon... were transmitted to the world by way of a television camera... controlled from a console in mission control... by ed fendel.
the networks didn't even want to cover the mission... except on the morning shows... and an occasional update.
in july of 1969... the entire world stopped... to watch buzz and neil... and the one giant leap.
the picture was so bad, a lot of people couldn't even make it out.
12, the color camera went out so there was no tv.
after extended problems with the gravimeter... and the lunar surface experiment package... and a time-consuming fix... to the broken fender of the rover...
cernan and schmitt were allowed to travel only half as far... as their first e.v.a. had originally called for.
not once did gene-o drive with me on the uphill side.
he usually only had three wheels on the surface... and me feeling like we were gonna tip over any minute.
with ten stations scheduled... the pair drove off over five miles... from the safety of challenger... with the single-minded task of doing as much work... in the allotted time as was humanly possible.
while the astronauts were in transit on the moon... there was no television signal.
the f-stop for the 500 millimeter... should be the same as for the 70.
gene, you might want to take some shots of those massifs... if they look interesting.
to find a sample... with such a vivid color on the surface of the moon.
that would be evidence of volcanic activity... the one-time presence of water or oxygen.
it was exactly the kind of find... you'd want to make on a place like the moon.
of course, it turned out it was too good to be true.
but that little episode... that had us going for a bit.
so what other things can reflect off the rover up there?
and you might brush the lens for us... before you move out of the way.
i'm gonna take a quick pan while i'm waiting for you.
now these were perfectly normal... preliminary assumptions to make... about an unexamined sample... but it turned out that it was orange volcanic glass... from a fire fountain that happened 3.5 billion years ago.
but that did not diminish anyone's excitement... about that find, or, frankly, its importance.
i think jack and i did as solid an e.v.a... as anyone could have on that second time out.
some of the best work ever done in all of apollo.
he said if he could, he would bring me one back.
and he said if he couldn't, he'd bring me a moonbeam.
he said he was going to carve my initials in the lunar dust... making me the only little girl with her name on the moon.
and that it would last for thousands and thousands of years.
the moon is roughly five times the size of the continent of africa.
in all, the apollo missions spent more than 12 days on its surface... but less than three-and-a-half days actually exploring its mysteries.
jack, he slept like a baby... with the sweetest dreams you can imagine, i suppose.
mankind's final day on the moon... came with the earth's face having waned by 15%.
the day would bring the last seven hours of human footfall... on the face of another world.
the longer you stay on the moon, minute by minute... the better the chances are for something to go wrong.
but the immediacy... of actually being there in houston at the same time... it did something to my consciousness that had not yet happened.
it came at a moment... when the man operating the camera... turned it toward the earth... and he zoomed in very slowly.
turning point rock was so named... because it was the station farthest away from the challenger... on the final e.v.a. of apollo 17.
what looked like in orbit to be one huge boulder... that had skidded to a stop in the valley... was, in fact, five different boulders... each the size of a house.
the lunar module was three miles away... and that was our home.
we were up on the side of the north massif working.
he did not know that le voyage dans la lune... was already playing in america.
and he was not ever going to see a penny from it.
agents of the american genius and thief, monsieur thomas edison... had seen the film in london.
they bribed the theater owner... took the film into a lab... and made copy after copy after copy of it.
gene cernan drove the rover... a few hundred feet away from the challenger... to its final resting place... a parking spot where it still sits today.
he would need the clamps that held together the quick-fix fender... for inside the lm during ascent.
i'd just like to say what i believe history will record.
that america's challenge of today... has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.
the camera on apollo 15 wouldn't tilt up... to follow the ascent... and its commands for keeping apollo 16... were too slow.
now with one last chance... to televise the complete event... the pressure was on to pan and zoom the camera... several seconds before liftoff.
apollo 17 embarked from the moon for the sixth and final time... in the history of mankind.
the exploration of another world... was successfully and safely completed... thanks to the efforts and attention of those on earth... who could only look on as vicarious participants... as the fantastic voyages came... to a bittersweet end.
boy, that made me mad because we were just getting good at it.
the hardware had been proven, was getting even better... and yet we have not been back to the moon since 1972.
if you have the time, i can list off the names... of a couple of hundred thousand people... who gave of themselves to make it happen... along with the names of dozens of people who gave their lives.
understand... that the moon is what the earth once was... before the ancient craters were erased by the wind... and the rain and the geologic forces.
i had been living up there on the moon... these past 25 years... wandering around with my hammer and a sack... and a thermos or two of coffee.
i'm very glad to have been alive when we went to the moon.
i am of the generation that witnessed it... that actually saw it live on television.
and what we saw on television... from the forbidding and desolate surface of the moon... was our own world... both beautiful and troubled.
standing on the moon, looking up at the earth... you see that the promise and potential of our world... is as obvious as it is magnificent.
and for the people who live on that green and blue ball... there is no difficulty they cannot overcome... no solution they cannot grasp... no distance that they cannot travel.
me standing in the valley of taurus-littrow... is proof of that.
what we learned about the moon... is not nearly as important as our going there.
we didn't go there to conquer it or claim it... or simply beat the russians to it.
sure, we wanted to find out what the moon was made of... to satisfy questions of science... that have plagued us since the dawn of man.
but more than anything else... we went to the moon... to see if we could make the journey... because if we can do that... if we can voyage... from the earth to the moon... then there's hope for all of us... because we can do anything.
william bradford, speaking in 1630... of the founding of the plymouth bay colony... said that all great and honorable actions... are accompanied with great difficulty.
our leadership in science and industry... our hopes for peace and security... our obligations to ourselves... as well as others... all require us to make this effort... to solve these mysteries... to solve them for the good of all men.
there is no strife, no prejudice... no national conflict in outer space as yet.
we choose to go to the moon in this decade... and do the other things... not because they are easy... but because they are hard.
because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept... one we are unwilling to postpone... and one we intend to win.
problems such as how to make that first exploratory leap... into the lifeless void of outer space.
for without surviving that, no one would ever dare make... the foolhardy, yet divine, voyage from the earth to the moon.
man has traversed the reaches of outer space, and that man is a communist.
soviet pilot yury gagarin in the spacecraft vostok i... successfully lifted off the face of the earth... flew his craft around the globe in approximately 90 minutes... and landed safely in the soviet union.
as with the flight of sputnik four years ago... this latest russian achievement... has caught those in the american space program by surprise.
the seven american astronauts of the mercury space program... suddenly find themselves jockeying for second place.
just when the flight will take place has been the subject of much speculation.
tonight president kennedy is meeting with officials... of the national aeronautics and space administration... to discuss not just why we are losing the space race... but perhaps if it has already been lost.
for the purpose of tonight's meeting, we can dispense with small talk.
he will want to know how we can catch the russians... or better yet, leapfrog them.
pumping that much cash... into the private sector could be popular.
he will ask if there's anything we can do for less of the taxpayers' dollars.
if we get into a race with them over heavy lifting capabilities... which is all that putting up a space station will demonstrate... we're going to lose for at least the next five years.
hugh, were you as sure about this when you were working under eisenhower?
the only thing we'll get for our money is some rocks.
so, put a probe up, scoop some out, bring 'em back... and tour the world with them for propaganda purposes.
their large rocket engines which gives them many months of lead time... and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit... this lead sometime to come... in still more impressive success.
we, nevertheless, are required... to make new efforts on our own.
i have earlier requested for space activities... to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals.
first, i believe that this nation should commit itself... to achieving the goal before this decade is out... of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
we've all been planning, meeting, talking, dreaming, but here... is the brass tacks... so we're all on the same page.
to get a man to the moon, we first have to get him into... orbit.
see if we can build a suit to protect a man outside.
see if he can maneuver, see if he can get back in.
we need to prove them all... proficiently over and over again.
we have to get so good at it... that we bet the lives of our crews without flinching.
i believe you're expected in the corral room up in the mezzanine.
you guys are drinkin' in bad company if pete conrad's buyin'.
and as we bow our heads in submission to divine providence... let us also thank god... for the years that he gave us inspiration... through his servant, john f. kennedy.
and to honor his memory and the future of the works that he started...
i have today determined that station number one... of the atlantic missile range... and the nasa launch operation center in florida... shall hereafter be known as the john f. kennedy space center.
if there is a word that expresses the washington reaction... to the russian space spectacular today, the word is admiration.
the gemini capsule would certainly be equipped to perform the same type--
on the fourth flight, which could come late this year... one of the american pilots will step outside.
i'd be happy to pass this along to the pubic affairs office.
when i told the kids astronaut elliott see was coming, they all said, "who?"
with such a suit, why, anyone could take a walk in space... or even a walk on the moon.
there you are, snug as a bug in a rug-- for a penguin, i mean.
i don't know exactly where we are, but it looks like we're... back over texas again.
as a matter of fact, yeah, that looks a lot like houston down there.
just last december, borman and lovell in gemini 7 were met in orbit... by tom stafford and wally schirra of gemini 6.
but what they didn't do was literally link up or dock.
american astronauts elliott see and charles bassett... have died in a crash of their t-38 jet aircraft.
the gemini astronauts were flying to lambert field... to inspect their space capsule at the mcdonnell aircraft corporation... when the plane carrying the two astronauts... smashed into the roof of the assembly plant.
two astronauts who hadn't even been in space yet are dead.
you don't think congress is gonna ask me how something' like that happened?
they'll slow us down, cancel missions, just so they can look good.
this is the first time a backup crew is going to be going into space.
if see and bassett had been killed during an actual space mission?
congress would shut nasa down and russia gets to the moon in a cakewalk.
gemini 8, c.s.q. how much rcs have you used and are you just on one ring?
we are on one ring, trying to save the other ring.
we have achieved orbital rendezvous of two spacecraft... and the docking of two vehicles in orbit.
these are not only firsts in their own right... but important steps to our long-range goal... of landing on the moon with the apollo program.
landing the first man on the moon is the priority of nasa... and the american taxpayers who are footing the bill.
i do not see their support wavering until we do so.
will the united states put the first man on the moon?
it is my job and the job of 400,000 men and women around the country... to see to it that we do.
using an 8-power sexton and charts... developed in the case of just such a malfunction...
aldrin guided commander jim lovell to a successful rendezvous and docking... with the agena target vehicle.
this was an important moment for nasa... as it proves the skills honed during the 10 gemini missions... can overcome potentially catastrophic problems... problems that could arise on a flight as crammed as gemini 12.
in four days, the crew is expected to dock... twice more with the agena... using its rocket engine... to send them into an even higher orbit around the earth.
the "d" mission will be the first dual flight of the c.s.m.... with the lunar module in low earth orbit to test it out.
the "e" mission will do the same in high earth orbit for reentry procedures.
the "f" mission will go all the way to lunar orbit with the lem but won't land.
that will be the objective of whoever takes the first "g" mission.
now, each of these missions must be successfully completed... before we can move on to the next type of mission.
if we have problems with the rendezvous radar... or the backpacks or the retracting probe... we will go to a d-1 or a d-2 or even a d-3 mission... before we attempt the first "e" mission.
so, even though there are only five manned missions laid out... it does not necessarily mean that the fifth group... will make the first landing... which brings me to the point of this meeting.
assembled here are those of you that are left... from the original seven mercury astronauts... as well as the new nine or the next nine... or whatever you guys call yourselves... and some of the third group.
even for the very first apollo mission... the plugs out test was routine and hardly considered hazardous.
for astronauts gus grissom, ed white and roger chaffee... it was supposed to be just another long afternoon... spent on their backs inside the apollo 1 command module.
we could fit one person across the cabin underneath the foot rail.
whichever one of us is going in there... we'll be able to hear what you fellas are hearing.
it's another to die on the pad during a routine goddamn test.
senator mondale's thoughts are with the families... of these three brave americans.
they'll be reporting to dr. robert van dolah... of the bureau of mines explosives research center.
i want you to head up the panel... responsible for dismantling the spacecraft.
you pull a lever and bam, you're outta there in a second.
remember when gus' capsule sank... and everyone said he must have blown the hatch by accident?
first off, i want to thank stormy and joe for coming to talk to us.
we're going to be writing this report in the next three weeks... and we have some questions for you that might help us clear some things up.
when we find the person responsible... we're going to make our displeasure known in the strongest possible way.
but we all know that that wrench... had absolutely nothing to do with the fire.
a number of people have told me gus wasn't happy with north american.
when he made suggestions or had complaints... he didn't think he was being listened to.
you wanna tell them the real reason for the wiring problems?
how nasa keeps changing mission requirements... yet you push us to meet these arbitrary deadlines.
but put a little on your pen and on the bulkhead and, presto.
then maybe there's just a few too many bits of it in there.
i think it's time you and your friends at nasa took a remedial math course.
in space, the cabin was supposed to contain... five pounds per square inch of pure oxygen, right?
that means that in order to simulate... the positive pressure of space flight, you had to add some p.s.i.
you guys tanked up that spacecraft... with almost 17 pounds per square inch of pure oxygen.
because of the severity of the fire damage in this part of the spacecraft... we'll never know for certain how the fire started.
our best guess is... that a wire was resting against the inside of this panel door here.
after the door opened and shut a few times... the teflon insulation became abraded in two spots.
when the current went through the wire, there was an arc and--
i don't want you to think that this reflects on what i think of you.
i honestly feel you're the most valuable man in nasa today.
i cannot understand with all those people... how a socket wrench could have gone undetected in the capsule... from october until january 27.
you're saying it was not because nasa was in a hurry.
sir, i have not found anyone at north american or nasa... who would not give anything they had to prevent what happened.
but there was negligence on the part of north american... was there not?
you really think frank borman is gonna paint a rosy picture?
it could have been him in that spacecraft and he knows it.
and if getting what i want means we don't go to the moon... then so be it.
colonel borman, would you have entered the spacecraft... on the morning of the accident if your turn had been called?
if you had entered the spacecraft on that morning... would you have been motivated by a desire to take risks?
sometimes there are... romantic, silk-scarfed notions attributed to this business... but we're professionals.
knowing what you know now... would you have entered that spacecraft?
how did commander grissom and his crew... feel about the readiness of the vehicle?
there are no front windows on the house he built for betty in timber cove... because he didn't want people looking in.
if that gives you the impression that gus was a cranky s.o.b.... well, he was at times.
as you all know, ed was the first american to walk in space.
there was a story going around... that when he was on his space walk, he stayed out after being ordered in... because he was having such a good time.
none of the bigwigs escorted through there ever talked to these guys.
but roger made them feel like the most important part of the program.
this isn't a court of law, so i can ask you something... that's completely hypothetical.
if we could somehow reach beyond the wall of death... and talk to grissom, white and chaffee... what do you imagine they would say about the fire?
i can only tell you what we know, or at least what we think we know.
when it happened they were waiting... for the test to resume.
they wouldn't have seen the spark that started the fire... because it was behind a panel door... down below gus' feet.
because of the oxygen, the spark was able to jump out... into the nylon netting under the seats.
no one ever imagined that it would happen on the ground.
if anyone had, the test would have been classified as hazardous.
now before we all go home... is there any statement you personally would like to make?
i think i'm safe in speaking for all the astronauts when i say that... we're confident in our management... we're confident in our training... in our engineering and in ourselves.
i talked to some upi reporters a couple of weeks before the fire.
i said to them i believed some kind of accident was probably inevitable.
i also said i thought it would be harder on those of us on the ground.
the astronauts are dead, god rest them... but we have to live with the knowledge we could have done something different.
why is it every time i say that people assume i mean i wish i were dead?
the fire started on the left side... below gus' feet, right?
i figure i had a 50-50 chance of putting it out before it got out of control.
my years in flight test, i saw a number of crews... slam into the desert floor.
the guys knew you would never get into space because of your heart problem... but they wanted you to know they considered you... as much of an astronaut as any of them.
they were gonna give that to you when they got back.
the crew is wearing full pressure suits... locked inside the hatch... confirming that the spacecraft can operate under its own power... with all the umbilical plugs connecting it to the ground removed.
even for the very first apollo mission... the plugs out test was routine and hardly considered hazardous.
for astronauts gus grissom, ed white and roger chaffee... it was supposed to be just another long afternoon... spent on their backs inside the apollo 1 command module.
another test of the complicated vehicle... that would someday perhaps take all three of them... on a voyage from the earth to the moon.
we could fit one person across the cabin underneath the foot rail.
whichever one of us is going in there... we'll be able to hear what you fellas are hearing.
it's another to die on the pad during a routine goddamn test.

my years in flight test, i saw a number of crews... slam into the desert floor.
the guys knew you would never get into space because of your heart problem... but they wanted you to know they considered you... as much of an astronaut as any of them.
they were gonna give that to you when they got back.
the ampco corporation in lowell, massachusetts... employed about a dozen people, predominantly middle-aged women... to pump a special epoxy resin by hand with caulking guns... into 380,000 one-inch-square holes... in the ablative heat shield of the apollo command module.
if x-ray inspection showed a bubble in one of the cells... they cleaned it out with a dental drill and tried again... for their product had to work perfectly for all of six minutes... during the fiery re-entry of the spacecraft... into the earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission.
anything less than perfection could mean the death of the crew.
it was up to these employees at ampco corporation... and hundreds of thousands like them at other companies... in almost every state of the union to deliver without fail... the goods that would make possible a voyage from the earth to the moon.
i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal... of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
we recognize there are unknowns... and things can happen that we haven't planned for.
capt. walter schirra salutes his fallen comrade, virgil "gus" grissom... in the first of three services held for the crew of apollo 1... who tragically died during a routine test on a launch pad.
grissom and roger chaffee are being laid to rest... here at arlington cemetery.
i've known all the mercury astronauts since the beginning of the program.
would you say that schirra has lost that famous sense of humor on this mission ?
i think he's pretty calm about it, or seems to be.
i do know that he got a little hot... when the mission planners were suggesting that the astronauts... have all their hair shaved from head to toe.
i'd have to get a gold earring if i was gonna look like mr. clean.
seriously, i just hinted to them that if the danger... was such that my own hair was going to be a hazard... maybe i'd just as soon stay home.
did he tell you that he nearly got canned on his mercury flight... because he hurt himself water skiing ?
someone's gonna bring up that i got myself in the same kind of trouble... on mercury, but the difference is that that was a freak accident.
how have you two kept your marriage together for so long?
well, i think the reason we've been married for so long... is because wally's been away half the time.
don healy and i were like two roosters in a pit.
this is the most complicated machine i've ever seen, and i've seen plenty.
we did not need a bunch of spacemen runnin' roughshod over the plant.
i told him, "look, i'm a test pilot, i've got a degree in engineering...
wally and i went through what you might call a "process."
you see, a pilot depends on his guys on the line.
people ask what it's gonna be like... being cooped up in a phone booth with two guys for 11 days.
well, we've been in that thing for six months, and we've survived.
wally schirra put in a word for me after-when his crew came on board.
i don't know, but i've heard... they told him they'd give him anything to keep him happy.
we're gonna need everyone to be excellent if we're gonna pull this off.
if this mission is successful, you feel confident you'll be going to the moon ?
and on top of that... we have our doppler radar system, and we have some of the finest... meteorologists that the air force has to offer right here on our base.
ultimately, though... the most important tool available to us for predicting the local weather... is this window.
uh, don, can we have the next slide up, please ?
with the minor retrofitting we've just discussed... we should have little difficulty adapting... the block one couches to the block two mounts.
i mean, i know these systems here like the back of my hand.
so if anything were to happen, your crew would be ready... and, in fact, willing to step right in for wally and his crew.
okay, we're sitting here with walt cunningham... who is the lunar module pilot of apollo 7.
you're now less than 24 hours away from your first launch into space.
the start of apollo 7, one of the most critical milestones... since this country embarked on the road to the moon.
america last flew astronauts on the two-man flight of gemini 12... in november, 1966.
but nasa officials say they're still optimistic... that weather conditions will be within mission parameters.
if the wind speed should top 18 knots, however... the possibility of a hold on this count... becomes far more likely.
that's gotta be one of the most memorable moments of my life.
of the two dozen men who flew to the moon... twelve were veterans who'd flown in space before.
nineteen would never do so again, and three made the trip twice.
the average starting pay for an astronaut was less than $20,000 a year.
the wives of apollo enjoyed the perks... and handled the attention with varying degrees of success.
the tough task they faced was to cope... with an equal volume of stress as did their mates... making their time at nasa just as arduous... just as consuming, and just as adventurous... as if they themselves had made the voyage from the earth to the moon.
i can't lose my wedding ring on the way to the moon.
that could be tough to explain to the wife... unless she's had to take a bowel movement in zero-g as well.
get ready for some of the latest in fashion fun and styles-a-plenty... modeled by the most elite women in the world... representing the very best that america has to offer.
and here they are now, hardworking pioneers in their own right... the wives of america's astronauts!
mrs. elliot see is actually a marilyn... a civilian homemaker who takes her housewife duties to heart.
boy, is she gonna look sharp at the market... in this smart paprika ensemble with saffron blouse and matching lining.
and here is none other than mrs. james lovell junior-- or marilyn.
she shows her navy spirit today by testing out... a navy blue silk suit... with kicky red leather shoes.
okay, well, the long hours and the low pay don't change... but now you're married to the statue of liberty.
so everything you say, everything you do... reflects not only on you but on your husband.
i think the most important thing is to take care of the home front... and that man of yours, and don't burden him with anything.
any problem at home could jeopardize his place in the flight line.
mrs. james mcdivitt and mrs. ed white... dressed here in matching silk alaskatine double-breasted coats.
their matching dresses with egyptian beaded collars of silver and gold... prove that these two women have casual elegance...
well, hell, i'd be happy with a trip to the white house.
he is never gonna get to go to the white house.
next up, susan borman... perfect and pretty in this french rose pink swing coat... and matching front-pleated skirt with an empire waistline.
the wife of frank borman has many demands placed on her... and looking good is just one of 'em.
i'll call you sometime tonight and fill you in on what i can.
they sure don't waste any time gettin' you to the cape.
i don't know what i did to deserve this attention, other than marry a pilot.
but a pilot's wife is what i am... and i'm glad i can support him in doing what he loves.
i do agree that the exploration of space that he and others are working toward... is a great thing for this country and the world.
it's an endeavor that is worth all the risks that they have to face each day... as great as those risks have proven to be.
even if my husband had not flown the first mission to the moon and back...
i would be proud to say that i did my part to support the program.
pat, why don't you just stay in the house you're in?
because i can't stand this town anymore... and i can't stay in that house.
before we go on another second, special attention needs to be paid--
their husbands have the courage to go to the moon... but i think the wife of thomas stafford... may need a boost from the audience to get her from backstage.
so why don't we all have it up for faye stafford?
and here she comes, ladies and gentlemen, faye stafford... wearing this nutmeg silk three-piece... with a restrained touch of rhinestones at the jacket's belting... adding just the right touch of brilliance.
you are smart, 'cause you are getting out of here with your marriage intact.
and, boy, i wish i could say the same for the rest of us... but, you know.
i'm in love with one of your astronauts, and he loves me.
am i just bein' naive, or will he ever leave his wife?"
and every day i had to decide what part of your life...
i was going to tell you about... and what part of your life i was gonna keep from you.
the great adventure of going to the moon may never happen again in our life.
manned space flight will continue... and there is adventure to be found in high earth orbit.
there is a brand of adventure to be had... in such a long-distance mode of human participation.
but the satisfaction and the sudden emptiness of an adventure completed... are intangible human concepts.
there i am again, five very heady days later... aboard our recovery ship where they set up a quarantine trailer... for me and my two crewmates:
pete conrad, my skipper... and dick gordon, our command module pilot.
maybe we weren't dignified enough to be heroes. lt wouldn't matter.
'cause we were the second mission to land on the moon.
i got three fuel cell lights, an a/c bus light, a fuel cell disconnect...
a/c bus overload 1 and 2, main bus a and b out.
so i had done my part to help out in a crisis.
of course, we owe a lot to that eecom fella, john aaron.
i'll bet they did when they heard you call about 18 lights.
every time i close my eyes, all i see are those damn lights.
not everybody was thinking about how al bean was enjoying the mission.
in houston, unbeknownst to us, there was serious concern... that the lightning had damaged our pyrotechnic system... that would deploy our parachutes.
fortunately, at this point, we had time to debate such issues.
i'm sure you're dying to know how it all turned out.
here's where my bad luck with the tv cameras comes in.
the color camera aboard apollo 12 is a substantial improvement... over the black-and-white unit neil armstrong and buzz aldrin had... at the sea of tranquility.
this would have worked out great had i not accidentally done something... that i wasn't supposed to do.
in all our months of training, we never had the actual camera.
i knew where i was supposed to put it and where the sun would be.
someone probably told me to keep the lens shaded or something.
press on and we'll try to get back to it later if we have time.
houston, let me move it around so the back is to the sun.
it's hard to get a tv repairman to make a house call in anytown, usa... and impossible, of course, on the moon.
the vidicon tube was fried beyond repair... so that was the end of color tv from the ocean of storms.
not even dick, who was stuck in orbit while we explored the surface.
i felt bad about that... but flying solo in yankee clipper was considered more important... than being the commander's sidekick on the moon.
he was holding out to walk on the moon on apollo 18.
unfortunately, there never was an apollo 18... so this was as close as he ever got.
unlike neil and buzz... our mission called for us not just to land wherever the ground looked good.
on 11, they were lucky to land almost three miles from where they had planned.
by all the numbers and delta vectors and crater sightings... it looked like we were right where we wanted to be.
but it wasn't until dick made a flyover pass... that we found out how good a job pete had done bringing us down.
with the help of the targeting people on the ground... he had proven that pinpoint accuracy was possible when landing on the moon.
he had set down our lunar module a stone's throw away... from our primary mission objective--
a short moon walk of about 200 yards-- just like he said he would.
not long after that... sometime very early in the morning back in houston...
when you are selected to become a member of the astronaut corps... you wear a special silver pin.
it gets replaced by a gold pin when you actually fly a mission.
i joined nasa in the third group of 14 astronauts in 1963.
so did dick gordon who flew with pete in gemini 11.
while he and the rest of the group were jockeying for seats... on lunar landing flights...
i was assigned to the apollo applications program... the space station which came to be known as skylab.
charlie basset died along with elliot see... when elliot crashed into a building at the mcdonnell plant in st. louis.
roger chaffee was on the crew of apollo 1... killed in the fire with gus grissom and ed white.
he had spent the night before our astronaut physicals... jumping up and down to compress his spine.
there was a six-foot height limit, and c.c. was a shade over six feet even.
he was a superb astronaut who impressed everyone he met... but c.c. was killed when his t-38... went into a spin over the swamps of tallahassee.
he had been cruising at 24,000 feet when his controls locked... and the plane went into a steep dive.
once on the moon, i had little time to think about such things.
i heard once the real cost of us being there... was about a million dollars for each minute.
tell them it's important to keep the experiments free of dust.
dr. wilson asks you guys not to forget... to keep the connectors and experiments free of dust.
you did not copy all of that pad. ls that affirm?
ed, if you want to talk to me, you'll have to take it off relay... so pete and al won't cut you out.
both of us had drafted a checklist to wear on our sleeves... but the actual flight item was made up by the ground crew just before launch... and put in our suits without our even seeing them... until we were on the moon.
thanks to dave scott and the rest of our backup crew... we had a little extra reading to do.
pete and i got up our first load of moon rocks.
we dusted each other off, then i started back up the ladder.
i know we're all human and we mess up... but i sure felt bad about it.
i seem to be a bit more sensitive about such things than my colleagues.
we were the most close-knit of any crew that ever flew.
pete even got us matching gold corvettes... customized for our positions on the crew:
i probably should have taken a sleeping pill, but that wasn't manly.
finally, i was able to put work aside... allow myself a moment of peace, a moment of calm.
in 1967, surveyor's tv camera had broadcast... the first-ever television pictures from the surface of the moon.
we aimed to take that camera home... so they could study the long-term effects of the moon... on manmade machines.
neil and buzz's ascent had knocked the crap out of their flag.
they could send a man to the moon, but they couldn't think... to place the flag 50 feet away from a rocket engine... so it wouldn't get blown over.
we're all set to jettison the lem in about a minute.
you know, if we were to lose the hatch... when we blow the lem... and one day someone was to find us floating around up here like this... they might be pretty confused.
falling through the sky after a trip to the moon... is no more surreal an experience than getting there in the first place... or walking on its surface.
it's just one more step, one more planned event... that comes about because of science and imagination and effort.
you can go through all the manuals... all the procedures and checklists... all the graphs and blueprints that show how it's possible to do what we did... to go where we had gone.
you might be impressed that such a complicated thing was even attempted.
i don't think i'll ever forget... when all that good stuff was lighting up... and then capcom called up sce to auxiliary.
i didn't know what the hell that meant... and you were awfully quiet, i might add.
all i hear is al bean's voice, two octaves higher than normal... saying, "i know what it is."
the best record of what it was like to have gone to the moon and return... is not in the tangible evidence of the endeavor.
they mix together in a constant stream... of thoughts and images that come and go... like all memories do.
the most precious things i brought back with me... were the same things i left with:
the ampco corporation in lowell, massachusetts... employed about a dozen people, predominantly middle-aged women... to pump a special epoxy resin by hand with caulking guns... into 380,000 one-inch-square holes... in the ablative heat shield of the apollo command module.
if x-ray inspection showed a bubble in one of the cells... they cleaned it out with a dental drill and tried again... for their product had to work perfectly for all of six minutes... during the fiery reentry of the spacecraft... into the earth's atmosphere at the end of the mission.
anything less than perfection could mean the death of the crew.
it was up to these employees at ampco corporation... and hundreds of thousands like them at other companies... in almost every state of the union to deliver without fail... the goods that would make possible a voyage from the earth to the moon.
i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal... of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
we recognize there are unknowns... and things can happen that we haven't planned for.
capt. walter schirra salutes his fallen comrade, virgil "gus" grissom... in the first of three services held for the crew of apollo 1... who tragically died during a routine test on a launch pad.
grissom and roger chaffee are being laid to rest... here at arlington cemetery.
would you say that schirra has lost that famous sense of humor on this mission?
well, everyone gets a little nervous before one of these things.
i think he's pretty calm about it, or seems to be.
i do know that he got a little hot... when the mission planners were suggesting that the astronauts... have all their hair shaved from head to toe.
i'd have to get a gold earring if i was gonna look like mr. clean.
seriously, i just hinted to them that if the danger... was such that my own hair was going to be a hazard... maybe i'd just as soon stay home.
did he tell you that he nearly got canned on his mercury flight... because he hurt himself water skiing?
someone's gonna bring up that i got myself in the same kind of trouble... on mercury, but the difference is that that was a freak accident.
how have you two kept your marriage together for so long?
well, i think the reason we've been married for so long... is because wally's been away half the time.
don healy and i were like two roosters in a pit.
this is the most complicated machine i've ever seen, and i've seen plenty.
we did not need a bunch of spacemen runnin' roughshod over the plant.
i told him, "look, i'm a test pilot, i've got a degree in engineering...
wally and i went through what you might call a "process."
you see, a pilot depends on his guys on the line.
people ask what it's gonna be like... being cooped up in a phone booth with two guys for 11 days.
well, we've been in that thing for six months, and we've survived.
wally schirra put in a word for me after-- when his crew came on board.
i don't know, but i've heard... they told him they'd give him anything to keep him happy.
we're gonna need everyone to be excellent if we're gonna pull this off.
if this mission is successful, you feel confident you'll be going to the moon?
and on top of that... we have our doppler radar system, and we have some of the finest... meteorologists that the air force has to offer right here on our base.
ultimately, though... the most important tool available to us for predicting the local weather... is this window.
i mean, i know these systems here like the back of my hand.
so if anything were to happen, your crew would be ready... and, in fact, willing to step right in for wally and his crew.
okay, we're sitting here with walt cunningham... who is the lunar module pilot of apollo 7.
you're now less than 24 hours away from your first launch into space.
mr. jimenez, could you tell us... what's the most important thing in rocket travel?
to me, the most important thing in rocket travel... is the blastoff.
america last flew astronauts on the two-man flight of gemini 12... in november, 1966.
it was to be followed in february of 1967... by the first three-man apollo flight.
standing there on pad 34, ready to blast off into space... the saturn 1b is potentially far more dangerous... than anything imaginable.
an explosion or the sudden, uncontrolled burning... of its 565 tons of liquid fuels... and oxidizers would almost surely destroy... everything on the pad, including the apollo spacecraft and its crew.
we seem to be experiencing some fairly strong winds here at the cape.
but nasa officials say they're still optimistic... that weather conditions will be within mission parameters.
he had to develop special wax models so he could study the lighting effects... to be duplicated in the frescoes... and come up with a special slow-drying plaster.
he suffered constant deadline pressure from frustrated church officials... and the pope, who just wanted the ceiling finished.
the work itself was uncomfortable and unending... with wet paint and plaster dripping in the face of the man... who was not, after all, a painter, but a sculptor.
such challenges arise in all the great works of human imagination... be they the creation of our world rendered upon... the ceiling of a church... or the view of our world evident by making the voyage... from the earth to the moon.
wernher von braun briefed the head of the national advisory committee.
he presented the two best options for going to the moon.
we put the pieces together in orbit... and off we go.
these two methods... these are the only ways of getting to moon?
you send up some ships to the moon... with all the extra fuel and supplies to get back.
that way, when the astronauts arrive... everything they need to get home is already there.
it looked like either earth orbit rendezvous... or direct ascent would be the way to go.
either way we go... the spacecraft that lands on the moon is going to look like that.
at chance vought industries in texas... an engineer named tom dolan hit upon an interesting idea.
you ever hear of a russian rocket guy named yuri kondratyuk?
in 1916 he realized something we seem to have forgotten today.
gettin' to the moon is going to be all about weight.
it's a little risky, but it could save a lot of weight.
i don't think there's a chance in hell... that lunar orbit rendezvous is the way we're gonna go... but it is interesting.
i'm afraid you're gonna have to tell your wives and kids the bad news.
you won't be seeing much of them for the next couple years... because we got the contract.
but the rubber balls you're gonna have to pay for yourself.
you know, if weight wasn't a factor, we'd have this thing done in a year.
we're gonna go with just the one docking hatch up top... and use a forward hatch for egress.
that means when they return they'll have to rendezvous and dock blind.
we had to know how a lem would react... when exposed to intense sunlight or when pelted with dust.
we had to know how the landing gear would perform coming down on a slope.
the descent stage... contains the engine that astronauts will use to control their landing.
after the moonwalks, the descent stage will serve as a launch platform... for the ascent stage...
lem 1 and 2 were designed and built for unmanned test flights.
lem 3 would be the first to be flown in space by astronauts.
we worked hand in hand with the astronauts... from the beginning of lem program.
they showed us what we were doing right... and what we were doing wrong.
from early on much of their attention was given to lem 3.
but it wasn't until a day in november, 1966... that nasa decided which crew would be the one to actually fly her.
first i pop the thruster, see if the lem can fly.
if it can, rusty and i fire the descent engine, take her on its maiden voyage.
the hardest part of getting the first lems to fly... was getting the thousands of systems and subsystems to work together.
most of the time it was like having a ballroom full of dancers... dancing different steps to music that wasn't quite right for any of them.
you know, this is so bad i can't even joke about it.
perhaps the main reason we were behind schedule and over budget... was because budgets and schedules are based on previous experience... with similar projects.
we didn't know how much it'd cost to build the lems or how long it'd take.
all we really knew was how much time we'd been given... and that was running out.
in june, 1968 it was decided... that we'd ship lem 3 to nasa as she was and finish the work at the cape.
you know, i don't know what i'm so worked up about.
remember when this whole thing was only gonna cost 500 million?
you know, i can't even remember when it was gonna cost a billion.
unfortunately, moving lem 3 to the cape... did little to ease the pressure we were under.
tom, there's still at least a hundred things wrong with it.
in the fall of 1968 while work continued on lem 3... the apollo program finally got off the ground.
on october 11, just a few miles... from where lem 3 was being fine-tuned...
all that time, lem 3 was being worked on around the clock.
by february 1969, george and the rest of the grumman crew... had tested every circuit and tightened every bolt.
now as far as lem 3 was concerned... that should have been it for me.
i should've been able to sit back in the span room in houston watch the show.
i tried to imagine what it was like in lem 3 just then.
astronauts have said that sitting in the command module during a countdown... can be almost peaceful.
for the next ten minutes it must have been... like lem 3 was stuck in a paint mixer in a hardware store.
and when it must have seemed the shaking would never stop, it did.
i just don't think it's safe for you to do it.
i don't think we can put you in a pressurized suit... if it looks like you're gonna throw up.
but if rusty didn't test the backpack... the lem couldn't undock from the command module.
when jim cancelled the e.v.a. we all understood... but we were devastated.
houston, if some of our friends from grumman are listening in...
i suggest on the next lem they give an extra go with a vacuum cleaner.
the only reason it was even a question is i didn't want you to kill yourself.
and i'll try not to for the rest of the mission.
when i said good-bye to lem 3, i felt like a proud parent... watching a child go off to college.
as i say good-bye to this lem, i feel like a parent of centuries past... saying farewell as his child embarks for the new world.
to some people, that might sound like i'm stretching the point.
a lem is not a child, it's a machine... and a machine doesn't have a soul.
apollo 11 might never have happened... were it not for three very specific people.
you've probably never heard of sergei korolyov... but without him the soviet union might never have put a man into space... nor stirred the competitive juices of his american counterparts.
wernher von braun was the german rocket scientist... who turned the weapons of world war two... into the giant saturn boosters of the space race 20 years later.
john f. kennedy brashly vowed to send a man to the moon and return him safely... long before it was known to be possible.
i can't go on the air without puttin' on my tie.
we'll be on the air from the moment you cross through the equigravisphere... right up through the big moment.
if everything goes according to plan... an event will take place today... that will forever mark the 20th day of the seventh month of the year.
i can guarantee that you'll remember this day... where you are and what you are doing.
it's a groovy trip, but there are more important things to do first.
it will be a revelation to all mankind... that the universe and the creation... is so much greater than anybody ever realized.
p-64... will commence... pitching the lem forward from face up to about 30 degrees from vertical... allowing armstrong and aldrin to see the lunar surface.
as they approach the landing site the most crucial information will be... altitude, rate of descent, horizontal velocity... and propellant remaining.
if they get below about 80 seconds of fuel remaining... the "quantity" light will illuminate.
at that point they've got 60 seconds to decide whether or not to land... leaving them 20 seconds of fuel... to either get down or level off their descent and abort.
at six feet, if all goes well... probes extending from the landing gear will touch the surface... and they will get the "contact" light.
armstrong will then shut off the descent engine and they will drop... gently to the surface... and mankind will never be the same again, blah, blah, blah.
for the next three months... we will do everything in our power to see that these men land safely... which means, for the next three months we must do everything in our power... to kill them.
so, how many times have you "killed" the crew of apollo 11?
i understand the crew kept training in the simulators up to the last minutes.
armstrong and aldrin were in the simulator at the cape... right up till the day before the launch.
but the point is, being the first to do it... you don't know exactly what's gonna happen.
i mean, how do you physically train for such a thing?
you've lifted off, flown to the moon... without biting your tongue.
you're finally climbing down the eagle's ladder... about to set foot on the moon.
it'll be my job to see to it that the lem is a healthy machine... all systems are running smoothly, feeding neil the data he needs.
if anything requires a special course of action, i will take that action.
you're also gonna be the second man to walk on the face of the moon.
but, shoot, buzz, wouldn't you like to be the guy that gets out first?
i've been reviewing the flight plan... both the current one and last year's, as well as the gemini flight plans... and there's something i think could bear some scrutiny as we head into the sims.
neil, it's this question about which one of us should get out first.
but i'm afraid he's so consumed by the physical task of landing...
i don't know how much attention he's prepared to give to the larger issue... of what we're doing and what it means to the world.
some measure of attention should be paid to the meaning of the task... by whichever one of us takes that first step.
since the mission parameters are still in the planning stage... and the order of the crew egress is yet to be determined...
nobody likes to dwell on such things... but that is one of the scenarios that we practice in flight simulation.
well, in fact, all three of you... train constantly for things going wrong, don't you?
they've given us lots of time after we land to fix any problems we have... but they've scheduled a four-hour rest period before we do the e.v.a.
what do you say we move the rest period till after the e.v.a.?
because going to the moon... is larger than us as individuals.
the earth represents, well, everyone... because the mission is bigger than nations... or politics.
neil armstrong, michael collins and buzz aldrin are mortal men... and yet their talents, their disciplines and their choices... have placed them here, in the third week of july, 1969... at a place and time unique in the cosmos.
these three men are on their way to a distant place... where no man has gone before.
with them go our dreams, our desires and our good wishes... but not only for their safe passage in return.
we hope too for their efforts to signal a transformation of our common globe... into a braver, bolder, better world for us all.
among the large headlines concerning apollo this morning... there's one asking that you watch out for a lovely girl with a big rabbit.
an ancient chinese legend says that a beautiful girl named chongo... has been living up there for 4,000 years.
she was banished to the moon because she stole the pill for immortality... from her husband.
her companion, a large rabbit... should be standing on his hind feet under the shade of a cinnamon tree.
we got a bunch of guys about to turn blue, but we're breathing again.
be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world.
this is one of the most thrilling moments of my life i guarantee you.
the great adventure of going to the moon may never happen again in our life.
but the satisfaction and the sudden emptiness of an adventure completed... are intangible human concepts.
the argument can be made that mankind cannot bear witness to an event... unless one of mankind has experienced the adventure firsthand.
that's me, standing in the ocean of storms on november 21, 1969.
there i am again, five very heady days later... aboard our recovery ship where they set up a quarantine trailer... for me and my two crewmates:
pete conrad, my skipper... and dick gordon, our command module pilot.
they were gemini veterans who are about as cool as they come.
i would be forever known as the fourth man to set foot on the lunar surface.
pete and dick wanted to be on the first landing... but i'd have been happy to be on the 93rd.
i was supposed to remove it and put it under my seat... like it said on the checklist.
i guess i was so happy the parachutes had worked that i said...
i got three fuel cell lights, an a/c bus light, a fuel cell disconnect...
a/c bus overload 1 and 2, main bus a and b out.
so i had done my part to help out in a crisis.
of course, we owe a lot to that eecom fella, john aaron.
i'll bet they did when they heard you call about 18 lights.
every time i close my eyes, all i see are those damn lights.
not everybody was thinking about how al bean was enjoying the mission.
in houston, unbeknownst to us, there was serious concern... that the lightning had damaged our pyrotechnic system... that would deploy our parachutes.
fortunately, at this point, we had time to debate such issues.
i'm sure you're dying to know how it all turned out.
here's where my bad luck with the tv cameras comes in.
the color camera aboard apollo 12 is a substantial improvement... over the black-and-white unit neil armstrong and buzz aldrin had... at the sea of tranquility.
this would have worked out great had i not accidentally done something... that i wasn't supposed to do.
in all our months of training, we never had the actual camera.
i knew where i was supposed to put it and where the sun would be.
someone probably told me to keep the lens shaded or something.
press on and we'll try to get back to it later if we have time.
houston, let me move it around so the back is to the sun.
it's hard to get a tv repairman to make a house call in anytown, usa... and impossible, of course, on the moon.
the vidicon tube was fried beyond repair... so that was the end of color tv from the ocean of storms.
not even dick, who was stuck in orbit while we explored the surface.
i felt bad about that... but flying solo in yankee clipper was considered more important... than being the commander's sidekick on the moon.
he was holding out to walk on the moon on apollo 18.
unfortunately, there never was an apollo 18... so this was as close as he ever got.

he had set down our lunar module a stone's throw away... from our primary mission objective...
a short moon walk of about 200 yards... just like he said he would.
not long after that... sometime very early in the morning back in houston...
i had a special moment for myself to mark my getting to the moon.
when you are selected to become a member of the astronaut corps... you wear a special silver pin.
being selected for apollo 12, i wouldn't be needing it anymore.
i wanted to put it in a special place where it would rest forever.
so did dick gordon who flew with pete in gemini 11.
while he and the rest of the group were jockeying for seats... on lunar landing flights...
planning things so far in the future... who knew if they'd ever become a reality or not.
while i was tucked away in some far-off corner... it seemed everyone else was assigned mission after mission.
but there were others from our group that were not so fortunate.
ted freeman was flying his t-38 at a couple hundred miles per hour... when a goose smashed in the plexiglas of his cockpit.
he was supposed to be the original lunar module pilot on apollo 12... along with pete and dick.
he had spent the night before our astronaut physicals... jumping up and down to compress his spine.
there was a six-foot height limit, and c.c. was a shade over six feet even.
he was a superb astronaut who impressed everyone he met... but c.c. was killed when his t-38... went into a spin over the swamps of tallahassee.
it was such a shock... it took some time to really sink in.
once on the moon, i had little time to think about such things.
i heard once the real cost of us being there... was about a million dollars for each minute.
pete and i did our best to stretch every penny of america's money.
both of us had drafted a checklist to wear on our sleeves... but the actual flight item was made up by the ground crew just before launch... and put in our suits without our even seeing them... until we were on the moon.
thanks to dave scott and the rest of our backup crew... we had a little extra reading to do.
pete and i got up our first load of moon rocks.
we dusted each other off, then i started back up the ladder.
i know we're all human and we mess up... but i sure felt bad about it.
i seem to be a bit more sensitive about such things than my colleagues.
we were the most close-knit of any crew that ever flew.
pete even got us matching gold corvettes... customized for our positions on the crew:
i probably should have taken a sleeping pill, but that wasn't manly.
finally, i was able to put work aside... allow myself a moment of peace, a moment of calm.
all the photographs from apollo 11 were of buzz taken by neil... one astronaut with maybe the other guy reflected in his visor.
we had the idea to use this timer... and get both me and pete in the picture... and not tell anyone about it until the film was developed.
the trick was finding the right moment so houston wouldn't catch on.
by the time we made it to the surveyor... we had less than an hour left outside in the ocean of storms.
let's mosey down there and grab what we came here for.
in 1967, surveyor's tv camera had broadcast... the first-ever television pictures from the surface of the moon.
we aimed to take that camera home... so they could study the long-term effects of the moon... on manmade machines.
getting it would mean we had completed all of our mission objectives.
we're all set to jettison the lem in about a minute.
you know, if we were to lose the hatch... when we blow the lem... and one day someone was to find us floating around up here like this... they might be pretty confused.
falling through the sky after a trip to the moon... is no more surreal an experience than getting there in the first place... or walking on its surface.
it's just one more step, one more planned event... that comes about because of science and imagination and effort.
you can go through all the manuals... all the procedures and checklists... all the graphs and blueprints that show how it's possible to do what we did... to go where we had gone.
you might be impressed that such a complicated thing was even attempted.
i don't think i'll ever forget... when all that good stuff was lighting up... and then capcom called up sce to auxiliary.
i didn't know what the hell that meant... and you were awfully quiet, i might add.
all i hear is al bean's voice, two octaves higher than normal... saying, "i know what it is."
the best record of what it was like to have gone to the moon and return... is not in the tangible evidence of the endeavor.
they mix together in a constant stream... of thoughts and images that come and go... like all memories do.
the most precious things i brought back with me... were the same things i left with:
moments after the end of the tv show, an explosion occurred... which put the lives of the crew in danger... and made it impossible for any further pictures to be seen back home.
the remaining dramatic days of the flight played themselves out... by way of only the faint radio voices of the crew... the sketchy telemetry data from the crippled spacecraft... and the reports from the media that suddenly found itself... as blind to the events as the rest of the world... a world which had become bored with tv shows from outer space.
i can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye.
so far, though, the moon looks pretty gray with some white spots.
13, houston, we're water critical in the lem... so we'd like to use as little as possible.
we'd like to make a free return maneuver of a 16-foot-per-second burn... in about 37 minutes.
people, we'll try to move this along as quickly as possible... because, obviously, we have matters to attend to in mission control.
i assume that deke slayton, chris kraft... and colonel james mcdivitt need no introduction.
unless we know what you know when you know it, we'll start getting paranoid.
we'll have a press pool of two... one print, one broadcast, rotated every two hours... in the visitors' gallery where they can monitor the flight director's loop.
who signed up to be historic figures courtesy of the u.s. taxpayer.
nobody put a gun to their head and made them do this.
i'm in a bind, and i wanted to know if i can use your telephone?
my mom told me to keep the reporters off our property.
suggest you just read off the circuit breakers... you want us to power down, as you did yesterday for us.
we have a procedure ready to send up to you here in about two minutes.
first of all, i would not characterize it a "nuke problem."
all i know is lem's got a nuclear reactor on board.
apparently, the aec doesn't think it makes for good public relations... to bring home radioactive material.
look, this battery is encased to survive a collision... or explosion without contaminating anything.
do you agree with commander lovell's assessment that... this will be our last flight to the moon?
i'm sure we've all been in situations... where we've found ourselves under pressure... and we make a comment that we might have phrased differently... under other circumstances.
a few hundred yards from where i'm standing... over 1,000 journalists from 83 countries are monitoring every beat and tick... of this star-crossed mission.
but the untold story remains the excruciating toll... the last few days have had on the families... of these three very brave men.
the astronauts of apollo 13 face new uncertainties... as they prepare for tomorrow's fiery descent through the earth's atmosphere.
the first big test will come early tomorrow... when the crew brings odyssey's electrical systems...
in minimal impulse pings, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch... which is about where you are now... to 008 degrees in roll... which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude... and to zero degrees in yaw, which is about where you are now.
we'd like you to do the body access align 400 plus 5-400...
in about 20 minutes, at 7:23 houston time... the astronauts will jettison their crippled service module.
at 10:53, they will cast off the lunar lander... that has been their lifeboat ever since the power failed on the main ship... some 82 hours ago.
will the pyrotechnics that deploy the parachutes... needed to slow the capsule... from a fatal 300 miles an hour... to a gentle 20 for splashdown function properly?
we're getting word from brett hutchins that the astronauts... are about to jettison the service module.
apollo 13 presently 34,350 nautical miles out from the earth... traveling at a speed of 12,846 miles per hour.
meanwhile, in the mission control viewing room, the crowd is increasing.
stand by for a go on pyro arm and lem jettison.
the astronauts are about to jettison the lifeboat that has served them so well.
in four minutes, the leading edge of the command module... will bite into the atmosphere.
and, as the accelerating ship encounters the thickening air... friction will begin to build... generating temperatures of 4,000 degrees across the face of the heat shield.
if this energy generated by the infernal descent... were converted to electricity... it would equal 86,000 kilowatt hours... enough to light up los angeles for one and a half minutes.
if it were converted to kinetic energy... it could lift every man, woman and child ten inches off the ground.
if radio contact is restored at the end of this time, controllers will know... that the heat shield is intact... and the spacecraft did survive.
if not, they will know that the crew was consumed in flames.
a remarkable end to a four-day ordeal... as the astronauts streak homeward...
we still have to wait for the drogue chutes and the main parachutes.
he experienced only about four minutes of zero gravity... couldn't see where he was going because there was no forward-facing window... and he splashed down just 302 miles from where he had started.
those 15 minutes in the spring of 1961 were just a taste... of other longer flights america's first astronaut planned on making.
if you ask me, shepard's flight wasn't such a big deal, anyway.
just a few more guys to meet and greet, then it's all business.
we have a logging crew to check for hydrocarbons in the well... which gives us a rough idea of its potential.
they have a probe they'll be lowering down to take a look at...
i'd like to start... by introducing the prime crew for the first manned gemini flight... which will consist of virgil i. grissom, command pilot... and john w. young, second pilot.
as many of you may have surmised... the big element in the choice of gus grissom... for the command pilot of the prime crew is, of course, the fact...
i'm deke slayton, the only astronaut who's been in space... for less time than alan shepard.
alan shepard may only have flown in space for 15 minutes... but he's given this program seven years... of commitment and expertise.
believe me, i've been to my share of doctors with this thing.
the general consensus is that either it goes away on its own, or it doesn't.
so why don't we make you the command pilot for the next lunar landing?
guess he just stayed at the top of the rotation this whole time, huh?
how would it look if they gave me the flight, and something went wrong?
i'm much younger than alan shepard, and i'm in excellent physical condition.
go into that it was a rough comeback... and it seemed like you wouldn't make it, and you finally did.
and i'm gonna try to think of a question that hopefully will lead you into that.
it's been a long road back to flight status for al... made possible by an experimental ear surgery.
so tell me, given your medical history... limited space experience, would you have chosen yourself... to rescue the space program after the near-tragedy of apollo 13?
we get that during the descent, this turns into a bad day.
i don't know how quickly they can come up with it.
now, if the switch closes before you're done... and it aborts us... there's nothing we can do, right?
let's see if we can't get ahead of ourselves on that checklist.
if we set the program monitor to 71 before the burn... the computer is not even gonna look at the abort monitor... because it already thinks it's in the abort mode.
so there'll be a little bit of a cleanup on the descent... but they're not gonna be in a rush.
we've got more procedures to pump up that're gonna alter what you've copied.
we think we've found a little slicker way of doin' this... to make the computer ignore the abort command if the switch gets set again.
let me comment that it is a stark place... here at fra mauro.
it's made all the more stark by the fact that the sky is completely black.
while you're looking that up, you might recognize what i have in my hand... as the handle for the contingency sample return.
it just so happens to have a genuine six-iron on the bottom of it.
along with the physical demands made on those who fly into space... other more particular demands were made of the men who went to the moon.
they not only had to have the acumen of pilots and engineers... they also had to have knowledge and practice... as physicists, astronomers, geologists... and, if possible, as historians... and even poets and artists.
the reasons to demand such disciplines of the astronauts was simple...
you will find no better record of what it is like to be on the moon... than in the experiences and recollections... of the men who went there.
i think probably to break up a piece of clod underneath it.
or i guess you could probably lift that top fragment right off.
a thorough examination of its twinning will confirm this is plagioclace... thus producing a feldspathoid.
is this what you had to sit through for eight years?
doing field geology... is like solving the mystery of the dead cat.
if you bring me a dead cat, all i can tell you is it's dead, and it's a cat.
which is why we didn't have many dinner guests in our home.
but gosh, if granite gets made way down below... how the heck did it get here?
not just which rocks you plan to bring back... but their context.
that and knowing which ones to pick up in the first place... is what might separate you guys from those little robots.
you know, the ones some jaded soul thinks should have your job.
you see, you have to become our eyes and ears... out there.
and for you to do that... you first have to learn the language... of this little rock here.
ever since galileo and his telescope... the moon has been getting closer and closer.
or maybe the moon is more like a sister... formed alongside the earth... out of the same magical dust.
or perhaps... a big old stray asteroid made the mistake... of wandering a bit too close to our gravitational influence... and doomed itself to circle us for all eternity... like some faithful dog.
the apollo 15 mission as we know it has been scrubbed.
we're moving straight into the "j" missions... which, as you know, mean longer stays on the surface... an upgraded lem, better suits and backpacks... and ultimately more science.
so when we're confronted with a new survey site... what do we do?
we go to the highest place we can find... and figure out the big picture.
a bunch of layers on the far wall of the canyon.
to the right, there's a lot of dirt... with green stuff sloping down.
no, no, it's like... a huge breccia-like boulder... right in the side of the wall.
at my three o'clock, there's a... layer of rock about... one quarter up from the bottom of the wall.
superimposed over a variety of about 20 layers of light and dark material.
looking down at my eight o'clock, the range of mountains in the background.
now, then... we have a deadlock between marius hills on the one hand... and hadley rille in the appenine mountains on the other.
we have been barking over this bone for six months now... with absolutely no movement... or, i might add, accommodation.
marius hills presents an adequately unique site... for testing any of the genesis theories... and it seems a safer landing site.
dr. pemberton, the appenines, first of all... should be a great source of deeper and older... imbrium ejecta... and we may even find material there... from the original lunar crust.
because if you find this... you have probably found a piece of the moon's... primordial crust.
it would be a shame if it was up there... and we missed it.
i can see from up at the top of the rille down... there's debris all the way.
looks like some outcrops directly... at about eleven o'clock to the sun line.
i guess one of the reasons we got here today... was because of a gentleman named galileo a long time ago... who made a rather significant discovery... about falling objects and gravity fields.
we thought... where would be a better place to confirm his findings... than on the moon.
oh, you were with us, professor... every step of the way.
we went to the moon as trained observers in order to gather data... not only with our instruments onboard... but with our minds.
i'd like to quote a statement from plutarch... which i think expresses our feelings since we've come back.
"the mind is not a vessel to be filled... but a fire to be lighted."
of the two dozen men who flew to the moon... twelve were veterans who'd flown in space before.
nineteen would never do so again, and three made the trip twice.
the average starting pay for an astronaut was less than $20,000 a year.
and whereas they could purchase brand-new corvettes at dealer cost... no one would sell them life insurance.
ladies and gentlemen of the greater houston area... welcome to the fourth annual junior league winter cavalcade of fashion.
get ready for some of the latest in fashion fun and styles-a-plenty... modeled by the most elite women in the world... representing the very best that america has to offer.
and here they are now, hardworking pioneers in their own right... the wives of america's astronauts!
mrs. elliot see is actually a marilyn... a civilian homemaker who takes her housewife duties to heart.
mrs. james mcdivitt and mrs. ed white... dressed here in matching silk alaskatine double-breasted coats.
their matching dresses with egyptian beaded collars of silver and gold... prove that these two women have casual elegance...
john didn't get to go to paris after his gemini trip.
well, hell, i'd be happy with a trip to the white house.
well, he's happy to be flyin' with gus, but he was hopin' to be in command.
the chaffees are really nice, and this is a feather in roger's cap.
the wife of frank borman has many demands placed on her... and looking good is just one of 'em.
susan handles her duties with style and grace... as you can tell by this ideal blend... of practicality and design.
you and your brother behave yourselves and try to get some sleep.
and tell eric's mom that next week you guys spend the night over here, okay?
but a pilot's wife is what i am... and i'm glad i can support him in doing what he loves.
i do agree that the exploration of space that he and others are working toward... is a great thing for this country and the world.
it's an endeavor that is worth all the risks that they have to face each day... as great as those risks have proven to be.
even if my husband had not flown the first mission to the moon and back...
i would be proud to say that i did my part to support the program.
so, thank you for this award, and thank you for the lovely afternoon.
their husbands have the courage to go to the moon... but i think the wife of thomas stafford... may need a boost from the audience to get her from backstage.
so why don't we all have it up for faye stafford?
and here she comes, ladies and gentlemen, faye stafford... wearing this nutmeg silk three-piece... with a restrained touch of rhinestones at the jacket's belting... adding just the right touch of brilliance.
complemented by the fawn coq-feathered cloche... this outfit makes her unstoppable.
who knows how many more to come as the years go by?
why should nasa be any different than the rest of the country, really?
i do, i do... because at least you get outta here with a little dignity.
if you're widowed, there's a code of behavior... that's understood by everybody.
and off they go, astronauts young, mattingly and duke... on what will be the fifth mission to put man on the moon... at the descartes plain.
apollo 16 is go... as it climbs higher into the sky over the atlantic... on april 16, 1972.
i did, but there's always some place that i've missed things, isn't there?
why don't you go over to the new house... get there before the movers, and i'll check around here.
you were about to go into space for the very first time.
i was trying to protect you from anything... that might be the reason that you...
i was going to tell you about... and what part of your life i was gonna keep from you.
so there were a lot of things that i didn't tell you, a lot of...
ladies and gentlemen, one last time... the wives of the new nine astronauts!
for century upon century... to explore the moon was considered... the dream of the addlebrained or foolhardy.
only divine beings, or supermen... could withstand the rigors and distance of such a journey.
but then, early in the 20th century... mortal humans went aloft on mechanical wings... defying gravity and redefining the realm of possibility.
forever after... the moon became a goal within the grasp of those on earth.
for if man could build a machine to make him fly... he would eventually build one to take him to the moon.
when and how and who... was only a matter of time.
from december of 1968 to december of 1972... 24 representatives of the human race... voyaged to the moon... and half as many walked upon its surface.
the requirements to make the voyage a reality... were the qualities that make humankind unique.
our desire to achieve... our wherewithal and perseverance... our willingness to sacrifice time, energy and even life... in the long labor needed to solve the problems one by one... over the course of the endeavor.
most important of all was humankind's tendency... to imagine things that are not possible.
imagining that it could be done was the very first step taken... in the journey from the earth to the moon.
i was very energetic in 1902... and i was working for the great george melies... who i had met at the theatre houdin in paris.
he was beginning, then, to work with film... and i was in love with the magic that came out of his camera... which wasn't all that different from the ones... you use right now.
but the moon was in monsieur melies' eyes... and this is what he designed and built... at the star film studios... in montreal.
monsieur melies had constructed... the largest film studio in the world at that time.
between 1896 and 1913, he produced over 100 films... each more magical and inventive than the other.
actors, visual effects specialists... carpenters, costumes... all under the direct supervision... of monsieur melies.
this is beginning to sound strange to you... and you murmur about this.
and i say, this projectile... will actually journey... all the way from the earth to the moon.
i got out of the lm after gene did on the first e.v.a.
so that would make me the twelfth and final person... to make footprints up there.
it's not like i get stopped at restaurants because of it.
i will bet you $50 and a box of donuts... no one knows the names of the last two men to walk on the moon.
but if you didn't get a nasa paycheck... you never even knew their names.
eugene cernan was a veteran astronaut... who walked in space on gemini 9 in 1966.
exhausted and overheated in his pressure suit... he lost 15 pounds in the effort.
gambling that the apollo program... would remain funded by congress... he held out for command of apollo 17... rather than take the job of lunar module pilot... on john young's 16 flight.
the first and only scientist to go... he was a geologist by trade... and an astronaut by choice.
he had also been instrumental in the training of every man... to walk on the moon before him.
they might have rued the day that they made the change.
i always had some strong ideas... about where we were going on the moon... and forcefully suggested them.
flights rules were not going to be rewritten... just for me and jack to make that last trip out.
chris kraft stopped me in the hallway one day... and he pretty much told me exactly how it was going to be.
when things were not so bad... he was not so bad.
this is how it is when you are working with a genius.
but it was not during the filming... that melies worked his true magic.
it was later... in the laboratory and the projection room... where i saw he was up to something incredible... something that had never been seen before.
most of the world and much of america... views apollo 17 as an undertaking... either commonplace or wasteful.
regardless... to be here, once again, in the presence... of such glorious force... aimed at such a heavenly target as the moon... one can only marvel and ask...
okay, houston... as i step down to the surface at taurus-littrow...
no one on the planet earth saw gene cernan... first set foot on the moon's surface.
the apollo 17 tv camera would not be operative... until the lunar rover was deployed and powered up.
when it was... crystal-clear video pictures from the surface of the moon... were transmitted to the world by way of a television camera... controlled from a console in mission control... by ed fendel.
the networks didn't even want to cover the mission... except on the morning shows... and an occasional update.
in july of 1969... the entire world stopped... to watch buzz and neil... and the one giant leap.
the picture was so bad, a lot of people couldn't even make it out.
12, the color camera went out so there was no tv.
after extended problems with the gravimeter... and the lunar surface experiment package... and a time-consuming fix... to the broken fender of the rover...
cernan and schmitt were allowed to travel only half as far... as their first e.v.a. had originally called for.
not once did gene-o drive with me on the uphill side.
he usually only had three wheels on the surface... and me feeling like we were gonna tip over any minute.
with ten stations scheduled... the pair drove off over five miles... from the safety of challenger... with the single-minded task of doing as much work... in the allotted time as was humanly possible.
while the astronauts were in transit on the moon... there was no television signal.
the f-stop for the 500 millimeter... should be the same as for the 70.
gene, you might want to take some shots of those massifs... if they look interesting.
to find a sample... with such a vivid color on the surface of the moon.
that would be evidence of volcanic activity... the one-time presence of water or oxygen.
it was exactly the kind of find... you'd want to make on a place like the moon.
of course, it turned out it was too good to be true.
but that little episode... that had us going for a bit.
so what other things can reflect off the rover up there?
if you will... or the central mound... is very blocky, very jagged.
and the impression i have... of the other mounds in the bottom... is that they look like slump masses that may have come off the side.
the bad news was that the orange was not... a fumarole alteration, nor was it oxidized.
now these were perfectly normal... preliminary assumptions to make... about an unexamined sample... but it turned out that it was orange volcanic glass... from a fire fountain that happened 3.5 billion years ago.
but that did not diminish anyone's excitement... about that find, or, frankly, its importance.
i think jack and i did as solid an e.v. a... as anyone could have on that second time out.
some of the best work ever done in all of apollo.
there was one thing i really wanted to do out there though.
well, i asked him to bring a rock back from the moon...
he said if he could, he would bring me one back.
before my father walked on the moon... he told me he was gonna do something very special up there.
he said he was going to carve my initials in the lunar dust... making me the only little girl with her name on the moon.
of course, i was nine years old at the time... and i had very little concept of what he was talking about.
the moon is roughly five times the size of the continent of africa.
in all, the apollo missions spent more than 12 days on its surface... but less than three-and-a-half days actually exploring its mysteries.
in the 75 hours challenger sat in the taurus-littrow valley... the crew spent 24 hours of them in scheduled rest periods.
it was just the fact that i was actually trying to do something so fantastic... it made it impossible.
jack, he slept like a baby... with the sweetest dreams you can imagine, i suppose.
mankind's final day on the moon... came with the earth's face having waned by 15%.
the day would bring the last seven hours of human footfall... on the face of another world.
the longer you stay on the moon, minute by minute... the better the chances are for something to go wrong.
now i will tell you, without hesitation... even with there being nothing wrong at all... that last e.v.a. was as anxious a time... as i ever spent in nasa.
turning point rock was so named... because it was the station farthest away from the challenger... on the final e.v.a. of apollo 17.
what looked like in orbit to be one huge boulder... that had skidded to a stop in the valley... was, in fact, five different boulders... each the size of a house.
the lunar module was three miles away... and that was our home.
we were up on the side of the north massif working.
he did not know that le voyage dans la lune... was already playing in america.
and he was not ever going to see a penny from it.
agents of the american genius and thief, monsieur thomas edison... had seen the film in london.
they bribed the theater owner... took the film into a lab... and made copy after copy after copy of it.
jack schmitt hurried to prepare the last bags... filled with priceless lunar samples... for the long transport to earth.
with the clock ticking and his life support... diminishing with every breath... the only scientist to ever walk on the moon... came to a melancholy realization.
that's why i'm the last man to walk on the moon.
jack was already inside challenger... so it was just me out there.
and as i take man's last step from the surface... back home, for now... but we believe not too long into the future.
i'd just like to say what i believe history will record.
that america's challenge of today... has forged man's destiny of tomorrow.
and as we leave the moon at taurus-littrow... we leave... as we came... and god willing, as we shall return... with peace and hope... for all mankind.
the tv camera on the rover... was broadcasting live pictures... of challenger's liftoff from the moon... making ed fendel... the most nervous man in all of nasa.
the camera on apollo 15 wouldn't tilt up... to follow the ascent... and its commands for keeping apollo 16... were too slow.
now with one last chance... to televise the complete event... the pressure was on to pan and zoom the camera... several seconds before liftoff.
otherwise the world would never see... a perfect tv picture of apollo leaving the moon.
president nixon sent up a message... congratulating us on the last exploration of the moon... in this century.
boy, that made me mad because we were just getting good at it.
but we did it at the cost of more than just money.
if you have the time, i can list off the names... of a couple of hundred thousand people... who gave of themselves to make it happen... along with the names of dozens of people who gave their lives.
understand... that the moon is what the earth once was... before the ancient craters were erased by the wind... and the rain and the geologic forces.
as such, the moon is a time machine... that can take us back... and tell us what our home was once like... what it was made out of... and how it came to be... that we're all living here.
i'm very glad to have been alive when we went to the moon.
i am of the generation that witnessed it... that actually saw it live on television.
and what we saw on television... from the forbidding and desolate surface of the moon... was our own world... both beautiful and troubled.
standing on the moon, looking up at the earth... you see that the promise and potential of our world... is as obvious as it is magnificent.
and for the people who live on that green and blue ball... there is no difficulty they cannot overcome... no solution they cannot grasp... no distance that they cannot travel.
me standing in the valley of taurus-littrow... is proof of that.
sure, we wanted to find out what the moon was made of... to satisfy questions of science... that have plagued us since the dawn of man.
but more than anything else... we went to the moon... to see if we could make the journey... because if we can do that... if we can voyage... from the earth to the moon... then there's hope for all of us... because we can do anything.
for the eyes of the world... now look into space... to the moon and to the planets beyond.
our leadership in science and industry... our hopes for peace and security... our obligations to ourselves... as well as others... all require us to make this effort... to solve these mysteries... to solve them for the good of all men.
but when some kid is lying in the street bleeding, what do you do?
i'm curious because the department's looking for a new medical director.
we'll do some x-rays of the neck and chest to look for an obstruction.
if i don't see anything, we'll do an endoscopy take a look down the throat.
i was on my way out when i got the page.
not as sexy as our afternoon with aesop, but hey even a gangbanger shot in the butt has needs.
look, i mean you're jumping to conclusions after one subjective test.
the good news is that reece tests within the aidable range.
it would be a good way to approach continuity of care.
i hate to see it happen to such a decent guy.
her films were negative, and sometimes plastics don't show up on x-rays.
you hear the one about the patient that swallowed a carrot?
the good news is that reece tests within the aidable range.
with digital hearing aids, he'll come up into this speech banana.
what can you expect of admin but to drop the ball?
he was supposed to blow my horn so i wouldn't have to myself.
you know the real meaning of the poem you just read?
once you know it you would write a much better story
from now all he has to do is to wait until it gets dark
the stars i see now are the stars from the past
he was in a distance and i could not even approach him
i was afraid... that he would not recognize me as you said...
i heard that this star called earth is a heaven to other stars.
earth is a planet, not a star, because it can't give out light.
the distance from here to the sun makes it possible for us to live.
nothing could survive on earth if we were just a little bit closer.
farther stars get away even faster so no one can catch'em up...
he is like the stars and i'll never be able to catch him up.
and my gravity is so weak that i can't pull him any closer to me.
i am an invisible poor moon without any sunlight to reflect.
you are too weak to protect your own room from a stranger.
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table
you know the real meaning of the poem you just read?
once you know it you would write a much better story.
then how come there isn't even a radio in your room?
i spent my money for stereo on the room with a view.
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table...
but there must be the one who knows your true value.
from now all he has to do is to wait until it gets dark.
the stars i see now are the stars from the past.
he was in a distance and i could not even approach him.
i was afraid... that he would not recognize me as you said...
you are too weak to protect your own room from a stranger,
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table...
you've gotta sleep with him if you really want to forget him
but i'm not even sure if i want to marry him yet
alpha in virgo is not a gentle star like its sweet name.
it is a fierce one with enormous heat and it's impossible to touch it.
you are too weak to protect your own room from a stranger.
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table
you know the real meaning of the poem you just read?
once you know it you would write a much better story
from now all he has to do is to wait until it gets dark
the stars i see now are the stars from the past
aii he does is to hold the umbrella for his senator
it needs some skill though, iike good height, angle and stuff...
he was in a distance and i couid not even approach him
i was afraid... that he would not recognize me as you said...
then how come there isn't even a radio in your room?
i spent my money f or stereo on the room with a view.
i heard that this star called earth is a heaven to other stars.

he is like the stars and i'ii never be able to catch him up.
and my gravity is so weak that i can't pull him any closer to me.
i am an invisible poor moon without any sunlight to reflect.
it's not pretty socks, new shoes or clothes that make you so special.
you must be watching this with untidy hair and baref oot.
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table
but there must be the one who knows your true value.
i was going to tell you this morning, but i couldn't.

you've gotta sleep with him if you really want to f orget him
but i'm not even sure if i want to marry him yet
alpha in virgo is not a gentle star like its sweet name.
it is a fierce one with enormous heat and it's impossible to touch it.
then why did he tell me that he's gonna wait till i show up?
she's relieved that you didn't wait there f or too long.
you are too weak to protect your own room from a stranger.
you drink water from the bottle and make weird scream at table
you know the real meaning of the poem you just read?
once you know it you would write a much better story.
all he does is to hold the umbrella for his senator.
it needs some skill though like good height, angle and stuff...
alpha in virgo is not a gentle star like its sweet name.
it is a fierce one with enormous heat and it's impossible to touch it.
then how come there isn't even a radio in your room?
i spent my money for stereo on the room with a view.
i heard that this star called earth is a heaven to other stars.
earth is a planet, not a star because it can't give out light.
the distance from here to the sun makes it possible for us to live.

last night we engaged in an operation... to destroy certain records belonging to this man...
orlando perez, a first-tier red cell tactician... who's been responsible for the abductions of several high-level players... all of whom have access to sensitive intel.
the information we destroyed last night was vital to perez's operation.
to recover it, he'll have to subcontract one of three data-recovery experts... all of whom we now own.
there is a chain of command and a protocol for speaking to superiors.
i will accept a certain leeway from time to time... when emotions run high... but not always.
you got entangled in a relationship with orlando perez... a man who uses you for errands and sex.
trust me... you do not have the strength to withstand the pain... our technology can inflict.
but i can only keep him saturated for a couple of minutes.
after that, there'll be too much damage to get anything useful.
the organization we work for... is so covert that none of us have any real identities.
we're all dead as far as the outside world is concerned.
but if we don't pick up perez soon, we'll have to rely on our field ops... who are already on the seams of their covers.
those systems will be untrackable if we don't find perez in the next 18 hours.
you got entangled in a relationship|with orlando perez... a man who uses you for errands and sex.
trust me... you do not have the strength|to withstand the pain... our technology can inflict.
i think we should take michael to medical before he debriefs.
there was quite a bit of interrogation equipment at the site.
stay on channel c, i'll be the only one on it.
just make sure you remember to turn off your main unit when you're talking to me.

the girl whom everyone nicknamed xiu xiu occupied my entire being
once you're away, you'll be on your own i won't be able to look after you
chen li was never found i endlessly worried about when xiu,
and chased down any scrap of news i could get of her
as i look back, i realize that this was the moment wen xiu and left our childhood behind.
from that day on, the girl whom everyone nicknamed xiu xiu occupied my entire being.
a tian an men made entirely from chrysanthemums, and even an enormous ship!

i don't need entertainment tonight to tell me drew barrymore is hot.
twentieth-century men worship women who look like nutritionally deprived heroin addicts.
they try and reel in the last remaining tourists before the town shuts down.
it's a blue-blooded tradition which celebrates the grand achievement of being born rich.
the culmination of which is this asinine formal dinner where some young nubile whose daddy owns the bank is crowned miss windjammer.
it's the most archaic display of ageism, racism and sexism known to man.
look, joey now that the proverbial wedge we so fondly refer to as dawson leery is no longer between us we could actually be friends.
i know, it's a bizarre concept but we might have more in common than just the boy next door.
you're more than welcome to crash at my house for a few.
thanks, but i was thinking of something a little more permanent.
with my video store wage, i can't even afford a two-man tent.
you don't need an assistant for that beauty pageant, do you?
when guys look at you, they think, "wow, what a babe."
and when they look at me, they think, "gee, she's really tall."
i feel like i'm about to set the women's movement back 20 years.
if i were you, i'd start filling out those ivy league applications.
- i assure you, mr. witter nothing in the u.s. constitution says that you have the right to enter.
and there's nothing in your rule book that says i can't.
i'd like to welcome you all to the orientation for the 35th annual miss windjammer pageant.
the rules for the pageant are listed clearly in your handbooks which will be completely revised next year.
the fact that i've been a bitch to you since you got here is pretty much public knowledge.
in new york, i didn't exactly hang out with a lot of other girls, okay?
well, why don't you go hang out with the capeside pep squad?
i mean, associating with me won't exactly send your popularity points soaring up the social scale.
your perception of me is almost as misguided as your perception of yourself.
if you wanna win, we have to work on the self-esteem issue, but first back to the basics.
i could get my hands on this tasty little red polyester number that my sister wore as a bridesmaid.
if you wanna win this thing, you gotta take it seriously.
you know, i was just wondering, because now that he's available, i was...
- look, jen dawson will always see me as the gawky little girl down the creek with the band-aids on her knees and the one braid falling out.
maybe i don't have a chance at winning but if i could take just one vote away from you and make you know how it feels to be a loser then this is all worthwhile.
if you could commit one act without consequence, what would it be?
i guess i want them to treat others the way they want to be treated.
it sounds pretty simple, but it pretty much applies to everything.
it looks like prince charming's found the owner of that glass slipper.
if you have a point, i wish you'd get to it.
if i could talk to the governor for one hour i'd tell him how he could lose 30 pounds in 30 days.
i'd like to tell my kids that you don't have to be the handsomest guy.
i would tell the world's leaders that a society that chooses war and death over the preservation of life cannot possibly succeed or thrive.
if that didn't work, i'd tell them i had dirty photos of them.
in approximately two minutes and 35 seconds, this will all be over.
but i've never had to sing in front of people before.
and if he were here he would destroy those who would judge him with sparks from his eyes and wit from his ass.
well, i am pacey witter but who of you are in the position to judge me?
well, judgment stops today because that which scorns me deems to own me.
i am willing to trade the trappings of my dysfunctional life for one chance.
and how i think she has got more guts and talent and strength of character than all the hannah von wennings of the world put together.
for your final question, miss potter please tell us what words of advice you would bestow upon today's youth.
people who think that material things or being pretty or popular automatically makes you a worthwhile human being.
i'd tell today's youth that none of these things matter unless you have a strength of character, integrity, a sense of pride.
but the truth is i don't want that at all, dawson.
i want you to look at me and see the person you've always known and realize that what we have is so much more incredible than just some passing physical attraction, because you know what?
this is all new to us, and we should talk about it.
no matter what happens, we can't go back to the way things were.
dawson, you've had a lifetime to process your feelings for me.
i can't spend the rest of mine hoping that you might throw a glance in my direction in between your tortured teen romances with whatever jen lindley rolls into your life next.
actually, i just have a lot of experience with being a loser.
i thought you might want some pointers, seeing as this is your first time.
what i wouldn't do to go away to school, be somebody else for a while.
i spent a total of 23 days at home this year.
last time i had a school break, i came home to an empty house.
seems my vacation created a scheduling conflict in my parents' social calendar.
the truth is, i haven't thought about much else lately, dawson.
look, i know that we didn't give our relationship much of a chance.
i don't need entertainment tonight to tell me drew barrymore is hot.

we can revisit the talent problem later but what are we gonna do about the eveningwear?
i could get my hands on this tasty little red polyester number that my sister wore as a bridesmaid.
if you wanna win this thing, you gotta take it seriously.
if you win, the associated press could be all over this not to mention cnn.

i am willing to trade the trappings of my dysfunctional life for one chance.
but if we were i would tell my best friend who was too afraid to get up in front of class for show-and-tell how incredibly proud i am of her.
and how i think she has got more guts and talent and strength of character than all the hannah von wennings of the world put together.
for your final question, miss potter please tell us what words of advice you would bestow upon today's youth.
i'd like to tell today's youth that no matter where life takes you, big cities, small towns you'll inevitably come across small minds.
i'd tell today's youth that none of these things matter unless you have a strength of character, integrity, a sense of pride.
and if you're lucky enough to have any of these things don't ever sell them.
for you to look at me the way that you look at jen.
but the truth is i don't want that at all, dawson.
no matter what happens, we can't go back to the way things were.
dawson, you've had a lifetime to process your feelings for me.
i spent a total of 23 days at home this year.
last time i had a school break, i came home to an empty house.
i really didn't give you a good reason for the breakup, but truth is, i don't even know if i had a good reason.
is it too late for me to ask you for another chance?
i sew a god of longevity as a gift for my father
i sew lotus with leaves and roots as a gift for my mother
so if you die at 80, you spend 20 years here
when the years total 100, your memory of heaven is erased
tomorrow i'll be reborn i"m grateful for my 100 years of life and my days in heaven
and i would like to pray for everyone 's future happiiness
in heaven, you can't meet people you were close to previously
other wise we'd have people dying to meet their families and lovers
in that case he bypassed heaven and was reborn to live on earth
if your grandpa was 102, he lived 2 years afterr ebirth
i have to leave you for a while and will leave this mountain
our coming and going to meet might have caught the attention of humans
now, this happens to be my favorite room in the philadelphia museum of art.
these abstracts are open to personal interpretations, so i want each of you to pick out a piece of artwork that speaks to you.
you know, nobody ever put a paint brush in my hand when i was two.
nobody ever helped me find out what i was talented at.
your father and i ran into mrs. eichelburger at the grocery store.
her daughter's the reason you didn't enter the talent show at the youth center, isn't she?
you didn't help me find out what i was good at.
and i do not want to be one of these people, dad, who has no first-place trophies and no special talents.
wait, it's pay-up time right now here in front of me?
so have you decided what you want for saving my life?
you know, when you meet somebody great like alexandra, you begin to wonder if you're worth anything, and if i'm not, it was easier to blame you.
but i know it's up to me to make my life something to be proud of.
daria, do you have to look at everything in such a negative light?
could you possibly be referring to the harsh light of reality?
so, what gardner is telling us is that the writer of fiction has a duty that goes beyond the mere telling of a story.
his or her job is to tell a story in such a way as to leave the reader... what, kevin?
or does it disturb you if i talk while you're writing?
it would disturb me if i were actually doing any writing.
you could write a thrilling romance leading up to their storybook wedding.
you need to start wearing a hat when you go out in the sun.
boy, would i like to be there when those two tie the noose.
and do you, kevin, take this pulchritudinous woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
i think i'd go back a couple hundred years, when women either married or shriveled up and blew away.
instead of marrying and then shriveling up, like they do now?
let us hope so, indeed, for nothing so recommends this world as the promise with which it offers up each gentle day.
and, pray, upon this dewy morning, what errand is it that finds you guys abroad?
oh, fighting the same old curriculum battles against the rest of the faculty.
and each fall there's a new batch of freshmen to potty-train.
well, there is some pleasure in winning awards for saying the same things that made me an outcast in high school.
and quinn, you've taken all that energy and enthusiasm you used to direct toward being, um, a teensy bit self-absorbed...
i won't talk about soccer anymore i promise 6 o'clock over here at the cafe
you don't have to show up if you're busy but i'm gonna be here anyway
the party they're gonna have after the wedding the food my aunt's gonna make and the people who gonna come...
you know how mama is i'm not gonna hang up, you know?
it's alright, actually i was going to thank you for being late
or otherwise i couldn't have the chance to talk to the girl
she was beautiful, i have never seen such a beautiful woman
i mean for a german woman actually i thought she was french
in small town in milano of course you know milano is in italy
what am i talking about you are italian you know that
the very first since the bar opened back in the days of mussolini
bartender wouldn't serve him one man stood up for him, a german businessman who also had come into the bar for a drink by himself
you can't know about it until it you've lived it all
just like heaven, you don't know if you like until you have one
but it might be a waste of money because won't be able to finish it
i mean you'll be gone and the milk will get all curdled in your fridge
i couldn't tell because it was in black and white so...
do you always appear in people's dreams before you take them away
i don't know, see i don't remember being in anybody's dream
i don't even know how to dream because i never sleep
oh, that hurts here i am, trying to be good to you
oh yeah if you wanna do me good why don't you let me live longer?
i didn't have to do this i mean i could have just come tonight to pick you up 9 pm
and you would've been sorry for yourself because you wouldn't have been able to finish it
what is the gate number for the noon flight to paris?
i'm sorry we don't have a noon flight but we have a regular flight at 6, 7, and 9, 10 and we have the concord which departs at 1:30pm
can you imagine what'll happen to me when i'm a sexually competent woman?
probably every man i meet will try to sleep with me
come over here, sit down come on i'll give you a reading
come on, come on, come to me come on sit down i give you a reading
how in the wide world of sports are we supposed to be expected to believe
that this young, beautiful, lovely can be with this old crusty piece of a fart
if i had known earlier i think i would have followed her
i've never been there and i thought paris would be a great place to die
it's six hours ahead in paris and when she said nine, i wasn't sure
if she meant eastern time or the local time wherever i would be
i want you to mail this for me and the address is inside
and i don't have the envelope or the stamp but please
i guess you don't like them you just like yours right?
that's selfish but it's okay it's a deceptive thing for me
you see they were a sort of maoist in the 60s, and after may '68
they felt so defeated and disillusioned that they wanted to adopt a child...
we were very excited when we got there with these festivities going on
cherry blossoms all over the place most beautiful i've ever seen
well i was kid, 18 years old full of dreams and ideals
so i joined the navy i wanted to see the world
'an evening spent with a young man who would die 3 hours later'
and it's gonna be sensational and i'm sure we can sell it worldwide
- what's he talking about - yeah mr. sage, sorry, know you don't like the truth but
i saw anouk at the gallery this morning before i met you
unless somebody came in while she was out getting the paper, and did her the favor of killing the kid.
well, so far, she's the only one with the boy all afternoon.
(music playing) who i share a taxi with is none of your business.
and i haven't done anything improper with any of my students.
maybe we should get them all together for a teacher evaluation.
yeah, women are a little harder to charm when they find out they're number 12 in the conga line.
foreplay generally consisted of letting her vent for half an hour.
when she was here on tuesday, it was the same drill.
you couldn't stand sleeping next to a guy who'd turned your son into a potted plant.
as long as michael was still alive, you didn't have the guts to walk out.
so the boy was alone from 3:00 to 5:00, which is when he got murdered.
go back to the m.e. nail down the time of death.
an orderly said he saw semenko hanging around the food cart while mcsorley was making her rounds.
semenko told briscoe and curtis he was out of the building.
molineux, even as extended by mees, allows only similar prior bad acts.
not one of these other deaths involved a patient who had zero expectation of recovery.
they'll tell you that michael sutter had no quality of life.
it's true that michael sutter wasn't going to grow up to be a teacher or an engineer or a doctor, like the defendant.
well, reality has all sorts of shades of gray, doesn't it?
dr. semenko didn't just wake up one morning and on a whim decide to kill michael sutter.
they have put dr. jack kevorkian on trial over and over again, but he's never been convicted.
because juries, juries just like you, have always recognized the truth.
and did you say to dr. semenko that michael didn't deserve to live like this?
didn't you tell dr. semenko that you wished michael's suffering would end?
mr. sutter, if you had to do it all over again,
i mean, if you had known how much michael was going to suffer, would you have pulled him out of that car?
the rules reflect a wrong-headed view of dealing with death and dying.
do you and your colleagues have methods to get around these rules?
sometimes i have to tell people the worst news they think they'll ever hear, the death of their loved one.
but somehow they wake up the next morning, and their life goes on.
if you're implying that my medical opinion was compromised by a desire not to be detected, you're right.
i would rather be in a hospital right now, caring for my patients, than defending this ridiculous charge.
yeah, well, don't be surprised if the sutters kick in a few extra bucks.
the hospital confirmed joe sutter asked for their son to be transferred to semenko's care.
i have all this power, i never do anything with it.
maybe the captain of the football team should grovel at my feet.
well, there was that time yo-yo ma was soloing and i screamed, "kick up the jams, yo-yo."
there's a spell to put our arms back, but i have to look it up.
i don't think i can go to school with molecular instability in the air.
i mean, what if one of my arms breaks off and gets attached to harvey?
if you need to put it back on, i've got some duct tape in my locker.
the cheerleaders have collected more canned food than any other club.
i have all this power, i never do anything with it.
maybe the captain of the football team should grovel at my feet.
the united global space force was searching the galaxy... for worlds rich with drinkable water and breathable air.
the hypergate was our best hope to colonize space... our best hope for survival.
my crew will sleep away our 10-year journey there... in suspended animation.
once we have rendezvoused with the research colony on alpha... i will supervise construction of a hypergate.
by then, technicians here on earth... will have completed the companion hypergate... in our planet's orbit.
once both gates are complete... ships will be able to pass instantaneously between them.
i wonder what it'll be like to jettison your body into deep space.
first, you'll try holding your breath... but your blood's already begun to boil.
every schoolchild knows that our recycling technologies... will cure the environment.
sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell computers... to people of all ages.
in two decades... the earth will be unable to support human life.
the new global sedition knows the truth as well as we do.
looks like somebody sprung for the full-extras package on this beauty.
if you have to be a babysitter, it's not such a bad nursery.
my only condition for accepting this mission... was that we could bring the children with us, so doing our job... wouldn't mean leaving them behind, so future generations would have a new home.
you're off saving humanity... so, what does it matter that will has to black out his school... just to get his father's attention... that penny's been dragged home by security three nights in a row... that judy's become a ghost, just like her father?
if this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?
as part of her enslavement... the brave young space captive, penny robinson... is forced to utilize her dazzling technical expertise.
killed in one of those combat missions that you admire so much.
my family is on this ship and you will follow my orders... whether you agree with them or not.
now if you've finished hosing down the decks with testosterone... i suggest you come with me.
i may have found a way to get us off this planet.
when the, uh, first sailors circled the globe... saw a brand-new sky... they thought they'd sailed right off the edge of the earth... but they were really just around the corner.
so you're saying that we should just billow our sails and let the wind take us home?
try so hard not to be their fathers... end up making the same mistakes.
we can't get off this planet, let alone get back on course.
sometimes, especially in the eyes of their fathers... little boys have to come first.
as soon as we get back up into space... we're gonna spend a lot of time together, i promise.
there's no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely.
the major and i are going to locate the radioactive material for the core.
whenever your grandfather went on a mission... he'd leave these with me for safekeeping.
and when he came home, i would always be there... waiting to give them back.
if your father and that idiot, west, fail... i have no chance of getting home.
it's in my best interests that they succeed... and i always follow my best interests.
the force of your time machine is ripping this planet apart.
these violent distortions in time are being caused by your experiment.
that's how it can be in the same place at the same time.
but the spatial delivery system, the targeting laser... i never thought of those.
my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world.
after the women were savaged... i became the father will never had.
finally... the warring nations of earth had forgotten their differences... and banded together to save our planet.
the united global space force was searching the galaxy... for worlds rich with drinkable water and breathable air.
the hypergate was our best hope to colonize space... our best hope for survival.
but as we prepared to launch ourselves... into the black of space... terrorists, calling themselves 'the global sedition...' were preparing to strike.
alpha prime is the only other habitable planet... yet detected by deep space recon.
my crew will sleep away our 10-yearjourney there... in suspended animation.
by then, technicians here on earth... will have completed the companion hypergate... in our planet's orbit.
once both gates are complete... ships will be able to pass instantaneously between them.
you're off saving humanity, so what does it matter... that will has to blackout his school... to get his father's attention...
penny's been dragged home by security 3 nights in a row...
i'm also dealing with two kids... who are leaving an entire planet behind.
sorry, but there's no manuals on how to deal with this.
how could they launch a rescue mission for us... when we've only been lost a day?
there's no data on the alien ship... but they brought in something that was attached to its hull.
try so hard not to be their fathers... end up making the same mistakes.
we can't get off this planet, let alone get back on course.
sometimes--especially in the eyes of their fathers-- little boys have to come first.
as soon as we get back up into space... we'll spend a lot of time together, i promise.
whenever your grandfather went on a mission... he'd leave these with me for safekeeping.
when he came home, i would always be there... waiting to give them back.
there's an alloy in this crater wall... that's disabling the com-links.
you're not going to be able to communicate with the ship.
finally the warring nations of earth had forgotten their differences and banded together to save our planet.
the united global space force was searching the galaxy for worlds rich with drinkable water and breathable air.

you're off saving humanity... so, what does it matter that will has to black out his school... just to get his father's attention... that penny's been dragged home by security three nights in a row... that judy's become a ghost, just like her father?
if this is all a dream, why can't there be more girls?
as part of her enslavement... the brave young space captive, penny robinson... is forced to utilize her dazzling technical expertise.
killed in one of those combat missions that you admire so much.
my family is on this ship and you will follow my orders... whether you agree with them or not.
now if you've finished hosing down the decks with testosterone... i suggest you come with me.
i may have found a way to get us off this planet.
when the, uh, first sailors circled the globe... saw a brand-new sky... they thought they'd sailed right off the edge of the earth... but they were really just around the corner.
so you're saying that we should just billow our sails and let the wind take us home?
try so hard not to be their fathers... end up making the same mistakes.
we can't get off this planet, let alone get back on course.
sometimes, especially in the eyes of their fathers... little boys have to come first.
as soon as we get back up into space... we're gonna spend a lot of time together, i promise.
there's no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely.
the major and i are going to locate the radioactive material for the core.
whenever your grandfather went on a mission... he'd leave these with me for safekeeping.
and when he came home, i would always be there... waiting to give them back.
if your father and that idiot, west, fail... i have no chance of getting home.
it's in my best interests that they succeed... and i always follow my best interests.
the force of your time machine is ripping this planet apart.
these violent distortions in time are being caused by your experiment.
that's how it can be in the same place at the same time.
but the spatial delivery system, the targeting laser... i never thought of those.
my unique gifts gave me an advantage in this quarrelsome world.
after the women were savaged... i became the father will never had.
finally... the warring nations of earth had forgotten their differences... and banded together to save our planet.
the united global space force was searching the galaxy... for worlds rich with drinkable water and breathable air.
the hypergate was our best hope to colonize space... our best hope for survival.
but as we prepared to launch ourselves... into the black of space... terrorists, calling themselves "the global sedition..."
every schoolchild knows... that our recycling technologies will cure the environment.
sending a family across the galaxy... is a stunt to sell computers to people of all ages.
in two decades, the earth will be unable to support human life.
the new global sedition knows the truth as well as we do.
looks like somebody sprung for the full-extras package... on this beauty.
if you have to be a baby-sitter, it's not such a bad nursery.
my only condition for accepting this mission... was that we could bring the children with us... not leave them behind... so future generations would have a new home.
you're off saving humanity, so what does it matter... that will has to blackout his school... to get his father's attention...
sorry, but there's no manuals on how to deal with this.
maybe it doesn't do any good... saving a world of families if we can't save our own.
perhaps, but i'm also the only one... that can save judy's life.
penny, precious, i want you to short the power on my command.
if this is all a dream... why can't there be more girls?
as part of her enslavement... the brave young space captive penny robinson... is forced to utilize her dazzling technical expertise.
also, the pod and the chariot are pretty much scrap metal.
don't you walk away from me when i'm talking to you.
my father is dead... killed in one of those combat missions you admire so much.
my family is on this ship, and you will follow my orders... whether you agree with them or not.
when the first sailors circled the globe... saw a brand-new sky... they thought they'd sailed off the edge of the earth... but they were really just around the corner.

within these egg sacs grow the seeds... of a master race of spiders.
we shall descend upon helpless earth... an entire planet to rule!
this is one of these times when i'm absolutely sure it's the right thing.
i can safely say you definitely, definitely won't regret doing that.

the lead dog turned up a snowshoe rabbit, the dog lay down low to the race, his body flashing forward, leap by leap,
he was sounding the deeps of his nature, and the parts of his nature that were deeper than he, going back into the wombs of time.
it's just, sometimes i just don't like the things he says.
oh, he definitely marched to the beat of his own drummer.
the phrase coined by the coroner when describing platt was "puréed".
but he confirmed platt was killed shortly before buffy found him.
a freshman told me that pete had eight café mochas and just lost it.
it's better than the oestrogen theory - taking his mother's birth-control pills.
we got hold of pete's lab books and stuff, and mr science was doing a jekyll-hyde deal.
he was afraid debbie would leave him, so he mixed this potion to become más macho.
i don't know what to say that's... not gonna sound stupid or obvious.
i've been friends with them both since before we started school.

but... the problem with goodwin locks is they don't provide comprehensive security against the advanced industrial espionage we see today.
goodwin locks are fine for your average run of the mill home security.
you're talking about a man who slaughtered his family in cold blood.
he said he had clues to their identity, buried in the maze behind his house.
on the seventh dawn of the seventh day, a twice-blessed man will roam the fields.
doomed to shadows with his brethren or savior to all who walk the ground.

the experiment as you know was a test of human will in the face of cruel adversity.
the governor's made a request that your son, jesus shuttlesworth, seriously consider enrolling in his alma mater, big state.
if you persuade your son to do this, the governor's given me his word... he'll do everything in his power to... cut your time here short, considerably.
and he's falling back, and you just "j" right in his face.
and then you look at him, and then you say, "what?"
from way back i shown no weakness when i speak this
mentally strong to keep this hit and my speech is given
all he wants to do is talk to you for five minutes, see where your head is at.
my head is on my shoulders and going to stay there.
but as your legal guardians as appointed by the court in the state of new york,
i feel you need to involve us more in your life.
look, i don't have a lot of time, so make it quick.
i got even less time, so i'm going to make it real quick.
-like i told the rest of the world, i don't know yet.
i pray that you understand... why i pushed you so hard.
it was only to get you to that next level, son.
you's the first shuttlesworth that's even going to make it out these projects.
so much money that we won't be in coney island no more.
what did i tell you about listening to what people say?
i hear what you say, but if everybody's saying the same thing, it's got to be true.
uncle bubba even said you were going to buy him and aunt sally some new house in long island.
he asked me if i want to go house shopping with him.
looking for a big old house, too, with, like, a green lawn and grass... and lots of trees and even a swimming pool in the back.
-i'm going to have to talk to that uncle of yours.
-all the kids in school say, since i'm going to be so rich and famous, that...
i'm not going to need to go to school anymore... 'cause i already know how to count and i'm just wasting my time.
if i hear you talking like that again, i'll kill you myself!

all these people around here, half these people aren't going to college.
tonight, our feature is about a biblical player-- the chosen one, the second coming, the resurrection, the salvation.
espn gets religion as we follow a day in the life of abraham lincoln senior...
he's able to do some of the things that most coaches talk about, and that is being able to be a triple threat.
if that's something that we as coaches have used for many years--dribble, pass and shoot.
but 40 minutes of everything he's got... because of what he's overcome in his life.
in terms of dealing with his sister, and all of the pitfalls that come with being in a deprived situation.
and in a situation that's void of any kind of leadership other than his own, he's had to be very, very self-reliant.
now, with kids as good as he is, he's probably receiving a lot of pressure... to go into the n.b.a. because so many kids are doing it.
when you see a kid with this kind of talent, it's almost normal for him... to take that into consideration with the kind of money that they're getting now.
but i would tell him that he needs to go to college and get an education... so that he'll be able to save the money that he has.
i think when april 11th comes, i just want to let my hair down, kick my feet up and have a good time.
just go hang out with my boys back in high school:
two months from now, when i graduate, my mother, she won't be able to attend my graduation... because, of course, she passed.
what most impresses me about jesus shuttlesworth... is the foresight of his parents... to name him appropriately as the world's greatest.
you weren't knocking on that door while i was getting my ass beat.
-yeah, well, i didn't want to get all up in your business--
that's one of my problems, or one of my many problems.
i tell people my whole life history and i don't even know a thing about them.
it's like 1:00 a.m. i'm really sorry it's so late, but i really have to speak to you.

see, everybody remember him from the knicks, you know, when he helped win that second championship.
i'm talking about when he was with the bullets down at winston-salem stadium... before that game, with 42 points a game the whole season.
i got down on my knees, and i asked god... to let tech university be the throne of jesus.
as you already know, this will be the most important decision... of your life that you'll ever make.
he told me that he was heading out of town today.
i don't remember where he was saying he was going 'cause i was half-asleep.
a female friend, and i'd like to take her someplace other than nathan's.
invite her up for one of them grilled cheese sandwiches and orange soda.
i mean, they're all the same, but you just have a good time with all of them.
we all do the same things--go partying, meet all the guys, go to classes.
and i believed you when you asked me to get that abortion.
when you begged me to get that abortion, i believed you.
a baby's going to hurt my chance of going to college.
i mean, the top schools, they're going to be scared away.
i told them nobody can tell jesus what to do, but they fucking insisted.
if they were stupid enough to give me money... to use some kind of influence over you that i never possessed, so be it.
"but under the circumstances my family and i have chosen to be alone.
"this past week has been a very difficult week for me.
"i've done a lot of praying and have asked for guidance from above.
"and i do believe that god has shown me the way.
dear jesus, ever since you was born i been pushing you, trying to make you the best ball player that you could possibly be, trying to make you the ball player that i never was.
i finally came to the realization... that i was pushing you further and further away from me also.
the governor's made a request that your son, jesus shuttlesworth, seriously consider enrolling in his alma mater, big state.
if you persuade your son to do this, the governor's given me his word... he'll do everything in his power to... cut your time here short, considerably.

last time something like this happened, half the prison population got sick.

she wouldn't let me play in the garden, from day one, unless i did my homework.
i think it would just be a sin that... you know, come...
two months from now, when i graduate, my mother, she won't be able to attend my graduation... because, of course, she passed.
you're going to make it out like the rest of these niggers out here, in a casket.
first thing that's going to take you out is these drugs they got for you.
that's all the players got to do to you, is make you mad, huh?
all they got to do is make you mad and you'll give up, won't you?
your food was getting cold, so i put it in the oven.
you know, when you threw that ball over the fence, it got lost.
do you know if you're going to go to big state?
i mean, is that like a finalist, or the final four for you?
not only a great ballplayer, a great student, but a beautiful human being.
when i read about how you've been raising your sister all by yourself, it made me want to cry.
i love them, but they make you work too hard, man.
them white girls over there, man, they do your dirty drawers.
i hope this rhyme gets you in time in space, come to a different place
will you hear spiritual lyrical knowledge in your face to face
invite her up for one of them grilled cheese sandwiches and orange soda.
now, i know you haven't fell... for that broken-down 'ho you been messing around with.
you got to take it back, give it back, do what you got to do.
i don't even want to know who you got it from either.
they got them all lined up, waiting to suck your dick.
if my mother ever saw me with a white bitch, she'd spin in her grave.
i believed you when you said... that you would never leave me, jesus.
and i believed you when you asked me to get that abortion.
if they were stupid enough to give me money... to use some kind of influence over you that i never possessed, so be it.
they put the money in my hand with the promise of more to come.
i ain't got no more time to be trying to beg your forgiveness or nothing, so i'll make this real simple.
this right here, it's a letter of intent... for you to sign to go to big state.
"this past week has been a very difficult week for me.
"i've done a lot of praying and have asked for guidance from above.
how could uncle jake have escaped when they let him walk out the front gate?
there's got to be some truth to it if it's in the papers.
i finally came to the realization... that i was pushing you further and further away from me also.
i believe that things gon' work out for the best for you,
so it was, one morning he set out to repair the water pump... and babe somehow got it into his head that he could help.
but fate turns on a moment, dear ones, and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret:
my pig hasn't come through, and i've only got 15 minutes to make flight ff-115.
i've got to get to the other terminal, but there's no point me going without the blessed pig.
if we miss ff-115, then we won't make the 4:15 shuttle.
and if we don't make the 4:15 shuttle, we won't make it in time for the fair.
it's the grandaddy of all state fairs, they say, and today's the very last day.
it'll all be over and we won't get the appearance money, and if we don't get the money the bank won't take, "sorry, i missed my flight" for an answer.
come to think of it, i should be saving the farm right now.
a-and if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
and so, dear ones, this topsy-turvy night... was to end with a beginning.
this event, that weaves a thread from past to future, soothed the tired hearts of those assembled... and, for a while at least, they put aside their uncertainties.
flealick, if we get caught, we won't be able to help anybody.
oh, yes, i've given myself a good, hard talking-to, let me tell you.
i said to myself, esme, you have let arthur, yourself and the pig down.
the judge had never heard anyone speak so many words in so short a time.
evidently, this was a woman... of clear conscience and good intent.
i used to dismiss pigs, but then a pig became my husband's best friend.
besides, he grew up on a farm and had a fondness for pigs.
you can bind me in chains, but the minute i'm free i shall march back into those streets... and search for my arthur's pig!
and so it was, the pig brought the two worlds together.
two broken halves to make something afresh... in a place just a little to the left of the 20th century.
so it was, one morning he set out to repair the water pump... and babe somehow got it into his head that he could help.
but fate turns on a moment, dear ones, and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret:
if only the farmer did not connect with the platform on the way up... or jam his fingers at the top;
[babe groaning] if only the pump hadn't fallen of fat the bottom;
my pig hasn't come through, and i've only got 15 minutes to make flight ff-115.
i've got to get to the other terminal, but there's no point me going without the blessed pig.
if we miss ff-115, then we won't make the 4:15 shuttle.
and if we don't make the 4:15 shuttle, we won't make it in time for the fair.

it'll all be over and we won't get the appearance money, and if we don't get the money the bank won't take, "sorry, i missed my flight" for an answer.
i'm a sheep-pig, and i've been sent to save the farm.
come to think of it, i should be saving the farm right now.
a-and if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
so, will this little pink "lunchness"... fulfill his destiny, nourishmentally speaking?
~ did you ever see such a sight in your life ~

[narrator] and finally, dear ones, the pig and the farmer... were content again in each other's company.
and things were back to where they started, more or less.
~ gets you little bit further down the road each day ~
~ and before you know it you'll hear someone say ~
if only the weight of the pig and the pump did not exceed the weight of the farmer;

it's the grandaddy of all state fairs, they say, and today's the very last day.
of course, it was proved beyond any doubt... that esme cordelia hoggett was not a felon.
but, sadly, they had missed their all-important connection, and to make matters worse... they were obliged to wait some days for the next flight home.
come to think of it, i should be saving the farm right now.

if only the pump hadn't fallen off at the bottom, and if only the poor farmer had the presence of mind... to hold onto the rope.
and so, dear ones, the pig and the farmer's wife... ventured into the larger world.
what follows is an account of their calamitous adventures... and how a kind and steady heart... can mend a sorry world.
my human's gone, and i'm hungry, and i'm supposed to save the farm.
yeah, that's truly tragic, but you see that long line of stuff over there?

and that the pantheon of powerful warring deities was the cause or reason for the human condition, for the past and the future, and for which great monuments would be created, on earth as in heaven.
but in time man replaced these gods with new gods and new religions that provided no more certain answers than those worshipped by his greek or roman or egyptian ancestors.
and while we've chosen now our monolithic and benevolent gods and found our certainties in science, believers all, we wait for a sign, a revelation.
our eyes turn skyward, ready to accept the truly incredible, to end our destiny written in the stars
sensibly, it's not a question of truth versus fiction, but of truths which are incomprehensible, because we have no physics, no real language for explaining patient x's story, much less the existence of extraterrestrials
nothing to prepare us for the ontological shook that is bound to follow...
we quibble and we jaw about the need for proof, for evidence, as if it would serve some purpose, as if it would make a difference, when what we should be seeking is exactly what this woman is describing.
not if they are here, but why, and what their business is.
in my conversations with her, she believes this business - the abductions and the experiments - are due to their plans for us.
we are not simply breeding cows for them, as some have suggested, but subjects, much like we think of our relationship with god.
there are sites - what she calls lighthouses - around which will be great activity.
all this conjecture, the ontological shock you speak of, for which we're so ill-equipped, is in my opinion not only false but dangerous.
but if you continue to look, you become liberated and you come awake, as if from a dream, realising that the lies simply protect what they're advertising:
a government which knows that its greatest strength is not in defence, but in attack.
the man you're talking about died because of what he believed in.
he died after i'd been interrogating him, after a visit from some men from our government.
again, authorities have now released a fairly complete list of the dead gathered from vehicle registrations, hoping relatives or friends will come forward and help to explain the cause or reason for this bizarre tragedy here in rural virginia.
at this time, details of the disaster at skyland mountain are sketchy.
i've gone over the initial forensics and pathology reports from skyland mountain.
while the event itself remains unexplained, it's less than a mystery who's involved.
"major depressive disorder characterised by periods of sustained anxiety and paranoia."
"patient believes he will be called to a place where he will be abducted by aliens."
nothing to prepare us for the ontological shock that is bound to follow.
[ woman ] we quibble and we jaw about the need for proof,
it's to make people believe in it so completely that they question nothing.
so, you and i have just been advocates of insanity all along ?
cassandra is experiencing a sensation that she's about to be called.
now is a time of war and stress among the alien nations.
i will be summoned to a place, just like duane barry.
the man you're talking about died because of what he believed in.
but i found at least two of these among the dead.
i think it's fairly certain that all the victims had them--

in the northern part of the state, last night's mass death in the forest...
before the exploration of space, of the moon and the planets, man held that the heavens were the home and province of powerful gods, who controlled not just the vast firmament, but the earthly fate of man himself,
and that the pantheon of powerful warring deities was the cause or reason for the human condition, for the past and the future, and for which great monuments would be created, on earth as in heaven.
but in time man replaced these gods with new gods and new religions that provided no more certain answers than those worshipped by his greek or roman or egyptian ancestors.
and while we 've chosen now our monolithic and benevolent gods and found our certainties in science, believers all, we wait for a sign, a revelation.
they've told me that i am an apostle, here to spread the word of a dawning of a new age of supernatural enlightenment.

i think... that if you prepare people enough to believe a lie, they will believe it as if it were true.
if you tell them a really big lie, like "there are aliens from outer space," they will believe it.
a government which knows that its greatest strength is not in defense, but in attack.
it's strongly held by believers in ufo phenomena that there is military complicity in abductions.

i am doomed to remember a boy with a wrecked voice.
not because of his voice or because he was... the smallest person i ever knew... or even because he was the instrument of my mother's death, but because he is the reason i believe in god.
he wants to know, uh, maybe if he paid you... could he touch your bre...
- he wants to know if he could touch your bre...
but that's not to say that she didn't have her kind side.
in fact, when our maid hildie got cancer and had to have her leg removed,
um, why don't i take this... and just put it right over here on this table.
and then you can take a look at it if you feel like.
well, kind of like the one i just left out there in the hall.
matter of fact, there could be a little drama unfolding just as we speak.
maybe he chopped off his thumb on purpose to show your mother... how much he loved her, like van gogh with his ear.
i can't see my mom being attracted to a metal shop teacher.
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
i said i will confess my transgressions unto the lord... and thou forgave us the inequity of my sin.
uh, i'd like to invite them... to join my wife and children and, uh, myself... for coffee and donuts downstairs after the service.
- what does coffee and donuts have to do with god?
i said, "what does coffee and donuts have to do with god?"
they're merely refreshments so people can socialize and, uh, discuss the upcoming activities.
coach higgins decided to pack it in, so we could all go home.
it was a decision that would haunt the poor man for the rest of his life.
first from her closets and drawers, then from her dresses she had sewed herself, and finally, from her bed sheets and pillowcases.
simon and i never talked much about that day on the baseball field.
i no longer just wanted to know just who my father was,
i had to know, and i was running out of time.
simon and i were in such a hurry to get to the answers at the end... of the road that we never took time to read the signs along the way.
how could we have known that everything was working together for a reason?
ah, well, we've got the shepherds, but they don't have a lot to do.
miss leavey always tried to downplay... the role of the shepherds, but we weren't fooled.
i think god made me the way i am for a reason.
well, i'm glad that, um, that your faith, uh... helps you deal with your, um, you know, your-your condition.
but, as the bible says, "there is severe discipline... for him who forsakes the way."
"to impose a fine on a righteous man is not good.
him and his wife, they're the two most miserable people we know.
him and his wife, they're the two most miserable people we know.
even now, i'll sometimes sit and try to remember the colors, the sounds, the faces.
but it only comes back to me in bits and pieces.
if only i had known, i would have paid closer attention.
but you're never prepared for the moment that changes your life.
the cabbie has given a statement that you asked specifically for room 10,
which would put you at the murder scene right about the time of death.
other than the stab wound, did you check his cholesterol level or anything ?
how did you know there was just one stab wound ?
and you can go home and work on your "angry young blind girl" comedy routine.
or we can just stay here and entertain each other for the next 48 hours.
and hide them in the one place that nobody would easily think to find them.
i think that's the most accurate scenario available to us right now.
i mean, she hasn't applied for any of her disability benefits.
maybe that's because she knows she couldn't pass the medical screening.
i don't think she was sure exactly what she was seeing.
it was more like a constant image in her mind she learned to live with over time--
now, you know, you don't have to pack everything you own.
i promise you, you're not gonna be in protective custody that long.
[ man on tv ] now this-- this here's a special number.
it's gonna make your tongue roll outta your head and dial 911.
her juvenile records are sealed, but detective pennock has it on authority...
that two of them were drug busts-- possession and possession with intent.
ms. glenn took a $60 cab ride alone straight to the motel.
the cabbie instructed her to room 10, which she asked for specifically...
yet according to you, she's been seeing through his eyes the whole time.

the cabbie has given a statement that you asked specifically for room 10,
which would put you at the murder scene right about the time of death.
other than the stab wound, did you check his cholesterol level or anything ?
how did you know there was just one stab wound ?

- including how a blind girl could get the drop on an ex-con and bleed him out with surgical precision.
ms glenn took a $60 cab ride alone, straight to the motel.
so just tell us who did kill paco ordonez and agent scully and i can go arrest him, and you can go home and work on your "angry young blind girl" comedy routine.

leaving marty to come in, go straight to the gloves and hide them in the one place nobody would think to find them.
i think that's the most accurate scenario available to us right now.
no, but possibly it's a conversion disorder or a form of blindsight.
a split consciousness whereby a person has some level of visual ability but they're not aware that they're actually seeing.
that two of them were drug busts-- possession and possession with intent.
so do you think that she caught little monster trying to snatch the pebble from her hand?

ms glenn took a $60 cab ride alone, straight to the motel.
it's been my experience that innocent people don't act like that, agent mulder.
she wouldn't explain being at the crime scene, and she avoided all discussion about the murder weapon.
leaving marty to come in, go straight to the gloves and hide them in the one place nobody would think to find them.
i think that's the most accurate scenario available to us right now.
no, but possibly it's a conversion disorder or a form of blindsight
a split consciousness whereby a person has some level of visual ability but they're not aware that they're actually seeing.
and because of that, you feel responsible for his actions, but you're not.
and you sitting here in prison for crimes you didn't commit, it isn't going to accomplish anything, marty.
a boy came out of room 35 and went around back behind the motel.
didn't seem to be checking out so i went back to the cart.
running my own agency, i make up the rules as i go.
any fool can kiss ass, but it takes an irishman to make a living kissing his own.
you could have gone to the hospital, called the police, asked for help.
you'd have done it for debbie but not your own child?
the crap yesterday put me so behind i haven't finished a regular shift.
the manager's on me to "clean up room 35, clean up room 35!"
debbie must have been afraid to tell her parents so he followed her lead.
if she's a good influence and he follows her lead, if she had killed the baby, would he have gone along with her?
how long did you think they'd let you park down here?
as long as gibbs is in charge, i can always get a space.
after i turned in my badge, i fell off too many bar stools.
then i realised i've got a skill that gets you paid in this town.
they might not have enough for first degree, but they'll go for manslaughter.
if you want your daughter to avoid being prosecuted, she's gonna have to make a deal.
prosecutor doesn't think it was fair that a dead infant was buried behind a motel.
so if you didn't touch the baby, if it was craig, you have to tell the police.
you're not gonna be able to see him for ten years or ever again.
you get out of prison, you could be almost 30 years old.
is it possible that someone else, a third party, may have suffocated the baby?
from the answers given by the defendants, the baby was with one or both of them from birth till the body was buried.
now let's hope somebody gets scared and decides to make a deal.
they want someone to strike a deal with the state attorney's office.
the manager said a couple checked in last night, checked out six this morning.
the sheets and towels were piled in a heap in the closet.
i thought they were leaving so i looked down the hall.
a boy came out of room 35 and went around back behind the motel.
any fool can kiss ass, but it takes an irishman to make a living kissing his own.
to cops and mopes, shysters and skells, this city can rot.
dragging their teenage butts into the courthouse will shake them up.
i don't know who's more guilty, the young mother or the young father.
if she's a good influence and he follows her lead, if she had killed the baby, would he have gone along with her?
i don't believe debbie could do what you're accusing her of.
from the answers given by the defendants, the baby was with one or both of them from birth till the body was buried.
the only footprints in the area were from craig halpern, the defendant, and reuben stone, who found the grave and then called the police.
it's just an excuse to make noise, cause traffic jams, leave a lot of litter and spoil other people's weekends.
like mine and harry's, and the families of all the other policemen who have to do extra duty.
we're sick and tired of those juggernauts thundering through, campers and caravans.
give us a bypass, let them go round us and leave us in peace.
i want to sum up what i... what you... well, all of us think about this bypass.
it's an act of sheer ecological vandalism which we want no part of!
erm... in the excitement, i think my wife left out something else that she wanted to say.
we're very fond of this village and the people in it, but we're not locals.
now, you have our support and when we're here we'll give any help we can.
but jean knows, realistically, that that's all we can and should do.
may i say, mrs bale, you look younger every time i see you?
you may say it, but don't expect me to believe it.
chain yourselves to trees, live up trees, dig tunnels, only think on this.
would you really get involved if local opinion wanted you to stay out of it?
before i get onto the plan of action i think we should take,
i want to sum up what i... what you... well, all of us think about this bypass.
who are they, these faceless planners who decide they can rip up yet another bit of our beautiful countryside?
what right have they to think we must have a bypass?
we're very fond of this village and the people in it, but we're not locals.
now, you have our support and when we're here we'll give any help we can.
he tickles his toes and the little one shakes with laughter.
go to your ancient ruins, he says, and let me enjoy the little guy.
haven't you been a gamekeeper at evros delta for 30 years?
we must get into giaurantas and we need you as our guide.
so that's why you put those idiot detectives spy on me.
i told you, i will never come back to this cursed wasteland!
the whores are saying his wife is fed up with him and the town of kilkis.
she and a salesman paired up and went away to thessaloniki.
i mean, have you thought about what opening these old wounds might do to him?
you know, the fact that you're my sister doesn't change one thing.
you know, the state may say you've got jurisdiction, but this is my neighborhood... and you don't operate on these lands without registering.
and i don't appreciate no bounty hunter... stormin' through here like the man with no name.
from what i hear, it's the mining company that wants mike dead.
well, you just tell your friends this ain't the wild west.
the only thing i believe is if lyle brings in jarod instead of me...
fenigor won't be the only supplier to the organ of the month club.
i wish i could invent a way to bring him back.
[mike] i want to tell you everything about your father and his dream quest.
mike was lost in the desert, so they mounted this huge rescue effort.
the find was credited to an ex-air force major who volunteered for the search.
- do you know how many times a.c.m.'s had me arrested?
i always skip a court appearance just to get theirjockeys in a bunch.
i heard about the search for you when you were a boy.
i wanted to be a big warrior, go on a quest.
i was too young to know then... that they were victims of countless misfortunes... the foremost being the great depression.
instead, i envied the whole teeming... tribe, seven children... which made my status as an only child seem... so spoiled and lonesome.
slowly, we began to discover... this was shadrach's return trip to ole virginny... 3% 4 of a century after his departure... from the land out of which he had sprung.
born a slave on the dabney plantation... in king and queen county...
shadrach atop the wheelbarrow with a look of composure... as we moved him gently down the path.
a serene african potentate... being borne in the fullness of his many years... to some longed-for, inevitable reward.
i peered into shadrach's ancient face... and watched his clouded eyes gazing at the dabneys... swimming in the millpond.
in a bright gleam, i was... certain shadrach had once swum here too... some sweltering august nearly 100 years before.
i had never really thought about death... before that summer and the coming of shadrach.
i believed i had learned all there was to learn... about time and its finality.
still, sensing her agony, and watching desperately... for her to be free of it...
i thought of shadrach and... the suffering he had endured for nearly a century.

us attorney and the doj had to recuse themselves, so alberto appointed me to carry the ball for team usa.
the greatest lawyer in the world representing the greatest country in the world, a match made in heaven.
the medical assistant said i had an obstetric fistula, and i needed a cesarean section.
but because they had no equipment or medicine or a physician, they said there was nothing they could do.
"we believe that a woman has a right to control her own body".
the poster was meant to promote women's rights and to prevent rape as well as spousal abuse.
yeah, until anonymous found datemistake. com and started posting all these lies about me.
his fiancee found him prominently displayed on the site and broke up with derek two days later.
you destroy my client's reputation, his business, you humiliate him in public, then force him to fix the damages that you've caused.
that's lika glass company throwing rocks through your window then saying,
some firms are quite formal and sticklers for grammar and language.
i see around here anything goes, which is fine, i just needed to know.
he was very encouraging and told me to go for it.
so i held the documents from being published, made a few calls, and well, here we are.
but what really gets me about these people is how they're so obvious and manipulative.
and you're trying to manipulate our friendship to get me to do something about this.
you're having fun, sweeping into court trying a monumental case about which there is much to be thoughtful, much to articulate, about which you know almost nothing.
and you're using nothing but easy jokes, a swell suit and blind patriotism.
i was in charge of the us aid office in the northeastern region of nepal.
part of my job was to enforce the rules of the mexico city policy.
no, the name of the policy in question is the mexico city policy.
but opponents erroneously refer to it as the global gag rule.
you, uh, you say this was done as a humanitarian effort.
however, the rule was instituted by president reagan, continued under the first president bush, then rescinded during the clinton administration.
the truth is that our global gag rule is affecting, well... the globe.
the balkans, africa, south america, asia, any place dependant on us funding is not allowed to even utter the word "abortion".
if you were to report me, you certainly wouldn't have warned me first.
and besides, what you'd really like to do is wrap your legs around me and scream at the top of your lungs.
i was here until 3 o'clock in the morning hunting these guys down.
all it took was some hard work and long hours, but i was willing to do it.
ms. moran, there are two ways to make money in a business like this.
the first is the short-term cash you make before someone like us comes in and shuts you down with a major lawsuit.
the other is the real money that comes when you grow your business large enough that one of the big media companies buys you out.
but nobody's going to buy a company with a potentially huge class action lawsuit hanging over its head.
but we tell other countries that if they want us aid, they cannot perform, encourage or even mention abortion.
we look the world in the eye and say, "do as i say, not as i do".
she had been to the clinic before, and everything had been fine.
she had the reasonable expectation that the clinic would continue to function.
how could she, how could anyone be expected to know that united states policy is as changeable as the political winds?
a political hack made a brutal, thoughtless decision that could not be appealed.
we have an absolute duty, 'cause we are the united states of america.
and these other nations, well, they're entitled, whether they keep their promises or not.
i'm so glad we're not like those women in the workplace who feel compelled to compete with every pair of legs in a skirt.
you know, marlene, you are not gonna get very far at crane, poole schmidt pulling the kind of crap you did with this case.
no one looks at an issue and struggles over the right position to take anymore.
and yet, our ability to reason is what makes us human.
he was wounded when, without regard for personal safety, he heroically thrust himself between an exploding grenade and his platoon, and, uh... saved most of their lives.
this was in the south pacific, earning him the purple heart.
i want your advice on a story i'm working on for sunday night's broadcast.
it's about a once-handsome, never-was actor from england, didn't make it here either, who gets a job in a hollywood mortuary.
the mortician takes a liking to him and the actor becomes a mortician himself, only our boy undertaker gets greedy.
he realises morticians can get to the bodies before anyone else, can find telltale traces of homosexuality, affairs, drugs.
just as i know you'll remember what was around dorothea's neck when her body arrived here some years ago.
eric, what ratings do you think i'll get for a story about a hollywood mortician who steals a diamond necklace from a dead movie queen so he can buy into a fancy mortuary?
i only came by to make sure you tune in sunday night, but it was worth it just to see that knot in your gut.
imagine this projected behind me... with the headlines, "grisly undertakings on sunset boulevard".
last time i heard from her was yesterday morning about 11:30.
she's having a party on sunday and asked me to email her the revised guest list.
"this reporter has been looking into a tangled web of crime amid the young and ruthless in the snowy hills of beverly."
"but the snow on those hills ain't sugar - it's cocaine."
there were only three messages since yesterday, all from her secretary.
no, sir, there was no message from you regarding dan riley's funeral.
well, that's a good thing if you don't like to eat.
but if you like to eat, not much time for sitting and thinking.
now, what can sheikh hirami do to help the los angeles police?
sir, i'm looking into a missing-persons case... a woman named verity chandler.
this somebody didn't steal 'em, he just handled 'em, if you know what i mean.
and then maybe this somebody went to prison for another job, then when he got out of the joint, he gets a call from a woman.
our business is based on trust, and without that trust, we lose our business.
so it is in the spirit of that trust that i accept these awards and thank you all from the bottom of my heart.
so i sent the ambulance and i just sat there devastated, reliving my memories of her.
then the ambulance returned, the body was brought in and then the phone rang again, and this time it was the police.
i dug up a little funeral medley for you all, and it goes a little like this.
♪ when a body meets a body in the dead of night
and here we have scalpels, needles and thread, putty, pan-cake makeup powder.
a mortician not only has to be a surgeon, but also part-beautician and part-makeup artist.
now, after the service, these are placed in the casket before the casket is closed.
sir, in case you were wondering, miss chandler, she didn't wear a pacemaker.
oh, she carried this everywhere, probably in her pocket, and this would tell her when she received email messages from the computer.
and on the day she disappeared, she received messages, oh, let's see... 11:13 and 11:57, but then, at 12:32... the pager cut off.
because when you called and said you'd be here in an hour,
i just had to help myself to a few cocktails because i know why you're here.
i'm gonna make an arrest tonight, but i can't lay a finger on you, sir.
i haven't understood one word, but that last part about the finger, i like that.
a piece of shrapnel made of stainless steel - hardest metal on earth, sir.
like titanium, it won't melt if you put 2,000 degrees on it.
i'm guessing you must have done something at that party in the other realm.
all i did was turn off the tv and storm out.
salem, i've got to find a way to bring the spirit of christmas back.
maybe if i start doing christmassy things, people will start to remember.
my allowance got cut 'cause my dad's exterminating business isn't doing well.
nobody has parties this time of year, so people don't care if their homes are riddled with insects.
in the name of all that is greasy and deep-fried, open this door!
ah, if charles dickens' a christmas carol doesn't jog people's memories, nothing will.
you don't know how happy i am to hear you say that.
we just thought we'd stop by and give you your presents so we could get back to our families.
my favorite halloween of all was the one time you took me trick-or-treating.
he wore this amazing gorilla suit and i went as his little banana.
run out and get one of those cardboard skeletons to hang on my door.
will you settle for an old poster of nina in a bikini?
now let me get this straight, 'cause this may be the crowning moment of your negligent parenting career.
you got someone to pose as you to take me trick-or-treating?
what drives me crazy is we never seem to get past the past.
missing halloween, or not being there when you had your tonsils out...
my favorite halloween of all was the one time you took me trick-or-treating.

will you settle for an old poster of nina in a bikini?
every time i come in here, you're either slamming your dad or turning on the waterworks.
could you tell me, what did he do that was so bad?
what drives me crazy is we never seem to get past the past.
missing halloween, or not being there when you had your tonsils out...
hanu and jeela had found a hiding place where they could now live together.
as for long tooth, he swore to kill the one who had taken his daughter away.
he's about this tall, he's got big eyes and big ears.
he's got a bad hairdresser and a puckered nose and he's running around with a hundred dollar bill!
and while it is our families that have brought us together,
i want everyone to know that my love for you is strong.
he believed hanuman was one of the last survivors of an ancient civilization.
he thought that one of these creatures was still hiding somewhere, a different kind of monkey, with incredible powers.
he dedicated himself to that exemplary life and today in death they have become one.
let us cherish his memory and learn from it the values of tolerance, courage and loyalty.
she was two years older than us, so we thought she was really cool.
and somehow she convinced us to sunbathe topless on this deck.
that i do respect you and that you're a good teacher.
and you're a good person, or you wouldn't be out here.
every year, at what was their version of christmas, they would cut out someone's heart and offer it up to the gods.
these people were convinced that without this sacrifice, the sun would fall from the sky and the world would come to an end.
the muslims, the gangsters, the latinos, the italians, the irish, the aryans, the bikers, the christians, the gays, and one called the others.
each group will have four prisoners living at em city, no more, no less.
we either become a part of our community, or we remain isolated from it.
in either case, the success of our lives depends on us.
you know, when i was laying in that hospital bed and i was afraid i was gonna die, i started praying.
i'm not saying i had any great spiritual awakening, said, but i did come to realize that my god and yours aren't so different.
montezuma saw this comet as an omen, a sign of his own downfall.
and so he surrendered his empire to the spanish conquistadors without a fight.
i got him so psycho that he tried to have me killed.
so now, not only is schillinger's parole chances dead, but he's facing ten more years.
with no hope of leaving oz, now he's got even more reason to fuck you up.
yeah, well, thank god i'm crazy because i don't give a shit.
all right, starting next month, the librarian will be available in the library from 1 to 5 pm monday to friday only.
yeah, that's because the rest of the time, she gonna be with me.
come on, i see you looking at me looking at you.
i gotta tell you something, and i know you know, you're beautiful.
if this shit spreads through your body, then everybody's gonna know the truth.
and by then it will be too late to save your life.
so there used to be this tribe, the aztecs, who believed that the universe was created by violence.
every year, at what was their version of christmas, they would cut out someone's heart and offer it up to the gods.
these people were convinced that without this sacrifice, the sun would fall from the sky and the world would come to an end.
then the spaniards landed and wiped the aztecs off the face of the earth.
mcmanus, you want us to be allies, but that will never happen.
better for you to transfer me back to gen pop and be done with me.
i'm not saying i had any great spiritual awakening, said, but i did come to realize that my god and yours aren't so different.
they both expect the best from us, and for us to find the best in each other.
believe it or not, i think you're gonna wanna hear this.
working in the psych office, i have access to all the files from the whole prison.
i had to figure out a way to get his parole hearing cancelled.
i couldn't start a fight with him, or i'd get in trouble.
it's not the kind of thing i come across every day, but i called a friend of mine who's an oncologist, ran the specifics down.
he said he'd be hard pressed to figure out what else it indicates.
but the only way we're gonna know for sure is if we do the biopsy.
let's just say, for the sake of argument, that she's right.
you know as well as i do, any weakness, any weakness at all, and i'm dead.
look, if you do have... lf you're sick and you don't do anything about it, you're dead anyway.
you want me to visit the guidance counselor give me some incentive.
i think my academic career needs a long, slow counseling session.
my mom's a wicked witch, and my genie's in a deep freeze.
if this were disney movie now i'd sing a moving ballad ot a cup.
lisa, without you... the moon has lost its luster the flowers refuse to bloom.
lisa, bless us once again with the radiance of your smile.
much of it centred around the play of vaunted slugger kelly olsen.
olsen is in the throes of a season-long slump, wihch, barring a turnaround, could end his career.
the other two got away, but we got a good look at them.
- rusty barnstead, what have you gotten yourself into this time?
we got guys in chicago could put out cigarettes on their tongue and don't flinch.
- i walked rusty to school on his very first day, okay?
they wanted a driver who's familiar with the area, so we can assume they're from out of town.
i've taken the liberty of removing his belt, his shoelaces and his wristwatch.
i also took the liberty of placing him into holding cell number 1.
and i would respectfully suggest that we get over to the stadium as quickly as possible.
huck, this is, uh... lieutenant harding welsh of the chicago police department, and this is, uh, constable fraser, of the royal canadian mounted police.
he first came to illinois on the trail of his father's killer, and for a number of interesting reasons, he's stayed.
you got a crime wave going here, and you got no criminals?
- got no criminals 'cause i done a damn good job here for the last 20 years.
it occurs to me that since this is a small town and news travels fast, that our presence here is likely known.
we should consider the introduction of a third party unknown to the town who could infiltrate the clubhouse and report to us from the inside.
ace, are you concerned at all about fitting in with this new league so late in the season?
- i just want to go out there and help the team any way i can.
he's done a lot of good for the town, always been there for charity work.
- you saying a guy does charity, he can't have a little ambition?
olsen's not much, but he's all i got, and you got him sitting in a cell!
- that's where you go when you break the law, huck.
as the hawkeyes take the field, fans, let me remind you about sunday's cheese-sculpting contest...
- they're gonna play me, fraser, put me in the game.
hey, you remember how dad used to take us to the cubs games?
- yeah, i remember when he used to drop us off at the gate and give the ushers a few dollars to look after us.
every other day, he was telling me you were his only real son.
- and every other day, he told me how you were his only real son.
but right now, they've got to get through the meat of the corrington order.
and ace leary might find out why they call it the hot corner.
- possibly, although i do think all the crimes are related, and that they revolve around the sale of this team and of the stadium.
furthermore, they all seem to share a certain pattern, or what you would call an m. o.
well, here we have it, folks, the final game of the season.
now just a reminder to all the fans here at the stadium, please remain seated after tonight's game for the big fireworks display.
seems you picked up that burnt-out lumber mill, the warehouse and the store.
- i bought some worthless property to help out some friends.
they've loaded the bases with two out, down 6-3 in the bottom of the ninth.
and i guess you could say the pressure is on mystery man ace leary as he makes his way to the plate.
much of it centred around the play of vaunted slugger kelly olsen.
olsen is in the throes of a season-long slump, wihch, barring a turnaround, could end his career.
- and i imagine you'll be wanting to speak with this fellow.
- the other two got away, but we got a good look at them.
- it turns out that rusty met the other two men in a bar three days before the robbery.
they wanted a driver who's familiar with the area, so we can assume they're from out of town.
i've taken the liberty of removing his belt, his shoelaces and his wristwatch.
i also took the liberty of placing him into holding cell number 1.
- huck, this is, uh... lieutenant harding welsh of the chicago police department, and this is, uh, constable fraser, of the royal canadian mounted police.
he first came to illinois on the trail of his father's killer, and for a number of interesting reasons, he's stayed.
- got no criminals 'cause i done a damn good job here for the last 20 years.
- yeah, well, maybe me and fraser will go back to chicago, then, let you handle it by yourself.
it occurs to me that since this is a small town and news travels fast, that our presence here is likely known.
we should consider the introduction of a third party unknown to the town who could infiltrate the clubhouse and report to us from the inside.
ace leary, somewhat of a mystery man signed out of the canadian league.
ace, are you concerned at all about fitting in with this new league so late in the season?
- don't worry, sweetheart, unless of course you canadians have something i haven't already seen.
- uh, you know, i'm gonna take it, you know, game by game, and go out there and do my best and try not to play with myself.
he's done a lot of good for the town, always been there for charity work.
- you saying a guy does charity, he can't have a little ambition?
olsen's not much, but he's all i got, and you got him sitting in a cell!
- that's where you go when you break the law, huck.
- assuming that kelly's alibi holds up, we can conclude that he was framed.
and it's likely that whoever framed him is behind the other acts of sabotage.
as the hawkeyes take the field, fans, let me remind you about sunday's cheese-sculpting contest...
- they're gonna play me, fraser, put me in the game.
- yeah, i remember when he used to drop us off at the gate and give the ushers a few dollars to look after us.
then he'd come and pick us up after the game and drive home hammered out of his mind.
so now i have to sell the team with the stadium, or i'm going to be stuck with a chunk of property that's not worth a bucket of warm spit.
so listen, you fellas want to talk to me, you know where to find me.
but right now, they've got to get through the meat of the corrington order.
and ace leary might find out why they call it the hot corner.
well, here we have it, folks, the final game of the season.
now just a reminder to all the fans here at the stadium, please remain seated after tonight's game for the big fireworks display.
seems you picked up that burnt-out lumber mill, the warehouse and the store.
- i bought some worthless property to help out some friends.
- i guess the hawkeyes will take baserunners any way they can at this point.
they've loaded the bases with two out, down 6-3 in the bottom of the ninth.
i mean, you drop dishes, you misplace orders, you fall all over yourself.
- then why don't you just terminate me if i'm such an incompetent moron?
bessie will be relieved and it will be like a test run.
just, uh, don't set the kitchen on fire or anything... okay?
it's allowance time and i feel a major buying binge coming on.
so tomorrow get your pocketbook and a sensible pair of shoes and let's go blow some major dough.
my plan is to spend the weekend in bed... counting my ceiling tiles.
- please, don't tell me this has something to do with your ludicrous dawson leery fixation.
the way we were, pardon me as a gag, oh my god, dumbo.
- okay, so i have a grade school mentality when it comes to movies.
the intensity of his lines... that jarvis was in complete control of his new technique.
sadly, three weeks after jarvis completed "winter mist" he died from alcohol poisoning.
i hereby declare myself a full-fledged, madly enthusiastic fan of your new hobby.
- dawson, why is it your obsession with movies is your life passion, while my interest in art is a hobby?
- you know, i really have to finish up, so i'll see you later.
- well, so you're just going to leave it like this?
you haven't even fully recovered from the gossip fallout of your last completely illegal interlude.
there are girls your age, there are girls who like you.
- only if your definition of scandal includes your wife having an affair with her co-anchor but if you don't mind, uh,
i'd like to give that image a rest for the afternoon.
- well, i guess that's one way of looking at me.
but just like if some shallow person stumbled across all these paintings and labeled them, like, i don't know, messy or meaningless, you know?
abby's got a particular way with words that, that sometimes the stuff she says comes out wrong, but she means well, mostly.
anyway, the only reason we came all the way down here is because she likes you, so give her a break, would you?
i'm just trying to be us, dawson and joey, who analyze and argue and debate and disagree.
you've put me in my place a thousand times about some movie.
you know, i keep thinking that i shouldn't be over this, but i am.
you know, sexually, we were pretty good together, but in all other respects, we were on 2 different planets,
we went down there for me... and you just stole him right out from under me.
i saw the looks you were giving him, batting your eyelashes at him with the mascara i bought you.
- dawson, look, i've been thinking of how to make you understand my behavior lately.
you know, why i've been pushing you away but then i realized that i don't even know, dawson.
all i know is that you are very important to me, and this art thing, whether it be a hobby or my life's passion, is important to me, too.
it is the first thing other than you that's been important to me in a long time.
- dawson, you've been everything to me, and i have been your sidekick, your confidant, your other half for so long, and that's how our relationship works.
and it's a nice place for you, but for me, it's scary because i realized that, aside from you, i don't have anything.
i would be standing here totally void of anything else in my life.
i live in total fear of doing nothing, of going nowhere, and that is why i shut you out.
joey is being sarcastic and oversensitive and you, my friend, are being self-absorbed and self-catering.
- this has nothing to do with joey and me this has to do with you.
- well, i'd love to but bessie's at home with the baby and
i've got to go to an art lecture after school so there's really no one to cover all the tables.
- jack, every since we hired you it's been nothing but a slapstick comedy.
i mean, you drop dishes, you misplace orders, you fall all over yourself.
- well, just when i've written you off for good you drop this whole dumbo bomb on me.
- hey, look, uh, i'm outta here and i got no plans so uh what do you say we walk around downtown or something?
no one can deny after looking at this exquisitely tuned surface that this picture that the positions of color and shape..
the intensity of his lines... that jarvis was in complete control of his new technique.
- why, when you say that, do i suddenly feel overcome with anxiety?
- because with talent comes responsibility, and you owe it to yourself not to let this talent go to waste.
i left new york because i couldn't handle being the bad girl anymore, but,
i tell you, if being the bad girl means not walking around in a perpetual state of loneliness and depression, then bad girl it is.
artist extraordinaire, empress of all impressionism, master of all still life.
i hereby declare myself a full-fledged, madly enthusiastic fan of your new hobby.
i knew, i knew as soon as i said "hobby" that it was the wrong word, but by the time i said it, it was already it was gone, and there was no getting it back.
- you know, i really have to finish up, so i'll see you later.
you haven't even fully recovered from the gossip fallout of your last completely illegal interlude.
there are girls your age, there are girls who like you.

it is the first thing other than you that's been important to me in a long time.
i just don't want us to lose what's great about us.
- dawson, you've been everything to me, and i have been your sidekick, your confidant, your other half for so long, and that's how our relationship works.
i care about you so much, but if i ever lost you,
i would be standing here totally void of anything else in my life.
i live in total fear of doing nothing, of going nowhere, and that is why i shut you out.
because if i can't have something to hold onto independently from you, then i don't have anything at all.
i had a brief flash of maybe feeling like i didn't, possibly, hate you.
hm, but it will pass so there's no need to get a big head or anything.
i mean, you drop dishes, you misplace orders, you fall all over yourself.
- then why don't you just terminate me if i'm such an incompetent moron?

- you know, i really have to finish up, so i'll see you later.
- well, so you're just going to leave it like this?
i should actually do this, uh, the "this" being coming out to see you because... you know, when we said hi yesterday it was, uh, a little...awkward.
and i don't know, i just thought that i should come...
you were off and down the hall before i could get it out.
- well, you see, we got a situation here, now, because
um, pacey, i'm your friend and i want to be supportive, and helpful, but the only thing i can think of to say to you in good conscience is stay away.
you haven't even fully recovered from the gossip fallout of your last completely illegal interlude.
there are girls your age, there are girls who like you.
would it be so terrible if you fell for one of them?
but just like if some shallow person stumbled across all these paintings and labeled them, like, i don't know, messy or meaningless, you know?
but if you stare at the images long enough, you can see they're filled with great power and passion...intelligence.
laura just had us working on a bowl of fruit, which isn't the most inspiring subject matter to say the least.
- see, you shouldn't be wasting your time drawing things you're not passionate about.
i bet you thought i came over to your house the other day to pour out my wounded heart to you, to confess just how much i miss you,
and to tell you that seeing you the other day brought back all the old feelings.
you know, sexually, we were pretty good together, but in all other respects, we were on 2 different planets,
and that's what i came to tell you the other day.
you're scaring me, and i'm afraid if i say anything it's going to lead to a fight.
- dawson, look, i've been thinking of how to make you understand my behavior lately.
you know, why i've been pushing you away but then i realized that i don't even know, dawson.
all i know is that you are very important to me, and this art thing, whether it be a hobby or my life's passion, is important to me, too.

i would be standing here totally void of anything else in my life.
i live in total fear of doing nothing, of going nowhere, and that is why i shut you out.
why would i kill someone that can fix things for me?
i guess a man that's been knocked around as much as you have is always expecting the worst, huh?
listen, i understand uh, but that's no reason to hurt this girl's feelings.
um... we've got some business to discuss so, uh, why don't you... go on ahead home and i'll call you in a couple of days, okay?
chancellor gowron, on the other hand is adamantly committed to the alliance.
you're going to making it look like gowron ordered the assassination.
i figured out a way to interrupt the power grid for a few seconds.
bilby and his men will be able to beam in before the backup generator kicks in.
all i'm doing is following procedures and warning our allies about a possible assassination attempt.
what happens after that is not my concern but believe me, if the klingons go after raimus and the rest of the orion syndicate
i eat when i'm hungry and when i'm hungry, i eat fast.
if you're not careful that appetite of yours is going to kill you someday.
why would i kill someone that can fix things for me?
i guess a man that's been knocked around as much as you have is always expecting the worst, huh?
well, now that that's out of the way shall we discuss the matter at hand?
we mentioned we might ask you to do something for us.
the ambassador has been advocating that the klingons break off their alliance with the federation and concentrate on defending the empire against the dominion.
chancellor gowron, on the other hand is adamantly committed to the alliance.
the ambassador will be seen as a martyr and his cause will gain strength.
if all goes well the klingons will retreat into their own territory and then, all we'll have to deal with is the federation.
needless to say, it is very important that the dominion's part in this remain secret.
if something goes wrong and you're captured... you never met our friend here.

how much longer are we supposed to put up with these malfunctions?
you know, i wouldn't be surprised if major kira or commander worf came in here demanding answers but you?
i guess a man that's been knocked around as much as you have is always expecting the worst, huh?
well, i've pretty much had to get used to the idea that i've got bad luck.
bilby told me he was in charge of the weather-control system on risa about a year ago.
it should be easy enough to figure out who that was.
well, now that that's out of the way shall we discuss the matter at hand?

- we need you to find out who their informant in starfleet is.
give me the name and i'll put you on the next transport home.

i wanted to say that for me it's a shit of a time now.
too bad radiofreccia is closing, a bit it was helping me, really.
i wanted to say that this evening i'm coming at plutonio.
speaking of which, now that you're closing, would you tell us why her name is radiofreccia?
here in town who got high had first name, surname and nickname.
and it was first names, surnames and nicknames that again could be counted on a hand's fingers.
one of these first names, surnames and nicknames was ivan benassi, aka freccia, because of an arrow-shaped birthmark he had on a temple. (freccia=arrow)
the radio was called radio raptus, and became radiofreccia the day they found him in a ditch.
he'd been there a while, and it was up to one of us to identify him.
now, i don't know if any of you went through anything like that, but there's a time you give up.
the ones with him were caught, also because his gang was not that big.
they realized his overdose only after he died, they panicked and threw him in the ditch.
yeah, i don't know a thing about freud, or not-freud... but mom, she's really hot.
i understand that you may lose your head for one like that.
guys, when he organizes these trips for us, our friend bruno iori, aka... 'bruno iori',...
there are no catches, if the fm is empty it'll be enough with a 1-penny transmitter, a little mixer, a microphone...
you realize, you idiots, that if we get caught with my father's van he kills me!
- if we get caught with my father's van he kills me!
i want to move from 2 hours' broadcasting a day to the whole afternoon.
i need to find people coming to broadcast, like, who have things to say...
in 50 years your little house with iron bars at windows, for we fear gypsies.
you'll fuck ilaria once a month, only when you'll be drunk.
and then muffins sunday morning, tortelli on the eve, some fireworks at the first of the year, the jokes in dialect at the pub and italian facing the boss.
sport news all life long and the 127 washed on saturday, to take the family out on sunday.
the ones like you can even become volunteers at the red cross.
the ones like me send the ones like you to fuck themselves!
i believe in the double bell ringing of your flat's owner who wants the rent every first day in the month.
i believe that everyone of us deserves to have a mother and a father who are decent with him at least until one stands on his feet.
i believe that an inter like corso's, mazzola's and suarez', will never exist again.
but it is not for certain that there will not be others beautiful in other ways.
and so i think i will believe sooner or later in some god.
i believe that if will ever have a family, it will be tough going on with 300 bucks a month.
but i believe too that rock'n'roll, some girlfriends, football, some satisfaction at my job, bullshit with friends, sometimes they fill this hole.
i think that wishing to escape from a town with 20.000 inhabitants, means you wish to escape from yourself.
and i believe that you cannot escape from yourself not even if you are eddy merckx.
i believe it isn't fair judging others' life, because anyway you can't know a fuck about others' life!
these guys, the ones full of money, keep in their homes aardvarks, pythons, tarantulae.
guess it's typical for them having an exotic stuff like a sheat-fish in their little pond.
don't you tell me you don't know a thing about the horror producer?
there is a horror-movie producer coming here every first friday in the month, at astrologo street 5.
now, in my opinion, the best screen-test one can do for a horror producer is scaring him.
imagine yourself coming, kinda 3 o'clock am, right in the middle of the party, with a horrifying mask.
correggio: hippo found in city centre had fled from the circus stopping in town
hey boys, what the fuck do you want from me, uh?
it does not matter if he who made them will change.
if you want to know my opinion, songs, your songs, you can trust them.
partly because they would have kept him away from heroin, and partly because they reminded him his sick heart.
because every hole for him was much more hazardous than for anyone else.
pass out a bit on the side, else people can't come in.
then not a cappuccino, but i'll take the risk of a coffee.
but i'm sure that many of you, that by chance are 18-20 years old, are there not leaving themselves be, not even this time on saturday.
i don't know how it was being 18-20 in the '50s or '60s.
there are bombs, there's the student movement, there are free radios, there are parents, who more and more are like what you swear you'll never be.
there are utopias, religions, and there are, right, those who don't let themselves be.
i passed 10 days in a bed i was soiling and that a person was cleaning.
if it wasn't for her, i wouldn't surely have got out of it.
but i don't know whether i can say i really gave up.
well yes, since some months i don't get high anymore, but...
maybe it's better if i don't think too much about it.
do you think it was worth it asking yourself that "why not?" the first night?
we talked about holes, or better said the holes someone made in himself.
we do not know if that's the same thing for everybody.
it was such a big hit that for the second time we lost sight with him.
how can one tell a love story with freccia in it?
she said that's better if we calm down for a while.
and she rang here at the pub, she doesn't even like that.
in these 16 years we pronounced freccia's name every time we pronounced this radio's name.
how many times we thought of what we would have done together.
in these two hours i told you a lot of things i don't know how much could interest you, but, as you understood, this radio's story is a group's story as well.
so, if i did so much, i can do a bit more.
let's do like in those movies where at the end you look at where all the people are.
bonanza doesn't go almost anymore to cinema but watches some home videos.
but some say he's preparing for the guinness, maybe eating the famous car.
omero tried to renew himself, and instead of the usual lottery tickets, now he ordered some "scratch'n'fuck" tickets.

i believe in the double bell ringing of your flat's owner who wants the rent every first day in the month.
and then i think i will believe sooner or later in some god.
i believe that if will ever have a family, it will be tough going on with 300 bucks a month.
but i believe too that rock'n'roll, some girlfriends, football, some satisfaction at my job, bullshit with friends, sometimes they fill this hole.
i think that wishing to escape from a town with 20.000 inhabitants, means you wish to escape from yourself.
and i believe that you cannot escape from yourself not even if you are eddy merckx.
i believe it isn't fair judging others' life, because anyway you can't know a fuck about others' life!
i wanted to say that this evening i'm coming to plutonio.
speaking of which, now that you're closing, tell us why her name is radiofreccia?
two hours, we've got two hours left then radiofreccia's signal goes dead forever.
the last two hours, then, of this radio of ours, so small it never even covered the whole province.
i'm sure at this very moment two or three idiots in a pub i know well have taken their handkerchiefs out and are pretending they're moved.
be jerks as much as you want, but you saw the birth of this station and you'll miss her.
at that time fm radios could be counted on the fingers of one hand.
here in town the people who got high had a first name, surname and nickname.
and those first names, surnames and nicknames could be counted on one hand too.
one of these first names, surnames and nicknames was ivan benassi, aka freccia because of an arrow-shaped birthmark he had on a temple.
the radio station was called radio raptus, and became radiofreccia the day they found him in a ditch.
he'd been there a while and it was up to one of us to identify him.
he was dead before they realised he'd overdosed and they panicked and threw him in the ditch.
they got a few months for concealing a corpse and negligence.
i understand how you could lose your head over someone like that.
the point is, though, that no one could be the only one for her.
it's okay in life to make a fool of yourself, but we're plumbing the depths!
i tell you now, if you don't win, forget me paying for the fucking shirts.
i need to find people to broadcast who have things to say...
i need some cash because there are records, lights, turntables to be fixed...
i think that there should be radio like this in every house.
everyone can tell the rest of the world about his thing.
and then muffins sunday morning, tortellini on christmas eve, some fireworks at new year, the jokes in dialect at the pub and in italian with the boss.
gazzetto della sport all life long and the 127 washed on saturday to take the family out on sunday.
all people who have decided how to live in this world.
guys like you, the only thing they do is tell others how they should live.
i believe in the bell ringing when it's your landlord who wants the rent on the first day of the month.
i believe we all deserve to have a mother and a father who are decent at least until one stands on one's feet.
and so i think i will believe sooner or later in some god.
i believe if i ever have a family, it will be tough with 300 bucks a month.
but i believe too that rock'n'roll, some girlfriends, football, some job satisfaction, bullshit with friends, sometimes they fill this hole.
i think that wishing to escape a town with 20,000 inhabitants means you wish to escape from yourself.
and i believe you can't do that, not even if you're eddy merckx.
i believe it isn't fair judging other peoples' lives, because anyway you can't know a fuck about other peoples' lives!
don't you tell me you don't know about the horror movie producer?
there's a horror movie producer coming here the first friday in the month, at 5 astrologo st.
now, in my opinion, the best screentest for a horror producer is scaring him.
imagine yourself coming, around 3 a.m., right in the middle of the party, with a horrifying mask.
songs don't betray you, even if the person who sings them can.
but songs, your songs, the ones that meant something to you, you'll always find them there when you want to find them.
listen... can i have some ice when you've got the time?
as long as you're still standing, can you wash my car as well?
but i'm sure that many of you, some who are 18-20 years old, might be listening in, even at this time on a saturday.
i don't know how it was being 18 or 20 in the '50s or '60s.
there are bombs, there's the student movement, there's free radio, there are parents, who are more and more like what you swear you'll never be.
there are utopias, religions, and there are, right, those who can't be themselves.
but you get sick if you don't get it and then you shoot up just to be normal.
finally, it's between you and it, and everything else means fuck all.
if it wasn't for her, i would never have got out of it.
but i don't know whether i can say i really gave up.
well yes, since some months i don't get high any more, but...
maybe it's better if i don't think too much about it.
second, freccia for the first time lost his head over a girl.
he really fell for a girl who, even if she lived in carpi, was light years away from him.
that's how many times we've thought of what we would have done together.
what he would have done, how different the 16 years would have been.
but you know the story of this station is the story of a group of people.
so if i've already said a lot, i can do a bit more.
let's think about going to a movie where at the end you see where all the people are.
bonanza doesn't go to the cinema now but watches some home videos.
but some say he's preparing for the guinness book of records, maybe eating that car.
omero tried to change, and instead of the usual lottery tickets he started buying some "scratch'n'fuck" tickets.
i believe in bonimba's bicycle kicks and in keith richards' riffs.
i believe in the doorbell ringing when your landlord wants the rent on the first day in the month.
i think i will believe sooner or later in some god.
i believe if i ever have a family, it will be tough on 300 bucks a month.
but i believe too that rock'n'roll, some girlfriends, football, some satisfaction at my job, bullshit with friends, sometimes they fill this hole.
i think wishing to escape a town with 20,000 people means you wish to escape yourself.
and i believe you can't escape from yourself, not even if you're eddy merckx.
i believe it isn't fair judging other peoples' lives, because you can't know a fuck about other peoples' lives!
i wanted to say that for me it's a shit of a time now.
too bad radiofreccia is closing, a bit it was helping me, really.
i wanted to say that this evening i'm coming at plutonio.
speaking of which, now that you're closing, would you tell us why her name is radiofreccia?
here in town who got high had first name, surname and nickname.
and it was first names, surnames and nicknames that again could be counted on a hand's fingers.
one of these first names, surnames and nicknames was ivan benassi, aka freccia, because of an arrow-shaped birthmark he had on a temple. (freccia=arrow)
the radio was called radio raptus, and became radiofreccia the day they found him in a ditch.
he'd been there a while, and it was up to one of us to identify him.
now, i don't know if any of you went through anything like that, but there's a time you give up.
the ones with him were caught, also because his gang was not that big.
they realized his overdose only after he died, they panicked and threw him in the ditch.
yeah, i don't know a thing about freud, or not-freud... but mom, she's really hot.
i understand that you may lose your head for one like that.
guys, when he organizes these trips for us, our friend bruno iori, aka... 'bruno iori',...
there are no catches, if the fm is empty it'll be enough with a 1-penny transmitter, a little mixer, a microphone...
you realize, you idiots, that if we get caught with my father's van he kills me!
- if we get caught with my father's van he kills me!
i want to move from 2 hours' broadcasting a day to the whole afternoon.
i need to find people coming to broadcast, like, who have things to say...
in 50 years your little house with iron bars at windows, for we fear gypsies.
you'll fuck ilaria once a month, only when you'll be drunk.
and then muffins sunday morning, tortelli on the eve, some fireworks at the first of the year, the jokes in dialect at the pub and italian facing the boss.
sport news all life long and the 127 washed on saturday, to take the family out on sunday.
the ones like you can even become volunteers at the red cross.
the ones like me send the ones like you to fuck themselves!
i believe in the double bell ringing of your flat's owner who wants the rent every first day in the month.
i believe that everyone of us deserves to have a mother and a father who are decent with him at least until one stands on his feet.
i believe that an inter like corso's, mazzola's and suarez', will never exist again.
but it is not for certain that there will not be others beautiful in other ways.
and so i think i will believe sooner or later in some god.
i believe that if will ever have a family, it will be tough going on with 300 bucks a month.
but i believe too that rock'n'roll, some girlfriends, football, some satisfaction at my job, bullshit with friends, sometimes they fill this hole.
i think that wishing to escape from a town with 20.000 inhabitants, means you wish to escape from yourself.
and i believe that you cannot escape from yourself not even if you are eddy merckx.
i believe it isn't fair judging others' life, because anyway you can't know a fuck about others' life!
these guys, the ones full of money, keep in their homes aardvarks, pythons, tarantulae.
guess it's typical for them having an exotic stuff like a sheat-fish in their little pond.
don't you tell me you don't know a thing about the horror producer?
there is a horror-movie producer coming here every first friday in the month, at astrologo street 5.
now, in my opinion, the best screen-test one can do for a horror producer is scaring him.
imagine yourself coming, kinda 3 o'clock am, right in the middle of the party, with a horrifying mask.
correggio: hippo found in city centre had fled from the circus stopping in town
hey boys, what the fuck do you want from me, uh?
it does not matter if he who made them will change.
if you want to know my opinion, songs, your songs, you can trust them.
partly because they would have kept him away from heroin, and partly because they reminded him his sick heart.
because every hole for him was much more hazardous than for anyone else.
pass out a bit on the side, else people can't come in.
then not a cappuccino, but i'll take the risk of a coffee.
but i'm sure that many of you, that by chance are 18-20 years old, are there not leaving themselves be, not even this time on saturday.
i don't know how it was being 18-20 in the '50s or '60s.
there are bombs, there's the student movement, there are free radios, there are parents, who more and more are like what you swear you'll never be.
there are utopias, religions, and there are, right, those who don't let themselves be.
i passed 10 days in a bed i was soiling and that a person was cleaning.
if it wasn't for her, i wouldn't surely have got out of it.
but i don't know whether i can say i really gave up.
well yes, since some months i don't get high anymore, but...
maybe it's better if i don't think too much about it.
do you think it was worth it asking yourself that "why not?" the first night?
we talked about holes, or better said the holes someone made in himself.
we do not know if that's the same thing for everybody.
it was such a big hit that for the second time we lost sight with him.
how can one tell a love story with freccia in it?
she said that's better if we calm down for a while.
and she rang here at the pub, she doesn't even like that.
in these 16 years we pronounced freccia's name every time we pronounced this radio's name.
how many times we thought of what we would have done together.
in these two hours i told you a lot of things i don't know how much could interest you, but, as you understood, this radio's story is a group's story as well.
so, if i did so much, i can do a bit more.
let's do like in those movies where at the end you look at where all the people are.
bonanza doesn't go almost anymore to cinema but watches some home videos.
but some say he's preparing for the guinness, maybe eating the famous car.
omero tried to renew himself, and instead of the usual lottery tickets, now he ordered some "scratch'n'fuck" tickets.
i believe in bonimba's bicycle kicks and in keith richards' riffs.

i have been a hunter of peace who chases the mayfly known as love... many moons now.
there is no rest for me in my search for peace.
that way, even if shinzaburo were to die... you would never be parted.
i'll give you not only my life, but my body as well.
but tsuyu cared so deeply about you, she came in death!
she's fallen for someone who's not all he appears to be.
the other night, i was on the phone to my mum, and she always asks after my friends.
and apart from you and adam, i don't seem to see them any more...
now, first, let me explain that my job is not to prescribe, but to facilitate... (groans)
..to enable you to understand any problems you might be having.
and i tried to push him off, but he was too strong, and er... ..i suddenly heard this voice behind me.
- "can i be of any assistance?" - (laughs) i remember thinking to myself, "what a ludicrously gallant turn of phrase."
not in years, maybe, but inside. i'm young at heart, me.
at least i don't have to hang out with girls half my age.
look, i don't know why we couldn't stay at the nag's head.
cos it isn't a pub crawl if you only go to one pub.
i mean, when you take delivery of a new merc, it makes all the years at college worthwhile.
i mean, people think insolvency's dull, but, you know, we're making decisions every day that'll change people's lives.
then nail her feet to the floor and use her as a mike stand!
no offence to anyone present, but that girl is the most pointless thing ever put on the planet, with the possible exception of the pope's testicles department.
i thought we could finish the week with a bang and have the village quiz.
i know, i know, david has won it for the last few years.
any luck vicar, or can we asume this idea is another defunct duck.
mm.. probably yea.., i meen, all i manage to get, is two tickets for a luxury weekend in disneyland paris, with £500 spending money
yes.., not only a very vise and beutiful lady but also a very sexy lady.
and i like her to except this small token of my appreciation
we're in a passage way that leads to a burial chamber.
and it was some brits who excavated on this in a century ago.
yeah, the celts believed very deeply in mystical kings and queens.
these mystical kings, they were tall and noble creatures with silvery tongues.
i bring the message we have all awaited since our arrival on earth.
evidence has been discovered which will lead to the remains of ma'el.
our mandate was to occupy this planet only until ma'el's message could be verified.
if his conclusions prove to be true, we shall leave earth forever.
after the companions came and helped us form the united republic of ireland, there was no ira to fight.
can't very well fight for nationalism when you see the earth and its true perspective.
the world is used to the idea that the taelons are on earth.
people will accept that they've been here before without much challenge.
go to doors, brief him and bring back any tools he has that will help us find ma'el's tomb.
i have posted zo'or as the companion representative to the united nations.
it is the synod's expectation that relieving you of some of your responsibilities will increase your efficiency.
i assume your role with the united nations will require you to be based in new york.
sandoval, da'an believes the mosaic was created a tombstone left behind by ma'el for other taelons to find after his transformation.
it may well be a tombstone, but it doesn't mean ma'el was buried here.
i can use multiple datasets to generate a three-dimensional map of these fields.
it should reveal the signature of any camouflaged tomb big enough to hide a taelon.
ma'el's early messages indicated that the human race was a perfect complement to the taelons.
only later did ma'el's messages indicate that we should not come to earth.
so the knave and the maiden sped off in the chariot.
and when they got home, they found the monster's hook stuck in the side of the chariot!
you were right when you said that we should obey the law.
but, you were right when you said that people should not be slaves.
it's a bunch of hooey about how big companies exploit workers and waste natural resources.
jack, your driver wants to know if he can stop circling the block.
a couple of years ago, i went to detroit to expose a major auto manufacturer who was threatening to close a plant.
well these two big guys tailed me the entire time i was there.
i've had my teeth whitened and my hair darkened and i had botox injected into my forehead.
the only way she can look better than me is if she spent the last 20 years in a freezer.
i have a wonderful husband, a beautiful family, a real life.
and everything that came before, the fame, the parties, starving myself, it all seems like some sort of bad dream.
jack, your driver wants to know if he can stop circling the block.
no, i want nice, cold air on the way to lunch.
hey, look, i spend my whole day listening to slick executives try to smooth-talk me.
so you'll excuse me if i don't fall for your little bad cop, cute cop routine.
hey, listen, before you go, i want to tell you something.
a couple of years ago, i went to detroit to expose a major auto manufacturer who was threatening to close a plant.
well these two big guys tailed me the entire time i was there.
they harassed me, they threatened me, they even roughed me up in a dark parking lot one night.
you know, greta's always been prettier than me, and i want this to be my moment of triumph.
i've had my teeth whitened and my hair darkened and i had botox injected into my forehead.
at no time was i never not aware of what finch was allegedly representing with regard to my recreational heated water proclivities.
now, isn't it time to put this behind us and get back to the business of running this magazine?
years ago at studio 54, she and i were both dancing with joe namath and he ended up taking her home.
as they walked off arm-in-arm, i remember wishing that she'd get fat and i'd be beautiful forever and now both my wishes have come true.
i was beginning to wonder if you were going to make it, lennier.
i said that i would never leave you that i would be here when you needed me most.
many of the rangers are patrolling the shipping lines but none of them have the experience with the centauri that you and i have.
so i need you on patrol along the centauri border watching for anything suspicious.
now, the thing you must remember about the drazi is that they are very insecure people but they have so much to be insecure about.
did you know that the female of their species will gladly mate with any other species in the universe to avoid the males of their own kind?
officially white star 27, but what kind of a name is that for a ship?
you won't find it on any records, but as far as i'm concerned it's the maria, named after my sister.
now, we have had several positive leads but we can't release any information until we have some conclusive answers.
but i do wonder if these leads pointed to someone close to you.
the circular stain is a coffee stain left by mr. garibaldi.
when i confronted him with it, he said it's the best part of the book.
but we can't be free until we learn to laugh at ourselves.
once you look in the mirror and see just how foolish we can be laughter is inevitable.
the more intense the search, the brighter the light on the wall.
the brighter the light on the wall the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it.
similarly, someone who does not search who does not bring a lantern with him sees nothing.
what we perceive as god is the byproduct of our search for god.
it may simply be an appreciation of the light pure and unblemished not understanding that it comes from us.
sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume that we are the center of the universe.
lower heartbeat and respiration to extend what air you had and to stay where you were to assist in recovery.
to be anla'shok means understanding that there is nothing to fear in death except the failure to complete our assigned mission.
we are currently in orbit near a red giant star in a system where several gas giants on the edge of the solar system have collapsed or been destroyed leaving behind a fairly substantial asteroid field of ice chunks and solid rock.
i've chosen this as the perfect place for an easter egg hunt.
now, while you were sleeping we seeded the asteroid field with 39 short-range homing devices.
now, you have to get pretty close in order to detect them.
so we're talking close-proximity scans of large, fast-moving and extremely dangerous objects.
your mission is to find and destroy no less than 10 of the homing devices while avoiding the possibility of getting hit and destroyed by an asteroid yourself.
they were anla'shok and it fell to me to carry on their work.
if you are doing this because you feel you should be doing this not because you want to, then your purpose is flawed.
lennier, i don't know what went on out there, and i doubt if i ever will.
but for purposes of bookkeeping i'm giving you a failing mark in the easter egg hunt.
we'll never know what findell would've done, since you shot up his fighter so he gets a neutral grade.
and as for you i've been giving this a great deal of thought and i've arranged for an assignment for you.
i want you to look into their eyes, findell and i want you to ask them from the very bottom of their soul if this is really what they want to do.
i don't want you to let anyone through who's here for the wrong reasons.
i think maybe we have a month before they decide to take things into their own hands.
and without proof we're going to have to oppose anything they do.
i was beginning to wonder if you were going to make it, lennier.
i said that i would never leave you that i would be here when you needed me most.

we are currently in orbit near a red giant star in a system where several gas giants on the edge of the solar system have collapsed or been destroyed leaving behind a fairly substantial asteroid field of ice chunks and solid rock.
i've chosen this as the perfect place for an easter egg hunt.
now, while you were sleeping we seeded the asteroid field with 39 short-range homing devices.
now, you have to get pretty close in order to detect them.
so we're talking close-proximity scans of large, fast-moving and extremely dangerous objects.
your mission is to find and destroy no less than 10 of the homing devices while avoiding the possibility of getting hit and destroyed by an asteroid yourself.
they were anla'shok and it fell to me to carry on their work.

lennier, i don't know what went on out there, and i doubt if i ever will.
but for purposes of bookkeeping i'm giving you a failing mark in the easter egg hunt.
we'll never know what findell would've done, since you shot up his fighter so he gets a neutral grade.
and as for you i've been giving this a great deal of thought and i've arranged for an assignment for you.
i want you to look into their eyes, findell and i want you to ask them from the very bottom of their soul if this is really what they want to do.
i don't want you to let anyone through who's here for the wrong reasons.
i think maybe we have a month before they decide to take things into their own hands.
and without proof we're going to have to oppose anything they do.
i was beginning to wonder if you were going to make it, lennier.
i said that i would never leave you that i would be here when you needed me most.
many of the rangers are patrolling the shipping lines but none of them have the experience with the centauri that you and i have.
so i need you on patrol along the centauri border watching for anything suspicious.

this man's mental acuity, his decision-making ability is vital to his job.

who are we to say where he can look for hope?
i do have all the answers, but maybe not all of them are accurate.
what you said about him knowing you when you were weak.
we live in a time where people just seem to be more empty.

that blow-drying your hair in the bathtub is never a good idea.

remember all we're announcing today is that the money for school renovation is going to brooklyn.
after careful consideration, we've decided that the money allocated for school renovations is going to b-b-b-
mike, you are aware that my wedding is in 2 days, right?
i told you my wedding gift to you is to plan this event down to the last detail, and that is a promise i'm going to keep.
now, paul, your vows are to love claudia and to lose 5 pounds...
well, i wanted to combine my wedding vows with my new year's resolutions.
i specifically remember scheduling paul's wedding for the 24th because on the 31st the mayor's opening a new v. a.
hospital, and i arranged to have the blue angels fly over the ceremony.
mr. mayor, i did not buy this bridesmaid dress for nothing.
now i'm leaving with or without you after i return councilman weir's call.
by the way, she's single, if you'd like to exchange phone numbers.
tina, baby, i'm in the phone book under "i" for love.
# at the copa # # copa cabana # # the hottest spot north of havana # # at the copa # # ha!
# # copa cabana # # music and passion were always in fashion # # at the copa # # ah!
i don't mean to sound threatening, but if you make another joke,
i'm gonna rip off your legs and feed them to you.
i know that traditionally a toast is given after the wedding, but seeing as the groom isn't speaking to me, well, i figured what the hell.
paul and claudia, let me just start by saying that if you were a mere mortal couple, your relationship would be buried back there with mrs.
or maybe she was just there to remind us that blow-drying your hair in the bathtub is never a good idea.
but seriously, i just want to say that i love you guys... to paul...
# i'm glad you found me # # hey # # quite entrancing # # ha # # but now it is time for some dancing # # so paul and claudia # # start your romancing # # now i'm proud to announce #
# that i'm going to pronounce you # # for the first time # # as man and wife #
at the least it would take us well over a month to get through it and more than a year to get around it.
the crew was unable to tolerate the nebula for even a few minutes.
of course you have, and i know that you could do it, but you'll need backup.
we have no idea what effect the nebula radiation might have on your holo- matrix.
i think we're all feeling uneasy about this, and i'd be lying if i said i don't have concerns myself, and i think it's about loss of control.

everyone's being relocated here to deck 14, so we can monitor you more easily.
my dreams have been... disturbing... but i am determined to fulfill my responsibilities.
with the doctor confined to sick bay, i have taken on increasing duties.
i am hopeful our propulsion system will remain operational for the next six days.
i'll admit i was surprised to find another ship headed toward me.
just to prove i'm willing to give you a fair chance, i'll ask you:
what would happen if the structural integrity around the warp coils collapsed?
when i studied the gel pack, i discovered the radiation was producing a degradation in the synaptic relays.
i'm guessing there's been a similar effect on your borg implants.
she's taken power from every available system, and it's still not enough.

look at me. i'm gonna fucking-- l'm gonna have to take that tape.
according to mr. dunlap's will, miss havers shall be furnished a stipend until she graduates from a college of her choice.
hard work and dedication of men and women of this department.
excuse me. i'm in the middle of this dog and pony show.
he learned to fly so he could squeeze in a little more time at the tables.
even taught stepdaughter brittney to fly so he could down a cocktail or two.
--where high-school student maya king came forward claiming to be the illegitimate daughter of niles dunlap.
the room exploded in chaos when brittney havers attacked miss king upon hearing the news.
the very same day he fired her, he cut her a check gave her the name of a doctor he wanted her to see.
needless to say, she didn't know what he wanted her to do with the money.
it is the opinion of the coroner's office that niles dunlap is indeed the blood father of maya king."
as per the will, mr. dunlap's 51 percent controlling interest in the dunlap corporation goes to miss maya king.
miss king stands to inherit the shares of the dunlap corporation valued at approximately $ 70 million.
in a related story, a cuban national was detained here on suspicion of murder in the crash of niles dunlap.
eleven years of cutting checks to assholes in wheelchairs who later are dancing a fucking jig in maui.
paying fortunes out to abused wives whose husbands inexplicably decide to take baths with toasters, blow dryers.
eleven years of living out of a suitcase watching the rich get richer.
and a boss who's just been looking for a reason to fire my ass.
now it's time for old bridge to get what's coming to him.
it's so nice to finally meet somebody who can play my game.
she must have erased the rest of the tape or something.
the fbi raided the dunlap mansion based on testimony of a cuban national arrested in the suspected murder of niles dunlap.
early reports show that records seized indicate mr. dunlap misappropriated millions of dollars of his company's funds to finance a gambling addiction.
turning now to entertainment concert pianist benjamin koskert continues to wow--
that son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me.
we understand your feelings, miss van ryan but please, we need some time with kelly.
a year ago when her old man blew his brains out kelly lost it, ran away.
they found her in a fleabag motel some place, coked out of her gourd.
meanwhile you, sam, are voted educator of the year or some crap.
they put the two of you in front of a jury they're gonna look stupid.
the lombardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town of blue bay with its tabloid appeal.
now just arriving, sandra van ryan jet-set real estate heiress and part of the powerful blue bay elite.
and even though it's something we've been over i want us all to be very clear about it.
kelly, when you saw that mr. lombardo intended to have sex with you what were your exact words?
it's day two of the lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim of the former guidance counselor has taken the stand.
yesterday, kelly van ryan delivered an emotional account of events and was not swayed by defense counsel's cross-examination.
so one month after you say this man raped you, you go to him for help?
sounds as if you still considered mr. lombardo a good friend.
because i promise you, if you are lying about this and i believe you are that you will be visiting that facility again quite soon.
which is why i'm gonna ask you again now, under oath.
so maybe one celebration is okay if we're in agreement that from here on out you do exactly as i say.
guidance counselors get to find out all sorts of interesting things.
unless you're setting sandra van ryan up for the big payday.
lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt before this whole thing started trying to keep up with a pricey girl like barbara baxter.
she might have saved it if she didn't try to ruin him.
you wouldn't go after a guy you thought raped your daughter?
no, but i mean, just the idea that mr. lombardo would...
well, the way i heard it, he was pretty tight with the kids.
told me i could work my way through college, like he did.
sam lombardo went to the university of miami on an athletic scholarship.
he knows it won't be found, but he made a mistake.
she'd been threatening to run away and i found the car at the bus terminal.
i just looked away for a second, just a split second.
and just like that, bingo she put a knee in my groin.
this is twice for you, duquette and i intend to see to it that there is no third time.
our investigation finds that this was a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.
you are, as of now, terminated, with forfeiture of pension and benefits.
chief goodsall detective duquette found susan marie toller's teeth and blood near the area known as stoner beach.
miss toller's blood was also found in the van ryan range rover.
this has led this office to conclude that susan marie toller was murdered by kelly lanier van ryan.
and even though we've been over it, i want us all to be clear about it.
kelly, when you saw mr. lombardo intended to have sex with you ...
you know, i'd want a clear head now, if i were you, so i could keep a real close eye on my new friends.
i'd hate to see you come to a bad end ...
that son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me.
we understand your feelings, but we need some time with kelly, to take her statement alone.
meanwhile you, sam, are voted "educator of the year" or some crap.
if they put the two of you in front of a jury, they'll look stupid.
i know this is hard, kelly, but i have one more question.
and even though we've been over it, i want us all to be clear about it.
on day two, the second alleged young victim has taken the stand.
yesterday, kelly van ryan gave an emotional account and was not swayed by cross-examination.
wait until you are asked, and don't use profanity in this court.
it was mr. lombardo who went with you, in lieu of a parent conference?
you know, i'd want a clear head now, if i were you, so i could keep a real close eye on my new friends.
i'd hate to see you come to a bad end ...
he would rather go broke challenging my mother's will than give me what's mine.
students, as spring break approaches we are once again forced to tackle the subject of sex education.
back in high school all i wanted to do was party.
by junior year my life had become a blur of alcohol, drugs and anonymous sex.
whenever you're ready, we'll need a urine sample for the rape test kit.
if you'll remove your clothes, we need to do a physical exam.
for the sake of argument, let's pretend that you're telling the truth.
you didn't rape elena sandoval and she took this bribe you gave her.
awfully convenient how they disappeared after you and your men showed up, don't you think?
get your client out of here before his mouth gets him in more trouble.
that son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me.
we understand your feelings, miss van ryan but please, we need some time with kelly.

it's day two of the lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim of the former guidance counselor has taken the stand.
yesterday, kelly van ryan delivered an emotional account of events and was not swayed by defense counsel's cross-examination.
we'll come back live later with an update of these proceedings.
ms. toller, you will wait until you are asked before responding and you will refrain from using profanity in this court.

but if someone placed a gun to your head and told you to give me the pass code would you die for us?
you aren't asking anything that i haven't already considered and the answer is yes.
i would die before i allow my work to be used in biogenetic warfare.
this information is required if we are to remain part of the alliance.
and our people need that edge if we are to compete.
we're here to build a new life for ourselves a home among the stars.
would you build a home on a foundation you knew would not last?
all the conclusions and results of the previous years are there are they not?
yes, but it's important to know the historical process that led to those conclusions.
you helped hide the truth about what happened by revising your history cutting parts you didn't like.
as far as i'm concerned, that makes you an accomplice after the fact.
but now that another has discovered our truth we may as well acknowledge it.
it is too high a price to pay to do otherwise.
byron, the vorlons changed me more than you could possibly know.
i don't know what it'll do once you get past my barriers and i get past yours.
we don't fit here because we're different because we were made different.
they owe us a place where we can be among our own kind.
unfortunately, sometimes it also brings a new strain of bacteria or a new virus.
my job now is to catalog all those possible infections for the new alliance and compile a complete medical profile on all the member races.
your system may be set up to destroy harmful bacteria on a selective basis.
i'd like to do an analysis of your upper intestinal system.
how many angels can dance on the head of a pin?
that question baffled religious thinkers for centuries until someone finally hit upon the answer.
byron is a sweet, charming, sympathetic man who's trying to create a better world.
he's trouble, and i don't think you should be seeing him anymore.
you needed my help during the shadow war, and i did that.
i put my life on the line, and what did i get?
you were gonna boot me into smaller quarters because i couldn't afford anything better.

computer, is there any reference to hyach-doh in any of the current hyach literature?
and all the while, there was intermarrying between the two sides, wasn't there?
it was a great scandal, but it continued throughout our history.
we killed the hyach-doh, and in so doing, we killed ourselves.
it took us a long time to discover the cause, but now there is nowhere to go.
it would take the resources of several league worlds to conduct studies on your biology, find out what was lost develop a means of restoring it on a planetary basis.
it's too big of a job to be finished in my lifetime, but we could get started.
it is too high a price to pay to do otherwise.
perhaps someday you may forgive us for what our ancestors did.
they owe us a place where we can be among our own kind.
we'll ask to speak to the alliance, put our case before them see if they can be persuaded to do the right thing.
my job now is to catalog all those possible infections for the new alliance and compile a complete medical profile on all the member races.
it's going to be a big job, but i'm looking forward to it.
we can eat of all the creatures who walk and fly and crawl but not of the fish in the sea.

- zack if byron asked me to follow him into hell i'd do it gladly with a smile on my face because i believe in him.
what could you possibly say in five minutes that would change that?
we would like access to your genetic records and medical files so that we can better understand your people and any dangers that might come to us or to you from other species.
until now, we have kept our medical information to ourselves to prevent others from using it against us.
but if someone placed a gun to your head and told you to give me the pass code would you die for us?
you aren't asking anything that i haven't already considered and the answer is yes.
i will arrange to have as many of our medical files as possible transferred to your system.
the material should be there by the time you get back to medlab.
violence is their way, the way of the mundanes who would use us, control us, and kill us because they're afraid of us.
the psi corps has adopted their ways, treating us as the mundanes treat them because they're afraid of themselves and because they don't know any other way.
well, it would be helpful if i had something a little more comprehensive.
all the conclusions and results of the previous years are there are they not?
search all available files for any records from any of the other races.
some have been in contact with the hyach for a long time.

benna began experimenting with jungle magic... using our poor workers here as her first subjects.
unfortunately, the procedures weren't entirely successful, and they've become as you see them--
you see, kahar lahi'ia is a very strong power, and, like most powers, it corrupts the user's personality.
your aunt benna began to behave irrationally, forgetting who and where she was.
we tracked you down with the gift... your aunt had planned to send you on your birthday.
we had an idea that the only way to get benna to return... and to convince her not to use jungle magic anymore... was to bring you here to this island.
mark, jungle magic is very dangerous for any one person to have.
now you have protected it for me for all of these years, and now...
all the excrescence... and microbes out there mean... you've got to respect your cock.
i get fucked off with queers who... act as if their cocks were filthy.
when you take your last shift, we'll be on your wings when you take on your most important test on the road.
as for your charming wife who must play with one man less.
i cannot conceal the feelings of happiness at welcoming the best amateur hockey players from 3 continents who will battle for the chamonix cup underlining excellence in the world of international amateur hockey.
i'd like to thank those from so far off the moscow sputniks who aren't here.
before declaring the fifth chamonix cup open... i'd like to acknowledge the unexpected presence of our remarkable and venerable mayor of chamonix his honour justin hismind and our irreplaceable member of parliament the honourable bernard-olivier parseman.
we musn't forget the incredible involvement and dedication by the editor of the "echo of the alps" and here is the one and only odile tremblette the "passionaria" of hockey!
or: "you and me could go far, if we leave right now."
it doesn't sound like much now, but say it in your own words.
and that's my problem. i expect too much from human beings.
speaking of human beings, do i err or are you bang on the button?
i had a game plan to prepare but i got other plans for the evening.
you make me so happy i feel like jumping in the air!
when two specimens like us go nose to nose we're not exactly swapping recipes.
i just want to say it's real classy of you to help us.
my french contact it's thanks to him you got your bags back has some info that'll knock your sox off.
the thing is that gerard, the guy that robbed you seems to have made an arrangement with one of the boys.
to keep your treasure clean, there's only one person who can vacuum it... you.
i don't know if you understand what i'm trying to say.
i'm an insomniac, i'm the only one he could call at any hour of the night.
the other day, he phoned at midnight, to make me listen to a concerto.
that dope would destroy us... and he was happy he'd been wrong.
then i told him that he wasn't wrong, that he was absolutely right.
that we acted pretty rashly, but never lied to each other openly.
he can't admit... he dropped me when he found out i was hlv-positive.
she told me you use blood types to arrange second marriages?
yes, blood types are more than just different types of blood.
girls of type a like you are so naive and weak.
they're like a fly stuck on birdlime to guys of type b.
i had a near-death experience on the bus when i was little.
when you said you wanted a boyfriend to ride a bus with...
they're not gonna let you pay for those on an installment plan, you know?
have either of you guys noticed we're in a tow away zone?
the man is so dangerous i had to sentence him in a closed court.
we're going all the way on appeal way over your head.
we are here in front of the county courthouse, where, thirty minutes ago... an extraordinary drama took place.
bryan slade, the convicted murderer made a bid for freedom from the courthouse... where he was being sentenced, apparently aided by members of his own gang.
we could try bringing them in on the same chopper slade wants to go out on.
come on, you know he's too smart to fall for something like that.
like i said, i want the chopper on the roof in a half hour.
i want five back packs with enough food for five men... for a week, flashlights, sleeping bags, a compass.
okay, look, let's try the "sources close to the scene" routine.
you know make them think that we know something they don't, right?
i have just been informed by sources very high up in the police department... that something big is about to break.
although i see no unusual activity outside the courthouse, these sources insist that this crisis is rapidly reaching a head...
so, as of now we have heard that at least one hostage has been shot, possibly killed.
and no further word as to the identity of that hostage.
the problem was, as time went on, there were more and more people.
and soon the fairy people had to leave their home in the fairy city.
they moved into the mountains, and into the old forests, and in the caves and in the cliffs.
but the other people always found these places... so the fairy people had to move on.
that's plenty of time to meet the vargas brothers at the delgado hotel and shoot them.
let's take a look at the money we caught them with.
you two seem to have an incredibly calm disposition, almost like you've been through this before.
well, sienna and i aren't very good at staying out of trouble.
the surgeon says it's a nine-millimeter round, and it's the only thing keeping mariano vargas alive.
they pull it out of him, he's gonna bleed to death.
sonny and cher came into this city with the clothes on their back.
when we arrested them, all they had was a gun and that bag of money.
leo and sienna thing on the news-- it doesn't involve me.
police report said you left the keys in the ignition outside the bank.
i think we need to find the source of that cash.
the camera at the atm at the bank was out of order.
horatio's going to want to have another chat with our banker.
mr. adams, leo riggs and sienna stone stole a million dollars in drug profits from this bank.
i am going to examine everything that you seize-- do you understand?
what we've uncovered in the last three years... he'll do more federal time than he ever will for your murder.
it's a mid-shaft, tib-fib fracture with a vascular compromise, meaning the blood supply to the lower leg...
they think they have to take part of the leg off.
we really should let her get some rest, and i do have to change the bandage.
you can come back in a couple of hours and see how she's doing.
pilgrim just isn't the same horse that he used to be.
as a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time for you to see him.
well, if you could just give me a time when you'd be available.
say, am i, am i being too polite here when i say "no" in nevada?
there's this thing on the tv about a guy who does it with geese.
he has this aeroplane, and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom.
- you know, i just think she's got a lot of nerve showing' up here.
draggin' that, you know, poor animal and that child all the way...
a great traveller, interested, not merely a good one... is a kind of introspective.
as she covers the ground outwardly... so she advances towards fresh interpretations of herself, inwardly.
and this is the quality which lends frea starks'books... the memorable poetic density which is their special cachet.
moreover, it is this quality which makes them as fresh and strike...
i've always wondered every time i, you know, when i go into a restaurant... what's the difference between a regular steak and a black angus steak?
i can never taste the difference, but i could swear that one was more tender than the other.
seems to me that the bulls have the best of the time.
just laying around the fields, waiting for somebody to come along and ask them to do their work.
he got on his horse and he rode over there... and he got off, and he walked as far as he could one way.
and then he turned around, and he walked as far as he could to the other.
it's, it's not the same as, as knowing a place like this.
well, sometimes people carry it more on the inside... than the outside.
well, you sit still too long in new york and you get renovated.
why is it, mr booker, that sometimes i get the feeling that you're laughing at me?
now most of the times, a horse, in its own way, can pretty much tell you the whole story... but sometimes they get so messed up in their head that you need more to go on.
now, i don't know how you feel about talkin' about it... and if you don't feel like it, i understand.
i knew she didn't want to be a rancher's wife, but i wanted to give it a try.
i thought maybe she could give music lessons to the kids in town, the school maybe... and that our kids would grow up with my brother's kids and play together.
i know it sometimes doesn't seem this way, but i do understand what, what you're feeling.
when i was your age, and when my, when my dad died...
and i know how, how hard it must be to have lost your best friend... and have your body be different than from how you'd like it to be.
but one day, somebody will look at this extraordinary woman that you're becoming and... all they'll see is how much they love you.
don't you go lookin' here for whatever it is you're lookin' for.
don't make that man go through somethin' that took him so long... to see his way clear of in the first place.
well, once when dad was in india, he, he got lost... way, way up in these mountains.
and when he finally found his way back, everyone said that he had discovered a new route.
- she comes to my door... suitcase and typewriter... and asks where tubab is, and i said, "right here."
and she said, "you're tubab?" i said, "no, my name is robert.
- i want you to come over here and sit next to me.
start right here where the neck is and the head, and i want you to stroke him.
now we're going to show pilgrim here how to help you get on him.
because, you see, there's a point where neither of you is gonna need me anymore.
well, i already know the way, and it's not like i have a job to rush home to.
to tell you the truth, i could use the time alone.
i guess i felt kind of lucky, a little amazed that... a woman like you would want to be with a man like me.
and i guess i thought if i could do everything right...
listen, i, i know that you're being hit with a lot now.
it's hard to think about anything else, but i have to talk to you about pilgrim.
pilgrim just isn't the same horse that he used to be.
as a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time for you to see him.
and i was hoping that you'd come to new york... and take a look at my daughter's horse and possibly do some--
[ chuckling ] ma'am, i'm sorry, but i'm, i'm afraid you've misunderstood... whatever it is you read because that's not exactly what i do.
ma'am, first class to montana is a waste of good money.
well, if you could just give me a time when you'd be available.
-why don't you get inside and-- -[ man #1 ] we're doing the best we can!
it's the only way to load this kind of horse. [ yells ]
do you want to put your music on up here ?
[ man #1 on radio ] and when you purchase your eureka world deluxe vac--
there's this kid at school says we should have imprint-trained him.
says if you do it as soon as they're born, makes 'em easy to handle later on.
- [ knock at door ] - [ annie chattering ]
- [ knock at door ] - [ annie chattering ]
[ woman on radio ] a great traveler, interested, not merely a good one, is a kind of introspective.
as she covers the ground outwardly, so she advances towards fresh interpretations of herself, inwardly.
and this is the quality which lends starks' books... the memorable poetic density which is their special cachet.
moreover, it is this quality which makes them as fresh and--
old hank got us a couple more men to move the cattle.
and what kind of cattle do you raise, mr. booker ?
- i've always wondered-- every time i eat when i go into a restaurant-- what's the difference between a regular steak and a black angus steak ?
i can never taste the difference, but i could swear that one was more tender than the other.
it seems to me that the bulls have the best of the time, just laying around the fields, waiting for somebody come along and ask them to do their work.
you get born a bull, got a 90% chance of gettin' castrated, served up as hamburger or somethin'.
every time i leave the ranch, i hold my breath until i can see the motel.
[ frank ] well, by golly, that's a lot of drive time.
i think it's time you started earning your keep around here.
so when you're not working and you're not doing your therapy,
it-lt's not the same as, as knowing a place like this.
well, sometimes people carry it more on the inside... than the outside.
[ chuckles ] she loves telling' this story... about when he was two years old, he ran off... and they found him sleeping' in the barn... between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion.
he said that horse was protecting' him, and nobody could convince him otherwise.
when i work with a horse, i like to know its history.
most of the times a horse, in its own way, can tell you the whole story, but sometimes they get so messed up in their head that you need more to go on.
now i don't know how you feel about talkin' about it, and if you don't feel like it, i understand,
but if i'm gonna figure out what's goin' on in his head, sure would help me if i understood exactly what happened that day.
he'd be grateful, and he'd take real good care with you.
[ sighs ] ls this how you're gonna make me pay my phone bill ?
i don't think you have to wait to be her age to find that kind of peace.
yeah, but how would you know, unless it was all behind you ?
was i right to bring her here, away from what's familiar-- away from her father, her friends ?
and the more i try and fix things, the more everything falls apart.
and then one day, she looked at me that way, and that was it- [ chuckles ] - for both of us.
i knew she didn't want to be a rancher's wife, but i wanted to give it a try.
it sometimes doesn't seem this way, but i do understand what you're feeling.
it sometimes doesn't seem this way, but i do understand what you're feeling.
and i know how-- how hard it must be to have lost your best friend... and have your body be different than from how you'd like it to be.
but one day... somebody will look at this extraordinary woman that you're becoming... all they'll see is how much they love you.
well, i guess you don't have to figure it out till you get home.
[ tom ] see, when you hit like a windmill ?
don't you go lookin' here for whatever it is you're lookin' for.
don't make that man go through somethin'... that took him so long to see his way clear of in the first place.
[ robert ] so at this point i'm pretty sure i'm lost.
so i stop by this general store and ask if anyone knows the booker ranch.
start right here where the neck is and the head, and i want you to stroke him.
i want you to rub him and feel him all over.
grace, now we're going to show pilgrim here how to help you get on him.
because, you see, there's a point where neither of you is gonna need me anymore.
it's not like i have a job to rush home to.
to tell you the truth, i could use the time alone.
i guess i felt kind of lucky, a little amazed that... a woman like you would want to be with a man like me.
and i guess i thought if i could do everything right--
[ frank ] oh, he probably got held up is all.
[ diane ] no, sweetie, the truth is, he's not real good at good-byes.
we really should let her get some rest, and i do have to change the bandage.
you can come back in a couple of hours and see how she's doing.
well, if you could just give me a time when you'd be available.
say, am i, am i being too polite here when i say "no" in nevada?

seems to me that the bulls have the best of the time.
just laying around the fields, waiting for somebody to come along and ask them to do their work.
he was only 1 8, he had a flat on his little pickup, and--
you know you're not allowed to go swimming in the river.
and then he turned around, and he walked as far as he could to the other.
and then he decided that that's where he was going to settle.
- it's, it's not the same as, as knowing a place like this.
well, sometimes people carry it more on the inside... than the outside.
when i work with a horse, i like to know its history.
now most of the times, a horse, in its own way, can pretty much tell you the whole story... but sometimes they get so messed up in their head that you need more to go on.

but one day, somebody will look at this extraordinary woman that you're becoming and... all they'll see is how much they love you.
don't you go lookin' here for whatever it is you're lookin' for.
don't make that man go through somethin' that took him so long... to see his way clear of in the first place.
and she decided to go to india all by herself without knowing a soul.
uh, she had no place to stay, but she was, she was told to look up tubab.
- i want you to come over here and sit next to me.
start right here where the neck is and the head, and i want you to stroke him.
now we're going to show pilgrim here how to help you get on him.

and this is the quality which lends frea starks'books... the memorable poetic density which is their special cachet.
moreover, it is this quality which makes them as fresh and strike--
i can never taste the difference, but i could swear that one was more tender than the other.
i didn't know there was that much difference between the cows.
just laying around the fields, waiting for somebody to come along and ask them to do their work.
you get born a bull, got a 90% chance of getting castrated, served up as hamburger.
i still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though.
every time i leave the ranch, i hold my breath until i can see the motel.
it's silly for her to be driving back and forth... when she, she don't know her way around that well.
well, that's very kind of you, but really we're fine where we are.
he got on his horse and he rode over there... and he got off, and he walked as far as he could one way.
and then he turned around, and he walked as far as he could to the other.
she loves telling' this story about... when he was two years old, he ran off... and they found him sleepin' in the barn... between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion.
he said that horse was protecting' him, and nobody could convince him otherwise.
well, you sit still too long in new york and you get renovated.
why is it, mr booker, that sometimes i get the feeling that you're laughing at me?
i was studying engineering... and she was studying music, the cello.
and i once heard her play a dvorak concerto... and i thought it was the most beautiful piece of music i'd ever heard in my life.
now most of the times, a horse, in its own way, can pretty much tell you the whole story... but sometimes they get so messed up in their head that you need more to go on.
now, i don't know how you feel about talkin' about it... and if you don't feel like it, i understand.
he'd be grateful, and he'd take real good care with you.
- is this how you're gonna make me pay my phone bill?
i knew she didn't want to be a rancher's wife, but i wanted to give it a try.
i thought maybe she could give music lessons to the kids in town, the school maybe... and that our kids would grow up with my brother's kids and play together.
i know it sometimes doesn't seem this way, but i do understand what, what you're feeling.
when i was your age, and when my, when my dad died...
the same thing could've happened to me... or to frank or to joey.
and it doesn't make any sense to try to figure out why these things happen.
hey, look, annie, i'm not good at this sort of talk.
goes around and round somethin', and never gets to it, so let's just say what it is.
don't make that man go through somethin' that took him so long... to see his way clear of in the first place.
i don't think tom would do anything he didn't want to do.
so i stopped by this general store and ask if anyone knows the booker ranch.
and this, this nice, uh, older gentleman with a bandage on his head... uh, gave me directions.
well, once when, uh, dad was in india, he, he got lost... way, way up in these mountains.
and when he finally found his way back, everyone said that he had discovered a new route.
- she comes to my door... suitcase and typewriter... and asks where tubab is, and i said, "right here."
and she said, "you're tubab?" i said, "no, my name is robert.
start right here where the neck is and the head, and i want you to stroke him.
i want you to rub him and feel him all over.
if i was the best husband i could be, the best father... even, even being a good lawyer only mattered because of what it meant for us.
if i could do all that... it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not.
but... the truth is, you don't know how you feel about me.
you don't know if you want a life with me anymore.
we really should let her get some rest, and i do have to change the bandage.
you can come back in a couple of hours and see how she's doing.
pilgrim just isn't the same horse that he used to be.
as a matter of fact, maybe now's not the best time for you to see him.
well, if you could just give me a time when you'd be available.
say, am i, am i being too polite here when i say "no" in nevada?
there's this thing on the tv about a guy who does it with geese.
he has this aeroplane, and these baby geese all grow up thinking it's their mom.
- you know, i just think she's got a lot of nerve showing' up here.
draggin' that, you know, poor animal and that child all the way...
a great traveller, interested, not merely a good one... is a kind of introspective.
as she covers the ground outwardly... so she advances towards fresh interpretations of herself, inwardly.
and this is the quality which lends frea starks'books... the memorable poetic density which is their special cachet.
moreover, it is this quality which makes them as fresh and strike...
i've always wondered every time i, you know, when i go into a restaurant... what's the difference between a regular steak and a black angus steak?
i can never taste the difference, but i could swear that one was more tender than the other.
seems to me that the bulls have the best of the time.
just laying around the fields, waiting for somebody to come along and ask them to do their work.
he got on his horse and he rode over there... and he got off, and he walked as far as he could one way.
and then he turned around, and he walked as far as he could to the other.
it's, it's not the same as, as knowing a place like this.
well, sometimes people carry it more on the inside... than the outside.
well, you sit still too long in new york and you get renovated.
why is it, mr booker, that sometimes i get the feeling that you're laughing at me?
now most of the times, a horse, in its own way, can pretty much tell you the whole story... but sometimes they get so messed up in their head that you need more to go on.

i know it sometimes doesn't seem this way, but i do understand what, what you're feeling.
when i was your age, and when my, when my dad died...
and i know how, how hard it must be to have lost your best friend... and have your body be different than from how you'd like it to be.
but one day, somebody will look at this extraordinary woman that you're becoming and... all they'll see is how much they love you.
don't you go lookin' here for whatever it is you're lookin' for.
don't make that man go through somethin' that took him so long... to see his way clear of in the first place.
well, once when dad was in india, he, he got lost... way, way up in these mountains.
and when he finally found his way back, everyone said that he had discovered a new route.

and she said, "you're tubab?" i said, "no, my name is robert.
- i want you to come over here and sit next to me.
start right here where the neck is and the head, and i want you to stroke him.
now we're going to show pilgrim here how to help you get on him.
because, you see, there's a point where neither of you is gonna need me anymore.
well, i already know the way, and it's not like i have a job to rush home to.
to tell you the truth, i could use the time alone.
i guess i felt kind of lucky, a little amazed that... a woman like you would want to be with a man like me.
and i guess i thought if i could do everything right...
it's a mid-shaft, tib-fib fracture with a vascular compromise, meaning the blood supply to the lower leg...
they think they have to take part of the leg off.
and i was hoping that you'd come to new york... and take a look at my daughter's horse and possibly do some...
ma'am, i'm sorry, but i'm, i'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read.
ma'am, first class to montana is a waste of good money.
well, if you could just give me a time when you'd be available.
there's this kid at school says we should have imprint-trained him.
says if you do it soon as they're born, makes 'em real easy to handle later on.
oh, there are plenty of signs, just not many of them printed.
why do i get the impression that you're just not driving through?
- you know, i just think she's got a lot of nerve showing' up here.
draggin' that, you know, poor animal and that child all the way...

now, i don't know how you feel about talkin' about it... and if you don't feel like it, i understand.

uh, she had no place to stay, but she was, she was told to look up tubab.
- i want you to come over here and sit next to me.

if someone was fished out of the lake, it has nothing to do with me.
well, when you're a cop, little details tend to bother you.
they called them "witches," and they burned them at the stake.

come three thousand kill, come four thousand kill, there does not exist a man in all the world with greater power than i!
in the second stage, goku also easily beats down maju yakon.
i've always wanted to do this since i was a kid.
the roaring drums, the floats ramming into each another... the heat and sweat it's a magical time for a japoness kid.
we take the good things from foreign cultures and make it the best fair ever.
let's use this fair to show the world a new japoness!
and we choose what is best out of the new things.
isn't that what they meant when they said that "times are changing"?
no matter how times change, or how the world changes the hearts of the people will never change!
besides, there's no way i'm ever going to forget you girls.
and she had surgery to try to correct the problem, but it didn't work.
alan, she's had a really tough time of it at the public school.
and these private schools have become so competitive, they don't need to let anyone in who isn't "perfect".
when i was in school the closest i ever came to that appellation was to be called a "perfect" bastard.
as soon as she was discharged we went to our family doctor but he told us it was too late to prescribe it.
it needs to be administered as soon as possible, but no later than seventy-two hours after the...
at any time while you were being treated, did nurses or physicians bring up the possibility of becoming pregnant from the attack?
my mom and i asked about it, and they said the chances were small.
we went to our family doctor to try to get the prescription there.
that's when they told us that it has to be taken within seventy-two hours.
dr. tusten, ms. bauer is saying that there's no moral debate at play here.
in the catholic religion, human life begins when the egg is fertilized not implanted.
it's a very effective tool for handling the delicate nature of these cases.
in the one hundred and thirty pages of this document does it ever recommend using the morning-after pill?
dr. tusten, in extreme circumstances like sexual assault, many catholic hospitals will make an exception to the provide rape victims with emergency contraception.
catholic hospitals are free to interpret sections of the ethical and religious directives liberally or conservatively.
we at st. mary's take a very strict application of catholic teachings.
tell me, dr. tusten, do you have a set schedule at the er?
now greek gods broke the rules and the laws, but the one thing they respect was power and influence.
and alan, if all else fails, and you think you've lost pretend you've won!
and we simply can't pretend that there is on the basis of sentiment or sympathy.
one of our many rights in this country is what is called "informed consent".
every patient has the right to decide what happens to his or her body.
and to make that decision a patient needs to rely on her doctor to disclose all available options.
do you want chemo therapy or surgery for a brain tumor?
do you want to amputate below the knee and hope for the best and risk death from gangrene?
she was deprived of a crucial medically relevant option because her doctor didn't approve of it.
she didn't choose to receive health care restricted by religious doctrine.
a teenage for example, brought in to the emergency room after a brutal rape.
a teenager who is now left to choose between violating her own moral principals in terminating the pregnancy or postponing college to deliver this child.
i figured this was exactly the kind of story that darcy likes... and this is the part that gets me excited... sink her teeth into.
you know the little artist that can't smile and the supportive school that loves her.
there are now as many starving people in this world as there were people in this world a generation ago.
and yet every year in this country we spend thirty billion dollars on our pets.
this is what barry manilow is, and always has been to beverly bridge!
now, barry manilow didn't care how much makeup beverly wore or whether her outfits were just a little bit too tight for someone her age.
especially coupled with the pain this cat must be in and its remote chance of recovery.
ms bridge, i am sorry for your loss, but i must hereby order that barry manilow's ventilator be shut off.

additionally, we award punitive damages in the amount of two point six million dollars.
i mean, he doesn't walk or move or anything, but he's breathing on his own.
i didn't exactly win the case, but "all's well, that end's well. "
denny, you've been a lawyer in this town for forty years.
i'm sure there are plenty of people who'd willing shoot you.
i have a lot of new ideas, but i can't put them together.
it's been two years since i started to live with kuniko.
kuniko called me and said she had something to tell me.
it's nice to have you as a boyfriend like this... so that i can have someone else as a husband.
the hungry look in her eyes when she looked at me told me that she wasn't a virgin.
her excuse for that was having bad eyesight, but of course, i didn't buy that.
thus when we couldn't make the rent, we were kicked out of the apartment.
kuniko managed to find a job as a live-in cook at the company's dormitory.
she was single, but i figured that she wasn't a virgin.
she had her first lover in her teens, and kept sleeping around with 5 or 6 more of them.
in the bed, i wondered how i had ended up in this house.
this shabby and joyless house started to make me feel like i belonged here.
we brought these children together because we wanted a glimpse of england in the year 2000 the shop steward and the executive of the year 2000 are now seven years old
in 1964 world in action made seven up we have been back to film these children every seven years they are now forty-two
at fourteen he was already an apprentice at tommy gosling's racing stable in epsom at fifteen he left school
this is a photo finish of when i rode at newberry
by twenty-eight he had given up on horse racing my greatest fulfilment in life when i rode at kempton in the same race as lester piggot
i was a naive, wet behind the ears apprentice all my years from seven, all my ambition was fulfilled in one moment and i eventually finished last tailed off obviously but it didn't make any difference to me
just to be part of it to be with the man himself
what will you do if you don't make it as a jockey?
find them, feed them and forget them the other f, i'll let you use your own discrimination but i mean, this one
i tried to do the three f's but i couldn't forget her
i think all marriages go through stages you can't stand each other
i think "oh god i hate him i wish he'd get out"
well with the help of my neighbour, i'm not really a d.i.y type of guy he painted all the back of the house and was going to put a conservatory here but if you look along here we've put a patio in and a pond for the fish
well when we bought it it was very old this was two rooms and we've knocked it completely out refitted the kitchen put all new windows in new flooring, literally everything really
i planted them three trees and they seem to have grown in the last three or four years it has cost us a lot of money to do it yeah a lot of money and now we're penniless!
well i think we over spent about... well a collossall amounts, thousands
yes without question because it is a mill stone round my neck at this time but it's nothing what two years won't achieve through hard work and determination
to help out debbie works the day shift in the cab while tony does the night shift
would everybody please sit round now, get on with their work
i don't want to see any backs to me shouldn't be anybody turning round, tony do you hear as well?
don't turn round again there's only one ambition really, i want a baby son and if i see my baby son that'll be my ambition fulfilled no one knows that, only you now
this is hackney marshes the games that are being played are mostly these are pub teams and i've been playing over here for nearly twenty-eight, thirty years
tony and debbie have three children the eldest, nicky, works as a french polisher
i wanted him to go on the knowledge and become a cabbie
i bought him a bike but i'm quite proud of the way he's turned out he's a very respectable kid very respectful towards people and most of all he's done it all on his own terms
perry, she is just started secondary school and she's a character but she's quite academic minded and hopefully she'll stay on
i'm not saying it's the school's fault, probably a lot of it's her fault but we have tried with her and tried to push her into it and i think she's a bit how tony was
she's just not interested in school which i feel she'll regret later on lovely mate!
i try to discipline them in various areas but at the end of the day it is quite hard and difficult
i'd like to stand up and suggest and lead with an iron fist but
i don't know how you put up with me for so long sometimes i don't know how i stand him
i've been in positions y'know and... well it's hard to say in front of debbie but it's true it's tempting you take the bait
i have often not gone through life with one hand tied behind my back and my character happy go lucky nature and being in positions that i do i find my self caught in trouble
i'm not proud at all to say this but situations arise that...
well it was touch and go whether we carried on from it or not we went through a very traumatic time but then again let he who has never sinned cast the first stone it just doesn't happen with a taxi driver living in essex, it happens with mp's etcetc
i'm not going to hide behind any trees and suggest i'm holier than thou which no doubt i'm not, what i'm suggesting is this is what real life is all about, if i've been caught that's fair enough
i felt that there was still something in the relationship and there was three children involved here as well which is not easy when you've got three young children and there was obviously still something between me and tony and it's not easy to walk away
i could've walked away it's silly but when it happened i felt very strong and i could've walked away but it's not been easy to try again to get over the hurt because i've never done it and i've never been unfaithful
and that's what i found really hurtful and i feel that i'm a good wife and that i didn't deserve it all i understand is, dogs, prices, girls knowledge, roads, streets, squares and mum and dad and love
that's all i understand and that's all i want to understand
at twenty-one tony was earning a bit extra as a bookies runner at hackney wick
go on three chase it come on boy go on three, inside
i look around the wick and close my eyes and hear all the voices of the bookmakers
i've got visions of me running up and down the stairs trying to earn a few quid running all the bets now i've come back here again and it makes me feel like crying
well i love them all there's not one i don't love more than the other, other than my mum obviously but your mum is the root of the tree, you love your mum best
by the time he was thirty-five, both tony's parents had died
"thanks tony, see you after school, be good" and that's the way it was even now
i'll get... emotionally sentimental over my mum and dad that's just because
i'm not trying to keep up with the jones's and make myself any more than what i'm capable of doing but i mean, i can only go so far and i'm only a cabbie, i'm not exactly a movie star
i've done as well as i can go and i think this is the limitations for me now so i'm happy with what i've got if anything else comes along, it's a bonus
well i don't know, i haven't given it a lot of thought 'cause i'm very, very cynical about it
but then you get a certain amount of faith restored in it
i've got friends and their parents are happily married and so it does put faith back into you, but me myself i'm very cynical about it
when i last saw you at twenty-one you were nervous, chain-smoking and uptight and now you seem happy what's happened to you over these last seven years?
i think you can't just walk through a marriage and think once you get married it's all going to be roses and everything forever y'know you have... well everybody has their rows, but we've never yet had a row that we haven't managed to sort out
it's very hard to actually say what it is that goes on between a couple it's either there or it's not and maybe we're very lucky, after twenty years we still seem to have it
what was the biggest shocks to you when you suddenly were confronted with a small baby that you had to be responsible for
panic set in i think that i wasn't going to be able to cope
very little has changed, my life is very much the same as it was then
i've had another baby, we've moved house and that's about all
i've chosen to stay home for the last fifteen years to bring up my children because i wanted to be the one that did it
tom is now sixteen and he's his own man now he's suddenly got confidence in himself now and having being quite a shy child he's now come out of himself and he's his own person
oliver's very individual it's a sort of love hate relationship oliver and i have we don't get on all the time but we still come through most things but it's been a hard battle for him, he's got learning difficulties
and life hasn't dealt too many easy cards for him so its's a lot harder for him
tom will be away at university in another couple of years and they'll all get on and make their own lives
the mid-forties is a crossroads for people as their lives do change and
i don't just want to suddenly find when the children have gone i've got nothing to my life
i'm not very good at sitting around doing nothing, i have to be doing something
i have to have a goal or something to try and achieve
the more she went through the stages of bereavement the bigger the space became
it's an extraordinary experience when you meet someone who is suffering terribly and over the months you see them move on you see them get their life back together again
at twenty-eight, suzy's father died it is terribly hard and even now i still can't believe my father's not here it's still sinking in i think
my mother had been ill before but when i started the course i didn't know quite how ill she was then and we found out she had terminal cancer when i was half way through the course
and i did wonder if i could carry on as it was quite difficult going to the course every week and listening to other people, what they'd gone through, but in a strange way it helped me
so i came through the course and my mother died just after that but i did find it a help doing it as i just felt i wasn't alone and i think that's the whole point of bereavement counselling
is that people feel very alone when they've lost someone very close to them and a lot of people don't have someone to turn to well i was the only child going through their parents splitting up, aged fourteen
i was partner in quite a big law firm and i resigned from that and set up my own company
i tend to specialise in refurbishing old buildings and converting them into offices
it was a very difficult time when rupert was deciding to leave he's got a lot of responsibilities with us and it's not easy starting up on your own
do you ever worry that the roof might fall in and you'll be out of this
yes, i mean it crosses my mind and this last year it's crossed my mind quite hard that we could lose this
i've never wanted to have a business which was dependant on you losing your house but i think ultimately that can always happen
ride, swim, play tennis, ping-pong and i might play croquet something like that
i did have a privileged background but on the other hand i was sent away to boarding school very young which i found very hard to cope with and i'm sure my parents did it for what they felt was the right reason
all i want is to be... to be here long enough to be fit and healthy long enough to see my children grow up to be independant people what i really couldn't cope with was if i died before they were grown up
it's the one thing i think every parent dreads is not living long enough to see their children into adulthood excellent!
well they think they can do everything without you doing it as well
symon was brought up in a childrens home the only child of a single parent
it's not a serious matter the serious point is whether you stay with someone or you leave them since thirty-one
i've got married, had a couple of kids well i don't think there's anybody else i could've ever married except yvonne she gives me my life really because we're together, we have the children and everything
we both sort of drifted apart unfortunately and had our own lives, got married and we met up again nearly six years ago
she already had a teenage daughter, miriam now symon and vienetta have a four year old son daniel
well it hurts me that he wasn't there, but at the same time... he wasn't there, he wasn't there for me or my mum, so...
i never really wanted to see him that's anger inside me, but... personally i'd like to see him just for curiosities sake, but the anger that i've had for how many years is... it's been overgrown by boredom now, i just can't be bothered to look for him
i've still got five children they haven't really taken the break up of my first marriage to well
i've still to get to grips with that, and get to them and make them understand that daddy is still daddy
i don't really want to lose my children, any of them
i still want them to know that i'm there for them at that time i thought maybe two families can meet and everything would be alright but we're not talking about a movie we're talking about life, so
i was going to be a film star, but now i'm going to be an electrical engineer which is more to reality really
by twenty-one symon was working in the freezer room of walls sausages in london
how do you see the future as far as work goes?
well i know i can't stay at walls forever, it's just not me
i couldn't stay there for that long, my mind would go dead but eh...
i think if i really wanted to i could learn a trade, even now
i'm quite happy to stay there, it doesn't look like it's going to close down better the devil you know isn't it
walls did close down and symon had a number of warehouse jobs before he joined yuson, an air freight company as a forklift truck driver
when i was young i used to say i'd never work in an office with all those stuffy people in a stuffy office
i've done enough hard work to realise i've been doing the wrong job for so long now and the brother has big eyes and he's blue, the brother is blue the year before last symon went to gcse maths
same thing as my daughter and they're both swatting here and symon comes up with good grades and he passed it's just give him a kick up the bum to get something in that feild 'cause he's very good
i had one dream when all the world was on top of me and everything was on me and i just about got out everything flew up in the air and it all landed on my head
well i get it from my mum 'cause she loved art always dragging me around the galleries and whatever
was it difficult moving from a home back to live with your mother?
yeah for me because there was so many things i never actually said to my mum that i would've liked to say to her
just things you think about afterwards, it's too late because they're not there any more
i like what you're doing or don't like what you're doing, just ordinary silly things everybodys got to get used to knowing coloured people and coloured people in turn have got to get used to being with white people
'cause if either side doesn't work properly then no side will work properly they're just the same as me aren't they
do you think it's hard being a black man in english society today?
it depends what you want isn't it if you just want to live in the society then no it's not hard if you want to fight the society, yes it would be hard to be honest michael i've never actually taken it on
it's still as tough out there, you're still fighting and you're still having to push yourself 'cause when you've got a job you've always got to try and work harder even at school you've got to... they seem to stereo type you
even when we moved in here, we've had no one speak to us
i suppose they suspect you to be having loud music and parties and that but we're not all the same, you've got good and bad in every nation and y'know, we're just the same as anyone else as far as i'm concerned
i just want to be like anybody else nothing too marvelous
i think really motivation, because... before i never really pushed myself
she looks after me she doesn't just push me, she looks after me she would never let anything be wrong for me she always makes sure that if i go down the road i look alright if i go anywhere i look alright
when he was seven, bruce was at a pre-preparatory boarding school at fourteen, st paul's in london
they don't enforce being upper class and things like that at st. paul's they suggest that you don't have long hair and do get it cut and they teach you to be reasonably well mannered but not to sniff on the poorer people
at twenty-one he was in his last year at oxford reading maths
you can show that this is irreducible then you do a transformation on this point and x = t + two
good that's a nice way of doing it particularly using eisentstien down here, his test is very powerful
well there was one job, i'd like to make maps really and it's nice sort of outdoor life
i didn't think they'd allow somebody to walk in of the street into a classroom
well going to africa and try and teach people who are not civilised to be more or less good
i've had the opportunity to come here for a term and it just so happens the school i'm in has great links with this part of the world
at thirty-five, bruce was teaching in sylhet in northern bangladesh and then i've also got the chance to learn a bit of bangla which is very difficult, i'm not doing very well at
this is bishop challoner roman catholic girls school in the eastend of london it's about a thousand girls, eleven to eighteen and i've been here about five years
it was a chance to go for promotion to be head of the maths faculty and to teach a- level as well
i didn't agree with the conservatives about what they were doing with the black people y'know, the racial policy
i'm an optimist here, i think we can show the way, if you like for developing a more harmonious multi-cultural society
i'm quite pleased in a way that i know an algerian fellow near where i live he will say that in other countries in europe... they are spat at, harrassed and beaten up by the police here he says "i walk down the street and nobody minds"
well my girlfriend is in africa and i don't think i'll have another chance of seeing her again
i do think a lot of people think too much about it
i think i would very much like to... become involved in a family, my own family for a start that's a need that i feel i ought to fulfil and would like to fulfil and would do it well
well not particularly, i'm always optimistic who knows who i might meet tomorrow
i think that's the trouble with reserve you're not rejected but you never know what might've been, but i'm getting better
not many men that will let you put on their make-up
it gives me great pleasure to be here on this joyful and happy occasion to celebrate the marriage of bruce and penelope
we just planned what we wanted and it all worked out very well in the end it was a very enjoyable day
in practical ways i'm better fed, better looked after thanks to bruce, generally better organised than i was before he is very good at financial organisation and... running bank accounts and be sensible when i aren't
but i suppose some of them were crusty old flares, i don't know perhaps they deserved to get chucked out
does he think that the discovery of gold was a good thinkg for the transvaal?
she's very determined and doesn't let things go especially with school, she wants everything to be well done she prepares lessons way into the future
and shes very sensitive and responsive and helps me act in a better way
i can remember also being miserable because i can remember crying
i always seemed to be beaten on and never used to understand why
i'm not talking about love now i'm just talking about generally speaking
i think i do have a greater level of confidence especially in expressing myself and holding opinions
if you saw me running around the cricket field now after a ball it's just comical, it's just a lumbering old man, y'know?
no flowing swoop and hurling in of the ball it's all gone, that lifeness, that youth, it's just gone
i don't want to pin all my hopes on it and nothing happens we are quite old
i can see bringing up teenage children in your fifties might be a bit strange
looking back on your life, half way through say, what regrets do you have?
now i'm married to a lovely person that takes out some regrets that may have been or...
i missed my chance there or something and you never know what the future will hold for you and i think i'm lucky to have found penny
he is the nicest person i've ever met he's just somebody you could rely on the whole time
some people from africa come here but when they go they put their clothes on
jackie, lynn and sue all grew up in the eastend of london and were friends in the same junior school
i think that we all could've gone and not any way that we wanted to at the time within our capabilities
i mean, we chose our own jobs we were able to choose our own jobs quite freely
well we only had a limited choice anyway, truth be told we didn't have a choice of private education because we couldn't have afforded it anyway
i wish i had wanted something that bad that i had to go for it
teaching children the beauty of books and watching their faces as books unfold for them is just fantastic to work with children of that age you've got to love them, and i love children
because of cuts in the education budget, tower hamlets closed the mobile library and lynne went to work in bethnal green
i do regular class visits with nineteen to twenty classes, more than that... coming into the library and within that we do either story telling or library skills but, he couldn't ride it
i've been a governor of schools in tower hamlets for twelve, thirteen years in chair of governor's at the moment
i've been married a year and... a couple of months you do think "christ, what have i done?"
- see i've still got my ideals - and i'm being honest about it!
and my husband thinks the same, at times you think "christ, what have i done?"
lynne married russ at nineteen, they have two daughters, sara and emma
we married young but because we wanted to go out and have fun together and grow together
how do you manage to keep a career going and bring up a family
used by a doctor in medicines in controlled doses is fine fifty percent of teenagers between fourteen and eighteen have tried drugs
i think emma's more like me, sara's much more placid, she's like russ with the girls in their teens now i've looked back and thought
she was a great friend to me as well as a mum probably the best friend i'll ever have it's only two years for some it probably seems like "oh it's a long time"
it's not very long the biggest area of my life that's changed since we last talked is i lost my dad and literally just after 35up went out he died
- not a lot at the moment they're investigating other treatments, but the surgeon said that... he doesn't want to operate at the moment as it's too near the optic nerve well it's never going to go away, i've still got this
vein malformation, it'll always be there obviously i had it from birth
respect there seems to be a great lack of respect for anything
i think that's what makes part of it hard bringing up children hard nowadays because our values are so high and expecting them to maintain those values
i don't know how whatever the reasoning behind it you and russ have made that work
- and that was something that i failed at - and me yeah, it's a failure definitely
if we did all love jeffrey and we all wanted to marry him
i think i know the one that he'd like best and that's her
sue was twenty-four when she married billy they had two children, william and katherine
i think that to get married young there must be things that you miss you must miss that crucial stage of being yourself because the minute you get married you're no longer a single being you're a partnership and that should be the idea behind it
deep down i probably wish i wasn't having to do this
i'd like to still be married and i'd like to have that steady relationship but i'm the type of person that likes to go out and likes to have a good time so it's not that hard for me, but
i think as you get into your forties you start thinking... well, maybe i should slow down a bit
i've been a single parent for a long while and brought them up on my own because katherine was only two when bill left it's been extremely hard and sometimes it's been very lonely
my children probably owe a lot to my mum and dad my mum and dad have been absolutely brilliant
with william, i want him to have a really satisfying career which is something i've never really had for him i would love that, well for both of them but particularly for him 'cause he can go far if he puts his mind to it
it was hard first of all when i gave up work from having a fairly high salary ...to nothing was hard but you get used to it, whatever your circumstances are you live in them, you get used to them and you cope, everybody does
when her children were old enough to go to school, sue started work again she has an office job in the law faculty of the university of london
i've always worked, but... anyone who has got teenagers knows how expensive it is, and there are times when i can't quite manage what i'd like to with them especially school trips and things like that
i've got certain little savings things that i do for them and policies that will come out when they're twenty-one and hopefully things like when they get married or want a car, then... they're the times that are hard when you're on your own
#your guitar, it sounds so sweet# we've all got little secret dreams and i love to sing along with millions of others #it's just the radio# but didn't want to give up work and risk all that to follow the dream
there's still lots of places i want to go lots of wild things that i want to do like jumping out of a plane silly things that you can do but you just never seem to get around too you just never seem to get around to it but i think you should make sure you do
by the time she was thirty-five, jackie and mick had divorced
we decided ourselves, just between the two of us we knew it wasn't going any further we both knew at the end of the day we would be happier leading our own lives
i enjoy doing what i want, when i want and how i want and certainly at the moment i can't see any way around that and it's not to say that that's a forever decision
and this one off, here we go oh yeah had a brief but very sweet relationship result which was charlie cor blimey charlie you just have to clean your teeth, not eating the brush it's the best thing that could've happened to me
and i could never have believed... that i could enjoy a child as much as i enjoy him anybody that wanted to know just got told, i was pregnant
i wasn't with the father, end of story give us a cuddle
we're here living on our own although he's a regular visitor and sees the children quite often
lee when any couple parts, and i don't care how good or bad the terms were there's always a tendency for recrimination
just the usual petty "this was your fault... this was yours... " y'know?
and blaming each other and it took us a long time to realise how much the boys were listening to us
when ian and i split up i went into temporary accomodation and i got housed a couple of miles from here but that was furnished because i didn't have anything to take with me
i was there seven weeks and they offered me this one with the help of family and friends and word goes out
"jackie's needing some stuff" and it all just suddenly arrived the poor, if you don't help them they'd sort of die soon wouldn't they
i don't cope financially, without my mother-in-law... stepping in to fill the gap, i wouldn't be coping
it's really hard to explain it to anyone who's not had to do it but you may, get to a point where... either that bill doesn't get paid or your children don't eat so obviously your children eat
which means my mother-in-law pays the bill or she makes sure that my food's in for the following week so i can pay the bills but it... it's not easy to live like it
she's brilliant if i couldv'e chosen a mother-in-law she's the one i would've chosen she's great for me, she's absolutely brilliant with the children she's just always there when i need her to be
at the moment, a career is probably about the furthest thing from my mind and i don't really know what i'm aiming for, except to get the house together my father had a reasonably good education he never went to the local school
certainly when i was younger it was probably laziness that stopped me when we did the last program there was a comment my father made which was maybe he should've pushed me a little bit harder and i think maybe in retrospect he should've done
and that's probably the one thing i'll do with mine that he didn't do with me
i think i shall push them just that little bit harder
james, you watch, you're catching up to him go on lee
i was working up here until very recently but they discovered i've got rheumatoid arthritis so at the moment that's put work on hold
it's painful, very painful, particularly my hands, feet and shoulders it can be almost crippling at times
i shouldn't really lift lee if lee wants a cuddle he should sit on my lap and i should cuddle him on my lap but how do you tell a four year old you can't lift them
i can't stop being his mum just because i'm not well
yeah infact don't flash back to that at this point please!
just the double chins and the age and... the funny part about it is you don't think about your age until you think about something like that when you think how many years ago that was and it was all so new and so fresh
there still is, oh there still is don't make that mistake mike
i am down and depressed about my illness but i'm certainly not down and depressed about my life
i've got three wonderful boys, i've got a loving family around me
i'm lucky, there's a lot of people that are a lot worse off than i am a lot of people
it depends whether i'll be good enough to do what i want to really do
i would like if i can, to do research the gas in these experiments is a temperature comparable with the sun whereas in a power reactor it'll be maybe ten times the temperature of the sun and we're trying to induce that gas to fuse
by twenty-eight he had moved to america and was doing research into nuclear fusion at the university of wisconsin by thirty-five he was an associate professor there the first one is basically saying that the rate of change of crystal momentum, it's ddt this quantity h-bar k
that is equal to the lorentz force so if you work out the density in any cell...
i've run the graduate program in my department which is electrical engineering
i've been running admissions and dealing with student problems and so on for the graduate program and i've spent the last year and a half writing a couple of books one about this business of using plasmas to process semiconductors
"what do you think about girls?" and i said "i don't answer questions like that is that the reason you're asking it?
yeah i thought so the best answer would be to say that i don't answer questions like that it was what i said when i was seven and it's still the most sensible but i mean, what about them?
nick was only seventeen when i first met him and i knew he was a nice person
i find him very attractive and he uses his intelligence in his relationship with me which is very important
well there's a couple of reasons, one is that these... silly jobs we have demand such an amount of time and such a commitment that it's hard to fit in one also he's such a lively person and he demands so much attention
that he makes it hard to find time for another so i think that's the main reason
i would dearly love to have another one actually no, don't go away with that impression, i absolutely adore children if i could change the world i'd change it into a diamond but i don't think i've done anything that you can call a great success
it would seem really ridiculous to any of my friends who watch this if i said
i'm not expecting to be reported in newspaper headlines anytime soon that's not the limit of my ambition but it's just trying to be realistic
i'm just going to have to try and settle for reasonably small victories they'd like to come out for a holiday in the country when i'd like to have a holiday in the town
it's been five years since i've been back here it's changed quite a lot, it's got more touristy and less like an area that's farmed as every second house seems to be a hotel
it's been rotten for my dad as he's been unable to walk a lot of the time he's had terrible troubles with his legs and of course farming is in a miserable shape so he's retiring and the animals have been sold
andrew's a newspaper reporter he's going to take a job near york he's going to need a base over there, he can't commute from here
well chris was married which is great, she's a very nice wife who is getting better and better at communicating with the deaf
and he works in skipton, he's taking some courses in computers
i'm not sure what but he always says to me that i do computers and i think it's a good idea he does computers so i try to encourage him
yes the hitchin's are certainly largely uprooted from here aren't they
i'm the only child in the village except for my baby brother well this is arncliff school where my brother and i went to from age five to ten and there's the church where we were all christened and everything
well you just look at this place and it's utterly beautiful but... not beautiful in a pretty cutesy way i think of it as being magnificent but rather grim really
i feel as if you could look deep somewhere inside me
i feel like there's some of this in there somewhere and it's rather dour but just wonderful it's very uncomprimising and sometimes it's rather tragic but it makes other places you go seem rather trivial as well
i'm enormously proud of having come from here even the people, the idea of being a dale's person is very important to me what you see that's so magnificent are the clouds sweeping by all the time
air and cloud and water continually sweeping over you there's a poetic side to that, i would be looking at these and thinking now... how does a cloud work?
when you come down to it, what i do when i'm trying to solve equations it's the same equations that describe clouds and water and air flowing around so from a scientific point of view i relate back to this sort of thing
i think about it a lot but i haven't seen the way to do it yet
in some sense it never really belonged to me part of me would love to own a stake in it but i really don't own any of it but the other thing is...
i've had to move out of here and i think that the way the world is it's very hard to stay in one place people are forced to move constantly the history of this century has a lot of examples where people moved or should've
and professionally and in lots of other ways it's really important that people are always thinking about... what's happening around them and how they have to react to it beauty is transient, so maybe we can come by here and visit it
but unfortunately i'm not going to be permitted to be here very much
i don't like the big boys hitting me and the prefects sending us out for nothing
when he was seven, paul was in care in a children's home in london were you happy at the children's home in england?
we didn't mind that really as we didn't know what was going on 'cause i was a bit young then well my mother and father separated originally i think
paul settled with his father and step-mother in a suburb of melbourne what mark has it left on you, the fact that you were brought up in a bad marriage
the only thing i can say may have came from that is my lack of confidence and being able to show my feelings
i can't say i don't want to get married, 'cause i think i do but i want to be happily married and therefore i want to make sure
what was it that you fell in love with, what is it about him?
his helplessness i suppose, brings out the mothering instinct in me can pick him up and cuddle him and he's also very good looking i think but he doesn't agree with me and in the summer he's got this cute little bum in shorts
i can tell quite a few stories here but the one that really irritates me the most is when we have an argument he says
by the time they were twenty-eight, paul and sue had two children
katie and robert when he was thirty-five he brought his family to london for a holiday to show them where he had started out
"when i'm an old man at least she'll come up and give me a kiss and a cuddle"
she is also the shy one of the two which is probably followed after me a bit
well katie loves to shop we're starting to learn more of what we share alike, she's very much like paul and she doesn't quite know what she really wants to do just yet
i really love painting and art and i love music and she has taken to that she seems to have the creative flair what does university mean?
i'm pretty happy with katie and i'm not having a go at rob but i've got fears for robert 'cause he's struggling a little bit and he's had three teachers already lets say they don't know how to motivate him
robert had started school and he was having a few problems he's a square peg in a round hole in the normal mainstream schools so we've moved him to another high school that's a community school which is much more relaxed
at twenty-one, paul was working as a junior partner for a firm of bricklayers by twenty-eight he had gone out on his own as a sub-contractor but it didn't work out
well i've gone from being stable in one job which was the brick-laying, to..
i think i've got to a stage now i just want to stay in work two or three years ago i tried to increase my skills and went to school and did a carpentry certificate as i wanted to work as a carpenter
but i found there was too many good carpenters that were out of work so i didn't go too far with that
i suppose partly it's due to my lack of confidence in myself and the monitors up in the wash room sends the nurse out well there's no talking, no i wasn't talking today and brown sent me out for nothing
i find it hard to express emotion most of the time although i'm getting on top of that
but i can be a pretty angry person and... in the wrong circumstances i can fire up terribly but fortunately it doesn't happen to often these days
at the beginning of this year paul and sue moved to another melbourne suburb
it's like living in a palace compared to our other house it's nearly twice the size
there's probably a few more professional people live around this area
we wouldn't manage just on paul's wage alone it's the difference sometimes between eating not eating and just paying bills most people these days rely on two wages to survive
i've been doing mobile hairdressing now since robert was a baby
with this job i go and cut peoples hair but it's like going visiting all day some of the people don't want me there doing their hair, they just want a chat tell them what i've been up to and for them to tell me what they've been up to
i've got twenty-three thrupenny coins and i don't know how many half-penny coins i have now
i spend, yeah i spend he doesn't save because i don't give him any to save, basically these days you don't get a pay packet, well i get money as i go
paul's wages are paid straight into the bank and it's really no money anymore you don't see it, it goes straight into the bank then all your money comes out it's just pretend isn't it
in their twenties paul and sue sold up bought a van and travelled australia
i think it brought us closer together because we really got to know each other and we relied on each other so much
when i was younger i definitely wanted to move out of melbourne
i would've only needed that encouragement from sue if susan had been exactly the same then we wouldn't be here now
i think as i'm getting older i'm more nervous about doing that
i still know there's a huge amount of space out there
i don't know why but obviously that's important to me it's just such a beautiful country right down to the barren land
what's the most fun in life at the moment for the two of you?
i guess i do feel middle aged but i'm pretty comfortable with it
i always remember when i was younger i always looked forward to getting older and hopefully into my eighties even it's never been something that really worried me one of our ambitions was always just to grow old together that's true, we used to say that
i keep telling my children "isn't it nice to be loved"
to know that someone loves you, it must be really sad for people out there... that have no one, that don't know that they're loved and each day, sometimes you're coming home and think "well they'll all be home"
well you have to have a legal ability in my business, obviously and you have to have a bed-side manner as far as your clients are concerned there's no good being brilliant if you can't communicate with your clients
by thirty-five he had become a partner well i work in the corporate department of a large firm of solicitors in the city that is dealing with things like mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, general corporate advice putting deals together for clients
how has that changed your life or your part in the company?
well it means you're under increasing pressure to produce things quickly
i don't go out and buy lots of expensive dresses, i just buy one or two and i even let her pay for them!
well i suppose the most important thing that's happened is we've had two children one, five years ago, alexander, then a couple of years later, timothy
we have a situation where we retain a babysitter once a week and we make a point that once a week we always go out by ourselves, mid-week and i think that's quite important
do you worry about not having a career and what will happen when the children leave home?
well i do but i've made that decision now and i've come to terms with it if i wanted a career i would but i wanted to be a mother and to be a full-time mother
it's our children's half-term so we decided to spend a few days in new york
i come here from time to time on my work but it's usually very rough but we thought it would be rather nice to bring them with us smile!
i think it's not a bad idea to pay for schools because if we didn't schools would be so nasty and crowded
- and the poor people would come rushing in and the man in charge of the school would get very angry and he would get bankrupt he wouldn't be able to pay all the teachers if he didn't get any money
education is very important and you can never be sure of leaving your children any wordly goods, but at least you can be sure that once you've given them a good education that's something that no one can take away
well alexander is coming up into his teens and he'll be sitting common entrance to go to his next school later in the year which will be a boarding school infact he's down to go to the same school that i went to
timothy is continuing where he is now for a while and perhaps be going through the same procedure
well i think boarding makes you feel self-sufficient and also teaches you to be away from your parents and to live with people for a long time
it's going to seem very very strange but if it's what he wants to do and it helps him to get where he wants to go then i'm prepared to only see him every three weeks
once i had a talk to grevil, he was in my class and
i asked sir if he could put him out of my class as he was always getting minuses
i feel that they are under more pressure to perform now
you look back at us at the age of seven saying... we're going to this school, that university and so on but there have been many places where one could've gone wrong just because you have the opportunities it doesn't mean you will pull through
i've been in my job for twenty years and not really wanted to do anything else when i leave this school i'm going to collet court
and then i would be going to westminster boarding school if i pass the exam and then we think i'm going to cambridge and trinity hall
i now have a career, i'm a barrister other than that life chugs along in varying degrees
when boys go around with girls they don't pay attention to what they're doing for instance my grandmother had an accident, because a boyfriend was kissing his girlfriend in the street
when i leave school, i'm going to the dragons school, i might and after i might go to charterhouse marlborough
i can't remember all the other places as mummy's got so many but those are some of them
charles went to marlborough but he didn't go to oxford instead he went to durham university
i'd say i'm pleased i didn't, because it was very much a sort of... sort of marlborough prep school
marlborough, oxbridge conveyor belt and you get shoved out at the end and what did charles want to do?
it's hard to say probably scribbling away in some basement for some london newspaper or something
charles did scribble away for an east london newspaper he then moved on to the bbc where he became a producer
he is now editor of science documentaries at channel 4 he decided not to take part in this documentary
well we pretend we've got swords and we make the noises of the swords fighting and when somebody stabs us we go "arrghhh!"
neil grew up in a liverpool suburb in the winter if you live in the country it would just all be wet and there wouldn't be anything for miles around and you get soaked if you try to go out
i don't think i ever had any stability to be quite honest
i can't think of any time in my life when i ever did
at twenty-eight he was homeless wandering around the west coast of scotland
if the state didn't give us any money, it would probably just mean crime and i'm glad i don't have to steal to keep myself alive
well i'm still known as an eccentric as i have been since about the age of sixteen or so
i'm not claiming that i feel as though i'm in some sort of nirvana, but
at thirty-five we found him living on a council estate in the most northernly part of britain, the shetland islands the nice thing about here is that you can cut yourself off when you want because there are people living around but they're pretty quiet people
it's an environment which sustains me, it's one in which i can survive
i still feel my real place is in the world where people are doing what the majority of people do and the reason i don't feel safe is because
i think i'm getting more and more used to this lifestyle which eventually i shall have to give up and what would you like to be doing say in seven years?
some of the advantages that residents of the trowbridge area have in comparison with those in other parts of hackney first of all they are geographically isolated they're separated from most of hackney by...
at forty-two he's a liberal democrat member of hackney council he was elected two years ago
while i was in shetland i felt strongly that i should become involved in politics simply because i felt i wasn't acheiving things in the way i wanted to and i could see decisions being made politically by people i felt were not competant to make them
and who i felt were not representing the majority of the public and i felt angry and i thought in my own small way i've got to get in there and i think more people should
i think it's only apathy which leads to bad government at any level
it's like a million miles from the shetland's here, how do you cope with that?
yes of course and if i didn't it would be wrong the councillor who has no nerves is not doing his job it becomes slightly easier after the first time
i'm glad you didn't record my first speech as most of the chamber walked out and i determined like disraeli to say something like
"well you are not listening now but one day you will hear me"
but unfortunately most of the chamber had already walked out so it was hardly worth saying that and also i don't believe that will neccessarily be the case well i'm going to take people to the country and sometimes the seaside
i think it was after the twenty-eight program there was a dinner organised just to say farewell to everybody really
i don't the idea was that we would get together and become friends but i think neil turned up without much notice, i can't really remember
not at all, he was a model host although he did always insist on measuring the amount of bathwater there was in the bath!
and i'm not quite sure why that was, i never actually found out!
i've trained to be a teacher of english as a foreign language been on a number of training courses
i've done that open university degree, that was perhaps the longest of all it was an open university b.a.
all neil's political work is voluntary like the canvassing he did for the liberal democrats at last years winchester by-election he lives entirely on state benefit
i haven't had any paid work apart from a couple of short government schemes
i feel as though i'm a drain on people who are working hard to provide the money it's not that i don't think there should be a benefit service
i think there should be work for all or for as many as want to do it and i'm not satisfied with efforts that... that have been made to provide work for those who want it when i get married i don't want to have any children because
they are always doing naughty things and making the whole house untidy
i don't know what the best stage is for falling in love maybe when you're in love in your teens you really are in love and when you think you're in love later on you're not or maybe i'm still not old enough to really fall in love
i think i'm somehow deficient in... my ability to react to the needs of others through not having had that relationship
i feel, especially sometimes when i'm on my own that i'm losing touch with the way other people live
can i just say neil many thanks for the prayers, they were really nice and thoughtful
i also beleive that as my friends who have been so loyal have... have got to know me better, there's always room to get to know people better that they themselves have been able to... show support and sympathy in the most appropriate ways
i feel incredibly grateful for the opportunity to do what i do
i'm grateful to the people who elected me, i hope i haven't let them down
i don't think there's a councillor in the country who doesn't want to be an mp yet they say every mp wants to be prime minister but i'm quite happy at the moment doing my council work
and trying to serve what i see as a very great need in hackney well i suppose i've done many more things than on previous programs but whether i've changed inside?
well perhaps that's just because i'm getting old but i think... it's made me beleive that things can't be as bad in the future as they have been in the past
i think there are certain short term objectives i have here in hackney and if i can achieve a few of those then i'll be pleased
and they just got it like that because daddy goes to the right club!
in the city where i work there are lots of very successful people from all sorts of social classes and if i was recruiting someone it's not something i would take into account so i think social class distinction has become less important
i've met some really interesting people through my work that are of a higher class they describe things and you know you'll never be a part of that circle but do you want to be?
i think the english classes police themselves in subtle ways if you're working class you're not supposed to want to do anything else and if you do try to do something else then... the other people around you will point out you're getting out of line
in my day young people had to know their place but now they're starting to burst forward whereas before...
"you will go that far and you will stop there and you will not go any further"
if the money's there then maybe that would give you the advantage it might get you into a better school, it might get you into someones law firm if the money's there, but i don't know that it's class as such anymore
nowadays the only excuse for class is ignorance, if that's an excuse there is so much worldwide communication and intra-national communication that people should know enough about how others live for this to not be the case
but i think it does still exist to a certain extent and i would love to see it change but i'm not sure how it can really be done
i think wherever you are there are a range of opportunities and they are obviously limited more limited depending on your background
i think there's definitely a class... maybe i've got the wrong idea of what class is but i think there's definitely an upper class and a lower class here
yes there is a society of class there is the advantaged and the disadvantaged but even from the advantaged we have failures
and you panic and think i should've done something, something dramatic
i was hoping i'd win the lottery last night so i could come on and say that!
i've met some of the most interesting people i know and am still in contact with and this includes people in different parts of the world one or two particularly close friendships have been forged through the program although i was very suspicious when the initial contacts were made
i don't think i'd have kept a record of my life like we have with this program so yes i enjoy doing it but... it's not something that takes a great precedence if you came and asked me if you could do this to my children
i haven't thought, well i have to be doing this by then or... how will this seem to others?
or so on it's just a periodic little intrusion it's the only time when you're a cabbie... instead of you picking up a celebrity and saying "oh you're paul gascoigne!"
it's not a question of liking it, i'm used to it it has to be said that i bitterly regret that the headmaster of the school where i was when i was seven pushed me forward for this series
because every seven years a little pill of poison is injected into..
i think there's a certain amount of excitement there too underlying
i'm old enough to admit it now i suppose no it probably is a bit of good fun some of us don't see family from one year to the next and i think that's how we all feel about each other, that we're linked
we're doing "dreams" on this album and it's called "the legacy".
not only is it special that... it's st patrick's night, that we're here, that we're going to play this song but also, we have a very special guest with us tonight.
lately, he's been in touch with able gelner... a man we've been after for some time.
gelner has been destabilizing friendly third world countries... through the use of his massive financial resources.
he's about to use those resources to fund terrorist strikes... against civilian populations.
we need to get in with him, discover his financial pipeline, and shut him down.
if you choose to use my services... your money will be funneled into segregated offshore accounts.
i stay away from the caribbean and other more visible hubs.
i'm going to need those funds in position by the thirteenth.
i have a client who's going to need them to make a fairly large purchase.
i kept myself alive... by feeding red cell disposable section intel.
they wanted to kill me... when i formed a relationship with one of the soldiers... who eventually went out on his own.
i'll look at this and let michael know how we're going to proceed.
what do i tell michael when he asks where i got the disk?
gelner plans to quietly acquire controlling interest... in the banks of several central african economies.
he will be meeting with the leaders of rebel armies today... to dispense funds for a large arms transaction.
yesterday, in kuala lumpur, we picked up marzio ellis... a well-connected dealmaker who works the pacific rim.
lately, he's been in touch with able gelner... a man we've been after for some time.
gelner has been destabilizing friendly third world countries... through the use of his massive financial resources.
he's about to use those resources to fund terrorist strikes... against civilian populations.
someone pushed a button on this guy in the middle of the operation.
it was like he was hung out to dry... for no particular reason.
to close this deal, he will have to move funds... on three continents in real time.
primary team will be responsible for getting control... of the computer while he's online.
they just delivered the tv an hour ago and, kelly, this thing is so gigantic, it's ridiculous.
i mean, the instruction book is bigger than our old tv.
she's filling out that skirt a little bit too much for my taste.
no, see, i love a little jiggle-jiggle on a first lady.
you know, you really should tell him it's never gonna be a form of currency.
all right, i admit, he's a little out there, but we can't keep cancelling on them.
yeah, and you know, dad, i was thinking, maybe i should just get out of your way around here.
in fact, doug and carrie agreed to let me stay with them until i can afford my own place.
i can take a personal day from work tomorrow, we can check out some of those retirement places.
there's a nice one i deliver to, right off of queens boulevard.
no jumping in line for the bathroom, making me late for work.
and certainly no naked, soapy silhouettes getting me all hot while i'm trying to shave.
you take the kids so they won't mess up frank's car.
well, i'm not so picky now that robert got his stupid cop paint on it.
the real problem is that now your father has the state of new york behind him.
yeah well, they better not try to pass him 'cause he'll flip them off.
i guess all that time he spends with his head in our fridge keeps him fresh.
you know, sometimes i don't see my parents for three months.
raymond, the man is gonna live for many, many more years.
and you'll feel much better once you make your peace with it.
you take the kids so they won't mess up frank's car.
well, i'm not so picky now that robert got his stupid cop paint on it.
the real problem is that now your father has the state of new york behind him.
yeah well, they better not try to pass him 'cause he'll flip them off.
is it possible that he took the term "mud pie" literally?
i'm sure if mr. rich were alive, he would find some humor in that.
according to his police report, mr. rich was a man who could tell a joke.
he grew up here, worked the same fields for 20 years.
according to the same report, the coroner had to hire a backhoe...
to remove the body, which was buried completely in a standing vertical position.
there is some indication that his stepson may have dug the hole...
and that a recent rainstorm may have helped turn it into a muddy trap.
that's why some people thought you might have dug the hole,
or attacked him when he fell in the hole, 'cause he was down there.
i'm still finding it hard to reconcile the facts with the physical evidence.
even if he didn't dig this hole, the disease could have killed root systems,
so you're saying bobby would have good reason to kill his father?
i'm saying there are some crimes where there are only victims.
of the soil and root composition in the rich family orchard,
but could not explain what pulled karin matthews' body into the michigan mud;
nor could the authorities determine how the body of karin's father...
was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier.
this same rage made her imagine victims in the children around her,
trying to instill in them a strength she never found in herself.
what happened to karin matthews in the orchard that night was a release,
release for a victim who, unable to face up to her own past,
is it possible that he took the term "mud pie" literally?
i'm sure if mr. rich were alive, he would find some humor in that.

even if he didn't dig this hole, the disease could have killed root systems,
and the bruise that you found on bobby's father's ankle could've been caused by a root,
the same root system that pulled karin's father from his grave.
you took the shovel to him, but you couldn't do it, so you ran.
you ran to the orchard, but not because you dug a hole or laid a trap.

what happened to karin matthews in the orchard that night was a release,
is it possible that he took the term "mud pie" literally?
well, i'm sure if mr. rich were alive, he would find some humor in that.
would you like me to show you how he may have done it?
how a 6'4", 250-pound man was buried alive in less than five minutes by a 16-year-old kid whose classmates lovingly refer to as "dork-weed"?
they were real close when bobby was little, always kidding around and stuff.
but bobby sort of got into that teenage stage-- he don't want to listen to nobody.
but if they do, and if there's evidence of abuse that you're not coming forward with, it could hurt his chances.
i know everything happens for a reason, but i still don't see no reason for this.
well, even if he didn't dig this hole, the disease could have killed root systems, creating weakened soil.
well, then how did the victim swallow 12 pounds of this stuff?
now, i'll be here for you as much as possible, but they're going to come and ask you some questions, and the most important thing is that you feel comfortable.
if you don't feel comfortable answering them, then i don't want you to answer them, okay?
i'm fairly certain that this man died from a broken neck.
yeah, but there was a substantial amount of blood loss, wasn't there?
and the bruise that you found on bobby's father's ankle could've been caused by a root-- the same root system that pulled karin's father from his grave.
mulder, there is a connection between these deaths, one that provides a clear motive and intent:
this has to do with karin, with her own father's abuse.
it was never bobby that was locked in the cellar, it was karin.
coats grove authorities conducted a detailed examination of the soil and root composition in the rich family orchard, but could not explain what pulled karin matthews' body into the michigan mud.
nor could the authorities determine how the body of karin's father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier.
this same rage made her imagine victims in the children around her, trying to instill in them the strength she never found in herself.
what happened to karin matthews in the orchard that night was a release-- release for a victim who, unable to face up to her own past, was finally consumed by it.
i'm sure if mr rich were alive, he would find some humor in that.
according to his police report, mr rich was a man who could tell a joke.
i've concluded that this man's head was held forcibly down in the mud just a little too long, most likely by his stepson, who was named in the report as bobby rich, age 16.
the coroner had to hire a backhoe to remove the body, which was buried completely in a standing vertical position.
- shall i show you how he may have done it?
how a six-foot-four, 250-pound man was buried alive in less than five minutes by a 16-year-old kid whose classmates lovingly refer to as "dorkweed"?
they were real close when bobby was little, always kidding around and stuff.
but bobby got into that teenage stage and he don't wanna listen to nobody.
i'm still finding it hard to reconcile the facts with the physical evidence.
even if he didn't dig the hole, the disease could have killed root systems, creating weakened soil.
maybe once he sucked down a mouthful of mud, it turned his esophagus into a siphon.
and with his head pushed down, it filled all of his passages like a gas can.
so you're saying bobby would have good reason to kill his father?
i'm saying there are some crimes where there are only victims.
but they'll ask you questions, and the most important thing is that you feel comfortable.
if you don't feel comfortable answering, then i don't want you to answer them.
we spoke to someone who thinks it does, who worked for your father.
according to the orchard man, your father's death ended a blight affecting the trees.
we removed a sliver of green wood from lisa's father's neck.
and the bruise on bobby's father's ankle could have been caused by the root system that pulled karin's father from his grave.
nor could they determine how the body of her father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier.
forensic data is inconclusive, but i believe the explanation lies in hospital records from karin 's childhood, which suggest she herself was a victim of abuse.
this same rage made her imagine victims in the children around her, trying to instill in them the strength she never found in herself.
what happened to karin in the orchard that night was a release.
well, i'm sure if mr rich were alive, he would find some humour in that.

nor could they determine how the body of her father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier
i believe karin's unconfronted rage forced her to face her buried father
this same rage made her imagine victims in the children around hen trying to instil in them the strength she never found in herself
what happened to karin in the orchard that night was a release.
release for a victim who, unable to face up to her own past, was finally consumed by it.
and my job, don't get me started on, because it really annoys me.
i-l was not cut out to be a worker, i'll tell you right now.
and, when you get down to it, handling dirt is, you know... is not my idea of a rewarding career.
it's this whole gung ho, superorganism thing... that... that, you know, i can't get.
i've gotta believe there's someplace out there that's better than this.
otherwise, i would just curl up in a larval position and weep.
we cannot begin to express our gratitude for your heroic efforts.
the private has asked me to convey his most humble appreciation.
i chose you because you were the most pathetic little bug in the joint.
i was gonna let you become part of my most erotic fantasies.
believe me, your highness, we will spare no effort to bring her back.
princess bala is essential to all our plans for the future.
- maybe you were living the high life, but personally, this beats digging.
if you'd ever done a day's labor you'd know what i was talking about.
we are the ones ensuring the future of our great colony.
and when we've completed this magnificent structure, we will reap the benefits:
i want all teams in place, fully prepared, ready to seal the doors here and here.
make certain the digging crew stays on schedule... for breakthrough midway in the dedication ceremony.
actually, now that you mention it, there is a certain strangeness to me.
i mean, it's a, you know, kind of a bizarre quality.
and i'm workin' with a new therapist, you know, terrific, absolutely terrific.
he's been putting me in touch with my inner maggot, which is helping me a great deal.
and my job, don't get me started, because it really annoys me.
i-i was not cut out to be a worker, i'll tell you right now.

i was gonna let you become part of my most erotic fantasies, but now, you can forget that.
you know, i guess what you prefer is old blood and guts.
his idea of a romantic night out is two seats at an execution.
your highness, we will spare no effort to bring her back.
princess bala is... essential to all our plans for the future.
and, you know, the guy flew away when i was just a larva.
and my job, don't get me started on, because it really annoys me.
my whole life, i've never been able to lift... more than 10 times my own body weight.
and, when you get down to it, handling dirt is, you know-- [ shudders ] is not my idea of a rewarding career.
anyone who falls behind is going to have to explain themselves to colonel cutter.
and let me assure you, the colonel is not as understanding as i am.
- everyone has their place, bala-- you, the soldiers, the workers.
now, it's not all that bad being princess, is it ?
it's always slow in here the night before one of those royal reviews.
i guess the soldiers need their shut-eye before they meet the queen.
as you can see, your highness, the battlefield is still fresh in his mind.
so, begging your pardon, but this is the perfect time to debrief the private.
i chose you because you were the most pathetic little bug in the joint.
i was gonna let you become part of my most erotic fantasies.
princess bala is essential to all our plans for the future.
so he kills himself a hundred termites, gets a few medals, then bada-bing, bada-bip, bags himself the princess.
- maybe you were living the high life, but personally, this beats digging.
if you'd ever done a day's labor you'd know what i was talking about.
soldier, the princess is vital to the future of this colony.
she must be returned to take her proper place as queen.
- this is very embarrassing for me, l-- - [ laughing ]
on the other hand, i probably could get used to this.
bala and i, incidentally, are thinking of starting a family, you know, just a few kids-- maybe a million or two to begin with.
and i'm workin' with a new therapist, you know, terrific, absolutely terrific.
he's been putting me in touch with my inner maggot, which is helping me a great deal.

all my life, i've lived and worked in the big city!
which, now that i think of it, is kind of a problem, since i always feel uncomfortable around crowds.

you're really not supposed to smoke here, so why don't we go back where we came from?
and i'll just see you in a couple days and i'll give you some money, all right?
he's at the dog track, blowin' the two grand i fronted him last week.
[ woman on video ] biologists call it a defense mechanism, because it defends the fish against attacks by hungry predators, like sharks.
i don't wanna meet somebody who presents herself in a different way, because then you have two people that are basically lying, gettin' together, talkin' a bunch of crap, you know?
i know this firsthand, because what i've been tryin' to do... is to change my destiny and not just spend the rest of my life being a plumber.
the only reason my mother was on the flight-- she was supposed to be on earlier flight--
but on the way to the airport, her taxi struck and killed a little dog, who was chasing a little furry squirrel, and she was delayed.
the reason why you don't want to come to my rallies is that... you do not like the masses, crowds, whatever.
what do you have against the masses, is what i want to know?
say this was a rally, our relationship, and i showed up to it.
no matter how many signs, how many slogans, how many things i'm chained to...
i was brought up catholic, but we can go into that when i meet you.
[ beep ] i do pull-ups, and occasionally i will do a squat thrust.
- i actually just finalized my divorce, about four days ago. - [ beep ]
- i have to admit i've got some, um, some betrayal issues. - [ beep ]
- someone that likes their mother and hopefully likes my mother. -[ beep ]
reading your ad made me feel like we were soul mates, i thought.
you have any idea what i went through to get this money?
i put my ass on the line and vouched for ya.
i'm the v.p. of operations at the krylex corporation in waltham.
krylex manufactures small rubber parts for a variety of commercial... and industrial products-- products ranging from the small rubber helmets... on wall-mounted spring door studs... to the waterproof gaskets on street newspaper vending machines.
but, consider what the consequences would be without those rubber nubs.
you know, you don't say a lot, but it's pretty obvious what you're telling me.
i mean, you're probably a very nice person, but i have no way of knowing that, you know?
you're all uncomfortable, you're telling all these strange jokes, and why are you trying so hard to impress me?
well, whatever, i mean, whoever said it is not so much important as i remembered it.
but i think of him that way because he's always, always in his books.
and i don't think i had to study as hard as a lot of people--
every night alan was out partying, and i'm at home, directed, and now it's sort of weird.
you know, they, they think that you're a bitch... or that you, you know, that you must certainly be depressed.
i mean, say, say a woman is sitting alone in a bar reading.
you know, a man who comes in, he automatically makes an assumption... that she's either sitting there waiting to be propositioned, and, you know, if she doesn't want it, then there must be something wrong with her,
because, you know, what woman in her right mind... would be content just sitting by herself, you know.
he would take us to ireland in the summers, and he and i would take these long walks, and then we would just sit together staring out at the sea.
he said that if you can learn to contemplate just one beautiful thing every day... that it would give you something very special.
reporter arnie reisman was with the children of the wimble school... and got some of their reactions.
it wasn't just another day for the kids here at the wimble school.
i mean, that was sort of the point of it, i thought.
so you asked me to this fancy restaurant on a date... so i could bring you back your notes.
[ man on p.a. ] grab your binoculars and cameras, folks, and get up on the deck, because in another few minutes, we'll be entering the humpback whale feeding grounds.
what we have here is hands down the best whale watching--
so you are in a two-seater, and it is being flown by my father who weighs 462 pounds, because he lost 10.
and he can't see out of his right eye-- his left--

well, it should be enough to buy an oscillator to extend the range of our radio.
first thing tomorrow morning, i want you to take a little trip to the countryside.
when the americans arrive and the fighting begins, i don't intend to be standing next to a piano singing"moonlight becomes you."
the americans won't even be able to approach this city without our help.
and if they can't liberate sainte claire, the assault into germany could fail.
we need to be gathering information about german troop movements and relaying it to allied command.
temperatures will range from a low of 52 degrees to a high of 7 1.
the northern coast reports heavy rain and strong winds and ocean swells reaching four feet.
ever since my days at the university, i've admired this painting... and now it's mine.
our fellow officers might prefer gold or land, but, for me, the greatest prize of war is art.
but first, tell the guard to escort you to engineering that we need more equipment-- specifically, a type- 3 isolinear emitter.
if he gives you any trouble, say"l can't complete the assignment without it."
we will travel to another part of space, search for new prey as we have always done.
a way of life that hasn't changed for a thousand years.
it's a subdermal transmitter that links your neocortex to the holodeck.
in essence, it makes you believe you're a character within the program.
i have found a way to disable the interface by remodulating one of your borg implants to emit a jamming signal.
once the hirogen have brought you back to the holodeck, the jamming signal will activate within seconds.
that will enable ensign kim and me to deactivate all the neural interfaces.
after captain janeway and the crew regain awareness, you can work with them to mount a resistance against the hirogen.
that should give you and me enough time to enter the building through the storm window on the eastern wall.
when i was there yesterday, i saw guards posted at all three stairways.
so you'll have to reach the second floor through the elevator shaft.
the command post is in the main gallery at the end of the hall.
i'll have access to the medical console for another 20 minutes at least.
that'll give me enough time to get to the bridge and...
the germans must be taking up new positions outside the city.
it looks like they're mobilizing more troops than our sources originally expected.

mr davis is faking an illness, and we'ii be long gone before they discover that there are to davises.
he lust volunteered to stay behind out ofthe goodness of his heart?
it's just that, we don't want everyone to know because this is going really well, and maybe the reason it's going really well is because it's a secret.
i know it sounds really weird, but we're just so bad at relationships.
that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life!
someone ate the only good thing going on in my life!
anyway, people are writing reports for me, uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule,
i'm telling you, you get tough with people you can get anything you want.
she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london!
so that's why she gave you a naked picture of herself.
all right, now, i'm going to get back to my bucket.
i'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs.
anyway people are writing reports for me pushing back deadlines to fit my schedule.
i tell you, you get tough with people and you can get anything you want.
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moistmaker?
do you, perhaps, remember seeing a note on top of it?

how would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here, rachel green?
umm, well i would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.
mental geller, yeah, i always wanted a cool nickname like that.
yeah, the best you got in high school was wet pants geller.
well, when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again, so he offered me a tranquilizer.
and i thought was a good idea so, i took it.

you know, i'm really glad we got a chance to meet each other.
i don't usually do the whole dating thing but when you came up to me in the java man, it was like you knew me.
as long as i maintain my concentration pain has no meaning for me.
by focusing inward, i am able to seek the truth without the distractions of the physical world.
molly, how can you still not believe when the proof is sitting right here in front of you?
maybe because the proof is trying to see down my blouse.
you know, molly may smell like the brine pools of meepus-5...
but i'll take a girl who knows what wine goes with cattle mutilations any day.
history teaches us that men behave wisely once they've exhausted all other alternatives.
for most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority...
so they went their separate ways, dragging their dwindling royalties and bruised egos behind them.
tony sold his yamaha but he still puts "rock star" as his job description.
they treated her like crap, but she loved the music and idolized brian.
that bastard was a near-genius but hell-bent on going the way of his brother keith already dead from a drug overdose.
les wickes was the most pissed off when the band broke up.
he'd been pissed off since keith died and ray simms replaced him.
what he's saying is keith used to sing it with more panache.
you wouldn't know panache if it bit you on the ass, beano.
it's not something you boast about, but i had the condom concession for the balearics.
i personally am in a state of celibacy at this time.
the song always meant a great deal to les but he always hated the way ray did it.
ray wouldn't let anybody else do the lead so they stopped doing it forever.
tell him we're well-established on the british music scene and will live up to their obligations.
why don't you live up to yours and get us out of here?
ironically a week later was the 25th anniversary of keith's death.
because she didn't have a grave for brian karen went to pay her respects.
it just might be too hard, given the history and all that.
this reminds me of the time when i lived on the street.
what if we just called her used a fake name and had her come to my office?
that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
it's just that now that they're in me it's like i know them and...
it just won't be easy when these babies have to go away.
we were just talking about me not going to ross' wedding.
it just might be too hard, given the history and all that.
this reminds me of the time when i lived on the street.
this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.
i called the company that sent her, and they don't care.
i called 911 and they yelled at me, this is an emergency!
they said if i bother them again, they'd call the police.
i said, "you talk to the police, you tell them i'm missing a ring".
usually, when you're done with the pregnant thing you get to do the mom thing.

and i'm invite gunther because, well, we've been talking pretty loud.
just want everybody to know the position of my best man is still open.
and, uh, you know, so is the position of the bride.
wow, this reminds me of the time when i was, um, living on the street.
and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him.
you know, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before.
yeah, and another one had never been to a party before, so...
well, what if we just, uh, called her used a fake name and had her come to my office?
oh, that sounds like fun, but we got a ring to find!
yeah, oh i'm sorry, it must be really hard to hear!
i tell ya, it's a lot easier having three babies play bringing in the noise, bringing in da funk on your bladder!
everything so far sounds great joey, just remember to keep it on the mellow side, okay?
just a couple of guys hanging out playing poker, no-no strippers or anything okay?
all right, okay, this is great, uh, chandler, you get behind the desk.
and-and when she comes in hopefully, she won't recognise you because, well, why would she?
it's just y'know usually when you're, when you're done with the pregnant thing, y'know, then you get to do the mom thing.
i'm gonna be y'know, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking tequila.
look, i know, i know what i got myself into, it's just that now that they're in me it's like, it's like i know them y'know,
i mean-i mean, it's just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.
aww, sweetie, but it's not like you're not gonna have anything.
you're gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways that's even better.

a lot of popular toys these days are remote control, cars, boats, planes, even submarines, but here's my favorite one here.
well, this looks just like the work glove that disappeared out of my locker.
when i turn on the machine, there might be a bright light, so watch out.
and try to figure out which set of lips to kiss.
i know you're messing with me, but i'm still getting a little hot.
you'll be well-informed and it'll show that you take him seriously.
i gotta have an intelligent conversation about stuff that doesn't exist.
i can't explain it, but i sense the presence of an alien.
taylor, have you noticed these aliens seem to eschew well-lit, ventilated housing?
tony's gonna show us two different systems which allow you to anchor yourself to the roof.
there's actually a third system which allows al's mom to anchor herself to a frost-free frigidaire.
... three hours in the morning they had been drinking all night he asked for it...
i like my natural color, but i want to try the more clearly.
i do not know, they invited me to eat at home.
they share a moment short but intense they live with me.
i spent last year on the run, searching for aliens which destroyed my life.
my guide on this journey is a dead prophet named nostradamus.
i saw a friend, bob haber, killed son for 16 years.
i tried to talk to bob, but he had a large scar on his forehead.

i'm tired of being at a school where the kids just think they're cooler than me.
i want to go to one where they think they're smarter than me also.
i've already hidden the keys to the car, in case sandi gets any ideas.
you know, i used to have to beat them off with a stick, too.
the key was finding a way to keep the damn creases from leaking.
you know, i came up with the idea for the suction-powered nail clipper.
maybe i could talk you into letting me keep the house.
does this picture make my nose look too close to my mouth?
it means why don't we see whether you get in to grove hills before we start listening to your opinions.
just because some jock made you feel like the loser you are, don't take it out on me.
try taking your head out of your butt for once and opening up your myopic little eyes.
or doesn't your 165 i.q. make you smart enough to see the way you really are?
and then the other thing is, who came up with the name "tennis bracelet" anyway?
it sounds like some kind of a sweatband, if you ask me.
once they're no longer useful to him, he disposes of them like trash.
he intends on gathering the energy to revive the sealed-up majin boo in the same way.
i think that with the energy being collected from those three in stage 1, there will be nearly enough to fill it up to the top.
if all goes well, majin boo's revival can be realized within the day.
babidi-sama said to be careful since you all have such strong energy, but apparently, you're all just fools!
are you sure it isn't this babidi guy that's the fool?
when boubico was born, he looked old, his skull and skin were wrinkled.
at the age of two, his cheeks were round, peachy coloured, a young man's crop of hair.
i would like to remark that if you had custody over a child, leaving him behind in an orphanage is not appropriate.
with all due respect, haven't you heard of the second world war?
this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will.
i knew ross when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
lately, the show's been about us getting excited to go to london.
and then we realized in real life, we're doing that same thing.
it's weird for all of us to be here without her.
she's in the episode, on the phone and things like that.
it's basically a "let's kick the brits up the butt" episode, really.
you're gonna see a lot of comedy, a lot of romance...
and, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
first one identifies oneself andthenasksfor the person with whom one wishes to speak.

do you think monica realizes how much our parents spent on this?
do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here?
i saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
i was going to say hi, then i figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding, and i have to warn them.
so give me that number or i'll come over there and i'll kick your snooty ass all the way to new gloukenshire!
i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to step aside, miss.
look, if i don't get to london... he is going to marry that other girl!
and, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.

this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will.
i knew ross when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
i need not stress the importance of bringing these two assassins to justice.
we'll seal off the city and go door-to-door, if needs be..., ...but i want them found!
let me lick your lollipop, and you can try my lemon drop.
so if you dip into my cookie jar, then, sugar daddy, we'll go far.
the athens grande royale hotel have graciously extended to us the full utilization of their facilities whilst we are performing in the area.
and i don't want to catch any of you girls in the gambling halls or the taverns.
but the money, the castles, that can't mean a thing to me until i know all the animals of the world are safe and happy.
i guess that's why i turned my gardens into a sanctuary for abused wildlife.
yes, well, as for you..., ...if you wish to have anything more to do with my cupcake..., ...you will have to go through me..., ...you... strapping, young buck.
you can lick my lollipop, and i will suck your lemon drop.
if you'd been a better date, we wouldn't be in this mess.
if i'd been a better date, i'd be picking up a wedding dress.
yeah, she doesn't know you killed your brother and set us up for the fall.
listen, from now on, whatever instinct you have..., ...do the opposite.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
i need not stress... the importance of bringing these two assassins to justice.
we'll seal off the city and go door-to-door, if needs be, but i want them found!

now, then, you go up to your room, and you stay there all day.
and while the rest of us are relaxing in the spa, you should have ample opportunity to discover the ramifications... of your "ingestatory" overindulgence!
so tell me, uh, what else do you like in a man?
well, he-he'd have to be kind to animals too... and maybe a little, i don't know, wild and dangerous.
but the money, the castles-- that can't mean a thing to me... until i know all the animals of the world are safe and happy.
i guess that's why i turned my gardens... into a sanctuary for abused wildlife.
if you'd been a better date, we wouldn't be in this mess.
if i'd been a better date, i'd be picking up a wedding dress.

they both wrote it up clean, they'll fall for a false report charge.

and tim, tim is not laying in that bed with all those damn tubes sticking out of him.
see, i get the car every monday, wednesday and friday from 9 to 12 and from 5 to 8:30.
except for every third wednesday when val needs the car at 8:20 instead of 8:30.
when are you gonna let me tune up your new ride?
my dad showed me how to make a car go 80 miles an hour in first gear.
if you just do me a favour and behave yourself tonight, okay?
i bet you don't even care that i'm parked on gum.
for instance, the other night i went to the movies with your aunt.
and the next thing i know, i'm alone on your front porch.
except for every third wednesday when val needs the car at 8:20 instead of 8:30.
see, and i get it every sunday, tuesday and thursday from 11:15 to 2 and from 7 to 10, except on the second tuesday in november and the fourth tuesday in january,
when are you gonna let me tune up your new ride?
my dad showed me how to make a car go 80 miles an hour in first gear.
when he started singing "i'm in the mood for love," i got woozy.
so until you produce your missing savings account, we're putting a lien on your magic.
look, i promise you can stay in my room forever, okay?
if you just do me a favour and behave yourself tonight, okay?
oh, well, you know what they say about men your age and memory lapses.
okay, if you say so, i'll check into the chess club.
i mean, all i did was almost kill you and mr. kraft.
get back in there and do some more filing, young lady.
when i can't stand somebody i don't even rap with them.
tell me, who's going to take care of the baby if you can't even take care of yourself, fucking squirt.
brother, we are here to get a job, not to start a fight.
and i don't see why you get so uptight... this guy's been trying to grab my meat.
of course, i wouldn't insist just to give you a hard time.
i do it because it's going to be good for us.
what i do dig is that you don't care for me.
if one of these days you end up in the can, what do i do?
megabon, if you see any cops, run over and let us know.
if the pigs show up i'll get the fuck out of here.
you stop at a red light, you go at a green light.
if you cannot agree on the little things, how are you going to manage the big stuff?
- well, it means i would see myself killing the killers.
but the impulse to murder, no matter how justified, was dulled by time and reality.
look, i had this, um... this dog once, this crazy little mutt, and, um... and he got hit by this car, and it didn't kill him, but he's laying there on the ground, a lot of pain,
and he's looking up at me, wanting me to, you know, help him.
- beth botrelle's lawyer, carolyn sherman, is a daily visitor to the prison.
clemency from the governor is now beth botrelle's last and only hope.
you know, in the middle ages, they would often open a hole in an accused person's torso into which they would pour molten lead as an encouragement to confession.
so i suppose, if you viewed it in a favourable light, you could consider this a form of progress.
what is important is that we need to know what was on that piece of paper.
- a woman is sitting on death row 'cause i screwed up.
and the countdown continues towards friday's execution of convicted cop-killer beth botrelle.
- no one gets any pleasure from what's going to happen here.
- what the hell are you doing down here in 27th?
- i'm just passing on the new regulations for petty-cash accountability.
maybe you should take a few days, get out of town till it's over.
- i don't want you to think i'm off my nut.
- you know, we used to watch his movies at the cinema in dawson creek.
few were more surprised than we when he actually became president.
as a matter of fact, he tells me you're one of his finest officers, which dismays me.
it dismays me because i can't have anyone from the cpd making public statements that inflame the situation.
now, the longer we drag this thing out, the more negative pr we attract to one of the greatest cities in america.
- so we should kill her to avoid any bad press... sir?
- well, sir, i first came to chicago on the trail of the killers of my father, and...
- detective, i have never met anyone with as great a capacity to piss off people as you.
you couldn't tell that he didn't mean a single word he was saying.
or that as soon as you were out of his sight, you were out of his mind.
- i was hoping that you'd be able to help us.
for instance, why didn't the subject of detective botrelle's philandering arise in court?
- and you are supposed to meet them within the hour, aren't you?
- yes, i am, at the... at the gladstone, behind the corner of shuster and wayne.
- i don't think this is the time to be discussing that.
i will say that my faith in, and my love for, this country has never been stronger.
- we can't meet him, and if we call him, he'll have us off the street in no time flat.
- exactly, so it will have be someone he could trust.
- we think jake botrelle was having an affair with bedford's wife.
that piece of paper i found at the scene had something to do with it.
a suicide that was prompted by a telephone call from state's attorney bedford... in which jake botrelle learned he was about to be indicted in a kickback scheme.
the piece of paper found under his body was a suicide note, a note that also implicated his partner in the crime,
- not really, ray, actually all that exposition makes me feel a little thirsty.
this scheme was going to be my payoff... and no one's going to take it away from me.
- are you willing to kill all of us for it?
- i was willing to let a woman die for it.
you stop at a red light, you go at a green light.
if you cannot agree on the little things, how are you going to manage the big stuff?
i mean, when it comes right down to it, the question is, could you pull the switch?
look, i had this, um... this dog once, this crazy little mutt, and, um... and he got hit by this car, and it didn't kill him, but he's laying there on the ground, a lot of pain,
clemency from the governor is now beth botrelle's last and only hope.
- against my better counsel, beth has consented to see you.
- no one gets any pleasure from what's going to happen here.
but people should let the state get on with the business of dispensing justice that is the will of the people.
- i'm just passing on the new regulations for petty-cash accountability.
i was in the area, so i thought i'd pop my head in and see how you're holding up.
as a matter of fact, he tells me you're one of his finest officers, which dismays me.
it dismays me because i can't have anyone from the cpd making public statements that inflame the situation.
now, the longer we drag this thing out, the more negative pr we attract to one of the greatest cities in america.
- so we should kill her to avoid any bad press... sir?
- well, sir, i first came to chicago on the trail of the killers of my father, and...
- detective, i have never met anyone with as great a capacity to piss off people as you.
you couldn't tell that he didn't mean a single word he was saying.
or that as soon as you were out of his sight, you were out of his mind.
- i don't know, but that's not the paper i found eight years ago, or the piece of paper you put in evidence bag number 26.
- if you're sure, we better move forward now, 'cause the clock's ticking on that woman.
- well, i'm not exactly sure, to be perfectly honest with you.
there are certain questions that we have that may be answered by the crime-scene tape.
- and you are supposed to meet them within the hour, aren't you?
yes, i am, at the... at the gladstone, behind the corner of shuster and wayne.
- i don't think this is the time to be discussing that.
i will say that my faith in, and my love for, this country has never been stronger.
- we can't meet him, and if we call him, he'll have us off the street in no time flat.
- exactly, so it will have be someone he could trust.
that piece of paper i found at the scene had something to do with it.
he knew that this case would make his career, so he destroyed the piece of evidence that could disqualify him from the case and kill his family image at the same time.
this scheme was going to be my payoff... and no one's going to take it away from me.
- are you willing to kill all of us for it?
cold winds have swept the harvest land... and laid to waste my field of dreams... and scattered wide the ripening seeds which drift to earth upon the morrow... to die, or bring forth choking seeds... and bless the harvest of my sorrow
in december 1 91 7... the great russian composer, conductor and pianist, sergei rachmaninoff... left the finland station in petrograd -
the older we get, the more we lose that divine confidence... which is the treasure of youth
and the fewer are those moments when we believe that what we have done is any good
true, i have my music, and my memories... which i now put down for you, my dearest daughters, and your children
and if it is true that a composer's music is the sum total of his experience... then it must express his love affairs, his religion... above all, the country of his birth
my father had been in the army and married a wealthy general's daughter... which perhaps accounts for my own military bearing
but my father drank, enjoyed his women, and gambled... and soon we were forced to sell our estates... and move to "temporary" accommodation in the great city of st petersburg
here i won a piano scholarship to the conservatory in 1 883... when i was just 1 0 years old
opposite the conservatory was the famous mariinsky theatre for opera and ballet... where the premieres of swan lake and boris godunov had recently taken place
and it was here i realised that i must become a composer
my studies went badly and when my sister sofya died of diphtheria... my mother decided this was the last straw... and blamed my father for our slum-like circumstances
shortly after, she left him, and i never saw my father again
on the recommendation of my cousin, alexander siloti... i was packed off to moscow to study and live with his professor, nikolai zverev... leaving behind my beloved mariinsky theatre
finally, i could take it no more... and moved out to live with my aunt, vavara satina... her husband and her two daughters, sofia and natalya
and every summer, we all travelled to their country estates... at lvanovka, 600 km southeast of moscow
and here, i once again discovered the country fairs... which i had earlier visited with my parents
the sound of gypsies and of the local peasant choirs... made a profound impression upon me
the endless fields ofwheat, stretching as far as the eye could see
the smell of the earth and all that grows and blossoms i felt so good there i could work, and work hard
many artists, orchestra players, young pianists or vocalists... they were directly or indirectly influenced by his figure, his personality
even when he left russia, i think... the remaining energy through the music he composed... was influencing every second or third musician... coming out of schools in siberia, caucasus, or in moscow or petersburg
this is what he brought back to the culture... which again helped him grow as an artist and as a human being
you can't imagine a pianist, a single pianist... who would try to learn something about piano playing... and just passed by without even looking at rachmaninoff
i heard the endless tolling of the church bells... and one day the prelude simply came to me, and i wrote it down
it came with such force that i could not shake it off, even though i tried to do so
on this soil, your great-great grandfather... your great-grandfather and your grandmother were born
and on june 21 st 1 907 your mother, tatiana sergeieva, was born here
on the meadow at the back of the house... we have put up a modest statue of your grandfather
he is conducting the best, and most perfect, orchestra... the orchestra of nature!
so, of course, for the first time, if suddenly... he doesn't wake up at six, in a cold room... with the stress of in about 25 minutes you have to be ready... you have two minutes to wash your hands... then 30 seconds to reach your piano and you have to play one hour exactly
suddenly, he came for the first time to two nice young girls... who were very happy to pamper him... to offer him a rocking chair, to bring his tea for him lt was absolutely an unbelievable discovery
the house itself has been rebuilt exactly on the site of the original
on the veranda, we even found wicker furniture... to replace what we found in photographs
these walls must have been the first to hear your grandfather's music
he chose this room because it is so quiet and solitary its only window looks out over the garden and the gazebo, shaded by maple trees
all these things on the desk your grandfather held in his hands
vavara arkadievna, your grandfather's mother-in-law... was the only person allowed in here when rachmaninoffwas working
the daughters of my aunt, varvara arkadyevna, were not my only loves
there were also the sisters skalon - natalya, ludmilla and vera
i was by now a student at the moscow conservatoire... and when i set to work on my first opera, "aleko"... i based it on a poem of pushkin called "the gypsies"
aleko - still not performed in the west - is only a student piece
tchaikovsky came to the dress rehearsal and was full of praise
but it was anna, the gypsy i lost, who inspired it
feeling well and happy byjust listening - that was his answer to the journalists
"lf you want to know me, listen to my music" - his second sentence
as you know, the symphony has never been performed again in my lifetime... or even published... and i'm pleased to report that the manuscript will never be found
i had, of course, dedicated it to my gypsy, anna lodizhenskaya
i sought refuge at lvanovka... but was unable to compose again for almost three years
but when i did begin again, well, you knowwhat that was!
my second piano concerto, which i dedicated to doctor dahl... who had helped me through this difficult period
and to celebrate, i was incautious enough... finally to marry my cousin, natalia alexandrovna satina, your mother
when i was still in despair about my first symphony... i was taken to meet leo tolstoy, the author of war and peace
it was thought he too might help me restore a little faith in myself
it was suggested that i went to america i had already been - played with the new york symphony!
my conducting career had also flourished - since beginning at mamantov's private opera company... i had already conducted at the bolshoi in moscow... and, of course, at my beloved mariinsky theatre
when i heard that they had looted and burned down lvanovka... and we were forced to continue our winterjourney by sledge
when we eventually arrived in stockholm, we were frozen, homeless and alone
my wife and i, with our two children, settled first, "temporarily"... in an apartment block at 33 riverside drive, by the hudson river... a far cry from lvanovka
a terrible pain in my head resulted in surgery... although the news that i was in hospital was interpreted back in russia that i had died
thomas edison asked me to make some recordings for his new "gramophone"
but i never cared for those... and always destroyed any pressings i thought less than perfect
my concert debut was on december 8th in providence, rhode lsland
little did i know that i was to give over 1 000 concerts in america alone... during the next 20 years
he simply had not the time to put his mind on composing... because he had the family to look after
he even got some money lent to go to america which he repaid later... and actually he was forced to do... the second period of his life as a concert pianist
but now i play it without feeling, like a machine i think i prefer it as a dance tune
but the money was good - what a bourgeois i've become!
to how many human cares... betrayals, prayers and misery... does money bear painful witness?
true, i was feted everywhere, and welcomed by my musical colleagues...
pierre monteux, who had conducted the premiere of "the rite of spring"... the young german conductor, wilhelm furtwängler... even by my fellow exile, igor stravinsky... although he was later to describe me as a "six-foot scowl!"
a widow brought me some baubles to pawn... in lieu of her husband's debt
we found some consolation each summer... by renting a house out at locust point, nj, about an hour from new york city
i employed a russian secretary, a russian cook... and because i had failed my american driving test, a russian chauffeur
chaliapin also gave him lots of pleasure because he was full of funny stories
but nothing could give us back what we most desired, our homeland
at least europe seemed a little closer to russia i loved to sit under the pine trees and just watch the rabbits!
breakfast of tea, with cream, ham, cheese and hard-boiled eggs... once again reminded us of our russia
"at no time, and in no country... has there ever existed a government responsible for so many cruelties... wholesale murders and common-law crimes... as those perpetrated by the bolsheviks
for 1 3 years now, the communist oppressors... have subjected the russian people to indescribable torture
and through a friend, a biographer - who, like so many others, had misrepresented me - l found a site by lake lucerne, hidden in the mountains of switzerland
there's a big flat space right by a precipice, down to the lake i fell in love with the view immediately i saw it
i kept imagining what it would be like to have my own music room... with big windows, with such a view
i've even found a place where l can be buried i should build a house here and call it "senar" -
and he had a very special movement - you know, he had that short hair
irina, his daughter, told me father has two hairs... one is silk and the other one is velvet
it really was like that - lt was silky, and when you went against it, it was velvet
after breakfast he went for a walk around the house and garden... and then he'd practise, and he always started with scales
he was a very good horseman, he was a good rider... but in clairfontaine, he fell off the horse and aunt said that's it, no more
my new boat in senar only cost me 1 600 francs... plus 1 00 francs to the neighbour who drove me to the auction... plus... oh dear, oh dear... 200 francs for the little dog we ran over on the way
despite its great age - l'm talking about the motor, not me - it works magnificently, and if i do change it... it will only be because i want to go faster!
in future, i intend to limit the number of my concerts... or find some cure for old age
music should bring relief lt should rehabilitate the mind and soul lt cannot be just rhythm and colour lt must reveal, as simply as possible, the emotions of the heart
i have made immense efforts to understand the music of today, but i cannot
perhaps it is that the music i care to write is not acceptable today
but time may change the technique of music, it cannot alter its fundamental mission
but i sometimes feel that all my audience wants is noise and excitement
on a recent tour of america, for instance... i played the corelli variations about 1 5 times... but only one of these performances was any good
the others were slapdash i even, the first time in my life, had a memory lapse... and, to the audience's great consternation... tried for a long time to remember what came next
i was usually guided by the amount of coughing in the audience
whenever the coughing increased, i would just leave out a variation ln one concert, the coughing was so violent... that i only bothered to play about half the variations i have yet to give a complete performance
i practise and practise but the more i play, the more i hear my own inadequacies
if i ever do learn to play properly, i'll probably drop dead the next day
but now the blood vessels on my fingertips have begun to burst, bruises are forming
when that happens, i can't play for about two minutes... so i just strum some chords
but take me away from my concerts and that'll be the end of me
calm is departing from those of us in europe, even though war does not come
to be the first to run away would seem improper in every way
this song of praise before the altar... offends us like a mockery
if he were among us now... and could see the achievements... of our glorious age... how brother has come to hate brother... how man himself is shamed!
when i came to england, the first thing i missed were the evening bells lt must be something which means a lot to russians, i don't know
i think he was quite fascinated by death - he didn't like to think about it... i don't knowwhether he was afraid of death... but it occupied his mind, i'm sure, quite a bit
and like the church bells, something in his music came always back to... you are here not forever, so one day you have to face the end is coming
and so we left europe once again... once again bound for america, to los angeles
left my beloved senar, just as we had once left lvanovka
once again cut off from those places which sustained me... gave me comfort
my symphonic dances, which i wrote in america... were a memory ofwhat was, and what might have been
after all, composing is as essential a part of my being as breathing or eating
my music is therefore a product of my temperament... and so, wherever i live, it is russian music
i wish to say, simply and directly, what i feel... and if that be love or sadness or bitterness, well, so be it
this endless concertizing, just to earn enough money to survive ln new orleans, i definitely noticed that my cough was getting worse
soon i shall not be able to get up, sit or lie down
and so, finally... as i end this long letter to you, my dearest irina and tatiana... i feel that my mournful features are clearing
i have signed myself up for a course of "healing by music"
what other function can music have but to make us whole again?
as you know, the title of one of my first published songs... was "the harvest of sorrow"
there are some composers of today, if they could only do it... and there's some very popular people in the last, let's say 20 or 30 years...
look at these young beatles - they have this ability to give you... simple, but beautiful and strong... simple but strong, you know, image i call it a gift.
and you see more and more... and every door opens and you see even more
sergei vasilyevich rachmaninoff died in beverly hills on march 28th, 1 943... a few days short of his 70th birthday
he had composed four piano concertos, three operas, 80 songs... over 1 00 pieces for piano including two sonatas... numerous choral works for the church - and three symphonies... the second ofwhich, rachmaninoff himself conducted the premiere in st petersburg... on the 26th january, 1 908, in the mariinsky theatre
after his death, since return of the body to europe was impossible in wartime... he was buried in a cemetery he and his wife had chosen, outside new york... appropriately called "valhalla" - the place of the gods
well, if you're asking me whether or not you would be successful there,
yale wouldn't have accepted you if they didn't think you could live up to the challenge.
you are gonna live in that house next to my parents until you die or until i die, whichever one comes first.
although, you know, it'd probably be you because you're like, what, 80?
mr. feeny, we know we haven't made life that easy for you these past couple of years.
i mean, when you think about all the stupid stuff we pulled...
i'm very honored to be your valedictorian, and i worked very hard on this speech, however, i'm not going to give it.
'cause i know somebody who could give a much better speech than i ever could.
i intended to take back my hook, but it was hooked with something,
i thought it was a big fish, so i pulled with all my might...
so i stuffed her mouth with a piece of bean curd
then her soul will get out from the top of her head
i have been a soldier, don't worry, this kind of matter won't scare me
master, the dog you love most has just been eaten by madam
i would remind the drazi ambassador that the centauri republic has already signed the declaration.
and if the centauri can sign it, anybody can sign it.
if we don't make it clear what we stand for from the start then we don't stand for anything.
i didn't go through all this just to make a social club or some high-tech store.
now, sooner or later, you're gonna have to use force to make this thing work.
if i were you, i'd be spending my time contemplating that nasty reality and let morality take care of itself.
the abbai delegation will be willing to join the alliance if they can be guaranteed food shipments during winter months.
they have had trouble with the weather, leading to crop shortages.
- somehow, g'kar, i don't think a rewrite will solve the problem.
we may be able to get the pak'ma'ra onboard to help but they are going to need something in exchange.
few weeks back, after they saved your life, mr. president you gave a small colony of telepaths permission to take up residence here.
at the time, they said they'd work to earn their keep.
michael, we know there is a crisis coming between normals and telepaths.
i let them aboard figuring we could keep them in our back pocket until they were needed.
one thing's for sure, though, somebody wanted to stop him from getting here alive.
if we do not find out, then his death will be meaningless.
"i imagine you are finding your principles most inconvenient now, yes?"
he went on for a bit longer, but that was the sense of it.
these people have been victimized by raiders and they deserve every bit of help we can give them.
since this encroaches on drazi space i wanted you to know that we were going in and ask for your help.
and you look into their eyes and there's nothing there anymore.
the rumor around psi corps is that's what happened to mr. bester.
since we have a bunch of them living down in brown sector i went to see them.
did they tell you they're tired of being used by mundanes?
they're gonna need all the help they can get, whether they know it or not.
i came back because i figured they deserve a chance to make this work and i'm gonna give it to them.
it speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion.
it is the language of the heart and the language of the soul.
no matter the pain no matter the darkness, no matter the loss, no matter the fear we are one.
here, gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule that we must be kind to one another.
"because each voice enriches us and ennobles us and each voice lost, diminishes us.
we are the voice of the universe, the soul of creation the fire that will light the way to a better future.
because we're tired of being ordered around by those who cannot hear the song we hear.
tired of being used as cannon fodder as inquisitors, as executioners, and as bloodhounds.
an animal does not do this to its own kind, but they do it to each other.
and they would do it to us, unless we stop them.
their economy gets a periodic boost from the raiders' attacks and they get to stay above it all.
"oh, no, not the drazi, we do not exploit other worlds."
before that happens, though, they're gonna hit the enfili homeworld and wipe out everything in sight as retribution for bringing us in.
kill everybody who might know or find out they were involved.
sorry to bring you out in the middle of the night, but we thought you should see this.
ambassador, good, you should most definitely take a look at this.
they've recently been attacked by raiders that have decimated their homeworld.
now, they have asked for membership in the alliance and for protection.
they were shot right out of the sky with great efficiency.
we have offered your worlds advice and technology offered to help you coordinate food supplies and resources.
could it be because those are your ships coming to attack the enfili?
your ships have been working with the raiders to exploit and terrorize those people for 10 years?
some of you have asked why you should have to sign a declaration of principles before being allowed full membership in the alliance.
what you've just seen fully illustrates the point far more eloquently than i ever could.
and it's gonna stand or fall depending upon what you do over the next six months.
now, sooner or later, you're gonna have to use force to make this thing work.
every race, except ours and the narns, use telepaths in some military or intelligence capability.
the narns don't do it only because they don't have natural-born teeps.
we provided them food, clothing a place for meeting more of their kind.
michael, we know there is a crisis coming between normals and telepaths.
i let them aboard figuring we could keep them in our back pocket until they were needed.
all i'm saying is, let's move them to the front pocket instead of the back.
run rhymes and little songs through our heads, round and round.
all that to keep from picking up what you're broadcasting loud enough to be heard halfway down the hall.
that little personality quirk must have cost you more than a few relationships.
mundanes want us to fill our heads with noise and babble so we won't hear what you're shouting at the top of your minds.
their world is located on the edge of drazi space, but the drazi never claimed it as a protectorate, never shown much interest in the outer territories.
so they are on their own unless we help them out.
so i have no idea how many white stars to send out there to deal with this.
well if you're going to make a point, why not make it so that no one misses it?
i've seen other telepaths who've been through it four or five times.
and you look into their eyes and there's nothing there anymore.
i guess he wanted to know what was on the other side.
they say he was there, inside someone's mind, when they died and he went too deep.
lyta, i know you've had a tough day and you're upset.
but i need you to get past that for a second.
i came back because i figured they deserve a chance to make this work and i'm gonna give it to them.
you do this for me, and i swear, i will never ask you for anything ever again.
no matter the blood, no matter the skin no matter the world, no matter the star we are one.
no matter the pain no matter the darkness, no matter the loss, no matter the fear we are one.
here, gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular truth and this singular rule that we must be kind to one another.
"because each voice enriches us and ennobles us and each voice lost, diminishes us.
tell your friend we will find him two among us who are trained beyond reproach.
they will find for him all the things that are hidden all the things that are dark and all the things that are secret.
the drazi keep all the worlds at their borders beaten down and submissive.
their economy gets a periodic boost from the raiders' attacks and they get to stay above it all.
but he believes the drazi are gonna lead the white stars into an ambush guaranteeing no further interference.
before that happens, though, they're gonna hit the enfili homeworld and wipe out everything in sight as retribution for bringing us in.
now, they have asked for membership in the alliance and for protection.
we asked the drazi government to support our action since the enfili are on the edge of drazi space.
you see, we had information that there may be a larger fleet...
the raiders your ships defeated, do you know if they had a chance to send out a distress signal?
i would remind the drazi ambassador that the centauri republic has already signed the declaration.
and if the centauri can sign it, anybody can sign it.
if we don't make it clear what we stand for from the start then we don't stand for anything.
i didn't go through all this just to make a social club or some high-tech store.
now, sooner or later, you're gonna have to use force to make this thing work.
if i were you, i'd be spending my time contemplating that nasty reality and let morality take care of itself.
the abbai delegation will be willing to join the alliance if they can be guaranteed food shipments during winter months.
they have had trouble with the weather, leading to crop shortages.
- somehow, g'kar i don't think a rewrite will solve the problem.
we may be able to get the pak'ma'ra onboard to help but they are going to need something in exchange.
few weeks back, after they saved your life, mr. president you gave a small colony of telepaths permission to take up residence here.
at the time, they said they'd work to earn their keep.
michael, we know there is a crisis coming between normals and telepaths.
i let them aboard figuring we could keep them in our back pocket until they were needed.
one thing's for sure, though somebody wanted to stop him from getting here alive.
if we do not find out, then his death will be meaningless.
"i imagine you are finding your principles most inconvenient now, yes?"
he went on for a bit longer, but that was the sense of it.
these people have been victimized by raiders and they deserve every bit of help we can give them.
since this encroaches on drazi space i wanted you to know that we were going in and ask for your help.
and you look into their eyes and there's nothing there anymore.
the rumor around psi corps is that's what happened to mr. bester.
since we have a bunch of them living down in brown sector i went to see them.
did they tell you they're tired of being used by mundanes?
they're gonna need all the help they can get, whether they know it or not.
i came back because i figured they deserve a chance to make this work and i'm gonna give it to them.
it speaks in the language of strength and the language of compassion.
it is the language of the heart and the language of the soul.

we are the voice of the universe, the soul of creation the fire that will light the way to a better future.

tired of being used as cannon fodder as inquisitors, as executioners, and as bloodhounds.
an animal does not do this to its own kind, but they do it to each other.

before that happens, though, they're gonna hit the enfili homeworld and wipe out everything in sight as retribution for bringing us in.
kill everybody who might know or find out they were involved.
sorry to bring you out in the middle of the night, but we thought you should see this.
ambassador, good, you should most definitely take a look at this.
they've recently been attacked by raiders that have decimated their homeworld.
now, they have asked for membership in the alliance and for protection.
they were shot right out of the sky with great efficiency.
we have offered your worlds advice and technology offered to help you coordinate food supplies and resources.
could it be because those are your ships coming to attack the enfili?
your ships have been working with the raiders to exploit and terrorize those people for 10 years?
some of you have asked why you should have to sign a declaration of principles before being allowed full membership in the alliance.
what you've just seen fully illustrates the point far more eloquently than i ever could.
i would remind the drazi ambassador that the centauri republic has already signed the declaration.
and if the centauri can sign it, anybody can sign it.
if we don't make it clear what we stand for from the start then we don't stand for anything.

and it's gonna stand or fall depending upon what you do over the next six months.
now, sooner or later, you're gonna have to use force to make this thing work.
every race, except ours and the narns, use telepaths in some military or intelligence capability.
the narns don't do it only because they don't have natural-born teeps.
we provided them food, clothing a place for meeting more of their kind.
michael, we know there is a crisis coming between normals and telepaths.
i let them aboard figuring we could keep them in our back pocket until they were needed.
all i'm saying is, let's move them to the front pocket instead of the back.
run rhymes and little songs through our heads, round and round.
all that to keep from picking up what you're broadcasting loud enough to be heard halfway down the hall.
that little personality quirk must have cost you more than a few relationships.
mundanes want us to fill our heads with noise and babble so we won't hear what you're shouting at the top of your minds.
their world is located on the edge of drazi space, but the drazi never claimed it as a protectorate, never shown much interest in the outer territories.
so they are on their own unless we help them out.
so i have no idea how many white stars to send out there to deal with this.
well if you're going to make a point, why not make it so that no one misses it?
i've seen other telepaths who've been through it four or five times.

do you have any idea how much an interactive holo-projector costs?
besides, it's a relief not to have to listen to him go on.
little did i know... he'd become such an important figure in my life... in all our lives.
morn was always someone we could count on for a cheerful smile... and an entertaining story.
he may have left everything to you but i was his wife.
i could contest the will and tie you up in court for years.
i wonder who came up with the idea of suspending liquid latinum inside worthless bits of gold?
probably someone who got tired of making change with an eyedropper.
if you find it, are you really going to share it with this woman?
i agreed to pay her ten percent so she wouldn't tie me up in court.
the royal family would like nothing better than to see her behind bars.
if you help me apprehend her there'll be a substantial reward.
you figured i could keep the four of them off-balance long enough for them to turn on themselves.
this whole thing was a scam to get them off your back, wasn't it?
two enterprising gentlemen like us could do all right for ourselves.
take that gold dust of yours... it doesn't have to be a total loss.
i hear there's some primitive cultures who consider it quite valuable.
morn, if you're not too busy i'd appreciate it if you did something about the shipment of livanian beets you have sitting in cargo bay 3.
do you have any idea how much an interactive holo-projector costs?
besides, it's a relief not to have to listen to him go on.
it means a great deal to me to see so many people cared about morn as much as i did.
i'll never forget the first time he walked in here and sat down on that very stool.
morn was always someone we could count on for a cheerful smile and an entertaining story.
you might think this place won't be the same without him.
he may have left everything to you but i was his wife.
i could contest the will and tie you up in court for years.
not that i didn't earn it after all you put me through.
if you ever want to set me up again, feel free.
well, i said that we could have the ceremony behind your church.
we are not going to dig a mud pit behind the oldest presbyterian church in san francisco.
where do you think they should hide out in a cave?
i just talked to a friend of mine who does family law.
i mean, we love him more than anything in the entire world.
so we're hoping that you'll think about it a little more.
if they do good without the baby, then next time, who knows?
or the four of us can take the baby to the movies.
well, i know both our families have certain traditions when a baby is born.
and i thought maybe we could work things out beforehand so we don't have to bother the kids with our bickering.
well, first, we dig a mud pit in a forest clearing to symbolize the womb of mother earth.
and then everybody emerges from it one by one re-enacting their own birth.
well, i said that we could have the ceremony behind your church.
we are not going to dig a mud pit behind the oldest presbyterian church in san francisco.
i just talked to a friend of mine who does family law.
and he said the birth mother has a right to change her mind.
sometimes i feel like this is just a trough where we come to feed.
we don't play as many games anymore as we used to.
i don't see why i have to do all the work, dad!
i mean why don't you take it out before you go?
i'm in san antonio one time and i'm walking down the "river walk"
and i realize i'm one of the only asian people around and i look across the river, and there's a chinese restaurant.
and the waitress looks at me and i look at her and we have that "weird moment"...
and i realized it's the same feeling i felt every halloween when i was a kid...
i was never a tough kid, i had one fight my whole life and i broke my hand.
i don't know why the guy was punching me in the hand but, it really hurt.
is the role of father something that's coming naturally to you?
the thing i have the most trouble with is trying to discipline my little guy because everything he does makes me laugh and you don't want to send the wrong message, you know?
it was funny, but i had to be like, "no, that's bad!"
for his birthday, my wife bought him this little plastic tool belt so he can be just like his dad.
i've had moments, though, when i understand what the homeless feel like.
if you want to understand what a homeless person feels like, ask somebody for jumper cables.
i had a bowl of "life" cereal this morning so i'm still coming down from that high.
that's my favorite name of any food out there right now, "life" cereal!
you gotta be a cocky marketing whiz to sell that name to a company.
"we have this new crunchy breakfast cereal but... what are we gonna call it?"
she used to find any excuse to pick on me especially during nap-time.
like i'm the only guy in the world who sleeps naked.
except when he comes home from a keg party and pees out the window then we're not as proud.
i hated going to the gym 'cause every time i go to the gym that one guy's always there, the guy that screams way too much when he works out.
this video be false, was very well done but i think it goes.
the analysis in this tape shows images more than a pixilated video normal and ordinary.
we seldom witness death. 0ften our only experience is from films and television, which can present it as a violent and painful event.
we are reluctant to face up to our own mortality, to confront the truth that in the midst of life, we are in death.
this is what it would look like if you could see the human body cool down over 24 hours.
death comes not as a single quick event, but a slow winding down.
it is difficult to say when every cell in the body ceases to have life.
long before we stop breathing, our brain may die, our personality lost for ever.
but the biology of death can seem cold, and distant from the human story.
(man, german accent) i want to die at home because it is not nice to die in a hospital.
herbie and his wife hannelorre fell in love with ireland, and decided to move here from germany in 1981.
we started filming herbie a year after he learnt he had a fatal cancer.
when you first hear the news, it's like a shock, and you can't really think about it.
there's only a couple of months, and, all the ideas - it's terrible!
the doctors are amazed that his body has been able to cope for this long.
a couple of months ago, we created this small garden here.
i got from a good friend from switzerland a couple of roses and planted them here, because when i die and get cremated,
hannelorre will put the ashes, afterwards, around these roses that you see here.
the modern way to die is often hidden from view in the sanitised world of the hospital.
but we have not always been so uneasy about confronting death.
i must confess to feeling both fascinated and repulsed by this spectacle of death.
for today it's death, not sex, which is the last taboo.
but an understanding of what happens to us when we die can do much to ease our fears and dispel our anxieties.
the human body has many attributes which are unique, but i think our ability to face our own death is perhaps the most remarkable.
herbie, together with hannelorre, has decided to let us film the final moments of his life.
i know i will never see this film in my lifetime.
death seems an entirely cruel and negative event, bringing loss and bereavement.
yet, from the very start, there is a fundamental link between life and death in our bodies.
each one plays a particular role - a heart cell, a muscle cell, a brain cell.
in an incredible act of harmony and organisation, they work together, performing the functions of the organ they belong to.
here, the developing hand grows as an enormous bundle of cells.
then cells are systematically destroyed, sculpting the fingers and the gaps between, in much the same way a sculptor chips away a block of stone.
this process continues throughout our lives, as cells become damaged, or just worn out.
during the course of this programme, around a billion cells in your body will die.
but do our own deaths play a part in the larger human story?
are we like cells in some cosmic machine, our deaths serving a greater unseen purpose?
each one of these babies is unique, the result of the particular mix of their parents' genes.
through evolution, winning combinations of genes get passed on from generation to generation.
this process, which we call natural selection, has speeded up our ability to adapt and evolve.
without sex, and the mixing of genes, we would never have evolved into such complex organisms.
but as individuals, we do pay a price for such success.
0nce you've had sex and passed on your genes, your job is done.
you hand over the genetic baton and the relay race carries on without you.
your own fate is unimportant, and death waits to catch you up.
and our modern medicine has also changed many of the causes of death.
better health care, combined with better nutrition and cleaner water, mean that we now live twice as long as we did a hundred years ago.
we are more likely to die from the diseases of old age, such as cancer, stroke, and the number one killer, heart disease.
today, heart disease kills a quarter of the population in the western world.
(american accent) i was sitting in this chair watching a football game on television.
i got my first surge of pain from my heart to the right side of my chest.
these small arteries, less than a millimetre wide, supply blood to the heart muscle.
here, a tiny blockage is hampering the supply to one of the arteries.
when the cardiologist came in, he had seen my ekg, and he went into the hall with the other doctors and interns and so on,
severe attacks can lead to cardiac arrest, where the heart stops beating altogether.
these days, we can't decide that a person is dead just by seeing if their heart has stopped.
instead, we look to the brain, and to one vital part - the brainstem.
buried at the back of the head, the brainstem is a relic of our ancient past.
millions of years ago, this was all the brain our distant ancestors had.
keeping our heart beating, breathing, regulating blood pressure and the body's temperature.
that's why, when the brainstem dies, doctors can be certain that a patient is clinically dead.
we had a lovely dinner, and herbie had three glasses of champagne.
but when the new year started, he got weak and he got depressed.
you know, i didn't want to live any more feeling like this.
you know, normally i'm not a man who gives up so quickly, never.
in this experiment, we will be able to see the brain at work.
a hundred and twenty eight sensors pick up tiny electrical signals emitted as my brain cells fire.
as soon as i open my eyes, the brain leaps into action.
even the simple task of watching television involves my brain in millions of actions.
from there, the activity moves through the short-term memory areas, and then to the front of the brain, the part actually involved in thinking.
the question is, can we find a single part of the brain that gives me my sense of myself, that makes me robert winston?
but the output - the music, if you like - isn't just about the areas that work, but about the order that they work in.
just as an orchestra can produce an infinite variety of music, depending on which instruments play, and when, so, too, the brain can produce limitless results, depending on the sequence in which the clusters of brain cells connect.
but the brain has more than a hundred musicians making music.
if you counted the connections between cells, just on the surface, it would take you 32 million years.
the weather is a little better, the sun is coming out.
anyway, i'm a man, i like nature, the flowers and the trees, when they start to bloom.
their near-death experiences might offer some insight into what happens in the dying brain.
i was in a motorcycle accident in which i suffered a fractured skull and numerous broken bones in my head.
it was at that point that i felt myself separating from my body and entering into the near-death experience.
i became aware that i was in a tunnel, there's no other way of describing it.
(w0man) we travelled at some great speed and distance through the tunnel.
everything that ever was, is, and will be was contained in this radiance.
nearly all who have come close to death give the same accounts of out-of-body sensations and tunnels of light.
similar experiences are also reported by fighter pilots when, subjected to massive acceleration, they lose consciousness.
the sensations that we have associated with blackout nearly always include a tunnelling of the vision down to a central point where you just have light ahead of you.
so why do extreme g forces and near-death experiences produce the effect of seeing tunnels of light?
as there are more neurones devoted to the centre of our visual field, and less at the edges, the light appears to be brightest in the centre, creating a tunnel effect.
had i had the choice, i would never have wanted to leave.
the sensations of euphoria may be because the brain releases opiate-like substances to relieve the acute distress and pain.
these produce hallucinations in the parts of the brain that deal with memories and emotions.
he said - his breathing was very heavy, and he was feeling very uncomfortable -
when i talk to him now, do you think he can hear me?
the hearing is the last thing to go, even when they cannot speak.
that's why it's so important never to say anything that you wouldn't say if they were in their full senses.
cause of death is this inoperable huge cancer that he had, retroperitoneal liposarcoma.
his heart gave away, then his lungs failed, his liver failed, his kidneys failed.
we find it hard to contemplate our own deaths, to imagine that one day we will no longer live in this world.
but there is a way in which our bodies continue after we die.
the cells in our bodies are made up of atoms which have existed since the start of the universe.
they are constantly being exchanged and recycled, so what today are our bodies were once parts of plants, animals, trees - indeed, other humans.
dear friends, it was herbie's wish to read his epilogue before we spread the ashes around the roses.
in 1981, my wife hannelorre and i decided to go to live in peace and harmony in ireland.
(hannel0rre and herbie) i can look back on many fulfilling years with her.
(herbie) and i thank her, deeply, for sharing her life with me.
she'll grow 28 metres of fingernails, and 950 km of hair on her head... and more than two metres up her nose.
by the age of twenty one, she'll have breathed over 31/2 million balloons of air.
this is something i've never done before in my life, and i never thought i would.
despite my brief experience, i can do a bit of it on auto-pilot.
this kind of driving takes a whole new range of skills.
and you need to be able to use them almost automatically.
to see how busy your brain really is, you have to look at the world differently.
everything that's alive, and some things that aren't, gives off heat.
your brain is managing the body's workforce of 50,000 billion cells.
and most of them don't last more than a few years.
cells are constantly dying... and being replaced by new ones, up to a billion new cells for old every hour.
this means that most of your body is a good deal younger than you are!
they're heart cells, and millions working at once is a heartbeat.
it's your head that rules your heart, as it's your brain that decides what rate your heart should beat at.
there are about 65,000 of them on the palm of your hand alone.
if you're getting too hot, your brain switches on your sweat glands.
so, all that is being controlled from here, inside your head.
and don't think you'll get out of all the hard work by nodding off.
even when we're relaxed or asleep, our brains don't let up.
this contraption is covered in electrodes, picking up part of my own brain's activity.
just as our bodies hide the miracle of everyday life, so they hide from us an even bigger surprise.
it's the story of how we came to be the way we are.
the way we live, the shape we are, even the way we think, was decided for us thousands, millions, even billions of years ago, when the human body didn't even exist and planet earth was unrecognisable.
here we are, 8,000 feet above sea level in america's yellowstone national park.
if you'd been on the planet 3 billion years ago, it would have looked something like this.
the earth was covered in volcanoes, billowing steam and sulphurous water.
had you been standing here, you'd have been present as the story of life was unfolding.
had you been standing here, you'd have been standing by the planet's most advanced life form.
0nce, long ago, this was the most complex life form on earth.
what's surprising is it's still here today, just like 3 billion years ago.
they were almost insignificant, but these tiny changes started an amazing process.
because if you add up enough tiny changes through generations, you get a revolutionary transformation.
yet we carry with us the remnants of what has gone before us in our strange past.
and there is a place we can go to see just one of those remnants, shaped by one of evolution's truly incredible transformations.
this is my ear drum, a thin skin stretched tight across my ear canal.
but what i want to show you lies on the other side of my ear drum.
it's the first in a chain of three bones which transfer the vibrations of my ear drum to receptors in my cochlea.
they are the smallest bones in my body and they're perfectly engineered to perform their task.
yet these bones will reveal how evolution has transformed us, because they were once something completely different.
let me take you back, even before birth, and the bones will tell us their story.
in other words, what we're looking at now is like the embryo of a creature which we evolved from millions of years ago.
it's just as if we are journeying back in time, virtually rewinding evolution to show episodes in the history of life.
the cells that will make them are located here - tiny grooves almost hidden behind that hand.
millions of years ago, the embryo of a distant ancestor of ours would have shared with us many of these features.
as well as giving rise to us, it gave rise to all sorts of other creatures.
in those creatures, these features that we're looking at here have evolved quite differently.
here is its heart and it, too, has a curved spine.
and the tiny grooves here, just a fraction of a millimetre long, have evolved to become not ear bones but supports for its gills.
so, some time long, long ago, this lot and i shared a common ancestor.
and like them, it, too, had little bones around its gills which helped it to breathe.
the rest of our ears, that allow us to balance and walk upright as well as hear, our limbs and hands, our whole body has been shaped by the process of evolution.
everything about the human body has been inherited and adapted from something our ancestors had a long time ago, though they may have used it for something different.
so every part of the human body bears a shadow from our distant past.
evolution has adapted our bodies from those of our ancestors, all the way back since life was as simple as that in the steaming pools of 3 billion years ago.
but to make sense of those time periods and to see them in perspective,
i've brought you here, to a cave deep in the french pyrenees.
and then, late in the afternoon, on june 11th, 1905, having been digging all day, he prepared to go but chose to go by a different route.
as he left, he was passing this wall and something caught his eye.
they are amongst the oldest images made by human beings on the planet.
they are six times older than the pyramids in egypt and eight times older than stonehenge.
quite what they signified to the people who made them, no one knows.
they were a stone age people, and they came here at the coldest part of the last ice age.
a child in a primitive world, the son or daughter of somebody who we would think of as a caveman.
and yet if i had taken such a child and brought it up as a baby in my own house, it would be indistinguishable from my own children.
because by the time these people pressed their hands against these walls, all the changes which make us what we are had already happened.
the evolution of the human body was, to all intents and purposes, complete.
what amazes me more is that, although we've changed so little in so many thousands of years, each of us changes so much in just one lifetime.
we tend to think of growing up as just getting older and bigger.
a caterpillar is an eating machine and that's just what it needs to be, to stockpile the energy it will need to reproduce.
yet, to meet a suitable mate, it may have to travel many miles and it's hardly equipped for that!
from the moment we are born, we are changing... and adapting to life's demands.
and every change we make follows a plan drawn up for us by the millions of generations that have gone before.
in this series, i'm going to show you the science of these changes throughout life.
how our brain cells are wired up when we are children.
well, each tear weighs 35 thousandths of a gramme and is about as salty as this part of the river thames at greenwich.
tears are produced by a gland above the eye which is literally squeezed when we cry, and the tears come down six tiny tubes about the thinness of a human hair.
the truth is a knowledge of the science of life is only made complete by a knowledge of those living it.
the human body is not just a biological machine, it's much more than that - it's a person.
having already mastered the complexities of crawling, he'll be taking his first steps.
when it comes to growing up, 12-year-old beatrice will ride the rollercoaster of puberty.
(marcia) there is nothing in our experience, genetic, metaphysical, emotional, psychological experience, that prepares us for being off the planet.
(marcia) you can look at all of the pictures from space, and there is something about looking out the window that is not describable.
and we'll be living through the ravages of ageing with 76-year-old bud and his wife viola.
they live and work on a farm in the mid-west of america.
i like this because everybody sees that a human can manage an illness like mine.
everybody can see in this film there is a way to make the best from the end of your life.
0ver a hundred million acts of sexual intercourse take place each day in the world.
these result in around 910,000 conceptions and, nine months later, 400,000 babies.
stack a hundred ultrasound pictures together and a new image emerges:
a remarkable three-dimensional picture of a child yet to be born.
today, new technology is letting us see the world of the unborn in a completely new way.
it also lets us retrace its past from a baby just before birth to a foetus of thirteen weeks.
and further back, unravelling the dazzling complexity of the embryo at six weeks... and four... and three...
..until we're back at the beginning, with the cells that start the whole thing off.
by filming every two weeks, we squeezed the nine months it takes to create a new life into less than a minute.
having a baby is a common enough experience and we feel we know a lot about it.
and even when we live through it, experiencing the months of pregnancy first hand, our bodies still conceal the marvel that's going on within.
in this film i want to look at that time afresh, over a single day... and over 300 days.
we'll follow the complexities and difficulties of the beginning of life.
we'll condense a year into just a few minutes and reveal how, moment by moment, month by month, a struggle to be born unfolds.
i think we decided fairly quickly not to have them straight away.
yeah, but it was never an issue as to whether we would or wouldn't, i think.
(jeff) i assumed very much that as soon as phillippa came off the pill that getting pregnant would be a piece of cake, but i'm not sure that's the case.
well, i definitely thought, because all my previous experience has been about contraception and how important it is,
the more you read, the more you talk to other people, you discover that it's actually not that easy.
and, er, my opinion at the moment is that i wonder how people actually do get pregnant.
there are only about 30 days a year when a woman has a chance of becoming pregnant.
and even on one of those days a whole chain of unrelated events needs to click into place.
success depends on a cycle that's been part of a woman's life since puberty.
with a new medical imaging technique developed especially for this series, we can see inside phillippa.
nestling deep in her pelvis lies phillippa's uterus - her womb.
it's a mass of muscle in which a baby could one day grow.
and though it's never been shown on television before, you're about to see what ovulation looks like.
we're inside one of the fallopian tubes, heading towards the ovary.
it looks enormous, but it's actually only a couple of millimetres across.
the end of the fallopian tube rubs against it in time with the woman's pulse.
a strand of sticky, almost see-through cells is pulled away by the rubbing fallopian tubes.
they're nurse cells, up to five million of them, ready to feed and nurture the egg.
as the egg is pulled from the ovary into the fallopian tube, the race to pregnancy has begun.
inside the folds of the fallopian tube, the egg and its sticky entourage are squeezed along.
the white fluid they're in is mainly nutrients for their long journey ahead.
at orgasm, huge muscular contractions propel the fluid on its final ride through the man's body and into the woman's.
within minutes, the walls are littered with the corpses of millions.
and within an hour most of the 500 million sperm that set off are dead.
yet the woman's body can help, as well as hinder the sperm's progress.
it's possible the contractions of her orgasm help to draw sperm into her uterus.
0r even that the junction between the vagina and the uterus, her cervix, is dipped time and time again into a pool of waiting sperm.
it's also likely that in the hours after sex the uterus itself contracts, helping to carry the sperm on their way.
then, minutes, hours or even days after they started out, the sperm that have struggled so far will find what they set out for.
deep in the folds of the fallopian tube, here magnified a thousand times - an egg.
as they get near, the sperm are lured towards their goal by a chemical signal sent out from the egg.
each sperm carries in its head all the genetic information the man will contribute, and this now needs to meet with the mother's genetic information waiting inside the egg.
suddenly one of the sperm, which has been burrowing into the wall of the egg, breaks right through.
inside the egg, the genetic information is gathered in two tiny balls.
and the instant that happens the unique inherited characteristics of a new life will be fixed.
all the information from phillippa and jeff is now there to determine whether their baby will be a boy or a girl, tall or short, have blue eyes or brown.
and the whole of pregnancy is shaped by a similar kind of parasitic relationship.
unlike the leech, the developing embryo doesn't suck the mother's blood.
but it does raid her blood for the raw materials it needs to grow.
from the word go, both leech and embryo are out for themselves.
but, surprisingly, the army of foreign cells does not meet any resistance from the mother's own defence systems.
if anything else grew inside her at the same tireless rate, it would either be killed or eventually it would kill her.
quite how the embryo pulls off this life-saving trick remains a mystery.
it's around now that a woman may for the first time sense there's something going on in her body.
i tend to get up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom anyway.
and i woke up and i suddenly had this urge to try out the pregnancy test kit.
so i was rattling around in the dark, opening drawers and bashing away, and i'm not quite sure what jeff thought was going on.
then i disappeared into the bathroom for ten minutes and, i mean, this was all at four o'clock in the morning and i crawled back into bed, sort of said,
this long column is the foundation of the nervous system and the brain.
the basic layout of the body is from a very early stage quite familiar.
by six and a half weeks, that makes the head, on the left, disproportionately large.
all four limbs have sprouted, though the right arm is hidden behind the umbilical cord.
five out of six embryos will not have survived up to eight weeks in the womb.
it's almost impossible to see a developing feature and not imagine it finished.
but the truth is this will only become an eye if luck stays on its side.
every moment we watch, this embryo is taking another step into uncharted territory.
the rest of pregnancy will be chiefly devoted to getting bigger.
and it must get a very great deal bigger, because the scale of these pictures is deceptive.
all that we've seen so far is in a foetus no bigger than this.
this is a model of a twelve-week foetus and it's tiny.
what's so remarkable is that something this small can cause such an upheaval in its mother's body.
my breasts got a lot bigger very quickly and that was the first thing i noticed, which i wasn't prepared for.
because, obviously, you look at all the pictures of the week-by-week guide and it's always the tummy growing bigger, and they really don't concentrate on that part of the anatomy at all.
so i got a bit, not worried, but a bit sort of surprised that it was so immediate, because you know that they would get large, but i didn't think it would be at the beginning.
before she was pregnant, her breasts were actually colder than most of the rest of her body.
in the first three months of pregnancy, a surge of hormones causes the blood vessels around the breasts to expand.
extra blood flow in these hot, red areas feeds the breast tissue as it gears up to provide milk.
the breast is made up of a mass of tiny glands.
from very early on, the glands can begin to produce milk, filling the tubes and making the breasts very sore.
that's why painful breasts are often a problem in early pregnancy.
first you're worried you're gonna die, then you're worried you're not.
early in pregnancy the mother's body seems to become much more sensitive to the waves of chemicals flowing through it.
many mildly toxic things, which we normally eat and drink quite happily, can throw the pregnant body into fits of nausea.
but the good news is that most women feel better by about twelve weeks.
although you're not exactly home and dry, after that things are much more stable for both mother and foetus.
so, if the world of the mother can be horribly uncomfortable, what about the world of the foetus?
their heart, which is bigger than you, would be thundering away.
around you would be metres and metres of arteries and veins, filled with someone else's blood.
and in the last twenty years the tool that's done most to show us that is ultrasound.
developed to help doctors screen for potential problems, it allows parents-to-be to see what their baby is up to.
instead of lying quietly, it's having a go at a kick or even a somersault.
it gulps and swallows up to half a cup of amniotic fluid every day.
