so rong feng and mo tian have opened an opium house here
they are new here so no wonder they pay respects to our teacher
i am not causing trouble here just asking my brother to go back
i tell you you are not allowed to come here again
your kung fu has progressed dramatically now you could counter my attack
i have not progressed that much just that, you don't seem to be as powerful as you were it must be due to the opium
to burn down the place is wrong and i could compensate you but you needn't beat him to a pulp
money is not everything you also asked a great instructor to back you up and teach his pupil to commit arson
a hundred taels of silver it could last you your whole life
i hope when i come here next time i wouldn't see you
whatever it takes, however long it takes, you're gonna love me as much as i love you.
i hope you have enough love for both of us, because i've decided to accept your proposal.
however, our tests show that she has suffered no severe brain damage.
but i have no idea how long she'll be in a coma.
you know, it's a vey strange thing, but the more i say no to you, the more interested in you i become.
as you know real well, i'm the only one that won't take your "no" for an answer.
just like you'll never let go of your children, you'll never let go of blake carrington.
are you afraid that you're gonna lose me to the memories of blake and my children?
the start-back campaign is gonna take a man with power, influence and respect throughout the state.
the committee came up with a name of one man who fits the bill.
i have a vested interest in this state, in this county.
i don't think one needs to be obvious to be paid attention to.
i've never known you to take a back seat to anything or anyone.
dex, blake may not have been the committee's unanimous choice, but he is the best man there is for the job.
i need you to think back and see if there's anyone that you ever talked to who knew matthew and lindsay and me.
someone who knew us well enough to know that i called him lancelot and who hated me enough, for whatever reason, to do this to me.
now, this could never have happened if blake had only listened to me about that peter de vilbis.
now, i ínsíst, krystle, that you have hím call me the ínstant that he comes ín so that i-
you can scream at people all you want, but the truth is, alexis, if you hadn't come between fallon and me, none of this would have happened.
coming between fallon and you was the best thing that i ever did.
oh, but don't wory, adam, i wouldn't think of putting you out of your misey.
i'll lust make sure you're put away the rest of your life.
kirby's life and the life of my child were in danger.
see how far you get with that kind of confession under those circumstances.
steven, i don't expect you to understand what i did to mother, but keep this in mind.
alexis is not quite as innocent as she would have us believe.
you know, kirby, i don't think you should rush into things.
are you talking about my walking or my marriage to adam?
marcia, would you ask tracy to step in here for a minute, please?
mr. carrington, i am flattered, honoured that you want me for the job.
tracy, if kystle weren't my wife, frankly, i'd be offering the job to her.
but i'm not. i'm offering it to you, and i want you to take it.
mrs. colby, i told you i would be in touch with you if there was any new information.
doctor, look, if there's anything that i can do to help you help my daughter, fly in other specialists from anywhere in the world, other equipment, will you please tell me?
and the thought that carrington has the inside track on contracts, handshakes, deals, why, she won't be happy until she gets him out of that position.
i know there's no love lost between you and carrington, so why the concern?
i just don`t wish my son to see the bloodspots on me
but you just let someone`s children see blood all over their father
but if you don`t deliver an imperial decree no one would listen to me
well, l`ll deliver a decree tomorrow to... grant you the title, ` 9 thousand years` and handle the affairs on my behalf
i told you not to talk about killing in front of the kid, but you don`t listen
i don`t wish my son would do the same when he grows up
i've just been handed a traffic report from the ruc to say that there's been an accident on the m1 at the moira roundabout where an articulated lorry is blocking two lanes in a south-bound direction.
it's hoped that everything will be cleared up within the next hour.
the one class of people who shouldn't be given a gun.
you know, daddy, he can spin a great yarn when he gets going
i have a good mind to pay you off here and now.
the army says, we'll have to get that place bricked up now.
the autobots create an astonishing illusion to trap the trecherous decepticons.
and optimus prime risks his very existence as the decepticons rocket back to cybertron with enough energy to rule the universe.
party people, if you're ready to rock let me hear you scream
if you really, really came to party then let me hear everybody

if you ask me, boy, i ain't too sure about you
listen, bloat-o, with your big fat suit next time say no, don't send no substitute

and just clap your hands, everybody and let me know that i'm not alone
and if you knew my man when he was alive scream it out and say, "ramon!"
so after this, there'll be no more hard times no more bad times, and no more pain
no more chump change, none of that bull just movies, museums, and the hall of fame

you have been one of the faithful that have helped our parish the most.
and i believe that god wouldn't approve if you're not there in the front row.
an unhealthy passion corrupts the mind... and might break your vows.
keep in mind that only a few days are left for you to be ordained.
but the truck needs some fixing and decided to do right here instead.
so i can stay with you for 2 or 3 days.
patsy maynard, she used to be my favourite country weastern star.
you tell her you`re her mother she`ll just go away with you.
and people hear all kind of things you only listen when it`s good.
well let`s say at first i heard it and then i started listening.
if he saw me pour it and the glass is empty, you must have drunk it.
yeah, yeah right, maybe i should take a drop of this coffee here.
- having to be both mother and father to a girl, hasn`t been easy.
oh yeah, i know, remember when i used to listen to the country songs all day, about heartache.
sara`s coming to town tomorrow, and she`s going to walk out on me, just like you did.
do you want her to have the kind of life you had these last years?
you know nick, your mama must have a lot of guilt, giving birth to someone like you.
be out of here in five minutes, or l`ll throw you out.
[ woman ] so what's on the big agenda for today here in, uh--
[ man ] well, i think that, uh, we're gonna go uptown.
vice cop who deals with dopeheads, pimps and scum all day?
he'll be lucky if he gets a chance to see the boy once a year.
caroline, let's stop this nonsense and get back into-- and another thing, scrub.
you speak to caroline like that again, and i'll wrap you around your endangered species briefcase.
yeah, i'm gonna haul mendez in, and i'll get the location for calderone out of him.
i'll catch up with you in a couple of hours downtown.
i immediately get in the guy's face, ask him, " who's the yo-yo in the button-down shirt blowin' kisses at you from the bar?"
then i'd accuse him of being a cop, and then i'd storm out of the joint... and refuse to even talk to him for at least two weeks.
we were sittin' on frito and perez for about a week.
some middleman called, offered to set him up with a couple of guys and three keys of coke.
i thought you said when you phoned we was gonna do some business.
yo, man, you better be glad i'm a pisces and don't offend easy.
i couldn't help overhearing on the radio earlier... about a couple of colombians that got bumped this morning.
now, i may be able to do something for you on that one.
when i got in the streets, i thought i could use my old connections to help me out, but i don't know nobody... and that's the square biz, homeboy.
i must have lost my mind givin' this grease stain 60 bucks.
# every day we pay the price we are the livin'sacrifice #
# life is worth much more than gold # what's the setup?
none of my men are risking their hides for some lowlife.
unless you've a better idea in mind, i'd like to move on now.
# i said, hey, baby, by the way, what's your name #
# she said i go by the name of lois lane #
he's being pretty tight-lipped about how he's gonna set up shop.
we got a loose tail set up on brickell... about three blocks short, if he decides to make a move.
vice cop who deals with dopeheads, pimps and scum all day?
he'll be lucky if he gets a chance to see the boy once a year.
yeah, they're still working on the car and the hotel room.
they got fingerprints on the car, and the hotel room's a bust-out.
listen, there's some frozen perch in the hold when elvis gets hungry.
s.i.d. found this in the trunk of the shooter's car at the motel.
i'm gonna pick up caroline and billy at the safe house and take my family home.
yeah, i'm gonna haul mendez in, and i'll get the location for calderone out of him.
kai and liang got hung up on the plane, and we were the last ones to get off.
well, frankly, when you said you might be bringing someone with you, i, uh...
speaking of which, dr. gerard, did you really order an inflatable raft... from the white saddle sporting goods company?
well, uh, uh, i might want to go camping someday, hmm?
one of the grad students will jump at it, believe me.
[edmund]jess, why don't you forget the hotel and stay with me?
but i can assure you, mrs. fletcher, i am fast and i am accurate.
as a matter of fact, as you can see, i can even talk and type at the same time.
little nell, poor thing, knocked off a trolley, derailed by the basest of human emotions... jealousy.
half-mad, half-crazed with grief, she raised the pistol to eye level and...
and the victim, that villainous blackmailer haskell, was shot in the temple, the bullet coming out of the base of his skull... a downward trajectory.
haskell, of course, would have had to be down on the floor on his hands and knees like a puppy dog, that is, if nell had actually been sitting in a wheelchair.
several nights ago, a woman by the name of allison brevard... was murdered by an intruder in her townhouse.
now, would you like to come with us, or would you prefer that i place you under arrest?
maybe it was a setup to make it look like one.
and maybe tolliver was waiting for her, not to rob her, but...
jessica, allison brevard was delightful... when she was sober, which i'll admit was not very often.
we had dinner a few times, and that was the extent of it.
if i had, she might not have been willing to talk.
excuse me, lieutenant, but if you're suggesting that david killed her, wouldn't that have been awfully stupid?
she and jack are separated, and he's been hounding her for weeks.
david, she said that she had proof... that you couldn't possibly have killed allison brevard.
it was finally turning into something, and that's why all this talk about allison brevard is so much nonsense.
the night allison died, lila and i were together the entire night.
ayoung woman is married to a very violent and jealous young man.
she longs for love and affection, and he is unable to provide it.
he knows that "a" will have an alibi, that "b" won't.
he knows that c's alibi is such that he's unable to reveal it, and that d's alibi is so suspect that it would be worthless.
by the time i got back to the hotel, you'd already gone.
i was just running in the door when i heard you scream.
it didn't last because lila wanted to get out of it, but todd wouldn't let her.
he's more subtle than her husband, jack, but i think perhaps just as dangerous.
she was so terrified of her husband, she was always looking back to make sure we weren't being followed.
jessica, i know i acted foolishly, but i think it did serve one useful purpose.
burglary division got some leads on the jewels that were stolen from the brevard woman.
they backtracked to a fence who led them to a three-time loser who was on parole.
amelia, i know how you feel, and i feel just as shocked as you are.
but lt. andrews is seeing a waiter from the lumberjack inn.
[jessica continues] you made a fuss about some purchase that he'd made.
you're the only one who could have known about that place.
oh, that's very kind, amelia, but i really need someone full time at the hotel.
and it seems to me you've got your hands full right here.
i don't mind competing, mrs. fletcher, as long as i'm given equal footing.
you'd be surprised how prejudiced some people can be, although it's more noticeable among male employers.
but, uh, really, i've never worked with a secretary before of any sex.
"and believe me, this has nothing to do with your skills, but i just would feel... more comfortable with a younger man."
i thought you looked a little too professorial to be a student.
[todd] just wanted you to know that my wife and i are both fans.
and maybe tolliver was waiting for her, not to rob her, but...
well, i suppose that you have evidence to support all these maybes.
if i had, she might not have been willing to talk.
excuse me, lieutenant, but if you're suggesting that david killed her, wouldn't that have been awfully stupid?
she and jack are separated, and he's been hounding her for weeks.

knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
the worst thing is that the only information we could get... from the one you picked up was his name, rank, and serial number.
he's a member of a quasi-military group... dedicated to overthrowing the island of mandominow.
the only thing is it appears to be a legitimate company.
and as far as we know, the van could've been stolen from them.
michael, i know how important this case is to you... but may i be so bold as to recommend caution?
devon, you can recommend anything you want... but that poison gas was meant for me.
but i still don't know where he is, that's the truth.
okay, if you hear from him, anything at all, you call me at this number.
i'm a man of considerable patience, but once that patience... has exhausted itself, it's replaced by a rage... the like of which you have never seen.
now i'm going to ask you one more time and one more time only.
yes, a small one, but certainly large enough for a private jet.
michael, if you're thinking what i'm computing, i'm afraid it's a long shot.
chalaxa is the perfect place to milk the orchids... and mass-produce their venom.
one fluid ounce has the killing power of 25 gallons of cyanide.
and i can assure you that the concentrated injection... will work much faster than the one diluted in the orange juice.
don't tell me i've died and gone to that hot place.
(male narrator) knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
if you've got to waste time, devon, there's no better place to do it than in new orleans.
i'm sure you're right... but you've been tailing this willis character for almost 24 hours now... and all you've got to show for it is a tour of the city.
i want to believe you but i've got to have proof.
and at this moment, the foundation must concentrate all its efforts on this key.
i'm being suspended here... and you're worried about a key they found on willis.
michael, the police have requested... that i use all our resources to discover exactly... what this key unlocks.
unless i'm mistaken, chuck, at this point you're simply one of the many... candidates being considered for the job.
well, that's true... [beeping] but when chuck wallyburton goes after something... he usually gets it.
well, you realize, of course, that we are still in the process... of interviewing possible replacements.
well, like i always say, why shop for ground round... when you've got top sirloin right on your plate?
if you can trust me, it doesn't matter who i am.
now, i'd like to trust you... if only you hadn't put what you did in my drink the other night.
i was doing everything that i could to support the two of us, and....
well, then along comes boyd... and promises that if i would just move in with him... that he would take care of everything, and....
trihydrosulfate-g... is an experimental genetically-engineered amino acid... being tested as a bacteriological agent.
it is quantumly more powerful than anything that is presently in use.
if one liter were accidentally released into the atmosphere... no living organism within 1,000 square miles would survive.
kltt, get me a site map of the fire mountain facility.
lasalle wouldn't even get 30 days... for masterminding the theft of a can of shaving cream.
but once the trihydrosulfate-g is in his possession... we'll have him right where we want him.
i truly hope part of your plan wasn't to have devon monitor our position.
well, it was, kltt... but after what lasalle said, i couldn't risk linda and her daughter's life.
he's made no secret of the fact, but even he didn't do you justice.
well, in an anxiety-provoking situation such as this, one tends to respond with exaggerated compliments.
i say by the end of the evening you two will be thick as thieves.
only if we can't resist the temptation to pig out on cheesecake.
nonsense, the wine and your verbiage went perfectly with our meal.
listen, why don't you two have a seat and i'll get us a fine cordial.
mother, i can't believe this of you, a woman who has always been the most gentle, rational human being i've known.
my dear boy, you know i would never follow through on my threat to kill her.
doctor crane, i'm sorry if i made a bad first impression, but i think, no, i know, it was a wrong impression.
i may be a diamond in the rough now, but i'm a dreamer, and i have a habit of making dreams come true.
he's made no secret of the fact, but even he didn't do you justice.
well, in an anxiety-provoking situation such as this, one tends to respond with exaggerated compliments.
i say by the end of the evening you two will be thick as thieves.
only if we can't resist the temptation to pig out on cheesecake.
i wanted to save you from ruining what could be a brilliant career.
i just can't stand the picture of you being married to a pseudo-intellectual barmaid.
my dear boy, you know i would never follow through on my threat to kill her.
as i was pricing revolvers this morning, i realised how irrational my feelings were.
i may be a diamond in the rough now, but i'm a dreamer, and i have a habit of making dreams come true.
when and if i marry frasier crane, i will be the kind of wife and family you'll be proud to know and claim.
i still feel the warmth of your face in my lap and of your wet hands... which make me so strong that i believe i have to shout aloud... and squeeze everyone half to death so they can share our love.
when we were cuddling in our little tent... so that we both were not cold anymore... you and me and eternity was all that was left.
now everything is so easy and so clear and i'm not afraid anymore.
let's not be sad anymore or cry either, will you promise me that?
i am quite sure our child could not have lived... at your mother's who was not allowed to know of our love.
but if we still love each other in a few years, we will have a baby.
i swear that i will leave schabbach... and the horrible hunsrück.
in particular, i will leave my mother's house... and i will never come back.
i solemnly swear to do all this... as soon as i'm 19 and my exams are over.
i was the only one in the class to be orally examined in religion.
but the image fails... because a vine can't go to heaven, can it?
the theme is freedom of the will, an old theological problem.
i wrote a piece... for piano, choir and orchestra... to a poem by riike.
secretly, i thought of kiärchen, who cried when i read it to her.
i knew that, now especially, from the applause and with my exam... in my pocket.
only as he turned away i saw that he was crying.
the other students... moved in a seif-confident way, they laughed... greeted each other loudly and seemed to know everything already.
one girl even brought her mother and a chauffeur... who carried her harp.
in such a short time, i had met only a person from munich... part of the art scene.
i had a room for the next few weeks, and even another one... with a piano and a view.
she just sat there, smoked a bit, looked at your books.
she stuck the butts in a matchbox and took them away.
"i feel like the sorcerer's apprentice poised to summon the spirits.
"munich is all i ever dreamed of, and music is my open sesame.
the more i thought hermann loved her, the more i dreamed of her myself.
i hadn't seen her for so long, perhaps she'd changed... or never really existed.
though it was nearly 20 years since the bombs had fallen... some still lay unexpioded.
one moment of tension, of irritation... awakening memories of panic and fear... then all was back to normal.
we enjoyed the power this gave us... over the recent past.
but we worked as slowly as possible... so that the job would last.
this poem by günther eich... inspired voiker schimmeipfennig... to set it to the music you are about to hear.
a film by reinhard dörr and stefan aufhäuser... will be shown, to combine the media.
it will find you, however, for you are from the fields of blood
it will come in the afternoon and catch you napping if not today then tomorrow, but it will come
do not sleep, while the rulers of the world are busy
do not trust them with the power they pretend to wield for you
make sure your hearts aren't empty for that's what they are counting on
don't serve, don't sing the songs that they expect of you
a year later my heart was affected, and i nearly died.
now i knew what it was like to be ill in a strange city.
the middling ones, who want them, but plan a retreat in advance.
and the strong ones... who take what they want, and then move on.
and yet he never told me that i was not the child... of the woman i'd always thought was my mother.
suddenly, my brothers were no ionger my brothers... as i'd believed since i was a child.
the music shop had belonged to my stepmother's family... who were all completely unmusicai.
perhaps my father had married into it... because he could play any instrument... and loved music.
there were no pictures, no documents... nothing to go on at all.
i'm certain my father didn't mean to take the truth to his grave.
in fact, i've wanted to... ever since he started giving me piano lessons... and telling me about munich.
the more my haif-brother jürgen pleaded with me... and warned me... the more of a stranger i felt.
the house was strangely familiar to me... as if i'd seen it before, or dreamt it.
that smell, too... of damp cellars, of old wood, of cinnamon.
it reminds her of what it was like when she was a young girl.
i remember it very well myself... all those literary gentlemen who came to see us.
when brecht came and herr feuchtwanger... now there was a gentleman.
i'm glad i can get away from it all down here... and that your grandfather doesn't know.
the new centre of our lives... was foxhoies, an old villa in schwabing.
it belonged to fräuiein cerphai, a middie-aged lady... who collected young artists as other people collected stamps.
foxhoies replaced our local and the seminars... or the studios and drawing rooms of the old times.
it was a privilege to belong to the foxholes circle... and fräuiein cerphai... was our patron, mother substitute, and guardian angel... although she refused to accept any of those titles.
i spent the saddest holiday of my iife with that book.
once you've begun, you can't stop reading about... that dark jewish destiny.
he lived in the villa... which made him the centre of our circle of friends.
he was a law student, and came from a rich family.
we'd go and see him in the middle of the night... and stay talking, smoking and drinking... and making music until dawn.
you're about to see an early work of the late avant-garde.
my father didn't think much of writers, but they came anyway.
brecht sat there, where that young woman is... and here, where the bed is, sat feuchtwanger.
in 1943, the opera house was hit by incendiary bombs... and completely gutted.
ever since, the mighty ruin... has towered alone above the rebuilt city.
of course, if they had known... that a year later it wouid all lie in ruins... they might have seen things differently.
but the heir to a publisher had to marry a girl from a good family.
last night closed the borders... between west berlin and the soviet zone.
this measure is designed to halt the continuing flow of refugees.
i met reinhard through stefan... and hermann and juan on the königspiatz.
through juan i met ciarissa... through hermann, olga... and through oiga, you.
now the fighting's over, he's like a fish out of water.
the army would have had him back... but it's too dull for him, he says.
the more i iooked for my mother, the more i found myself.
the more i iooked for myself, the more i found ansgar.
but if i cut it in lots of pieces, it can't go anywhere.
look, ansgar... this must be the chestnut tree my aunt meant, with this wall.
ever since i saw your aunt's photos, the city looks different to me.
look at these windows, these walls, just as they were in the war.
i still practiced in the woodshed... and spent my nights at foxhoies.
for days, josef had been brooding over architects' plans... and receiving visits from smooth-faced men in suits and ties.
my cello concerto had been a success without my knowing it.
even my vain composition professor liked it... and was happy to conduct it... when he heard it wouid be broadcast live on radio.
"we were talking about our families and about the mess our lives were.
"i have to confess that i have been writing and painting a iot since the age of 12.
the soft morning light... the banners moving in the breeze... the women praying in the procession.
corpus christi day 1962 was such a day that i'ii never forget.
i inhaled the scent of piety and sin... and of the birch branches that lined the streets.
i too was a birch tree, waiting for the growing storm.
three kids were playing rock-and-roii music on the street singing rock-and-roii songs.
an outraged citizen from the house next door called the radio patrol.
but when the policemen arrived wanting to drag away the kids... the people in a café took their side.
one of them let down the tyres on the police car.
will you keep it for me if i leave a deposit?
150 marks is rock bottom, it's what i paid for it myself.
dear birthday girl, i am delighted... that you brought us such a distinguished guest today.
it is one more tribute to your character... which we, your parents, have always respected.
i went up and asked him why he was looking so sinister.
he said he was going to shoot you... or himself, or hermann.
sometimes i hear something or see something... and i'm absolutely certain it's happened before.
maybe i've already been here... as an animal... or in another country... or in another century.
after five nights of rioting in munich... peace has returned to schwabing.
police were out in force along the leopoidstrasse again last night... but no incidents were reported.
a low had come from britain, across the north sea, westphaiia... the hunsrück, the german low mountain ranges to the foothills of the alps... bringing us all cooler weather.
the rain that had drenched düimen yesterday... now engulfed the streets of munich.
no need to feel left out, hermann... it's your cake we're eating.
we just had to open the package... it smelled so good.
outbreaks of war, arrests... railway accidents, executions... and "the exploitation of the working class. "
alex didn't want to belong to that part of the world.
alex was older than the rest of us... but he was still a student.
no one has read as much as he... not even his philosophy professors.
the story was, he'd got into debt running a grill room.
it was his father, alex said, who'd coined another of his sayings.:
my landlady had started her christmas baking, and then gone out.
it was odd, because usually she left the kitchen door unlocked... but that day she didn't trust me.
if i'd been a texan, kennedy would have died on a sunny day.
but as it was... it was a grey november day, as described in so many german poems.
i couldn't bear to think of a young life in such danger.
it's like a sword of damocles or a tree of damocles.
she was a lovely young woman... and my mother, who was still a baby, was in her arms.
my grandfather... had just come home and she ran up to him.
and just at that moment, a gust of wind swept across the manor... and tore down the rotting old apple tree.
before his eyes, this huge tree crashed down on the young lady.
there's an instinctive intelligence in us that grasps things... and flashes the message to us in a split second.
i felt a whole cascade of flashes... when i saw the little tour guide walk down the hall.
i wish i had someone like that... who just drops in to practise the piano.
you know, i had a friend at home... but her name was renate, too, so we stopped being friends.
so wet and hungry was i... that it all just looked a dream.
reinhard, stefan and rob, the friends, performed... in a film about film about film.
he's one of those arrogant geniuses, iike voiker and jean-marie... and reinhard and stefan and all the rest.
aii they care about is their immortality... and they don't need us for that.
after a iong cold and rainy day we wanted to get cosy at waltraud's.
a friend who travelled to america had lent waitraud this flat.
by the gate was a lamp... that smelled of charred cables.
and a rubbish bin... that gave off a stench of rotting garbage.
"o, holy staff, i would that i had never shunned the sword for thee.
"had never heard, o, sacred oak, the rustling wind among thy leaves.
around 8.:00, i decided... to test the rest of my friends by telephone.
with the deposit from one milk bottle, and three beer bottles...
when he got ill my mother pretended to be sick, and terrorized everybody.
not even the doctor suspected he was the one who was dying.
the prime minister left a banquet, to go and do... something more important, whatever that is.
the pubs are empty, but people haven't gone home to bed.
three years and three months had passed... since i had left neuburg... to study music in munich.
i had come a iong way from my mother's house... and from the thrills of my childhood triumphs on the cello.
my old cello teacher said... on my sad and desperate days i should go to the alte pinakothek.
looking at the old classics would give me hope and strength.
i wanted to do things myself... not merely have them done to me.
for weeks i'd been trying to persuade ciarissa... that she could play the cello part in my traces concert.
they included this one, about the rocking chair... he liked to sit in, in the garden at foxhoies.
once, sitting in it with a glass of red wine in his hand... he felt like kennedy, and said.:
advent, and the days before christmas... still reminded me of home, of childhood, and of family functions.
i tried to forget them all and i avoided schnüsschen, too.
so i said so long to the city... and came home to the hunsrück.
my six brothers are all married... but that never stops them coming home for christmas.
i had to find a flat soon, because the friend who'd lent me hers... wanted it back.
i wanted somewhere seif-contained, and was willing to pay for it.
then there are the opera houses, the city orchestras... and independent ones.
not to mention the record industry... film and television, and advertising, if you iike.
we all went about our own business... isolated from the others.
we kept our plans to ourselves, doubted our talents... and let no one see our hand.
i'm certain i was right... to send those young people packing.
i was chasing an idée fixe all those years... thinking i couid resurrect the old schwabing.
he said it'd be safe in the hold... he'd take care of it personally.
i didn't believe him... but i wanted to save the money.
they charge more for a cello... than for a person if you keep it with you.
even though a cello doesn't eat or drink or even speak....
the way the cakes tasted on your 60th birthday for instance, in the war.
or that edith smelled of sweat... before they took her off to dachau.
brazil, peru, ei salvador, mexico... countries that grew the cotton he'd been sent to document.
with rob's help, he'd captured on film... everything the german chemical company wanted.:
i don't know how the story ends, or if i'ii like it.
at the moment, i'm just sad... and that's why i'm writing.
horses and indians, the desert and the prairie, they're much more fun.
well, i don't know what'ii become of this story... or how it'ii turn out.
when i see these pictures, it all comes back to me.
in those subtropical places... at sunrise, it's still hot from the day before.
i had scribbled down my foxhoies requiem in a few days... feeling irritable and unable to concentrate.
lulu had an ear infection, and kept me awake at night.
schnüsschen wanted to give up her job... and was pressing me to earn money with my music, at last.
reinhard needed someone to write the music for his cotton film... and my friends only reluctantly agreed to join a requiem parade.
in that room, in that house, in ticino, in switzerland... you were homesick and couldn't sleep.
every morning you asked your aunt... when your mother was coming to fetch you.
your mother seemed further and further away, until finally... she was just a photo.
a piece of paper, which you smelled... and licked, searching for some trace of your mother.
sometimes it's too much, and i want to drop the film and run back to you.
but how could i face you, without having told esther's story?
and as his body was never found... we could never quite dismiss them.
stories that he'd been seen in renate's club... at the airport... or in venice.
in the winter of '67-'68... we were having trouble making ends meet.
often we didn't know where the next month's rent was coming from.
how they've all stood here, taking their snaps... first one, and then the other...
like dogs lifting their legs, because all the other dogs have lifted theirs.
i don't mind you waiting for hermann... as long as you're quiet and don't wake the baby.
i'm afraid i can't offer you anything, not even a cup of tea.
it became a key word for us and gave a name... to everything that was to follow.
even herr zieike, isar film's jealous resident director... felt part of the project... and wanted to join us in breaking new ground.
i know that in his heart hermann left me long ago.
he looks down on me, because i don't understand about art.
i hope our lulu never goes off the rails like that.
did you know that lots of the youngsters down at the drug centre... come from very good families?
but i witnessed nazi fascism in the hunsrück with my own eyes.
mind you, no one in my family was ever a nazi.
police watched as the march passed... the british military mission... on its way to the kurfürstendamm.
german participants in this french communist demonstration... were called upon to leave.
at work, in education, in the family... that's where democracy starts.
there are things in your script, stefan... that you can't get away with today.
we were on the way to the studio... when we were held up.
russian tanks everywhere, and overturned cars... with people hiding behind them.
love is a heap of wrecked feelings... family, a breeding ground of neurosis.
the man oppresses the woman, she takes it out on the child.
you see, if you'd stayed with us you'd have missed you vocation.
i always felt that your place was in life, not in the office.
i have an idea to put to you both, just a suggestion.
how about detaching the studio from isar film... as a separate enterprise, devoted to music?
then in '47 our herr h started isar film... with me as resident director.
he kept quiet about my past sins... and i kept quiet about his removal of the army property.
we can simulate a 100-piece orchestra... as easily as one violin... or piano or anything else.
we could rent it out for 2,000 a day, if people knew about us.
there it was again, my voice, which yesterday, i thought i had lost.
the words tumbled out of my mouth as though someone else had put them in.
for the second time in 24 hours... an ageing man had pinned his hopes on me.
for the second time i'd been offered fantastic sums... to use as i wished.
you have to read more, and learn to falsify and verify and things.
do you know that i've done lots of philosophy and group dynamics?
you've spent all this time telling us about witch-hunting... and its relation to the oppression of women.
you've given us a lecture on else lasker-schüler and her love poetry.
i still feel the warmth of your face in my lap and of your wet hands... which make me so strong that i believe i have to shout aloud... and squeeze everyone half to death so they can share our love.
when we were cuddling in our little tent... so that we both were not cold anymore... you and me and eternity was all that was left.
now everything is so easy and so clear and i'm not afraid anymore.
let's not be sad anymore or cry either, will you promise me that?
i am quite sure our child could not have lived... at your mother's who was not allowed to know of our love.
but if we still love each other in a few years, we will have a baby.
i swear that i will leave schabbach... and the horrible hunsrück.
in particular, i will leave my mother's house... and i will never come back.
i solemnly swear to do all this... as soon as i'm 19 and my exams are over.
i was the only one in the class to be orally examined in religion.
but the image fails... because a vine can't go to heaven, can it?
the theme is freedom of the will, an old theological problem.
i wrote a piece... for piano, choir and orchestra... to a poem by rilke.
secretly, i thought of kiärchen, who cried when i read it to her.
i knew that, now especially, from the applause and with my exam... in my pocket.
only as he turned away i saw that he was crying.
the other students... moved in a self-confident way, they laughed... greeted each other loudly and seemed to know everything already.
one girl even brought her mother and a chauffeur... who carried her harp.
in such a short time, i had met only a person from munich... part of the art scene.
i had a room for the next few weeks, and even another one... with a piano and a view.
she just sat there, smoked a bit, looked at your books.
she stuck the butts in a matchbox and took them away.
i came to the land of johann sebastian bach to study music.
at home in chile i'd play the bach on the marimba.
she was a child prodigy here... though she only started the cello at 1 1 .
i don't know much about it... but dr. kirchmeier... the head of our hospital, a very artistic-minded man... he said she had great talent from the start.
do not trust them with the power they pretend to wield for you
make sure your hearts aren't empty for that's what they are counting on
don't serve, don't sing the songs that they expect of you
be stubborn, be sand not oil, in the engine of the world
if a composer just thinks of now, that's one kind of music.
but if he thinks of eternity, or of death... you hear it.
a year later my heart was affected, and i nearly died.
now i knew what it was like to be ill in a strange city.
he'd travelled half the world... and compare us to all of it.
he had the widest view and he still believed in love.
and yet he never told me that i was not the child... of the woman i'd always thought was my mother.
suddenly, my brothers were no longer my brothers... as i'd believed since i was a child.
the more my half-brother jürgen pleaded with me... and warned me... the more of a stranger i felt.
and the more certain i was i would never return to neuburg.
the house was strangely familiar to me... as if i'd seen it before, or dreamt it.
that smell, too... of damp cellars, of old wood, of cinnamon.
it reminds her of what it was like when she was a young girl.
i remember it very well myself... all those literary gentlemen who came to see us.
when brecht came and herr feuchtwanger... now there was a gentleman.
i'm glad i can get away from it all down here... and that your grandfather doesn't know.
the new centre of our lives... was foxholes, an old villa in schwabing.
it belonged to fräulein cerphal, a middle-aged lady... who collected young artists as other people collected stamps.
foxholes replaced our local and the seminars... or the studios and drawing rooms of the old times.
it was a privilege to belong to the foxholes circle... and fräulein cerphal... was our patron, mother substitute, and guardian angel... although she refused to accept any of those titles.
stefan, reinhard and rob had made a short film... about the ruins left by the war... especially the munich opera, which had been completely destroyed.
no film distributor would take it... and the film board refused to certify it.
he was a law student, and came from a rich family.
we'd go and see him in the middle of the night... and stay talking, smoking and drinking... and making music until dawn.
i was little, and sitting under a sink that was about to fall on me.
it was full of sawdust, heaps of sawdust... that had come out of my favourite doll.
dear ciarissa, we must stop... this endless hesitating, hiding, running away.
i have to tell you, even if i lose you forever...
the soviet zone authorities... with the approval and at the request... of the warsaw pact...
last night closed the borders... between west berlin and the soviet zone.
this measure is designed to halt the continuing flow of refugees.
from now on, the inhabitants of east berlin and the soviet zone... will no longer be permitted to work in west berlin.
there are 25 orchestral parts... and all just to set the cello off.
to give it a chance to explore all its possibilities... that was my aim.
if i cut it in half... their two separate halves can go their separate ways.
if i cut it in four, it can go in four different directions.
look, ansgar... this must be the chestnut tree my aunt meant, with this wall.
my mother brought a whole four-course meal here once for his birthday.
they were a fixed point amidst our world of covert genius... our brief affairs and our fears.
ever since i saw your aunt's photos, the city looks different to me.
look at these windows, these walls, just as they were in the war.
if we were here 20 years ago, we'd be torn to shreds.
i still practiced in the woodshed... and spent my nights at foxholes.
for days, josef had been brooding over architects' plans... and receiving visits from smooth-faced men in suits and ties.
my cello concerto had been a success without my knowing it.
even my vain composition professor liked it... and was happy to conduct it... when he heard it would be broadcast live on radio.
"we were talking about our families and about the mess our lives were.
"i have to confess that i have been writing and painting a lot since the age of 12.
when the house was built... at the turn of the century... the secessionists met here.
then der blaue reiter... the expressionists, the surrealists... and all the rest of them.
the soft morning light... the banners moving in the breeze... the women praying in the procession.
corpus christi day 1962 was such a day that i'll never forget.
i inhaled the scent of piety and sin... and of the birch branches that lined the streets.
i too was a birch tree, waiting for the growing storm.
three kids were playing rock-and-roll music on the street singing rock-and-roll songs.
an outraged citizen from the house next door called the radio patrol.
but when the policemen arrived wanting to drag away the kids... the people in a café took their side.
one of them let down the tyres on the police car.
will you keep it for me if i leave a deposit?
150 marks is rock bottom, it's what i paid for it myself.
you can't imagine the things we got up to in würzburg.
we used to lock ourselves up in the x-ray department... even in the loo.
dear birthday girl, i am delighted... that you brought us such a distinguished guest today.
it is one more tribute to your character... which we, your parents, have always respected.
i went up and asked him why he was looking so sinister.
he said he was going to shoot you... or himself, or hermann.
sometimes i hear something or see something... and i'm absolutely certain it's happened before.
maybe i've already been here... as an animal... or in another country... or in another century.
after five nights of rioting in munich... peace has returned to schwabing.
police were out in force along the leopoldstrasse again last night... but no incidents were reported.
a low had come from britain, across the north sea, westphalia... the hunsrück, the german low mountain ranges to the foothills of the alps... bringing us all cooler weather.
the rain that had drenched düimen yesterday... now engulfed the streets of munich.
no need to feel left out, hermann... it's your cake we're eating.
we just had to open the package... it smelled so good.

alex didn't want to belong to that part of the world.
alex was older than the rest of us... but he was still a student.
no one has read as much as he... not even his philosophy professors.

i couldn't bear to think of a young life in such danger.
it's like a sword of damocles or a tree of damocles.
she was a lovely young woman... and my mother, who was still a baby, was in her arms.
my grandfather... had just come home and she ran up to him.
and just at that moment, a gust of wind swept across the manor... and tore down the rotting old apple tree.
before his eyes, this huge tree crashed down on the young lady.
it was "aleatory music, " from the latin word for dice.
to me, it meant something like fate... in a world without god.
a piece of sausage, some cottage cheese... or frau ries' good gherkins.
but on that day there was only... a bit of stale bread... and some mouldy jam...
i wish i had someone like that... who just drops in to practise the piano.
you know, i had a friend at home... but her name was renate, too, so we stopped being friends.
so wet and hungry was i... that it all just looked a dream.
reinhard, stefan and rob, the friends, performed... in a film about film about film.
he's one of those arrogant geniuses, iike volker and jean-marie... and reinhard and stefan and all the rest.
all they care about is their immortality... and they don't need us for that.
after a long cold and rainy day we wanted to get cosy at waltraud's.
a friend who travelled to america had lent waltraud this flat.
the exhaust fumes mixed... with the smell of the steaming wet pavement stones.
by the gate was a lamp... that smelled of charred cables.
but of course she doesn't sing... or write poetry, or play the cello.
oh, juan, if i'm really honest... if i told you what i really want....
"o, holy staff, i would that i had never shunned the sword for thee.
"had never heard, o, sacred oak, the rustling wind among thy leaves.
around 8.:00, i decided... to test the rest of my friends by telephone.
with the deposit from one milk bottle, and three beer bottles...
a night like this makes you see what matters in life.
the prime minister left a banquet, to go and do... something more important, whatever that is.
i had come a long way from my mother's house... and from the thrills of my childhood triumphs on the cello.
a long way from my patron, dr. kirchmeier... and from the good luck people had wished me... on my way to fame.
what is this compulsion... that drives us to practise for thousands of hours?
what do we hope to find in those long solitudes with the instrument?
my old cello teacher said... on my sad and desperate days i should go to the aite pinakothek.
looking at the old classics would give me hope and strength.
i wanted to do things myself... not merely have them done to me.
for weeks i'd been trying to persuade ciarissa... that she could play the cello part in my traces concert.
they included this one, about the rocking chair... he liked to sit in, in the garden at foxholes.
once, sitting in it with a glass of red wine in his hand... he felt like kennedy, and said.:
advent, and the days before christmas... still reminded me of home, of childhood, and of family functions.
i tried to forget them all and i avoided schnüsschen, too.
with that mother she's always known some things just have to be borne.
i understand her and know that she also would understand my thoughts.
it is all a question of attitude... whether a woman is weak... and not of her nature.
i will never allow a man to provide for me... as other women usually do.
i can't imagine spending christmas anywhere but home... and my whole family is the same.
so i said so long to the city... and came home to the hunsrück.
once upon a time, there was a poor little crippled girl... who could never go out.
he went back to sleep the moment he smelled his mother's perfume.
the silence of an afternoon nap... broken only by my experiments at the piano.
i was trapped in this routine... and yet felt no need to run away.
we all went about our own business... isolated from the others.
we kept our plans to ourselves, doubted our talents... and let no one see our hand.
i'm certain i was right... to send those young people packing.
i was chasing an idée fixe all those years... thinking i could resurrect the old schwabing.
when the city was silent, and the last pub had closed... they landed on us like a flock of birds.
they ate us out of house and home... and never stopped talking.
when i think how many people we used to have around.
at foxholes... hardly a night went by without friends dropping in.
at night i saw the flames of the burning city... reflected in the clouds.
up to now everything horrible and bloody has passed me by.
i didn't believe him... but i wanted to save the money.
they charge more for a cello... than for a person if you keep it with you.
we're pleased that the firm was so sensitive... to the human element, then.
your family's story... must be a wonderful reflection of its time.
your father... got goldbaum's house... by promising to return it after the war.
he took everything he had... and gave none of it back.
i didn't sleep until it was light... and the danger was over.
but i had a rehearsal at 10:00, so then i started panicking i'd oversleep.
for a year, he'd looked at the world with a filmmaker's eyes.:
brazil, peru, ei salvador, mexico... countries that grew the cotton he'd been sent to document.
i don't know how the story ends, or if i'll like it.
at the moment, i'm just sad... and that's why i'm writing.
horses and indians, the desert and the prairie, they're much more fun.
well, i don't know what'll become of this story... or how it'll turn out.
when i see these pictures, it all comes back to me.
in those subtropical places... at sunrise, it's still hot from the day before.
i had scribbled down my foxholes requiem in a few days... feeling irritable and unable to concentrate.
lulu had an ear infection, and kept me awake at night.
schnüsschen wanted to give up her job... and was pressing me to earn money with my music, at last.
reinhard needed someone to write the music for his cotton film... and my friends only reluctantly agreed to join a requiem parade.
in that room, in that house, in ticino, in switzerland... you were homesick and couldn't sleep.
every morning you asked your aunt... when your mother was coming to fetch you.
your mother seemed further and further away, until finally... she was just a photo.
a piece of paper, which you smelled... and licked, searching for some trace of your mother.
sometimes it's too much, and i want to drop the film and run back to you.
but how could i face you, without having told esther's story?
often we didn't know where the next month's rent was coming from.
the money that schnüsschen earned... was hardly enough for food, and for lulu... who kept growing out of her clothes.
he got me small jobs at country carnivals... weddings, and village festivals.
now that reinhard was dead... there were no more commissions for film music.
consul for sauru, a south sea island i'd never heard of.
and head of isar film, where stefan and reinhard had worked.
more than that, the inventor of a new kind of cinematic perpetuum mobile.
one of the houses at the lake belonged to my parents... or rather, to the forestry commission my father worked for.
the engineers, the assistants, the studio teams... and our fat boss, who gave us all a free hand.
when we came out of the tunnel, you should've filmed that.
it's nearly done and you'll get more credit than you deserve.
it's you and herr simon who've got more than you deserve.
i wanted them all to help to get the story right.
herr aufhäuser, i can't bear to see... the camera idle all day.
i hope our lulu never goes off the rails like that.
did you know that lots of the youngsters down at the drug centre... come from very good families?
but i witnessed nazi fascism in the hunsrück with my own eyes.
mind you, no one in my family was ever a nazi.
i had no good reason... to fly to berlin that day.
it wasn't that silly fight with schnüsschen... or a reaction to trixi's break-in.
i was in prague on august 21 when the russians invaded.
we were on the way to the studio... when we were held up.
love is a heap of wrecked feelings... family, a breeding ground of neurosis.
the man oppresses the woman, she takes it out on the child.
you see, if you'd stayed with us you'd have missed you vocation.
i always felt that your place was in life, not in the office.
then all we need is a money man, to tell us how much our dreams cost.
and if i lose, well, at my age it doesn't matter.
- no, handschuh... offered to get it all out of harm's way at his place in the ammersee.
i gave the order without realising what he was up to.
he kept quiet about my past sins... and i kept quiet about his removal of the army property.
i should have never given him so much power over me.
strange that it should be alex predicting the decline of the male.
alex, who never found a woman of his own... and who only knew about them from his friends.
we could rent it out for 2,000 a day, if people knew about us.
we need more work to show... advertisements for ourselves, not others.
but in business... it's reality that counts... and i've shielded him from reality for years.
because of what he did for me... in 1945, '46, '47.
for the second time i'd been offered fantastic sums... to use as i wished.
and each time it was my youth and idealism... that were valued so highly.
you've spent all this time telling us about witch-hunting... and its relation to the oppression of women.
you've given us a lecture on else lasker-schüler and her love poetry.
for a year, he'd looked at the world with a filmmaker's eyes.:
brazil, peru, el salvador, mexico... countries that grew the cotton he'd been sent to document.
i don't know how the story ends, or if i'll like it.
at the moment, i'm just sad... and that's why i'm writing.
horses and indians, the desert and the prairie, they're much more fun.
well, i don't know what'll become of this story... or how it'll turn out.
when i see these pictures, it all comes back to me.
in those subtropical places... at sunrise, it's still hot from the day before.
i had scribbled down my foxholes requiem in a few days... feeling irritable and unable to concentrate.
lulu had an ear infection, and kept me awake at night.
schnüsschen wanted to give up her job... and was pressing me to earn money with my music, at last.
reinhard needed someone to write the music for his cotton film... and my friends only reluctantly agreed to join a requiem parade.
at night, in bed that photo hung next to you on the wall.
in that room, in that house, in ticino, in switzerland... you were homesick and couldn't sleep.
so i said so long to the city... and came home to the hunsrück.
my six brothers are all married... but that never stops them coming home for christmas.
i had to find a flat soon, because the friend who'd lent me hers... wanted it back.
i wanted somewhere self-contained, and was willing to pay for it.
once upon a time, there was a poor little crippled girl... who could never go out.
he went back to sleep the moment he smelled his mother's perfume.
the silence of an afternoon nap... broken only by my experiments at the piano.
i was trapped in this routine... and yet felt no need to run away.
and will forever see your sweet smile, and enjoy your voice.
hear again that lullaby that echoes in my ears, since childhood.
you have a woman who loves you, and who deserves to be taken to dinner once in a while.
you know, i've spent a whole week waiting for this day.
i fought to save melissa until i was overcome by old age... and paralysis.
father, my only reason in life is to follow your work.
we start making a lot of waves, draw a lot of attention to ourselves.
before you know it, some of that power could be taken away.
we just think of ourselves as a paternity, a club if you will, a very exclusive club, whose members care about each other.
harry, we want you to be a member of that club.
dan, how can you think of yourself at a time like this?
because i have stood next to death and people liked him better.
and if they are treated nice is because somebody wants something from them.
so when somebody treats you nice and they don't want anything from you, you think they love you.
when do you start to love and when is it complete?
i don't know any more about love than the next guy,
the 13th district city council seat has been won by the late edward burns.
burns, who would have been 52 next january pulled up a stunning upset in what many insiders felt was a sure bet for the live candidate.
i think this just goes to show you how really uninformed the public is.
i bet they even didn't know the man they were voting for was dead.
you not only look american but you have the same impatience as well.
we're just anxious to do the jobs we were trained for.
- because the newspaper just came out and the professional shoppers aren't here yet.
in a half hour, this place is gonna be swarming with people.
i really wasn't due in today so i didn't concentrate on the password.
mr. melrose called me, specifically, at home and requested that i come in.
i don't know how we can cover every risk target in washington.
if we knew who they planned to assassinate, it'd make it easier for us.
well, i know it looks impressive but looks can be deceiving.
well, amanda, you're really dropping off a meat loaf at this address?
no, one cannot talk too much when the subject is tyranny.
the tyrants have taken my family, they have taken my home.
he can give a firsthand and very articulate account of what's going on behind that curtain, believe me.
you put him and the princess together, you could stir things up pretty good.
just promise me that you won't be taken in by any of those unattached men they have floating around at one of those parties.
mother, i fully intend to meet a prince and marry him.
besides, she wants to be accessible to the people who need her.
that makes her accessible to the people that want her dead.
so we'll cover the house from the outside from every angle.
how about a house-to-house search just for the hell of it, huh?
if you don't know how to spell a word, look in the dictionary.
if i don't know how to spell a word, how do i look it up in the dictionary?
you know, the assassination attempt is all over the front page.
i got rid of last night's and hid this morning's paper but mother is getting very suspicious.
there's no lane in the middle of the road, mrs. west.
there's a lane on the right and a lane on the left.
well, i mean, she and i met, but amanda and she have become very close.
in fact, amanda spends a lot of time with her highness.
one of the best things about living in paradise... is that when you get a couple of days off... you don't have to go someplace else to have fun and relax.
instead, you can concentrate on some of the finer things in life.
by the time they get to it, it'll be another two weeks.
apparently they don't take me too seriously, so i'm gonna handle it myself.
i was starting to get the feeling that carol's source was either wrong or too late.
now, the trick of surveillance was knowing when something was a dead end.
and maybe these guys were just trying to scare me off.
when i write my book on being a first-class private investigator... rule number 168 is going to be:
no matter how fast your car is, there can always be one that's faster.
no matter how much i want to deny it... there's something exhilarating about a confrontation.
it got to be the ninth inning... and the tigers were down 4-0, there were two outs.
there was a man on first and second and harvey kuenn was up and...
i don't know, 10 minutes before al finally picked himself up.
and he digs in... and turley is just... looking at him.
one of the best things about having friends... is that you've got someone to talk to when you're in trouble.
you don't even have to talk about what you're talking about.
so ruby says to me, "you get one more customer asking for you...
i'm going to have to change the name to emily's beauty emporium."
well, i mean, sometimes he yells too much, but, well see... he and i have had our differences, but basically...
the important thing is that he's always gracious to his guests.
i was really bored one day, so i watched a documentary.
it was about how sharks are attracted to certain kind of movements... and thomas, i'm moving just like a wounded seal.
thomas and i could have picked up some burger and fries on the way to the hospital.
burgers and fries are hardly satisfactory nutrition for someone who's recuperating.
how do you really feel about me being here, mr. higgins?
well, it certainly cuts the sting out of having to live with magnum.
be that as it may, the point is two men are trying to kill you.
you don't do yourself or emily any good if you don't protect yourself.
- no, i was upset... and i'm afraid i took it out on you.
no, i should have given you more information, i was wrong.
i know, ever since the accident, i believed i was only concerned about emily.
but what higgins had said brought the truth home to me.
that no matter how bad things get... you can count on that connection to pull you through.
what he didn't tell me was that when someone you care about lies to you... that connection is very painfully broken.
(magnum) most people think a private investigator's life... is filled with danger and excitement.
sometimes it is... but most of the time it's about as dangerous... as watching keoki's nephew destroy a sandcastle.
when i write my book on being a first-class private investigator... rule number 168 is going to be.:
if you're getting chased, you should be in a fast car.
well, it seemed like... i don't know, 10 minutes before al finally picked himself up.
and he digs in... and turley is just... looking at him.
now, i don't know why i was thinking about baseball... but i do know... that i'd forgotten the lesson al kaline had taught me back in 1956.
pick yourself up, brush yourself off... and get back in the box.
well, i mean, sometimes he yells too much, but, well see... he and i have had our differences, but basically....
the important thing is that he's always gracious to his guests.
it was about how sharks are attracted to certain kind of movements... and thomas, i'm moving just like a wounded seal.
well... i don't think the sharks around oahu are used to seeing any kind of seals.
thomas and i could have picked up some burger and fries on the way to the hospital.
burgers and fries are hardly satisfactory nutrition for someone who's recuperating.
how do you really feel about me being here, mr. higgins?
well, it certainly cuts the sting out of having to live with magnum.
it was my-- no, i was upset... and i'm afraid i took it out on you.
no, i should have given you more information, i was wrong.
(magnum) i guess nobody likes to think of themselves... as selfish or self-centered.
i know, ever since the accident, i believed i was only concerned about emily.
(magnum) my dad once told me... there's a connection between people called trust.
that no matter how bad things get... you can count on that connection to pull you through.
they both deal with images, both are done alone, and both require a steady hand.
i think there's room in my life for the two, but right now photography is exerting the stronger pull.
twenty dollars is reasonable to charge for a session of prints.
why he wanted a graduation photo of his daughter is beyond me.
i don't like to extend credit, but sometimes you have to.
i wouldn't do this kind of photography at all, except that i need $8,642.
i think that your interest in photography has gone past the point of being healthy, charles.
you're spending too much time in that darkroom with those chemical fumes.
susan got a throbbing case of los hornitos and forced me to stop at a disgusting adult motel.
no, it was your mr. winky that was doing the throbbing.
don't you understand that if you don't make it young in this business you don't make it at all?
laura, there comes a time when you've got to drop the fantasy.
there's a kid at my school whose little brother still has a gill.
it, uh, never grew back together or whatever it was supposed to do.
so, uh, you come here just to look at this one fish?
when something's bothering me, i come and i watch the fish, and whatever's bothering me goes away.
and i don't have a lead guitarist, and i don't know where i'm gonna find a decent one, and i know that this all must sound terribly trivial to you, in comparison to your need to take my picture,
but it's really important to me, so i would appreciate it if you would just go away so i can figure out what i'm gonna do.
she still has those big, nice swimmer shoulders... doesn't she though?
you must be a wonderful mother because you raised an absolutely terrific son.
i got a big spare side of the bed and a window that gives you a great view of the smog.
i'll be up until about 11:00 if you want to call.
i can't do anything like what you're talking about on such short notice.
anyway, we don't do this kind of thing, and if we did, you couldn't afford it.
you may be disappointed by a person's humanity, but you'll never be disappointed by their greed.
i felt like i had just bought the biggest present in the world, and i was holding my breath until she opened it.
sometimes it seems like nothing ever works out, and what's worse is sometimes things almost work out and then fall apart.
if this is the way life is, how do people stand it?
a whole lot of people have been calling up for reservations just to hear you sing.
and you know how i hate to disappoint the paying public.
i almost caught a disease that i don't even think they have a name for yet?
uh, not to mention wandering around in the middle of the night, in the rain, in a garbage bag.

make us thankful for your generous bounty and your unceasing love.
please remind us, in these hard times... to be grateful for what we have been given... and not to ask for what we cannot have.
forgot to tell you, we got a letter from your aunt gladys.
she was hoping we could come to oklahoma and visit them... during your vacation.
well, i seen you was almost out of firewood... so i thought i'd chop some for you.
i could fix you some breakfast, but after that, you got to go.
i reckon with the right kind of help... you'd make yourself a handsome living just farming cotton.
all you need is somebody like me... who knows most everything there is to know about farming cotton.
but at the close of banking hours yesterday... you had a balance of $116.72.
however, when your husband bought this place... he did borrow money from the bank.
at the time of his death he still owed... $3681, to be paid twice a year.
what that means, mrs. spalding, is... come october 15th, you will owe the bank $240.
rilla langsford and her sister have that nice little gift shop... and, well, i thought i could do the same thing.
i could get some pretty little things, and i could set them out...
mrs. spalding, what we at the bank suggest is that you sell this place.
now i know times are hard... but maybe we can pay off the loan and have something to tide you over.
got too much to do around here to go around saving your life all the time.
if you're just gonna stand around, you might as well be of some use.
then i'd... head out across the pasture and down to this grove of elm trees.
and right in the middle... was this little spot where i used to go and sit all the time.
now then, mrs. spalding... in spite of the fact that i have great doubts about... this misguided attempt of yours to hold on to this place... as a christian and deacon of the church, it's my beholden duty to... reach out the hand of charity to a human being in need.
and i got to thinking, now what better way to help out this poor woman... than if she took in a boarder.
someone who could move in here, and by paying a modest rent, help her out.
what if my brother-in-law was to move in here and rent a room from you?
old man wilson ought to put that studebaker of his out to pasture.
not a week goes by without something going wrong with that fool thing.
and the trouble is, he thinks he can fix it all by himself.
so he goes in there and messes everything up... and makes it worse than it was in the first place.
mrs. spalding, believe me... if i had anyplace else to go tonight besides... the state home for the infirm, i'd gladly leave right now.
when i came here, all i asked was to be left alone.
next time you want to play cards with us... you'll have to go to houston.
i got an offer from an oil company down there... too good to pass up.
and what happens if you don't get the first bale in?
then i'll pay them out of the money i get from the gin.

mrs. spalding, i hate to be the one to tell you this... but that sister of yours doesn't have a natural talent for cooking.
i got to thinking, if we all weren't gonna die of ptomaine poisoning...
i expect you realize the bottom dropped out of the cotton market.
i'm pretty much doing you a favor, taking it off your hands.
this'll be the first year since i don't remember when... that y'all aren't first.
i guess mr. wheeler at wheeler's gin will be pleased to meet my price... just so he can show off all next year at the masons.
if you could give it to her, i'd be most grateful.
and old frank, he had his eye on this rabbit foot of mine for a spell... so i expect he might as well have it.
this morning we take our text from first corinthians... the 13th chapter, verses one through eight.
"though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels... and have not love...
i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.

please remind us, in these hard times to be grateful for what we have been given and not to ask for what we cannot have.
and make us mindful of those less fortunate among us as we sit at this table with all of thy bounty.
all i could think of when i saw that poor man in there was what would i do if it was you?
what would i do if something was to happen to you?
i thought i told you last night you can't stay around here.
well, i seen you was almost out of firewood so i thought i'd chop some for you.
all you need is somebody like me who knows most everything there is to know about farming cotton.
i was thinking that maybe i could work around here for food and a place to stay.
mrs. spalding i don't know how much your husband told you about his business.
but at the close of banking hours yesterday you had a balance of $116.72.
however, when your husband bought this place he did borrow money from the bank.

i could get some pretty little things, and i could set them out...
mrs. spalding, why would someone come all the way out here when the langsfords' place is there on the square?
he was just passing through, and i gave him a job doing some chores.
you're telling me you let some negro hobo talk you into planting cotton?
you'll excuse me, mrs. spalding but that's just about the most ignorant thing i've ever heard.
mr. denby i'm not ignorant and i'm not selling my land.
got too much to do around here to go around saving your life all the time.

when i came here, all i asked was to be left alone.
governor johnson appealed to president roosevelt today for emergency relief due to the failure of the wpa program to get started in dallas.
the governor had asked the administration for $1,000,000 in direct relief yesterday.

mrs. spalding, i hate to be the one to tell you this but that sister of yours doesn't have a natural talent for cooking.
i got to thinking, if we all weren't gonna die of ptomaine poisoning i'd have to do something about it.
i ought to explain to you how things work around here.
i gin the cotton for a fee, then i buy your cotton if we agree on a price.
i'm pretty much doing you a favor, taking it off your hands.
mr. simmons, i want 41/2 cents a pound for my cotton.
i remember how much store your daddy set on ginning the first bale of cotton each year.

mr. denby i'm not ignorant and i'm not selling my land.
and i'm not giving my children over to anyone else to raise.
i'd sneak out of the house go out behind the barn.
then i'd head out across the pasture and down to this grove of elm trees.
will's been living with his mama until she passed away and since that time he's been visiting with my wife and me.
now then, mrs. spalding in spite of the fact that i have great doubts about this misguided attempt of yours to hold on to this place as a christian and deacon of the church, it's my beholden duty to reach out the hand of charity to a human being in need.

take in a picture show then have supper out just like an old married couple?
you can tell buddy you're visiting that aunt of yours up in dallas...
when i came here, all i asked was to be left alone.
i am not some kind of freak that is here on display for the amusement of those hooligans you call children.
next time you want to play cards with us you'll have to go to houston.
i got an offer from an oil company down there too good to pass up.
and what happens if you don't get the first bale in?
then i'll pay them out of the money i get from the gin.
i got to thinking, if we all weren't gonna die of ptomaine poisoning i'd have to do something about it.
so i'm fixing us some green beans like my mother used to make.
i expect you realize the bottom dropped out of the cotton market.

you have brown eyes, she has blue eyes, you have dark hair and she has light hair but i'm telling you, the resemblance is just absolutely uncanny.
i had always heard that everybody has a double somewhere in the world but i'd thought it was just an old wives' tale.
listen, if i'm not supposed to say something i think you ought to tell me.
you operate on a need-to-know basis, but i needed to know.
oh, she's not gonna jeopardize the safety of her mother and her sister.
getting them out of hungary and relocating them was all part of the deal.
could you tell me where i might find the display of camptosorus rhizophyllus?
uh, yes, i believe they're right over there in that greenhouse.
she's different from any communist i've ever seen on the news.
they all wear boots and drive tractors and work in factories.
she is in a position where she can compromise a network of operatives that has taken us months to put in place.
she is in a position where she can expose our cultural mission for what it is, an intelligence operation.
now listen, lee, you know that i will do anything that i can within reason to help my country, but this has gotten out of hand.
now, i was supposed to take a message to her and to bring you back the answer.

you don't bark at strangers, you don't bring in the morning paper you don't even bring me my slippers at night.
i don't know what you're becoming but i do know what you're not becoming.
you don't do any of the things that a dog is supposed to do.
you don't bring in the morning paper you don't even bring me my slippers at night.
dogs used to round up sheep and guard them in case wolves attacked.
you don't try to follow me to school and you don't meet me when i come home.
there's nothing worse than owning a dog who isn't a dog.
however i'd like to try but then i don't know where to begin
i see there are many books on 'theatre' at the book stores and i've been wondering what to buy
put simply, your daily life has to be rich with experiences
so i think the way one grows up is crucial to being an actor
of all times to be painful during the audition what a troublesome kid and he stays in me and wouldn't leave
i am determined to give birth to him and change his character
my friend was really in the limelight and had it made
however on the other hand the other one in the hospital with flowers all around him was down in doldrums
then he returned to the room and found his friend's bed was gone
he cried but something inside him scared him and he was shocked
he realised the way he held his fist was not aesthetic though the way he cried, moved his audience
the way he felt about his friend's death could be better used to improve the way he acted
i empathies with that and since then my other self frequently appeared whenever i was bathing or dining even when i was having sex and certainly when i was acting
that chap didn't know how to forget everything and act according to his instincts
simply put... everyone present in the residence that night is a possible suspect
if no one left after the murder then we would lose our lead
i see but i don't have that much money besides, i have no plans to move
you only need to pay what you're paying for rent now
he was also the first one to bring me to broadway
when i got the award as a rising star he bought me an mg which made me hurry to get a driver's license
even if one has talent one needs the director's appreciation to have the opportunity to act and one needs many people to buy the tickets otherwise how could there be a chance to act, right?
i could say it was douhara who accosted me that he wanted to support my show
i don't think we should replace actors because of a scandal
but she has been summoned to the police station for investigation
we are not moralists what has one's private life to do with acting?
if one is not discreet she has no right to be on stage
for the subsistence of the troupe, miss chieko acted her favourite plays but she wasn't paid;
however she couldn't get a job which would stop her from acting
there are also those who have bought me clothes wined and dined me paid for my rent
it's just that... it's just that up to now no one has died because of me
miss chieko didn't you do this sort of thing to be able to stay in acting?
deep in the corner of our hearts... no, i should say in our heart of hearts we tell ourselves we did all this to be able to act
if it's dutch treat then the clothes have to be returned to him too
there's no time for other work and there simply isn't enough money for sustenance but had i not received his money would you then admit this was a love affair?
however if the murderer is the spouse or a direct relative, then that person will lose the right
that is to say, mako's direct relation who is her aunty will have no right to the inheritance
your research focuses on genetics and the quicker the chairman who opposes your research dies the quicker aunt would inherit the estate
since it'll be aunt's estate it'll be as good as yours
she requested you to stand in for her the prize is for playing mako
then the two of you moved the body to your room
- well, she's happy now, and she hasn't been happy in quite a long time.
and i'd like her to enioy things for as long as possible.
now, that's one thing you don't do in business or family.
and that's one of the most important things i've learned from you.
that evey morning, for the rest of our lives, you'll wake me up with a kiss.
you'd better weigh what you're getting for a husband before we make any promises.
you know, i was gonna do eveything i could to make you feel at home, but that obviously wasn't necessay.
and i hope, i truly hope, that it turns out to be you.
if i'd wanted to be with someone, i've got three children that i could call.
but they might not know that you were in any sort of trouble right now.
did it have anything to do with the fact that he was pumping me about you before he ever went to hong kong with you?
or maybe he had some scheme in mind, which he tried on you, something you rejected?
and we may not be lovers anymore, but we can still be friends.
how can two people still be what they never were in the first place?
i don't sleep in my clothes, nor do i sleep with them.
i require one bedroom for my wardrobe and one for myself.
i lust got a call telling me the ad campaign's been postponed.
so i'm gonna stick around denver for a while to be with danny.
well, whatever your interest in alexis colby is, let me just warn you, she is a woman who has made it to where she is because she's as tough as anybody she's ever been up against.
so if you'll excuse me, i have business to attend to.
the only item i've been able to unload from your portfolio is one of the horses, allegree.
i got a million and a half for him from a syndicate in louisville.
your wife is a lot more realistic about what you're up against than you seem to be.
i asked 5 million for that horse, but the word is out, blake.
i may not be his real mother, sammy jo, but i couldn't love danny any more than if i'd given birth to him.
now, you've made it perfectly clear that you and i are never going to be friends.
so when his nervous nellie of a nanny gets back, she's gonna dress him to go outside, with me.
i want to make a person-to-person call to new york city.
so terribly misguided in your thinking my company can afford to plant daisies in that acreage.
so i'm afraid that my offer for your process is zero.
gone are the days when you were king of my fate, when you exiled me from my children and threw me out of denver.
and i had a damn good reason for doing it, and you know it.
look, what you and she do or don't do couldn't interest me less.
all i want to know is when this cosmetics campaign you're going to be managing is going to start.
sergeant, i've told you eveything that i can remember about this.
well, let's lust say i want you to tell me again, mrs. colby, for the record.
what were you doing in his room at la mirage on those several occasions?
look, i told you that it was personal and vey short-lived.
as for the truth, i came here to denver to see my son for a day or two.
and then go back to the rat race in new york.
this champagne was obviously frozen in the bottle at some point.
if the champagne is too burned for your taste, miss deveraux, don't drink it.
let me ask you, mrs. colby, is that supposed to be an implied threat of some sort?
because if it is, i am just as tough as you.
i'm glad my last assignment is going to be under you, sir.
we're both a little too young to be talking about last assignments.
"they can't do that because ladonna carey said that the interest rate won't go up?"
i swear to jesus you're about as nervous about that boat as you are about that tank.
i want a beer bar on this post with a soft jukebox
so old farts like me, and a few others out there can sip our suds in peace
i can't do that, they're coming here, i can't do it.
hells bells ladona, best news i've had in 10 years, billy's out on a date,
now who was it that marked you up while you was out representing me?
because now i'm walkin' around with marks on my face, and that, i can't have.
you do believe in the lone ranger, and you think he wears army green, and that's a dangerous thing for a lady in your position, ya think?
you see sarah, you do business with them people, of course.
you got a bad problem, we just got to nip it right in the bud.
well i don't see you making any calls to locate my man.
cause we sure don't want you to have any problems with the army so, you take him, go ahead and take him.
and by 5 o'clock you won't have to worry about seeing soldiers in any of your bars, or your restaurants, or your stores, or your whorehouses.
well, sooner or later, that's going to blow up in your face.
i just don't want it to ever get to that point.
euclid, could you come in here and bring your camera please?
you wouldn't mind posing' for a picture with me, would you?
i think it would be inadvisable for you to get the idea of bringing some jew lawyer down here to talk about civil rights.
cause you do that, i'll have that little boy of yours on this farm
i didn't do anything, somebody's else's lock was on my locker.
i know, i know, it doesn't have anything to do with you.
the sheriff's using you to get me, that's why he put you in here, to get me.
i'm gonna do exactly what he wants, then you're out of here.
once you're out of here, i'll tell you the whole thing.
but the bottom line is, you're going to get out of here, you understand?
all right, you talk to a lawyer, find out what can be done,
but don't you take any action that'll get to that sheriff without telling me first.
governor, i have got a 52 year old sergeant that's crazy.
i got a 16 year old dope fiend, and a 20 year old hooker in a sherman tank!
i want you to call out the national guard, and blow that son of a bitch away!
well, i suppose i could do that, but that would take a lot of time.
why don't you see what the army can do for you old buddy.
...and in clemmonsville today, in what has to be the most unusual prison break in recent history,
we're gonna head for the tennessee state line, it'll take a couple of days over back roads and broken country.
we can move pretty good, it'll slow them down a tad.
i can have him call you, or he can call your superior.
either way, i want to see some tanks rolling out of here to stop that maniac.
the most i've got him on was busting a 20ft section of fence.
general, i'm the local civilian authority, and i'm hereby making a formal request of the military, to do everything in its power to assist me in apprehending...
i mean the son of a bitch ain't driving a toyota!
any fool knows it ain't far to empty on a sherman tank, so i'm putting one of you brave boys
i got a few things to square up on the tank, then we're going to move out.
now, i would like to say a few words about mr. gant.
billy, i know how you feel about me, and maybe you're right.
but i just wanted you to know nothing happened between your father and me.
if he hadn't been there in the first place, none of this would have happened.
and maybe if he took me out back, nothing would've happened either.
if he would've been like any other guy with $20 in his hand and wanted to cheat on his wife, that would've been the end of it too.
you should hate him for not taking me back there in the first place, or hate me for not being sexy enough to get him there.
you can think of many reasons to hate, but your father deserves better than that.
that's where the sheriff thinks you are right now down in them bogs.
this morning 16-year-old william carey broadcast an s.o.s. from the tank
seems his father was injured fixing a thrown track, and william requested first aid instructions.
in the meantime, what has since been dubbed as the battle of gant's farm,
the tank and it's unlikely crew are fast becoming folk heroes, for the entire nation.
he doesn't have to prove anything to me, and i don't have to prove anything to him.
the bottom line is, he's my father and i love him.
governor, that's my husband and son, in that tank with that 20 year old prostitute.
if i don't have a problem with that, i fail to see why you should.

do you really think you were better off before in russia?

mr. baldwin is ready to meet with you now, mrs. fletcher.
and in the meantime, i'll arrange for the family to tour the rest of the park.
i'll only need a few minutes of your time, dear lady.
it must seem bizarre having an office complex like this beneath the park.
mr. baldwin, have you lured me here to offer me some sort of job?
please, mrs. fletcher, permit me the seduction before you cry rape.
but i can assure you... this conversation is far from over.
mickey, mrs. fletcher is going to prove tougher than i suspected.
the medical examiner says that horatio baldwin took a blow to the head here.
and he's pretty sure that it was the blow that was the cause of death, not the gunshot.
mrs. erica baldwin, one-time showgirl, now america's wealthiest widow... thanks to the untimely demise of three... now four... husbands.
would it surprise you if i said i loved horatio very deeply?
i'm concerned about the fate of a very nice young lady named laurie bascomb.
but if you've shanghaied me here to persuade me to stop, you're out of luck.
we're not looking for details, but if he was blackmailing you, he may have had his thumbprints on several other people as well.
he had files on arnold, carlson, nils, all his key people, but i don't know where he kept them.
oh, yes, i had the call automatically forwarded to a phone just a block from here.
but i don't have to tell you about call forwarding, do i?
whoever planted those blackmail files on arnold megrim... would have first replaced his own file with something less incriminating.
that's why you killed gardner... because he knew what horatio baldwin really had on you.
then he programmed the telephone... so that if a call came in, it would automatically be forwarded to horatio's telephone.
oh, and keep in mind what he was wearing that day... dark slacks and a dark sweater over his shirt.
next, he disconnected the bell on horatio's telephone... so that if a call came in, someone standing outside the door couldn't hear it ring.
and, finally, he propped horatio up at the desk, placed the gun in his hand, the barrel to his head, and squeezed the trigger.
in the darkness, totally dressed in black, he was virtually invisible.
the guards broke in, but, of course, they were focusing on horatio slumped at his desk.
they never saw carlson exit the room while their attention was diverted.
in the corridor, he quickly got rid of the sweater, turned and rushed back toward the office, calling out as he did so.
mrs. fletcher, i really don't know how i could ever thank you.
well, first, by finally calling mejessica, and, secondly, by starting that book you want to write.
witness all ye assembled here... that for various crimes against the people,
horatio baldwin must now suffer thejudgment... rendered unto him by a jury of his peers.
mr. baldwin is ready to meet with you now, mrs. fletcher.

mrs episteme, there's something else i want to say to you.

all her being was telling her to run, to take her back before he makes her his woman so as to save her family, that pitiable amount of money she had been saving drachma by drachma, dime by dime,
working honestly for a whole life by the labour of her hands.
i may nose around but i haven't fouled my own nest like certain other women around here.
if you had been a bit prettier, mrs pagona dear, you might have fouled your own nest too.
who made sure that peasants won't go to prison for their debts to the masters?

addicts need their daily fix and to give it to her, and it's just my supposition,
corrado must have had contact with those in the drug trade.
and perhaps unwittingly, he found himself mixed up in the squalid world of traffickers.
a small favour every day, and you end up trapped and a victim of blackmail.
this is a humanitarian mission which has at heart the interests of miss pecci scialoia.
her family wants to cure her, protect her, return her to life.
i want the name of the bastard who raped the child.
okay, but even if someone did, we can't let that cop walk all over us.
besides, watching a man sleep, gives me like a sense of tenderness.
i did it with dad and grandpa as a child at our home in the country.
yes... but you see, it so happens... that i loved titti.
and i didn't want to run the risk that she'd be killed, you see?
when you try to stretch your legs the noose tightens and chokes you.
so you try to resist but you realise you're killing yourself.
he did well at the police academy, but i felt he had limitations like a lack of determination.
and to think that i recommended him for that quiet job in sicily.
during the investigations, corrado meets titti, the junkie daughter of the suicide noblewoman and gradually falls for her.
his marriage to else has been on the rocks for a while.
titti tells corrado that a heroin trafficker called cirinna, killed her mother and lnspector marineo.
titti, terrified of cirinna and because of the drugs he gives her, had been too afraid to report him to the police.
corrado's investigations have come a long way, coming dangerously close to the heart of the criminal organisation.
through bank audits, the lnspector identifies the involvement of prominent citizens both in the drug trade and in the murders.
go to the office, act like god and give orders to the fools you work with.
but remember that from now on, we give the orders that count.
cirinna will stay in our hands and you'll avoid a dangerous situation.
you consider me a friend and i consider you a friend and we try to spare our friends trouble.
and profits and debts must be paid, sooner or later... if one wants to save one's skin.
after a thorough examination by prof. cristina, this morning sante cirinna was moved from jail to villa rosalia clinic for further tests.
i'm sure the lnspector knows more than i do about drug matters.
but i fear that... falling victim to his human qualities, and perhaps to help someone who's embroiled in that scene, he himself, has got lost in that world...
a world where neither we, nor the majority of our citizens has ever entered.
we have never walked down the dark paths he hasn't been afraid to venture down.
maybe you have a plan i'm not aware of, but unless we act, they'll take over and toss us into jail!
you're absolutely right, but you see, i needed to understand, to find a solution.
sir, it seems i'm a specialist in legal problems and conundrums.
so i've been asked to find a way to get your daughter home and make you happy.
we still have the issue of cirinna's gun, which killed deputy inspector leo de maria.
according to what we saw... the lnspector took it out of the dead man's hand and said it was cirinna's by putting it next to him.

in spite of your sister's sexual aberrations with... your mother's tennis teacher... for which she should be bloody ashamed... she'll soon be back if she really leaves.
and i assume we'll also continue to enjoy your obnoxious presence.
your mother told me what happened here while i was gone.
in spite of your sister's sexual aberrations with... your mother's tennis teacher... for which she should be bloody ashamed... she'll soon be back if she really leaves.
the hours of tenderness have passed or does she still love me?
i'd like to stay with you i'll give you what you need
here's an opening hint from a guy who's opened a lot of these rascals.
if you smack this baby here, it'll open up like a big walnut.
sam, the salesman also said, "this scale is not being made any more. "
"this one was in a cellar for over 40 years. "
i feel so good, i'd like to set up the entire bar.
but as that's financially impossible, i'll settle for buying cliff a drink.
my little card said i would hear from a distant loved one.
sure enough, a half hour later, my daughter in pennsylvania calls me.
i am not the one who complains how tired i am every night.
getting her to make love is like asking her to run the boston marathon,
i am the reverend peter shayne, and i know the plague that cripples you.
i've been sent by the lord to save you and to rid the earth of that plague.
o thou, my god, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
save him from this bigmouth cush with a motor-driven ass who--
you can win by being honest with me instead of humoring me.
what do we have if we can't be honest with each other ?
i just thought after last week that maybe we could be friends.
you really think we could be friends after last week ?
so i wanted to show him there was nothing to be afraid of.
so one day i picked him up fast, and i held him.
well, your mom and i have to be on our own for a while.
i swear to you that doesn't mean that we've stopped caring about you and lisa.
he needs me so badly, and i just can't do it.
i want you to make him feel like a man again.
creative decisions that sometime hurt the film or sometimes hurt a character in the film.
it's uh.. it probably did in this case, because it does show..
it's not really a scene that ultimately belongs in the film as we.. we shot it..
and then we looked at it and we said you know, it's um..
really siding with amy in this scene, because she is uh..
she is the uh.. the wife who lost the husband to this.. to this other woman.
god knows, well, he's had his own group for years but..
uh.. he's.. he's very good at doing symphonic rock or he was.
it's vari.. the film is variations, the music in the film is variations on dvorak's new world symphony.
and of course, new world released the movie in the united states.
you know, never heard a symphony, never heard of dvorak, i wouldn't think.
anyway, don't forget you said this film was book ended by this therapy session,
and the audience wondered what happened to the characters, the two main characters.
and we said.. well, it's not really the point of movie, but..
photographed by dick bush, who i used to work with on bbc doing lots of documentaries.
and had a garish look which we uh.. went for really.
what.. what power they seemed to have over their flock and how.. how..
and.. and so we changed the character to a typical american bible puncher.
in fact, i got them from a local bookshop on oriental art.
so a kid can wander in a bookshop and see them but he's not allowed to see 'em on the screen.
and uh.. it was a great experience and is.. yeah know..
directors don't respect the written word as.. as much as you do, most directors.
and he uh.. gave me, i don't know, about 5 scripts to read on the plane going home.
and i remember the time, i got off jumbo at heathrow london,
and when they bend over in front of you and uh..
show their g-strings when they're pouring coffee for the next passenger down the list, you know it's..
but ultimately, you know i think what the movie makes is that it's.. it's..
as exciting and.. and. and titillating and provocative as it may be..
we cut some of them before we shot it and then we shot it.
and you looked at it and you said, "right, you know something got to go."
yeah, that's an interesting choice of music to.. to underscore on that.
yeah, the more i see this, the more i'm surprised she..
since then become a very popular uh.. daytime soap opera star.
i believe "days of our lives", she started on "santa barbara".
you know, when you have two hour and forty minute first cut..
and you've got to cut uh.. you know, forty-five minutes out of it, something has to go.
so a lot of groups, religious morality groups objected to the.. the uh..
depiction of the break up the family in this movie in that um..
and uh.. sh.. here's a great scene where's she about to reach that uh..
that part of realization that.. that will manifest itself into this epiphany.
but you see, i mean.. she's just gone too far now.
i mean she's now taking out all her rage and her frustration and all her need and pain..
for.. obvious reasons, i mean the man is very sick and um..
you know, the.. the movie is unsettling for a lot of people but um..
"least.. at least you stop pretending", yeah that's the key line.
it's a tough sequence to shoot, i mean it was obviously uh..
she can't even face him, notice how ken has positioned her.
or maybe it was kathleen's instinct to position herself that way.
but he sees it as an act of desperation, which it is and uh..
yeah, john doesn't say a word, it's all conveyed through his uh..
three songs before we were able to get the rights to uh..
an old standard we finally ended up with this song, which absolutely, you know, works for the sequence.
yeah, i'm not sure if it's going to work out either, but at least it's a first attempt.
the camera now for the first time is moving in on this character..
really i'd rather get fucked by a vibrator than your cock any day.
it's honest, loving, and i don't have to make breakfast for it in the morning.
i am not the one who complains how tired i am every night.
getting her to make love is like asking her to run the boston marathon, and then those times that we actually do go through with it,
it is truly an honor to be named miss liberty 1984.
i have dreamed of this moment all my life, and i promise i shall carry the name... with dignity and with pride.
music, do you say what kind of instrument do you play?
i play the flute, sir, in honor of our forefathers... who died at concord and lexington.
oh, i like to wrap my fingers around it and tenderly caress it.
then i like to lift it to my mouth... and wrap my lips around it.
i am the reverend peter shayne, and i know the plague that cripples you.
i've been sent by the lord to save you and to rid the earth of that plague.
so, that means you can make room for that hot tub.
well, you act like i- forced you, and i don't even want it anymore.
o thou, my god, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
save him from this bigmouth cush with a motor-driven ass who- forgive me, lord.

so i wanted to show him there was nothing to be afraid of.
so one day i picked him up fast, and i held him.
and i really appreciate you listening, and i won't bother you again.

well, you know there are three things you have to know to be able to make it as 5o buck hooker.
you have to act, fuck and know how to count to 50.
i thought it was being inside the woman that i love.
and giving her as much pleasure as she was giving to me.
so i wanted to show him there's nothing to be afraid of.
so one day, i just picked him real fast and i held him.
thanks a lot, and i'm sorry for busting in on you like this.
i really appreciate you listening and i won't bother you again.
well, your mom and i, we have to be on our own for a while.
i swear, that doesn't mean we've stopped caring about you and lisa.

all right, we'll piggyback your bugs, but our mission takes precedence.
looks like tony and his lady are goin' to a party.
so, where in the hell do you think you're going in this?
look, if she takes him out, it blows us all out of the water.
i'm willing to take the chance that that is not going to happen.
we're in an ideal position to move to the next step.
we're gonna pick up dupass at the airport and replace him with paul.
the missile will seek out that target and that target only.
and as it gets within striking range, the heat seeker automatically integrates with the base system, and the missile homes in.
we've got a hook on the van with the m-60 and the spent stinger tube in it.
off the threat of a 10-year fall for that, we can lever the location of the other nine missiles out of them right now.
just let us get a chance to get tony amato, notjust the missiles.
is there something about this deal that you haven't told us?
they got two, two and a half million out on the street at any one time.
lombard's the kind of guy, you could steal his wife, you can run off with his daughter...
- this is the fourth official complaint in the last month.
about an hour ago, he shows up uninvited at dr. lenderman's cocktail party... and scared everybody half to death.
apparently, you ladies have never heard of amendment e4-144 of the florida wildlife and game code.
"any animal in the employ of a federal, state or county police department, is exempt from all county statutes."
we've known for six months there's been somebody on demarco's payroll.
in exchange for immunity from prosecution on the racketeering charge, he named crockett.
- eight years with momojackson and dom maziade, and they got me on a b.s. racketeering indictment.
[scoffs] but it ain't gonna stick 'cause i got some witnesses on the road.
i'm gonna be staying at this number... until the end of the week.
so where else can a big-city player find a good time in a town like... this?
the only ones they can check is jay wolper and detellis.
wolper's up in maximum security up in kansas, doin' no talking on the phone, and detellis is all set up to back your action.
i had dinner with detellis at the resort before i left.
i hear that wolper's doin' a pound on that newark thing.
forensics thinks the carrow woman was in the water ten hours, which makes her time of death around 8:30.
absence of bruising, hematomas and low hormone levels indicate there was no struggle.
a newcomer like you, getting a social invitation to lombard's yacht.
it's an invitation, but i don't know how social it's gonna be.
given his arrest record, commendations... and the interest he shows during an investigation...
i'd say either you've been had, or you're a complete idiot for believing the charges against him.
looks like tony and his lady are goin' to a party.
so, where in the hell do you think you're going in this?

there's got to be someone else waiting in the wings in washington.
this little demonstration you wanted is costing me a lot of money.
okay, now that specific image is locked into the computer tracking system.
the missile will seek out that target and that target only.
## to see you there this way ## [ amato ] what's the matter?
your nose still out ofjoint about that bal harbour lawyer and his junior league wife?
##and as for me i can sit here and bide my time ## it's goin' down on the boat.
##i got nothin'to lose if i speak my mind ## [ groans ]
##and i really ain't bothered what you think of me ##
## 'cause all i want of you is just to let me be ##

you're saying you'll use godzilla's "homing instinct" and some "magnetic area"
and come up with a synthetic soundwave that will lure it in?
what's more, even if it were possible to make mount mihara erupt, what about the problem of what happens to the people of oshima?
there have been no incidents of magma crossing the volcano's mouth and extending to its base.
i think it'd be best to leave godzilla to the self-defense forces.
let's ask the jsdf for help, but also move forward with hayashida-san's plan.
the return of godzilla means the world is going to be in turmoil.
all i want to do is send godzilla back to where it came from.
i understand that's approximately half of what was used on hiroshima.
mr. director general, should godzilla reach tokyo, how extensive do you think the damage would be?
if we use nuclear weapons, how can we deal with the radioactive fall-out?
what's more, do we even know that nuclear weapons will even work against godzilla?
but once we use them, who can say when they'll be used again.
if you would call japan's three non-nuclear principles "egotism," then so be it.
"should godzilla appear in your countries, either america or the soviet union,
should it threaten the capitals of washington or moscow, would you have the courage to use nuclear weapons?"
don't go walkin' around like you own the place, you bastard!
just 'cause you're in shinjuku doesn't make you a big shot!
at this rate, it will strike godzilla in about thirty minutes.
in other words, a nuclear explosion in the heart of shinjuku!
a soviet satellite has accidentally launched a nuclear warhead that is expected to detonate in the airspace above shinjuku.

- henmi shou) having said that, even i couldn't believe it.
besides, how can we explain the corpses... found on the yahata-maru?
their blood and body fluid were sucked dry by the giant sea slaters
you must find it strange, how sea slaters, some centimeters long can grow into such giants..
why do you think godziiia would appear out of the blue?
three months ago, there was a iarge-scaie volcanic eruption causing a series of crust movement awakening godziiia to rise to the surface.
in the fear that this might cause panic the government has put him under house arrest and banned any news about it
they ignore the feelings of okumura's family for the sake of national security
godzilla responds to its homing instinct and we can trick him with some compound ultrasound developed from some magnetic theory?
i don't get it and we need the professor's effort also what about the people living in the vicinity?
according to the instruction from the countermeasure headquarters a nuclear missile was mistakenly fired by the soviets which... might explode in the air of tokyo professor!
aii residents must evacuate accordingly to designated safety shelters including all subways, in the platforms or along the railway
according to the maritime security agency the number of shipwrecks is increasing.
including the 77 ton fishing vessel, yahata-maru which suddenly lost radio contact near daikoku island.
it's a question of timing, and now is not the time.
cabinet secretary takegami suggested that we speak with mr. hayashida, a bio-physics professor.
super-power tensions nearly resulted in a full scale nuclear war but time was on our side.
our investigation proves that america had nothing to do with the sinking of the russian submarine.
all of its circuitry has been designed to withstand incredible temperatures.
its guns will be firing special cadmium shells designed for use against godzilla.
it's possible that by using the same theory we can make the volcano erupt anytime we want it to.
the problem is, how do we bring godzilla to the volcano?
if tokyo is destroyed, our economy will be destroyed as well!
i am merely expressing reservations about the use of an atomic bomb!
if we use them, who can say when they will be used again...
you think that we are acting out of national pride and maybe we are...
prime minister, what did you say to the russians and the americans?
i said, that if godzilla appeared in your countries, and attacked washington and moscow...
halfway, the missile will pass from the stratosphere into outer space.
it will then descend to strike godzilla in the shinjuku district of japan.
the professor is confident of the americans but the missile is still heading for us.
godzilla will wake up soon and the helicopter may not make it to the island in time.

three months ago, there was large volcanic eruption on daikoku island.
it must have awakened godzilla and brought it to the surface.
in reply, the americans and nato allies have put all of their forces at full-alert status.
the tension is mounting as both sides seek to prevent a world catastrophe.
our investigation proves that america had nothing to do with the sinking of the russian submarine.
the submarine was destroyed by other forces and a military conflict was avoided.
the japanese fishing boat, yahata-maru, that vanished near daikoku island was later found abandoned with all the crew dead except for one survivor who testified to seeing the monster.
as the lone survivor, all i can do for my friends is to claim my desire for revenge on godzilla.
its guns will be firing special cadmium shells designed for use against godzilla.
as cadmium is used in the seal of a nuclear reactor it should work against godzilla, as well.
the problem is, how do we bring godzilla to the volcano?
from what i've outlined, i believe i can come up with something quickly that will attract its attention.
yes, but i think it would be best to leave godzilla to the military.
the military will do their best but at the same time, the professor should continue his project.
we will use nuclear weapons against godzilla as our only alternative!
prime minister, you know we have the power to stop godzilla with nuclear weapons...
nuclear weapons even on a small scale, are hard to quantify.
the americans and russians have hesitated to use them on the battlefield because of this.
i said, that if godzilla appeared in your countries, and attacked washington and moscow...
would you have the courage to use nuclear weapons knowing that many of your people would be killed?

i have just spent 20 minutes standing in the pouring rain waiting for a cab.

even before when the presence of so many people in the street had sounded an alarm in my instinct,
i have been trained as an actress myself, and male costume is nothing new to me.
yes, it was i who followed you to your door, just to make sure that you really were the celebrated mr. sherlock holmes.
is it not a pity she was not on my level.
from what i have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.
i am only so sorry that i have failed in my commission.
on the contrary, my dear sir, nothing could be more successful.
and that was how a great scandal threatened the kingdom of bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.
he used to sneer much at the cleverness of women, but i have not heard him do it of late.
it was not that he ever betrayed any sign of love for irena adler, all emotions such as that one are abhorrent to his cold, precise mind.
he only looks on women pathologically, as the source of motives, clues.
holmes and i had been sharing rooms in baker street for some years,
my practice had caused me to be absent in the country for several days.
i have just spent 20 minutes standing in the pouring rain waiting for a cab.
it won't do that old wound of yours any good getting so wet, doctor.
i speak not only as your friend, but as a medical man.
how can you risk such damage to the great powers with which you have been endowed?
the monogram is an abbreviation for papier gesellschaft, which is the german for "paper company."
and the eg, eglow, eglonitz, egria, a german-speaking district of bohemia noted for its numerous glass factories and paper mills, there.
vvery well, i take your word that he is a man of honor and discretion.
but i must begin by binding you both to absolute secrecy for a period of two years.
the august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you.
in fact, i may confess that the title i have given you is not exactly my own.
every precaution must be taken to prevent an immense scandal which would seriously compromise one of the royal houses of europe.
to speak plainly, the matter concerns the great house of ormstein, hereditary kings of bohemia.
miss lrena adler has certainly turned all men's heads in those parts.
she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet, so say the serpentine-mews fraternity, to a man.
she has only one male visitor, but sees a good deal of him.
he never calls less than once a day, and often twice.
his name is a mr. godfrey norton, of the inner temple.
you see the advantages of having a cabman as a confidant.
i was just about to sprint after the landau and perch on the back when another cab came through the street.
he looked twice at such a shabby fare, but i jumped in before he had time to object, showed him a handful of sovereigns and promised him one if he would get me to the church of st. monica within 20 minutes.
well, during the ceremony i thought my plans had been overthrown.
if they had made an immediate departure, it would have necessitated the most prompt and energetic measures on my part.
that so many people should gather in such a quiet little turning.
well, it's the gang, madam, it was all pre-arranged to rob you.
it is a plumber's rocket, madam, one of my flock is a plumber.
it is ignited by a cap, and sends smoke into pipes to betray cracks and holes.
you must be a witness at the end of our quest.
i trust you will sleep well tonight for a change, holmes.
because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance.
if she loves her husband, then she does not love your majesty.
from what i have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.
i am only so sorry that i have failed in my commission.
then i have the honor to wish o your majesty a very good morning.
and that was how a great scandal threatened the kingdom of bohemia, and how the best plans of mr. sherlock holmes were beaten by a woman's wit.
he used to sneer much at the cleverness of women, but i have not heard him do it of late.
and when he speaks of irena adler, or when he refers to that woman, it is always under the honorable title of "the woman."
at the time of our involvement in the irena adler case,
holmes and i had been sharing rooms in baker street for some years.
your recent services to one of the royal houses of europe have shown that you are one who may be safely trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.
this account of you we have from all quarters received, be in your chamber then."
you may say before this gentleman anything which you may wish to say to me.
very well, i take your word that he is a man of honor and discretion.
at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance.
at present it is of such weight that it may have an influence upon european history.
goodnight, your majesty, and i trust we shall soon have good news for you.
holmes, we can dine at romano's, but we only have three days, till friday.
i spent a couple of hours with the cabbie and his cronies.
miss irena adler has certainly turned all men's heads in those parts.
she is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet, so say the serpentine-mews fraternity, to a man.
she lives quietly, drives out at five in the evening, returns at seven sharp for dinner.

that so many people should gather in such a quiet little turning.
well, it's the gang, madam, it was all pre-arranged to rob you.
my vocation takes me much amongst the poor and even the criminal classes, madam.
look at those people staring, curiosity is so unseemly, but i fear universal.
at least your name, your address, that i may thank you adequately.
well, i am just a humble servant, madam, of the all seeing providence.
you must be a witness at the end of our quest.
i trust you will sleep well tonight for a change, holmes.
because it would spare your majesty all fear of future annoyance.
if she loves her husband, then she does not love your majesty.
until after the alarm of fire, i had not a suspicion.
but then, when i found that i had betrayed myself, it flashed into my mind that i had been warned against you months ago.
i had been told that if the king employed an agent it would certainly be you.
yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know.
even before when the presence of so many people in the street had sounded an alarm in my instinct,
i could not think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman.
then i started for the temple to see my new husband.
we had married in secret in case we needed to leave the country to elude the king.
"the king may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged.
i kept it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps he may take."
from what i have seen of the lady, yes, indeed, she is on a very different level to your majesty.

and when he speaks of irena adler, or when he refers to that woman, it is always under the honorable title of "the woman."
there is but one woman to him, the beautiful irena adler, of dubious and questionable memory.
the spirit of the lord is with me because he has appointed me to teach the less fortunate the good news of the lord.
as i was saying, my article is about nuns who are involved in politics.
in our congregation, nick, we can choose our assignment depending on our interest and skill.
i know that if there are nuns or priests in the picket line, the scabs have second thoughts.
we have something to donate, but i'm not sure if the nuns will join the strike.
why don't you pursue that in the second part of your series?
but it will be more interesting if you will concentrate on the nuns.
the nuns who are still locked up in the convent are hopeless.
do you really think that or you're just still mad at her?
did you enter the convent to run away from the chaos?
no, i entered the convent to find solution to the chaos.
it hurts to be dumped by your girlfriend and be replaced by... wow!
let me ask you stella, what does christ have that i don't?
you know the situation, the nuns and priests who get involved are being watched.
if stella gets involved, for sure, she's not aware what she has gotten into.
ka sidring, we're not yet sure if there are really scabs arriving.
if those are trucks, or vehicles of the factory, or the manager is arriving, we should let them enter.
but what i can't forget is the way they took care of us.
they were the ones in need but they always look after us.
but if it's a big story, the publisher cannot do anything if there's a big story or not.
if the workers want to go on strike the publisher cannot do anything.
if it's doubt on what i do now, it already happened.
but on being a nun, believe it or not, nick, it hasn't happened yet.
typical nun who comes and goes, helps once in a while.
when you get sick and tired of the strike you will go back to your comfortable life in the convent, sleep in soft mattresses, and eat three square meals a day.
their uneducated officials who join seminars outside and picks up a lot of nonsense.
add to them those who meddle with affairs which they should not meddle with.
maybe you'll admit that there was a sudden turn of events in your life during the previous weeks.
gigi, your namesake, even that journalist you used to talk to, and now the strike.
i want to have a child with him and possibly get married.
when i got pregnant again, he was forced to bring me here.
he agreed to live in with me as long as we won't have a baby.
but i was the one who did not adhere to our agreement.
but the decision for me to go back to caritas came from the provincial.
that's what juaning told you, but i believe it's not true.
if i get voted as pope, we will change the rules of the church.
you can get married, or go to the mountains if you like.
if his management is satisfactory, no amount of manipulation can affect his workers!
i'm a catholic, mr. fajardo, but if the nuns and priests today are being used by the communists, then it would be better to change my religion.
if he is a catholic, nick, it is better if he would change his religion.
i don't want to hear that we believe in the same god.
we have our own responsibilities but - do you need to sacrifice other people's lives in order for you to do your duty?
aling auring, do you think it would be better for everyone's safety for you to stop the strike?
he will not let anything bad happen to someone like marie.
she left several tasks here so i cannot go back there immediately.
if he ever doubted once, that's on his ability to lead the union.
but he never doubted the ability of the union to fight the oppression of those capitalists!
it's just right, he said, that those who worked hard to earn this wealth should also have their share.
i told him that what is important is that we continue to live.
because if you will just keep quiet they would even get what little wealth you have.
and this will happen if you will not learn how to fight.
i'm sad today because i lost my husband and my partner in life.
like what my children feel upon the loss of their father.
i became happier when i saw that many came here to support the strike.
we know you are all here to condole with us, that we are not alone in our sorrow.
i saw the fresh marks of the torture they did to him.
i felt that his body cannot stand it anymore but his spirit is still very strong.
i can feel that - this gives us strength to go on with our just strike.
i cannot forgive the torture and the murder of ka dencio by unknown men.
i know, because i experienced the cruelty that they can do.
i was intimidated, and i am still intimidated by what they can still do.
i was reminded several times that i am just a nun.
a nun who should not meddle with things she doesn't know anything about.
victims like gigi then, who suffered and was not able to bear it anymore.
and victims like ka dencio, who died fighting for his beliefs.
but i am here now, in the midst of the events.
i learned and understood a few additional things, but i continue to study and learn.
not just someone who only watches, but shares the burden of those who cannot fight back, unites with the struggle of those who are oppressed, helping to the best of my abilities.
ka dencio said when he was still alive, if we will not act, who will act?
knight rider... a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
well, here we are on our way to the beach, a full afternoon off.
bonnie and devon are going to watch a building being leveled.
however, with the development of our new xpl nitro-plastique... we can accomplish the same job with just six of these packets... weighing a total of 30 ounces.
today, we are fortunate enough to be joined by mr. devon miles... of the foundation for law and government.
nurse gilmore, i appreciate all you've done, but, really, i am fine.
if you're so fine, why were you found half unconscious... babbling something about your car driving off by itself?
now, he said he was scared because he thought i was the game warden.
well, he was scared, all right, but it wasn't for that reason.
she's been through a lot, and i'm here to see no one takes advantage of her.
i appreciate your concern, but maybe i didn't make myself clear.
trying to have a nice, quiet family dinner here... and, thanks to you, people are yelling at each other.
yeah, well, it's not a family dinner 'cause you're not part of the family.
(male narrator) knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
the worst thing is that the only information we could get... from the one you picked up was his name, rank, and serial number.
he's a member of a quasi-military group... dedicated to overthrowing the island of mandominow.
the only thing is it appears to be a legitimate company.
and as far as we know, the van could've been stolen from them.
michael, i know how important this case is to you... but may i be so bold as to recommend caution?
devon, you can recommend anything you want... but that poison gas was meant for me.
why is it that i can always count on you to fret over the most minute details?
because careless people in my position do not survive very long.
well, i've got to admit i've never seen another flower quite like it.
no, in some ways, you're fortunate to have seen it at all.
i'm a man of considerable patience, but once that patience... has exhausted itself, it's replaced by a rage... the like of which you have never seen.
now i'm going to ask you one more time and one more time only.
yes, a small one, but certainly large enough for a private jet.
michael, if you're thinking what i'm computing, i'm afraid it's a long shot.
chalaxa is the perfect place to milk the orchids... and mass-produce their venom.
one fluid ounce has the killing power of 25 gallons of cyanide.
i know, but see if you can access the plane's navigation computer... to the palomar uplink.
if we can scramble their compass and airspeed indicator... we may be able to throw them off course, cost them some time.
i can't risk revealing the sea base's position to the enemy.
friend or enemy, it's a distinction that's lost on the silurians,
each of you passed a difficult co-ordination test to quality for this training.
you are very special girls and i wish you the best of success.
her name is teodora ungureanu and she has just moved to onesti
teodora is 8 years old and has been performing advanced gymnastics for two years.
why shouldn't they experience that at the time of their life when they're most alive?
bela, it is our responsibility to keep them from hurting themselves.
in paris, romanian gymnast nadia comaneci won the hears of the audience in a surprise appearance.
professor bela karolyi stated that she is one of top calibre gymnasts currently training at his school who will be competing at all up-coming european events.
miss comaneci had dominated the 1974 championship with three gold medals and one silver.
and her coach bela karolyi is confident that his students will carry off several medals at the 1976 olympic games.
ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing gymnastic history in the making!
with her final routine nadia comanesci has scored an umbelievable seven perfect tens!
that flash nearly caused an injury to one of my girls.
when we are training, don't you bring anyone here without my permission!
it concerns me that they did not wake up as we had planned in the first place.
their enforced period of hibernation may have caused much muscular and organic degeneration.
you wouldn't be here if there was any doubt about your fitness for the job.
i'm a student on attachment to sea base 4 to study an experienced sync operator in action, not to take his place.
do you realise the base is defenceless with maddox in the state he is?
and we still haven't established what destroyed our probe, nor what sentinel six shot at.
but i can't do that, not without authority from sea base command.
if we are to maintain operational efficiency, there really is no other way.
i've spent too long on a sea base not to be.
and given how unstable the current political situation is, an attack is not to be unexpected.
it concerns me that they did not wake up as we had planned in the first place.
their enforced period of hibernation may have caused much muscular and organic degeneration.

trying to convince us he's nothing more than a lost tourist.
if you'd nothing to hide, why didn't you declare yourselves to us immediately?
i can't risk revealing the sea base's position to the enemy.
friend or enemy, it's a distinction that's lost on the silurians,
as long as you're in one piece, i believe i'll go do the same thing.
oh, coast guard's picking up distress signals from some damn fools out there in a yacht.
my, uh, company just retired me after 42 years, gave me a small pension and the, uh, proverbial gold watch.
and all of a sudden i realized... there was a whole lot of this world that i hadn't seen.
well, my feeling is that there are special circumstances here, and before we go holding an inquest, i want to see that body.
the way the tide is, the body should wash ashore tonight.
better you should smoke it than it should sit there gathering dust.
naturally, i'm as upset as anyone over the death of mr. earl.
ladies, forgive my presumption, but if you've not yet firmed up your plans for final determination,
i stand ready to assist you in your hour of grief.
well, now that's a mighty strange thing to say, considering that only yesterday you confessed to killing him.
i might have confessed to killing him, sheriff, but i didn't kill him!
father was supposed to be hiding out on shore, waiting for terry's appearance.
then dad would show up and prove to nan just how lousy a guy he was.
ladies, i've still got a dead body with two bullets in his chest.
yes, and i'm also sure you have a dead body with a pipe in his pocket.
well, as a matter of fact, i do, but how did you know that?
i gave it to mr. earl the night before last when he was having dinner at my house.
just as you predicted, the shots that killed dad... the coroner says came from a.32 caliber, not my gun.
did he also tell you how long the body had been in the water?
and naturally we're all very relieved that maggie has been cleared.
and so am i. leaving us one small question to be resolved.
you know, you seem like a very sweet old gal, but this is a family affair.
we don't need strangers poking their noses where they don't belong.
you see, mrs. fletcher, there are some people like maggie... who secretly believe in me.
anyway, nan and i spent the night together in a motel near the airport.
oh, now, maybe not in one of your books, but this is evidence enough for me.
anyway, you're the one who told me right from the start that they were her shoes.
portland desk clerk says you checked in around 9:00, but no one saw either one of you after that.
both of you could've come back, killed him, and then gone back to the motel.
well, the sheriff discovered... a heel of a shoe wedged into the rocks down by the beach.
nan has already admitted that it was hers, but the shoes are missing.
if nan had lost her shoes, she would have had to walk... a couple ofhundred yards along a rocky path to leave the beach.
now, back in her room, when i asked nan... to try on her shoe, i knew it was hers, but i wanted to see the bottom ofher feet.
the one person who with sisterly affection had told nan... of terryjones's imminent arrival at portland airport, to be sure that she had no alibi.
under the guise of cupid, you were setting your sister up for a murder charge.
i have a young woman here who wants to surrender herself into your custody.
i know how my sisters felt, but my father really was a decent man, mrs. fletcher.
as long as you're in one piece, i believe i'll go do the same thing.
oh, coast guard's picking up distress signals from some damn fools out there in a yacht.
my, uh, company just retired me after 42 years, gave me a small pension and the, uh, proverbial gold watch.
and all of a sudden i realized... there was a whole lot of this world that i hadn't seen.
well, my feeling is that there are special circumstances here, and before we go holding an inquest, i want to see that body.
the way the tide is, the body should wash ashore tonight.
an immediate coroner's inquest so that the reins of leadership can pass quickly on to his successor.
well, i can appreciate you've got some kind of a problem, mr. earl...
by the time we got up on deck, father's body was gone.
there were splotches of blood everywhere, and his pipe was still lying there, still warm.
sometimes you spin around more in a circle... than a roman candle on the fourth ofjuly, like now!
but if you feel that strong, the least i can do is help you look.
then dad would show up and prove to nan just how lousy a guy he was.
ladies, i've still got a dead body with two bullets in his chest.
yes, and i'm also sure you have a dead body with a pipe in his pocket.
well, as a matter of fact, i do, but how did you know that?
he was at your... - i also believe, sheriff, that when the coroner examines the body he will discover two things...
one, that those two bullets were not fired from maggie's gun, and second, that the body has not been in the water for anywhere close to three days.
we don't need strangers poking their noses where they don't belong.
i beg your pardon, mr. shelby, but mr. earl was no stranger.
outside the mortuary, you said you heard of the death of stephen earl... this morning on the early news broadcast in kentucky and flew right in?
in reality, you learned of his death yesterday, around noon, from stephen earl himself.
maggie had told nan about the old man's bizarre plot to trap me.
you see, mrs. fletcher, there are some people like maggie... who secretly believe in me.
yeah, couple ofhours ago he got this anonymous note shoved in the mailbox.
whoever wrote it said there were some funny goings-on down there last night about 10:00.
if you find a heelless shoe, the heel was bound to be somewhere.
well, now all we have to do is to find out who these belong to.
well, i hope not, because in this state, being an accessory is about the same as being a killer.
well, as long as you're here, i see no reason why you shouldn't see her.
nan has already admitted that it was hers, but the shoes are missing.
you mean she broke off her heel while she was out on the beach last night?
look, this is very presumptuous, and probably quite insulting, but i do know how sisters are.
i know how they trade off clothes and, well, is it possible that one of you could have worn those shoes?
just before we entered grace's room you said you didn't wear pink.
and you never mentioned that the shoes were pink, did you?
now, once the frame was obvious, it was also obvious who'd engineered it.
the one person who with sisterly affection had told nan... of terryjones's imminent arrival at portland airport, to be sure that she had no alibi.
you really should tell that captain caleb to do something about his food.
the girls and i tried it last friday, and, honestly, it isn't very good.
oh, you may turn me over to the local constable, mr. giles, but no amount of coercion will force me to betray a trust.
on the other hand, when the local newspapers get hold of this story, the finger of suspicion will point equally at each of your guests.
# he was the king that brought her to ruin #
# he gave her dictation and a place to stay #
i don't know what that is, but i'm not eating it.
well, it's an old fletcher recipe... guaranteed to take the spots off of a leopard.
doc, i know you're not the coroner, but you got a look at that body.
nowjust off the top of your head, how long would you say he'd been dead?
[inhales] between church and football... and the fact the town council never calls me, this is my favorite day of the week.
mrs. fletcher, you've just made this the worst sunday i've spent in 10 years.
i suppose they think that a chief of police from a small town like me is in over his head.
well, if you believe that grady is a thief, maybe they're right.
look, mrs. fletcher, i know he's kin, but facts are facts.
at 6:00 a.m. this morning, we found that detective's car... parked about half a mile from giles's place.
i just spent several hours across the street... being hounded by a couple of homicide detectives.
all i want now is a hot bath and a cold drink.
he wasn't caught in ashley's room, and, as you also know,
ashley had an alibi that night, which is more than i can say for your nephew.
i mean, how do we know for sure that anyone intended to kill baxendale?
i mean, in that costume, the killer may have been after you.
mrs. fletcher, you're a very shrewd cookie, but you're barking up the wrong tree.
all my employees know that i am cap'n caleb's chowder houses, okay?
now, you wait here, bernie, and i'll go upstairs and get some money.
aw, forget it, mrs. f. if this ointment works, it's worth a lot more than a few bucks on a meter.
now, be sure to put it on for a half hour every night for a week.
and don't forget to write to me and let me know how it worked.
and remember, whoever she was dealing with... was just as vulnerable as she was.
well, it doesn't figure she'd keep anything incriminating in her office.
and i think you'll sleep much better once you've arrested ashley vickers.
chief, this evening, i was privy to a conversation... in which she practically admitted having stolen that report.
mr. brill, tell me about the stolen information... that you've been receiving from ashley vickers.
my dear lady, i have no idea what you're talking about.
ayoung man's future is in dire jeopardy... because of your shenanigans, and i won't allow it.
at the risk of repeating myself, i do not know what you are talking about.
the victim's wife, louise mccallum, arrived at the hudson street police station... shortly after 1:00 p.m. today, accompanied by her attorney.
when asked if she was under suspicion in her husband's death, authorities had no official comment.
to tell you the truth, we're kinda back to the start line on this thing.
except for the fact that your nephew is off the hook.
seems that last night, brill dragged the lady over to some new jersey nightclub... to catch this singer's act.
accordin' to the witnesses, they didn't leave there till past 2:30 in the mornin'.
if something else is destined to come out of this relationship, so be it.
if not, at least i'll have made a very good friend.
you know, preston, you and i are standing about 25 feet apart.
that's the same distance the killer was from sherlock holmes when he was shot.
the point is, the killer knew exactly who his victim was.
or, more specifically, preston, you knew you were shooting that detective.
as he was leaving the bedroom, he saw that brass figure of blind justice.
[no audible dialogue] and he turned and he said something very strange.
a hotshot detective, third grade, had a hunch that i was still alive.
he became even more positive when, over the next couple of years... like the count of monte cristo... lfinancially destroyed my three ex-partners from a safe distance.
preston, even if i could bring myself to believe that, there's no way that you can justify the murdering of caleb mccallum.
and you did kill him, for the same reason... to divert suspicion from yourself.
you can put your arms down when the search team finishes with you.
we don't want anybody from this fort going into tynin looking for rednecks.
remember, you're the first coloured officer most of these men have ever seen.
the army expects you to set an example for the coloured troops and be a credit to your race.
as a matter of fact, he wrote home to his wife everyday.
i just don't see why anybody would want to kill the sarge.
i mean, those klan boys, they can't stand to see us in these uniforms.
they usually take the stripes and stuff off before they lynch us.
if i'd given that gal what she asked me for she'd give me somethin' i didn't want.
around home, there's a fella folks used to call little jimmy one-leg on account of his thing was so big.
"anything you don't want to do, the coloured troops will do for you."
"anything you don't want to do the coloured troops will do for you"
a whole lot of shots had gone off right near the barracks.
i, myself, had gone over and gotten a little juiced at the enlisted men's club.
and this low-down nigger we're looking for got chased down here.
and was almost caught, until someone in these barracks started shooting at the men chasing him.
and the finest player that waters ever had was cj memphis.
now, if you'd have seen him, you'd know what i mean.
can barely read or write his own name and don't care.
he'll tell you they like him or that coloured folks ain't supposed to have but so much sense.
paid him to tie a tail to his ass and run around half-naked making monkey sounds.
they put him on a big round table in the cafe napoleon.
put a reed in his hand, a crown on his head a blanket on his shoulders and made him eat bananas in front of all them frenchies.
the white boys danced and passed out leaflets with his picture on it.
you can put your arms down when the search team finishes with you.
we don't want anybody from this fort going into tynin looking for rednecks.
any man found in the town will be immediately subject to court-martial.
sergeant waters' replacement will be assigned in a couple of weeks.

when i got here, the team had already won 9 or maybe 10 games in a row.
it was even rumoured we'd get the chance to play the yankees in exhibition.
around home, there's a fella folks used to call little jimmy one-leg on account of his thing was so big.
a couple of years ago a young pretty thing laid clap on jimmy so bad he lost the one good leg he had.
"got to watch what you're sayin' got to watch what you do
"'cause that low-down dirty waters is gonna roll all over you
the kind of coloured man that don't like lazy, shiftless negroes.
well, sir, you ain't got to come in here calling us names.
i just wanted to congratulate you men on the game you won today.
the way i figure it, only seven more and we'll be the first coloured team in army history to play the yankees.
see, a man told my daddy the day i was born:
he said, "the boy got the shadow of crow wings in his chest--"
when i checked the officers' billet, i found them both asleep.
they admitted they'd had an argument with the sergeant but said they'd left him on the road.
everyone in the barracks confirms that they were in by 23:30 and that neither man left till the following morning.
that's nothing but white officers lying to protect their own and you know that.
colonel, what will the army say when they find out two white officers beat up the murder victim not long before he was shot to death?
their co refuses to report that they had anything to do with it and he signs an affidavit supporting their alibi.
happened just last year right at the end of the baseball season.
a whole lot of shots had gone off right near the barracks.
and was almost caught, until someone in these barracks started shooting at the men chasing him.
so we got us a vicious, low-down murdering piece of black trash in here somewhere.
i told the lieutenant not to make the situation worse than it was.
so, we left him there, on the side of the road, on his knees.
he said he wasn't gonna obey the white man's orders anymore.
then he starts blaming wilcox and me for him being black.
he kept it quiet so the coloured boys wouldn't know anyone white was involved, but those weapons cleared ballistics.
besides, we've been short on .45 calibre ammo for what, six months?
the weapons had cleared and the colonel felt if he involved you you'd tell washington, which he thinks you did anyway.
sir, we were not involved in any way with the sergeant's death.
they put him on a big round table in the cafe napoleon.
put a reed in his hand, a crown on his head a blanket on his shoulders and made him eat bananas in front of all them frenchies.
when we slit his throat, you know that fool asked us what he had done wrong.
my daddy told me, we got to turn our backs on his kind.
any man found in the town will be immediately subject to court-martial.
sergeant waters' replacement will be assigned in a couple of weeks.
remember, you're the first colored officer most of these men have seen.
the army expects you to set an example for the colored troops and be a credit to your race.
and on the way over, the jeep hit a hole, bam!
and the papers flew all over the road and i happened to notice it, sir.
word went out on the grapevine you were here the minute you hit the fort.
i'm conducting an inquiry into the events surrounding the death of waters.
penalty for being drunk on duty is severe in peace time.
so don't bring me, "us colored folks can't do nothing unless they're drunk."
i just don't see why anybody would wanna kill the sarge.
[over speakers] # --the apple tree with anyone else but me #
around home, there's a fella folks used to call little jimmy one-leg on account of his thing was so big.
a couple of years ago, a young, pretty thing laid clap on jimmy so bad he lost the one good leg he had.
you know, that pretty young thing talking to me ain't look too clean.
yeah, them dirty ones will give you the clap every time, right, henson?
we don't need no more of that guitar-picking, sitting-around-the-shack music today, c.j.
i want all you out of those baseball uniforms and into work clothes.

to be a half hour late returning from lunch, especially when it's your first day on the job.
hey, rizzo, i'm about ready for the second part of my plan.
i'm going to need your help and all the other rats too.
maybe it would have been better if we had never met.
then you and jenny would not be tormented by my presence.
remember you promised me i could have one chance to become a broadway producer.
you would get the set and the lights and the scenery and everything !
don't you realize it might be against the law having a chicken dancing onstage ?
you mean you're going to go back on your promise ?
mr. "x," i'm sorry to tell you this, but your case is hopeless.
why don't you find a nice job and make a new life for yourself ?
we have a show to put on, your show, and it's opening tonight !
seeing a show would be a pleasant way to spend the time,
## not sure quite where and i don't know just when ##
[ floyd ] ## you're in my heart so until then ##
i really don't know what to say, except we're really glad you liked manhattan melodies.
we all worked hard to make it the best senior variety show ever.
remember you said we could not get married until we had enough money?
well, we'd have enough if we had a hit on broadway!
but we've got this great show called manhattan melodies that he'll wanna produce on broadway.
it's about kids that come to new york to marry and has a wonderful opening number that goes like this...

what we can do is give you a nice, clean set of clothes, wish you luck.

it's about kids that come to new york to marry and has a wonderful opening number.
i did some reading about broadway producers and investors and agents and i know what i have to do to sell our show.
i can use your help, because i have a three-part plan.
you know, maybe, kermit maybe it would've been better if we had never have met.
then you and jenny would not be tormented by my presence.
mr. x, i'm sorry to tell you this, but your case is hopeless.
why don't you find a job, make a new life for yourself.
we'd just like to thank everybody for having so much faith in us.
it's not often that a frog and a bear and a pig...
and a chicken and a whatever even get accepted into college.
we're all so proud to be graduating now, some with honors--
we've got this show called manhattan melodies he's gonna want to produce on broadway.
it's about a couple of kids that come to new york city to get married.

## you can't take no for an answer no, no, no ##
i did some reading last night about broadway producers and investors and agents.
now i know what i have to do to sell our show.
i would suggest to you that it is neither prudent nor wise...
to be a half hour late returning from lunch, especially when it's your first day on the job.
hey, rizzo, i'm about ready for the second part of my plan.
i'm going to need your help and all the other rats too.
you see, uh, seems that, uh... someone, um, picked mr. steele's pocket.
however, we- we know th-the culprit and exactly... where the- the culprit is.
you know it, and i know it, and you know i know it!
you were found in the room alone with the murder victim.
you have got to find a way to prove this case.
miss conover, i know, but right now i have to ask you something.
listen, kid, miss holt and i will solve this case with or without the pictures.
if that's all i wanted when i picked you up, all i had to do was twist your arm.
killing stiles may have eliminated the only link between him and the loan-sharking.
well, if that's the case, those photographs are more important than ever.
i had him believing there was at least one person who wasn't trying to scam him.
this morning that kid was nothing more than an annoying inconvenience.
you owe me one, and you're gonna make good, one way or another.
well, we're certainly making a lot of new friends today, aren't we?
frankly, steele, i came here because word is leaking out... that our bank funded loan-sharking... so i'm in desperate need of either a villain or a scapegoat.
i'll give you, well, to the end of the day... to bring me a villain before i make you the scapegoat.
if this is about those pictures- and it is, isn't it?
i just sold them to larry, and he's on his way to sell them to the guy you're trying to bust.
could it be that he took those negatives and put them in the photographs that he gave larry?
you mean the killer has the right pictures and the wrong negatives?
i can't very well have you blackmailing me for $10,000 every week, now, can i?
- if it's the money you want, i'll give it back to you.
they tied him right in to schwimmer and the loan-sharking operation.
you never told me how you knew which direction jackie took when he left the bus.
we know for a fact, mr. schwimmer... that you used your position in this bank to set up a phantom company.
your company, which also used the same borrowed funds... to bankroll a loan-sharking operation.
as a matter of fact, there-there does seem to be a slight delay.
you see, uh, seems that, uh... someone, um, picked mr. steele's pocket.
you were found in the room alone with the murder victim.
lieutenant, do you honestly think i had anything to do with his death?
you don't know what kind of pressure i'm under, miss holt.
you have got to find a way to prove this case.
miss conover, i know, but right now i have to ask you something.
would you be adverse to my giving your name to the police in relation to this case?
listen, if i'm gonna get the "crime doesn't pay" routine, don't bother.
- my old man laid that one on me a long time ago.
yes, well, mediocre talents and little quips won't get you by forever.
someday you're not gonna be cute any longer, and then where will you be?
once you get your hands on those pictures, i'll be just another bad memory.
listen, kid, miss holt and i will solve this case with or without the pictures.
this morning that kid was nothing more than an annoying inconvenience.
yeah, well, perhaps i know him better than i care to.
i also called the bank, and i checked with miss conover, and she told me that-
that i turned down each one of those four loan requests during the last nine months.
to the contrary, mr. steele's learned a great deal, haven't you, boss-sir?
oh, yes, of course i have... but miss krebs is much better at the specifics.
well, mr. steele's as sure as he can be at this point.
frankly, steele, i came here because word is leaking out... that our bank funded loan-sharking... so i'm in desperate need of either a villain or a scapegoat.
and with his smiling face plastered all over those negatives... it was as good as a calling card.
yes, well, apparently the buyer took a run at locating them... before he dealt with jackie.
and as soon as he taps it, he's gonna fly this here coop for good.
leroy, what we desperately need from you right now... is the location of that mother lode.
i should have known you were scamming me when you offered to pay up front.
well, i had to be sure i could get the negatives.
but how can i be sure that you didn't make any copies, hmm?
i can't very well have you blackmailing me for $10,000 every week, now, can i?
two years ago he disappeared from his usual haunts and i have every reason to believe that he... oh here it is.
i've every reason to believe that he's back in england again.
carlos of spain became a dribbling madman, a disastrous jewel digby.
the world would be much better off if it were sunk in the ocean from which it came.
under the circumstances wouldn't it be better to place a guard over it?
it has a hundred guards over it at this very moment.
i disconnected these wires just to show you how absurdly easy it would be for anyone,
far less ingenious and far less resourceful for giles conover to do the same thing.
awe come now mr. holmes haven't you made enough mistakes for one day?
it's no crime you know in taking a job in a museum.
one of two things has happened, either the woman he bumped into was an accomplice in which case she has the pearl, or he managed somehow to conceal it in his flight.
he had to stick that pearl in some make shift hiding place.
yes, what makes you so blinking sure there's a message in it?
because he asked me for a lend of me pencil that's why and he promised a quid if i'd keep my mouth shut.
berating me like a mother who boxes her child's ears after snatching it from under a tram.
a very human impulse watson and one that suggests that you've been taking up the cudgels on my behalf.
said she came in to clear away supper things and found him lying there.
and that's the first and last word we've been able to get out of her.
that's the outstanding feature of this case whether you know it or not.
all these broken plates, plaster ornament, bric-a-brac, why was all this china mashed and nothing else disturbed?
a monster watson with a chest of a buffalo and the arms of a gorilla.
his particular method of murder is back breaking and it's always the same, the third lumbar vertebrae.
when you heard that major harker's back was broken you suspected the creeper huh?
naturally, can't be mere coincidence that the creeper comes back into the scene just as giles conover reappears in london.
my surmise is that giles conover has lost the borgia pearl and is trying desperately to get it back just as we are.
i'm just as sure of it that am that we're being shadowed this very moment.
she may do many desperate things but my dear lestrade she does not run around the walls like a mouse.
those plates were taken down and smashed deliberately and it was done after she was killed and not before.
if you lift up that body i think you'll find there's not a vestige of broken china underneath.
just to prove your wrong, here lend a hand here becker.
we've got to get to the heart of this mystery and quickly too.
don't you realize there's a monster at large in the city bent on destruction?
you'll find more chance at finding the clue you're looking for in the china cause there is much more china.
and there's too much china watson and too little plaster, which leads me to suspect that the greater conceals the less and if the china was smashed to cover up the plaster.
i'm doing a little private investigating in connection with some busts of napoleon that you purchased from george gelder's plaster shop.
i understand there were six busts of napoleon here on wednesday morning last.
well don't be too hard on the poor girl mr. harder accidents will happen you know.
now tell me, you say that two of the busts were broken here in the shop, the third went to major harker, a fourth to miss carey and a fifth to mr. thomas sandeford.
yes you will find the pieces over there... in the container.
but you won't find the borgia pearl there my dear conover.
you know i never would have thought of disconnecting those wires if it hadn't been for your excellent example at the royal regent museum.
it has been said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
she lost her head you see when she found she was cornered.
grabbed a large pair of shears and stabbed doctor watson to death.
she'll hang for that you know and it's all your fault.
you got her into this and you won't raise a hand to help her will you?
till the greed and cruelty have burned out of every last one of us and when that time comes perhaps even the pearl will be washed clean again.

i don't think i can put up with those crazies tonight.

and then, on to the second week, you're allowed anything that begins with a "b."

do you know what he did to theresa, right in front of me?
he had his secretary call at 10:00 at night and say he had work to do at the office.
yes, i just want to take a look over here for a second.
i searched all day long, but i couldn't find that woman who was haunting me.
it fell out of your pocket yesterday, when you got off your horse.
i decided to pick it up after you left so quickly.
you go over, you get into bed, you see dr. schumacher...

during our 35-minute stroll, i realized i was still in a deep fog.

four weeks ago i met a cute, available old-fashioned guy who liked horse riding.
in one month you got married you had two daughters and you can't ride a horse to save your life.
in fact, he's seated on a small window sill, smoking a cigarette.

when eva finally told me who you really were i wondered how many other spies i was lecturing to.
gee, it's funny, in all the conversations we had you never mentioned eva.
do you have any idea how many things i have never mentioned to you?
i have nothing now to show for my one and only trip to hawaii.
i wish your father had not dropped the camera out of the war canoe.
a guard at the lubyanka was so outraged at what they had done that he assisted me in my escape.

this guy called me up and said he had seen my self-help routine... in 'holly does hollywood"... and he wanted to hire me to do it in private.
he said that he had this friend who got off on peeping.

alexander revelle set me up in this house to witness the murder.
i know this all seems crazy, but i'm trying to help you.
are you gonna stay in there for the rest of your life?

but you kept on her tail after this other guy disappeared.
you peep on her, follow her, fuck her and keep her panties as a memento.
then you sit on the 50-yard line and watch her being slaughtered!
i should have known when you told me i had a terrific smile.
no real producer would tell me that in a million years.
he was looking for somebody who needed a place to stay.
i thought it was a coincidence that we kept running info each other.
he hired the indian to follow gloria... and snatch her purse and steal the card key to her house... and then sneak inside.
then when she got home... the indian opened the blinds so i could see him kill her.
i thought it belonged to gloria, but it must have belonged to the husband.
that's why he never barked at the indian when he tried to sneak in the house.
you were hired to come in and do two nights' work.
you were hired to come in, do your routine and leave.

you peep on her, follow her, fuck her and keep her panties as a memento.
then you sit on the 50-yard line and watch her being slaughtered!
i should have known when you told me i had a terrific smile.
no real producer would tell me that in a million years.
he was looking for somebody who needed a place to stay.
i thought it was a coincidence that we kept running info each other.
he hired the indian to follow gloria... and snatch her purse and steal the card key to her house... and then sneak inside.
then when she got home... the indian opened the blinds so i could see him kill her.
i thought it belonged to gloria, but it must have belonged to the husband.
that's why he never barked at the indian when he tried to sneak in the house.
i thought it belonged to gloria, but it must've belonged to the husband.

as soon as i pack up, you can put your stuff away.
as far as i'm concerned... you're the real reason gloria revelle got murdered.

this guy called me up and said he had seen my self-help routine... in "holly does hollywood"... and he wanted to hire me to do it in private.
he said that he had this friend who got off on peeping.

none of you have yet realized that the universe itself is a life form, and it is currently still in an embryonic state.
when the universe is filled with the lives of you organics, it will be reborn and evolve to the next stage.
we should go into the city before they find us again.
as a soldier, i used to fight here so i'm familiar with the area.
the bomb itself is small, but once it explodes, it causes a chain reaction, and the entire planet turns to plasma.
so even if we have it, we can't use it without destroying the planet.
that's why we were planning to take it to the inorganic home planet and detonate it there.
but this place was destroyed in a nuclear attack before we could.

they wanted more, but he told them sharply: "nein!" and came to our performance.
now, looking his best, shining like a moth from outer space,
i have a sweater too, which my wife and i knitted together.
we do everything together, so we made the sweater together too.
when tarzan goes to the jungle, he first visits jane, and then he inserts her his chita.
he asks her to take care of his chita, so he doesn't fall.
first i started performing alone, as the moth, and i liked it.
others accepted it bit by bit, so, i stayed the moth.
i knew you were a moth, but i didn't know you were a cockroach!
when you needed me, you were all nice and quiet, and now you run away from me!
i took water out of a well, that lever hit me, and the water from the well was cold, so i have a sore throat.
nurse, if you don't have any more questions, bring me tea.

we have found the chassis and engine number of the trucks.
to remove suspicion from that spot they used 555 timer along with rdx.

call me up on the wireless as soon as you get an answer.
the dogs and i have had a truce for a couple of months now.
they let me alone, and i give them a steak once a week.
it didn't have anything to do with him, just his money.
she was drooling over the thought of getting half of his used-car lot.
of course, i can't see the face, especially with the sunglasses on.
but, man, believe me, with a body like this, if i were...
man, up until that time, the only waves i had seen were the ones when i slipped in the bathtub.
but now, here i am out there where the big chompers live on a little bitty board trying to make like some hollywood hotshot in malibu.
then the very next day, you see her on this big yacht through the long lens of your camera.
you can't get a picture unless her back is to you.
all she would have to do would be to pick up the phone and call the navy.
they'd tell her where you are, at least your last location.
oh, by the by, here are the prints you wanted me to make for you.
well, i had finished developing my campaign pictures and, uh, the solution was still good.
you come here looking for me, you roust a kid, you damn near start a riot.
this is honolulu, and in case you haven't heard, the war's over.
it's just that i can't imagine a short turkey like you with a woman like that.
let's see just how hot you are without a piece, fuzzball.
we spent the rest of the day and night in little saigon, striking out.
no one knew michelle, the three yo-yos, or the kid who stole my wallet.
i have every right to, the way you con and hoodwink me.
it's got something to do with the dod investigation into your unit in nam.
maybe you can get by them, but you're gonna be awol.
there's not a court in the land that would convict me.
i know a lot of brass who would just love to see you in a brig at norfolk.
well, look at the bright side of this, there's a positive side.
the... the navy will release you from active duty just as soon as you testify.
and washington's beautiful this time of year, uh, and filled with lovely ladies, just especially for a navy commander.
any party crasher will tell you the key to getting in when you don't belong, is to look like you do.
and the navy had been kind enough to put me on the base in uniform.
you're running out of time and you have no idea who the tiger is, where the tiger is!
so, you are trying to involve my wife because she is french and was a nurse in south vietnam.
you forget, general, that this mission of yours is simply to provide me time to find the tiger.
and when i find him, or her, to execute whoever it is in as public a manner as possible.
that is why he insisted upon having the mia negotiations here in hawaii instead of hanoi.
he and col. ki knew that the tiger would be here this month to organize the refugee community and to negotiate for aid from your cia.
last night, col. ki came to the church looking for me.
he said you knew he was there and... and that i should go with him.
and know that i have loved you since the first day i saw you.
i will continue to love you until the last day of my life, and beyond.
it's been quite a few years since i retired from the regiment.
true i may have put on a stone or two, but that's to be expected when one leaves the rigors of army life for a civilian position.
you provided the cover fire so col. ki could see michelle with me.
you want him to think she's an agent, maybe the tiger.
set up a network of refugees, gather support, arrange funding, weapons, form a political base.
oh, come on, buck, you're not gonna dance to that fiddler again.
and i was driving to where i prayed she would be.
the scary part of all this was that buck was right.
now, i was the target of every aspiring performer on the island.
if they could do bird calls, juggle dishes, or do a handstand, they were doing it for me.
but you were too late, and i'm hoping we can change that.
my visions almost always come true in some form, and i would like to change the outcome of this one.
this particular bottle was found in hitler's bunker after he died.
it's a 1936 lafite rothschild with a swastika under the date.
well, what do you think the better business bureau would call it?
i don't know what i'm gonna do with you, tom, i really don't.
it was a couple from a divorce case i was working on.
look, you said your visions started when you saw my photo in the paper.
i was at the helm, even though my fever was 103.
i remember the night was moonlit, rather like the sea off the coast of lisbon in june.
i mean, all of your visions have related to a case that i've worked on or that you've worked on.
so, it seemed logical that some fragment of one of your visions would relate to the missing bottle of wine, and higgins said that o'shane had died six months ago, and judging from the degree of decomposition that you described,
he simply let thelma find out when and where he was gonna pay me for my services rendered, knowing that she would talk eddie into giving me some nasty lumps.
then he calls the cops in time to save me from the lumps, but get thelma and eddie's assault on record.
but probably the most important scientific knowledge of our time still exists on the sole of patrik's foot.
all attempts by giovanna castelli, to unlock the genius of her teacher... using the supercomputer fail.
in 14 days... the world food conference is held in rome.
and if the public finds out that there's this formula, and that the boy is the only one who has it, whereever it may be, then nothing more will happen to him.
the formula gives us the unique opportunity to realize a dream.
perhaps soon one won't hear of the underdeveloped countries of south america,
for prince ali this formula would be the gateway to paradise.
with professor gunströms discovery, the whole world can become a paradise!
or rather, in the most beautiful of all gardens, where the sand has not yet engulfed the thriving life.
with this image, you can understand the misfortune of my people.
besides, you'll find his mortal enemy ibrahim still in custody here.
you could get him from the penalty bench and use him.
your siblings in our lomonossov university... are very worried about you.
therefore i've seen to it that you can resume your studies.
for ali much more important and valuable than the affection of his subjects.
you must know, that many people here have lost their property, because they've sold off their water rights to richer neighbors.
if you rob a man... like professor gunström and destroy his life?
it was already destroyed the moment he came up with the formula.
in my case, i discovered early on that one can make a lot of money through treason.
my study of physics was through... and i needed starting capital.
the pacards are hiding in their alpine cabin until the world food conference in rome.
in rome, patrik is to testify that the formula still exists.
perhaps soon one won't hear of the underdeveloped countries of south america,
india, africa or something, but rather the well-fed, happy people of the earth.
for prince ali this formula would be the gateway to paradise.
with professor gunströms discovery, the whole world can become a paradise!
yes, there's an asterisk by the name, so... he's a vip.
and the little "d" means he's traveling on a diplomatic passport.
you have the opportunity to apply your extraordinary abilities as a biochemist.
you'll test out the invention of your teacher, prof. olav gunström.
the guy says that patrik is doing well, he wouldn't let him lack for anything, but he's unfortunately indispensable.
$12,000 monthly, villa with a swimming pool, two cars, beach house... everything.
your employer enjoys the favor of prince ali, i think which allows you to do something.
besides, you'll find his mortal enemy ibrahim still in custody here.
yes, however kharkov needs to, how shall i say it, motivate him.
your siblings in our lomonossov university... are very worried about you.
your bakush deserve better press in the west than they've had up to now.
i am neither a slave of the east or the west.
you must know, that many people here have lost their property, because they've sold off their water rights to richer neighbors.
and water is more important here than the vast oil under the desert.
if you rob a man... like professor gunström and destroy his life?
it was already destroyed the moment he came up with the formula.
in my case, i discovered early on that one can make a lot of money through treason.
my study of physics was through... and i needed starting capital.
i haven't used it since i learned it in high school.
yeah, well, i'm really not saying anything that's making any sense.
my wife and i have invited some guests for the weekend.
if you were to join the party, come to bromfield hall....
well, thank you, but i do have some business to attend to.
no, i think it's important, you see, because if the two of you are seen together it might appear that you are more than employer and secretary.
my dear, i've been looking simply everywhere for you because i do want to find out what happened.
i mean, how do you come to be in that position?
as liaison with the intelligence community he's privy to a great deal.
but why would lord bromfield try to kill anyone at his own home?
you know, you could really hurt a guy's feelings the way you've been trying to avoid me and all.
we don't see you around the track that often, when we do, you're always calling them right on the nose.
i can see we're going to have to teach you a little lesson about sharing the wealth.
if you want to stay healthy, you and me are going to be partners.
hey, listen, guys, i've thought this over, and i'm not really interested.
why don't you just let me off at la cienega, okay?
well, there are some people up at thornhill that are anxious to meet with you.
yeah, well, what would you do if i just opened the door and jumped, huh?
ah, perhaps you can tell me what the hell i'm doing here.
we wanted to talk to you about the project that we're working on.
so, jane, what you do here, in effect, is count boners.
i can see you're going to be a real challenge to work with.
do you think next time you could spare me the cloak-and-dagger act?
oh, you mean you would have come if i just called?
i can always have you dropped back into your life of playing the horses and hustling the women.
i wouldn't dream of standing in the way of anything that important.
and i don't know what demons that boy has inside, but... they were certainly too much for edward now.
i think i'd have to be out of my mind to hook up with that machine of yours.
we all feel that the possibilities for our program are tremendously exciting.
but we've got to see that you don't jeopardize the wonderful work you've already done.
all i know is i have this terrible feeling of anxiety.
the neighbors are starting to think that george is a little crazy.
and i think that's what you have to do to help buddy, alex.
whatever his demon is, you have to help him face it.
the president has retired for a few days to his california retreat to recuperate while he prepares for the geneva nuclear disarmament conference.
white house press-secretary james nichols announced today the president will personally lead the united states delegation at the conference, which is scheduled to convene early next month.
yeah, well, if he's so powerful, then, what the hell is he doing wasting his time on dream research, huh?
consider all the deep, dark secrets that people hide away in their minds.
now, those secrets are bound to come out in their dreams, no?
it occurs to me that a technique for plumbing those secrets could be of enormous interest to certain intelligence groups.
he certainly wouldn't be the first world leader to take his dreams seriously.
no, but he could be the first to destroy his country because of it.
i mean, these are the guys even the cia are afraid of.
what, you mean he's training me to be some kind of a spy?
there's going to be some people coming here in a couple of minutes.
they're going to be in a hurry, and i want you to slow 'em down for me.
why don't you just let me off at la cienega, okay?
i know this is going to sound a bit sinister, mr. gardner, but we have instructions to bring you back with us.
well, look, i'm sorry, but i hung up the psychic bit when i was 19.
well, that's fine, because we're not interested in parlor tricks here.
do you think next time you could spare me the cloak-and-dagger act?
oh, you mean you would have come if i just called?
i can always have you dropped back into your life of playing the horses and hustling the women.
i wouldn't dream of standing in the way of anything that important.
but all the machine does is help connect your brainwaves with the dreamer's.
but, hopefully, once you get proficient at dreamlink, you won't even need the machine.
and i don't know what demons that boy has inside, but... they were certainly too much for edward now.
i think i'd have to be out of my mind to hook up with that machine of yours.
i'm not going to have you start trying to play mind-reader with me.
well, how else do you expect me to warm up the old whammy, huh?
we all feel that the possibilities for our program are tremendously exciting.
but we've got to see that you don't jeopardize the wonderful work you've already done.
yeah, i found that if i could talk to somebody, it made me feel a whole lot better.
so, that's what i want to tell you, is that if you ever want to talk to somebody, talk to me.
all i know is i have this terrible feeling of anxiety.
the neighbors are starting to think that george is a little crazy.
well, whatever webber's dreaming is the key to all his problems.
i'd say whoever sold him that toupée is the key to all his problems.
they believe their dream lives are just as real as their waking lives.
the children are taught to never lose control in a nightmare.
the president has retired for a few days to his california retreat to recuperate while he prepares for the geneva nuclear disarmament conference.

if you're concerned about security, then, this wing is clearly the easiest one to isolate.
if you can't handle the move, my people will do it for you.
i mean, these are the guys even the cia are afraid of.
what, you mean he's training me to be some kind of a spy?
when you dream that you die, you die in life... the very same instant.
now we can go into an enemy's dream... kill him... make it look as if he died in his sleep.
there's going to be some people coming here in a couple of minutes.
they're going to be in a hurry, and i want you to slow 'em down for me.
you mortals think you are so full of heart and soul and love and kindness.
you think your god looks down on you with tenderness and mercy?
what i developed with cal, it-- it's what gives me an edge.
( scoffs ) god, every time i think about that experiment that you were involved in and how you were able to link up.
lose one... just one... and i shall have both your souls.
paul, what if this thing is real and we can't get out of here?
the city was dutch then and they were expecting an attack from the english in new england so they built a wall for protection but the bids from the private contractors were too high, so the people built it themselves.
it ran from the east river straight to the hudson, straight across.

yeah, because we took him to the city for his birthday because the circus was in town.
course, we have to do the same thing for the other one for his birthday.
i should have slept with him, maybe that would have made it easier.
i just think we were meant to be together, even though we never will be.
take this bag, open its strings and fill the countryside with a blizzard of snow.
let any clergyman who tries to get through be buried under six feet of snow and not discovered until next spring!
i will make the offer once more, and only once, but, first, know your fate.
at the touch of this switch, the whole of chesters missionary college - so-called - will explode into flames.
i said you'd have it under your hand, and you've had it under your hand.
you had it under your hand today and you didn't know.
the last time you were here some poor guy tried to hang himself... because you wouldn't shut up!
if he so much as touches one hair on her head, i'm gonna kill him.
maybe it ain't the best of towns... but it ain't the worst, either.
so what if the football team and the baseball team got to share the same nickname?
maybe hawaii isn't... the most breathtaking place in the world... but if it isn't, i don't know what is.
and even though big-league sports haven't come our way yet... we have plenty of big-league sunsets to keep us going.
the only thing was, my little voice was telling me... there was some little loose end i hadn't wrapped up.
if i was listening carefully enough... perhaps i would have heard it.
instead, i was hearing other music, namely... a little tchaikovsky and a lot of tolstoy.
yes, i was finally going to take the time and get through war and peace.
while i appreciate your retrieving it from the box... i do not appreciate your leaving it under the chainsaw... in the gardener's shed for the past five days.
that is not where l'm accustomed to going through the estate correspondence.
from now on, it will be the lads' duty, not yours.
because of you, the whole financial pyramid... that is my managing of the estate economy... could come crashing down into a depression that would rival that of '29.
well, let me tell you that computers and electronics... are the wave of the future in this industry.
foot-tails and stakeouts will become as obsolete as panama hats... and the ubiquitous informants on the street.
you remember the time when you and me and frankie albright... busted up that greek olive smuggling ring in the....
hey, tom, i want you to meet some buddies of mine from the old days.
me and the boys have got some memories to catch up on.
you know, tom was with me and helped me bust up that artie canoe guy a while back.
i found the boys, blackie, nick the stick and rudy g, quite interesting.
their stories were bizarre... but it was kind of neat to hear about the good old days.
the shock of having someone close to you... suddenly and inexplicably yanked away... was a brutal reminder of how fragile... human relationships can be.
of course, we were both too professional... to let that affect our realistic assessment of the facts.
the butler got blanche drunk, seduced her... wrote this phony kidnap note, and then ran off with her.
why would blanche run off with higgins, luther, when she's got you?
i'm just gonna drop you off at doc lbold's so you can get your head examined.
and then i'm gonna go back to the estate... and see if there's any messages from the kidnappers.
miss rafferty, although the higgins lineage is decidedly distinguished... it is not of the realm.
i guess you're not being held here on account of for your bread.
chuckie and me was being held prisoner... by moe safronsky and his gang... in this cabin in the catskills.
see, these hotel comedians, they was being bumped off one by one--
i shall attempt to remove the hairpin from your hair with my teeth... and use it to try to undo our bonds.
it may take some time and effort, but it will be worth it.
i realized the alternative, coming down here with luther... was worse.
so i left him with doc ibold and a fervent request that he be heavily sedated.
the slammer, the big house, the hoosegow... i know all the names, they don't scare me.
they haven't built a joint big enough to hold luther gillis for long.
and that's why i'm gonna stop at nothing till i find her.
so, no more of that funny business... like getting that doc to fill me up with dope.
let me tell you what's gonna happen if after i count to three... you don't tell me where blanche and higgins are.
luther's gonna hit big sally over the head with the frying pan... you're gonna shoot luther... and then i'm gonna shoot you.
nice try, big guy, but you'll have to come up with something else.
or just go through with the exchange and hope for the best.
i'm supposed to be there tonight to accept an award for the best book.
what do you mean i was never gonna get an award?
the last time you were here some poor guy tried to hang himself... because you wouldn't shut up!
if he so much as touches one hair on her head, i'm gonna kill him.
maybe it ain't the best of towns... but it ain't the worst, either.
so what if the football team and the baseball team got to share the same nickname?
(magnum) maybe hawaii isn't... the most breathtaking place in the world... but if it isn't, i don't know what is.
and even though big-league sports haven't come our way yet... we have plenty of big-league sunsets to keep us going.
after a real tough case on the big island... [birds chirping] i was ready for some quiet r and r.
the only thing was, my little voice was telling me... there was some little loose end i hadn't wrapped up.
if i was listening carefully enough... perhaps i would have heard it.
instead, i was hearing other music, namely... a little tchaikovsky and a lot of tolstoy.
yes, i was finally going to take the time and get through war and peace.
some people make new year's resolutions to stop drinking... or quit kicking their dog.
i knew i could count on hearing that pathetic little phrase once again.
it is as regular as the rising and setting of the--
i just don't want it to happen again, and it won't happen again.
from now on, it will be the lads' duty, not yours.
"you are cordially invited by the national academy of private investigators...
"to their 1 7th annual convention to present a golden keyhole award."
well, let me tell you that computers and electronics... are the wave of the future in this industry.
foot-tails and stakeouts will become as obsolete as panama hats... and the ubiquitous informants on the street.
you know, tom was with me and helped me bust up that artie canoe guy a while back.
yeah, it reminded me of the time when i was back in keokuk.
there were these bohemian used cars.... (magnum) i know what you're thinking.
you're thinking i spent the whole day at the convention... bored out of my mind.
i found the boys, blackie, nick the stick and rudy g, quite interesting.
their stories were bizarre... but it was kind of neat to hear about the good old days.
(magnum) one of the tougher things about being... a private investigator was doing what i was doing now.
going into a potentially dangerous situation... without really knowing what form the danger would take.
i can assure you this is not my idea of idyllic bliss, either.
in fact, your presence here, my dear woman... acutely exacerbates the situation.
i guess you're not being held here on account of for your bread.
miss rafferty, i'm quite sure that the reason we're being held here... can be directly attributed to the presence of your fiancé... i wish.
see, these hotel comedians, they was being bumped off one by one--
please, miss rafferty, i fail to see how some sordid tale from the past... can have any relevance to our current plight.
it may take some time and effort, but it will be worth it.
not unlike the time that i was imprisoned with bertie farnbush... and his maiden sister in an albanian zipper factory by--
even though i realized it was risky coming down to hotel street... and looking for artie keanu alone...
i realized the alternative, coming down here with luther... was worse.
let me tell you what's gonna happen if after i count to three... you don't tell me where blanche and higgins are.
luther's gonna hit big sally over the head with the frying pan... you're gonna shoot luther... and then i'm gonna shoot you.
it was 9:30 and i was wearing this strapless blue gown.
oh, the big full moon was shining... and the browns lost a game to the tigers.
nice try, big guy, but you'll have to come up with something else.
or just go through with the exchange and hope for the best.
(luther) let's just kick in the doors and go in blazing.
look, luther, even though we're early and have the advantage of surprise... i still think we ought to use some finesse.
if you had any technical sophistication at all... you'd realize that this is a remote control unit.
all i have to do is press that button and your blanche and that englishman... will leave this world, literally.
and then you busted him and i got caught in the net.
it's funny, i was so small then, you didn't even know who i was.
let us undertake a cinematic journey... through the world of fantasy.
to this end, i have dug up a few major movie treats from my film archives.
the mummy has found some reason to awaken from its century-long sleep.
naturally, the mummy falls in love with an unknown girl... whom it mistakes for its long-lost love.
in this castle, dr. frankenstein has his laboratory... where he created a man from corpses.
he and his servant fritz are on the verge... of breathing new life into the creature with the help of electricity.
at last i know what it means... to feel like god!
of course, the calculations of our brilliant scientist don't pan out... and the creature only does what monsters will do.
create a woman for me, or you will end up like fritz.
dr. frankenstein knows the monster will kill him too if he resists... so he creates a bride for the monster.
my research leads me to believe... that this dinosaur is a gazorrasaur.
this is a dinosaur species that has been extinct for millions of years.
well, coach...these guys burst into the bar and they... i thought it was just one guy.
no, i just said one guy had a gun...that i saw.
i guess i really shouldn't have done it, but i'll tell you something.
the next time one of those drunk, drugged-out punks decide to break in and take advantage of an honest citizen, they'll think twice about it, i'll tell you.
when my husband left last night with a gun, i never thought he would...
why think of something that had nothing to do with me!
sorry, diane, tonight's receipts are making too much noise. i can't hear you.
i honestly don't care what you do, but i must say i'm a little disappointed.
no, i just said one guy had a gun...that i saw.
they could have all had guns, but when they saw what i did to their pal, they just took off out of there.
yes, i realise i'm burning my bridges, but there's no hard feelings on this end.
in fact, if you're ever in bora bora, stop by the peterson hut and we'll share a cup of grog, sir.
i fly through the air completing, one, two, three, oh, my god, four somersaults.
the first quadruple in the history of the big top, norm!
yes, i realise i'm burning my bridges, but there's no hard feelings on this end.
in fact, if you're ever in bora bora, stop by the peterson hut and we'll share a cup of grog, sir.
i had... i had years of private lessons, but when the time finally came to audition for the juilliard school, with my first step i fell down and bloodied my nose.
and before i could do anything else, they said, "thank you very much."
the first quadruple in the history of the big top, norm!
but, i became a postal carrier and the rest is history.
we will pause here for several minutes, after which we will go to the hotel where a dinner is waiting for us.
environs preserve many monuments which allow to trace primary paths of develoment of russian architecture of xv-xvi centuries.
but they wiped off the text and went to the cinema.
and i came up with the idea to say that we've gone to see the physics teacher.
i could have an opportunity to give you several extra excellent marks in order to prove what an extraordinary class i have!
and, by the way, someone in moscow took offence at this.
in order to build it, he sold entire village of the bessoltsevs:
my grandfather, my grandmother and even the famous petr, the artist, whose paintings we collect.
you mean i've had an android as my adc without knowing it?
when he made that copy of me, it was like looking into a mirror.
i forced him to agree more for the next delivery, sir.
he's desperate for the gas weapons so i said eight kilos or no deal.
if it wasn't for you, we'd be well on our way home.
i should've wiped you out the minute i first saw you.
i know how bored an officer of your temperament gets with hq duties.
as you know, we've had a satellite monitoring radio signals here for some time.
why don't we ditch what's his name and go spend a week on my yacht?
all anyone has to do is shoot out the tires, and we'd be helpless.
you do not get to be as powerful... as the greykirk corporation playing by the rules.
you're afraid if the greykirk corporation hears... you're going to testify, they'll try to grab the children...
well, a tap will only pick up an irritating electronic whine.
[ chuckles ] i'm instructed to assure you, sir- and these are the chairman's precise words- the reappearance of walter gallen... will actually help both you and greykirk.
[ laughs ] there are times when i tell myself the same thing.
why don't we ditch what's his name and go spend a week on my yacht?
i'm sorry, but i owe you about three flats of petunias.
i brought you fresh clothes, and i've got them in the r.v.
you know, when john ford was directing stagecoach... someone asked him, "why don't the indians shoot the horses?"
and he replied, " because then we wouldn't have a movie."
that would explain the key lime pie- and how the niemeyers found us.
if our trusted miss haines knew where we were... then she could probably figure out where mr. gallen is this morning.
and if snatching the kids was the greykirk corporation's plan " a"...
i'm sure they have a plan " b." we're not early.
and if i were you, i would definitely not invest in greykirk stock.
now that we're gonna be living in los angeles... you think maybe we could take in a movie?
i have been, but the government has asked me... to testify about my old associates at the greykirk corporation.
if i do, then they'll let me, uh... well, come home.
i have two children living in this house... and they mean the world to me.
you do not get to be as powerful... as the greykirk corporation playing by the rules.
my being here has changed that, and i will not agree to testify... unless i know that chris and angel are in safe hands.
now, all you have to do is take them on a little trip.
i've been asked to testify day after tomorrow- federal court in phoenix.
now, you deliver chris and angel to me after the hearing... safe and sound, and i'm going to put you in a brand new tax bracket.
[ chuckles ] i'm instructed to assure you, sir- and these are the chairman's precise words- the reappearance of walter gallen... will actually help both you and greykirk.
[ chuckles ] well, we believe... there's an area in which mr. gallen is vulnerable... to persuasion.
a girl with your looks doesn't have to work this hard.
[ laughs ] there are times when i tell myself the same thing.
all right, obviously the child in you... is a bit overwhelmed by the child in her.
if the child in you takes one more shot at the child in me-
dad always thinks he's fooling me, so i let him think so.
i've had more cousins with big shoulders and bulges in their jackets-
yes, senator, i am aware of the rumors bouncing around washington.
but as i told you earlier, we're in complete control of the situation.
all anyone has to do is shoot out the tires, and we'd be helpless.
you know, when john ford was directing stagecoach... someone asked him, "why don't the indians shoot the horses?"
hiding your head in the sand is not gonna keep... the rest of your extremities from getting shot off.
after all, i do believe that gallen intends... to name you as chief recipient of greykirk's largess.
we have reason to believe you accompanied walter gallen to phoenix... where you no doubt left him with federal marshals.
i'm authorized to pay each one of you $1 00,000... for the exact time gallen's arriving at that courthouse.
if our trusted miss haines knew where we were... then she could probably figure out where mr. gallen is this morning.
and if snatching the kids was the greykirk corporation's plan " a"...
this afternoon saw the conclusion of the libel case brought against the informateur by françois-rené pervillard, known in politics and finance as "the president".
mr pervillard will be our guest on the whole truth, on this channel next wednesday.
you know... sometimes, through one's professional contacts, bonds can be formed.
a coincidence is a coincidence, whatever you think, but guess who plays squash here.
- with a video of under a minute, mr senanques revealed the truth about president pervillard.
the video was filmed without pervillard's knowledge and confirms the facts that he previously denied.
a cargo of food destined to starving africans was sold to cuba.
senanques' victory in this battle with his former client will be far-reaching, as it will be supported by the press.
lord, i want to say thanks for helping me do things right and i ask forgiveness for what i've done wrong.
virgin mary, guard me tonight and help me tomorrow so i can be better.
i'm going to the metro, it's been a while since i've been there and it's a good spot
i bet, the best, but things have gotten tough, real tough,
sergio needs new clothes, he needs to eat right and i want him to go to school, all of that costs lots of money, i need to bring in cash
i understand you duke, but be real careful with those guys, they're mean
it's a good thing you don't have children, if you did...
if i did they'd all be drunks or drug addicts or whatever
sure, but in spite of your rights we better pick this up and beat it
well, i always say... that a timely retreat is always a victory, that's what napolean always said
c'mon rocky, let's make like a banana and split, that's what i always say!
it's so pretty, it's like we were in another country, right duke?
egypt, it's an egyptian temple that was built by the pharaohs
wow, it must have been tough to bring all those rocks from egypt
hey, will you tell me about the pharaohs and cleopatra one day?
of course, and you'll see how interesting those stories are, they're like fairy tales
of course, what a delight, it was a desire near to my heart
you're as slippery as an eel man, but we're good at catching the slippery ones like you
those good for nothings, did they have to break your guitar?
it was my companion for 20 years and look at how the poor thing ended up, nothing could be salvaged except for the strap
i spoke with sarcedo later and i think that it was the dirtiest sort of deal.
several families were left on the street and without a cent, just the clothes on their backs
not for the moment, because he knows he can get much more in the future
he's not dumb, it's clear to him that you'll want to see the boy again
now he'll lose his freedom, like i lost mine when i had money
i was rich you know, very rich, but a bad rumor ruined me
i don't know, but you have to think hard about what you're going to do with the boy
to give him a good upbringing, that's what i think, to give him an education so he becomes a man
- duke, they're very nice to me, they give me lots of stuff, they take me to the movies, i have a good time
yes, i know, and i'm very happy, but you have a great time with me too
i think the result of the vote leaves no doubt, the project is approved
i'm sorry enrique, but you know that when i want something-
we're going to have such a big dinner tonight, and we have so much chocolate
well now, look who it is, the duke in person, and with company
- they had my number, luckily there are still good people are else i wouldn't be around to talk about it
hey, and how am i supposed to pay for treatment like this?
- from a good friend of yours, he looked for our number and let us know
we were very worried, you had a serious concussion, they even thought you might have had a cranial fracture at first
- we want him to have a stable family, a home, we want to give him an opportunity to be something in life, and you can't give him any of those things.
well, think about what i've said, it's for the boy's good, don't forget that
well you're right, the worst part is that sheriff lazario the quick is in el paso taking care of some business
if he'd been here it'd be different, the ponzos wouldn't have dared to kidnapped the longoria's kid
i read a newspaper this morning murcian's bar, there was a whole page dedicated to the boy's adoption
it seems that the longorias are important people, and very rich
we're going to have to set the record for patience to put up with his story
what happened with the elephant is nothing along side what happened to me in kenya
well i love them, all those girls julio iglesias is going out with!
that stud beltinos borne, or the houses of the famous, so pretty, so well appointed
as the lady has ordered, i've brought the child, he's already eaten
how cute, he looks so smart, and he's very tall for his age
- really son, i promise, and please don't call me sir, i'm your father
son, now you'll drink this glass of warm milk and some pills
- listen to me from now on, you'll see how everything will get better
look at them milady, soon their heads will be removed by the headsman's axe
i thought you had understood, or is it that you're trying to get rid of a responsibility that you sought out?
the boy is here because you wanted him to be, it's your obligaton to educate him
the duke will come to save me and he'll punish you, he'll punish you!
listen kid, no one's going to hit you anymore, but you have to be obedient
i want you to know i'm willing to pay whatever they ask
i understand, but my advice is that as soon as the kidnappers get in contact with you-
in the meantime we'll make a plan to get the ransom without a problem
i'll go see how the boy's doing, see if he wants to eat something
- it all happened very quickly, the fraulein barely saw them
the girl described one of them, but it's very confused, she's not sure of anything, and besides, there's a lot of people like that on the streets
i'm warning you, you better play along or i'll kill all three of you
we're very close to their whereabouts, the boy will be back with you soon
this kidnapping is a real botched job, clearly the work of amateurs
commissioner, i prefer to pay, i don't want sergio in any danger
i told you i don't like these capguns, what did you expect?
i'm just a thug, a two bit hoodlum, and i'm scared to death too
i want the police to leave, leaving behind a car with a full gas tank and with the 10 grand too
the kids coming with me and i'll let him out where i feel like it, and if i see anything funny i'll blow his brains out, is that clear?
that's the duke, yes, that's the duke, no, you're my hero and i love you, yes sir
i'm always happy with my boy that i love, only him, only him, my love
wandering and playing through the streets and the metros can be, can be, a pleasure
i don't want anything that people look for, only him, only him, my love
if they don't like my presence, i'm sorry, i can't, i can't, do a thing
that's the duke, yes, that's the duke, no, he's the strongest and the bravest, yes sir
that's the duke, yes, that's the duke, no, you're my hero and i love you, yes sir
when i wake up i give thanks to the lord that i live, that i live, just for him
i make breakfast and then i clean the house and i leave, and i leave, with him
i always walk, enjoying life, next to him, next to him, next to him
i love you so much my child that without you, without you, i'm nothing
that's the duke, yes, that's the duke, no, he's the strongest and the bravest, yes sir
that's the duke, yes, that's the duke, no, you're my hero and i love you, yes sir
i have in my life just one great desire and it's to provide, to provide, for him
now, i don't want to be forced to call the police.
these people are guests of mine, but you are trespassing, mr. thorn.
no, but i observed the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.
you started early, but you had a drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.
there is no mystery, my dear lady, the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places, the marks are fresh.
there is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that particular way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver.
at present it is out of my power to reward you, but in a few weeks i should be married with control of my own income.
i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as to that of your friend.
my stepfather then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live in his ancestral house at stoke moran.
but the money your mother left you was enough for all your wants, so that was no obstacle to your happiness?
sometimes he goes away with them for days at a time.
you can imagine from what i'm saying that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives.
no servant would stay long so we did all the work of the house.
she was but 30 when i lost her, but already her hair had begun to whiten, even as mine has.
he investigated the case with great care, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death.
and your evidence would have shown that the door was fastened on the inner side, the windows blocked by shutters, secured every night.
it's my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was which frightened her i cannot imagine.
what do you gather from the allusion to a band, a speckled band?
so what prompted you to come here when your life seems set so fair?
yesterday, some repairs were started and my bedroom wall was pierced, so that last night i was forced to move into the chamber in which julia died, to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.
if we were to come to stoke moran today, could we see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?
as it happens, he spoke of coming to town today on some business.
i shall walk down to doctors' commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.
let us meet again at 1:00 under the clock at waterloo station.
i would be obliged if you would slip it into your pocket.
an eley #2 is an excellent argument against gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.
he proved rather hard to locate, but i finally managed to get him through swanson at bards.
he did know roylott in calcutta, confirmed what the girl had said, and added one intriguing fact.
now, it seems that a series of robberies had been perpetrated in his house, and suspicion fell on his native butler.
roylott promptly seized the man, and in a fit of anger beat the poor fellow to death, narrowly escaped a capital sentence, but suffered a long term of imprisonment, and returned to this country a morose and disappointed man.
if you don't mind a word of warning, you want to take care with him, sir.
there are some round these parts say he's not right in the head.
yes, he turned up just after you left, but holmes sent him off with a flea in his ear.
he's so cunning, i never know when i'm safe from him.
there seems little need for repairs to this end of the house.
there are none, i believe it was an excuse to move me from my room.
then when you hear your stepfather retire for the night, you must go to the windows, undo the hasp, open the shutters, and leave your lamp on the window sill as a signal to us.
then withdraw with anything you may want for the night to your old room.
i believe, mr. holmes, that you've already made up your mind.
for pity sake, tell me the cause of my sister's death.
violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.
the idea of a snake occurred to me when i coupled it with the knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india.
it might, or might not bite the occupant of the bed.
she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later, she must fall a victim.
my inspection of the chair in dr. roylott's room had shown that he had been in the habit of standing upon it to reach the ventilator.
last night when i attacked the snake and drove it back through the ventilator,
now, i don't want to be forced to call the police.

it's my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was which frightened her i cannot imagine.
what do you gather from the allusion to a band, a speckled band?
so what prompted you to come here when your life seems set so fair?
yesterday, some repairs were started and my bedroom wall was pierced, so that last night i was forced to move into the chamber in which julia died, to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.
if we were to come to stoke moran today, could we see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?
as it happens, he spoke of coming to town today on some business.
i shall walk down to doctors' commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.
let us meet again at 1:00 under the clock at waterloo station.
i would be obliged if you would slip it into your pocket.
an eley #2 is an excellent argument against gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.
he proved rather hard to locate, but i finally managed to get him through swanson at bards.
he did know roylott in calcutta, confirmed what the girl had said, and added one intriguing fact.
now, it seems that a series of robberies had been perpetrated in his house, and suspicion fell on his native butler.
roylott promptly seized the man, and in a fit of anger beat the poor fellow to death, narrowly escaped a capital sentence, but suffered a long term of imprisonment, and returned to this country a morose and disappointed man.
if you don't mind a word of warning, you want to take care with him, sir.
there are some round these parts say he's not right in the head.
yes, he turned up just after you left, but holmes sent him off with a flea in his ear.
he's so cunning, i never know when i'm safe from him.
there seems little need for repairs to this end of the house.
there are none, i believe it was an excuse to move me from my room.
then when you hear your stepfather retire for the night, you must go to the windows, undo the hasp, open the shutters, and leave your lamp on the window sill as a signal to us.
then withdraw with anything you may want for the night to your old room.
i believe, mr. holmes, that you've already made up your mind.
for pity sake, tell me the cause of my sister's death.
violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.
the idea of a snake occurred to me when i coupled it with the knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from india.
it might, or might not bite the occupant of the bed.
she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later, she must fall a victim.
my inspection of the chair in dr. roylott's room had shown that he had been in the habit of standing upon it to reach the ventilator.
last night when i attacked the snake and drove it back through the ventilator,
now, i don't want to be forced to call the police.
these people are guests of mine, but you are trespassing, mr. thorn.
drive on and wait for me by the gate, will you.
the fellow was trespassing, he had a dunking, and that is all.
no, but i observed the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove.
you started early, but you had a drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.
i shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as to that of your friend.
as to reward my profession is its own reward, but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best.
i was only two at the time of mother's remarriage, and my sister, julia, was five years older.
our mother had a considerable sum of money not less than a thousand a year, and this she bequeathed to dr. roylott entirely while we resided with him.
my stepfather then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in llondon and took us to live in his ancestral house at stoke moran.
but the money your mother left you was enough for all your wants, so that was no obstacle to your happiness?
a terrible change came over my stepfather, instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who at first were overjoyed to see a roylott back in the family seat,
he shut himself up in the house and indulged in ferocious quarrels.
sometimes he goes away with them for days at a time.
you can imagine from what i'm saying that my- poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives.
no servant would stay long so we did all the work of the house.
she was but 30 when i lost her, but already her hair had begun to whiten, even as mine has.
uh, on the floor there was a candle and the charred stump of a match.
which means, something must have woken her up, and she struck a light to see what the matter was.
and your evidence would have shown that the door was fastened on the inner side, the windows blocked by shutters, secured every night.
it is certain, therefore, that your sister was alone when she met her end.
yesterday, some repairs were started and my bedroom wall was pierced so that last night i was forced to move into the chamber in which julia died, to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.
imagine my terror when i was woken by the same low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.
i was too shaken to sleep, i dressed and slipped out of the house.
i got a dog-cart at the crown inn, and came to llondon with one objective, asking your advice.
if we were to come to stoke moran today, could we see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?
as it happens, he spoke of coming to town today on some business.
he did know roylott in calcutta, confirmed what the girl had said and added one intriguing fact.
now, it seems that a series of robberies had been perpetrated in his house.
yes, he turned up just after you left, but holmes sent him off with a flea in his ear.
he's so cunning, i never know when i'm safe from him.
well then, he must guard himself, or he may find someone more cunning than himself upon his track, shall we?
holmes, don't you think we ought to get miss stoner away from here tonight?
then when you hear your stepfather retire for the night, you must go to the windows, undo the hasp, open the shutters,
and leave your lamp on the window sill as a signal to us.
then withdraw with anything you may want for the night to your old room.
i have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.
it might, or might not bite the occupant of the bed.
she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later, she must fall a victim.
my inspection of the chair in dr. roylott's room had shown that he had been in the habit of standing upon it to reach the ventilator.
llast night when i attacked the snake and drove it back through the ventilator,
drive on and wait for me by the gate, will you.
the fellow was trespassing, he had a dunking, and that is all.
mrs. hudson has been roused, she retorted on me, and i on you.
but it's only a quarter past seven, what is it, a fire?
but only a moment, mrs. hudson is a mistress of the art of fire lighting.
ah, this is my intimate friend and associate, dr. watson, before whom you may speak as freely as before myself.
you started early, but you had a drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station.
there is no mystery, my dear lady, the left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places, the marks are fresh.
but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses i may be put to at the time which suits you best.
and now i beg you, lay everything before us which may help us form an opinion upon this matter.
shortly after our return to england, she was killed in a railway accident near crewe.
my stepfather then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in london and took us to live in his ancestral house at stoke moran.
but the money your mother left you was enough for all your wants, so that was no obstacle to your happiness?
a terrible change came over my stepfather, instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbors, who at first were overjoyed to see a roylott back in the family seat, he shut himself up in the house
vagabonds, whom he has given leave to encamp on his land.
sometimes he goes away with them for days at a time.
you can imagine from what i'm saying that my poor sister julia and i had no great pleasure in our lives.
no servant would stay long so we did all the work of the house.
uh, on the floor there was a candle and the charred stump of a match.
which means, something must have woken her up, and she struck a light to see what the matter was.

it is certain, therefore, that your sister was alone when she met her end?

imagine my terror when i was woken by the same low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.
there are a thousand details i desire to know before i decide on a course of action.
if we were to come to stoke moran today, could we see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?
find your friend cooms and see what you can get from him.
i shall walk down to doctors' commons, where i hope to get some data which may help us in this matter.
he did know roylott in calcutta, confirmed what the girl had said, and added one intriguing fact.
now, it seems that a series of robberies had been perpetrated in his house, and suspicion fell on his native butler.
dr. roylott has gone to london and he won't be back before the evening.
but we have already had the pleasure of dr. roylott's acquaintance.
he's so cunning, i never know when i'm safe from him.
well then, he must guard himself, or he may find someone more cunning than himself upon his track, shall we.
miss stoner, may i ask something, that's unusual, isn't it, bedrooms on the ground floor?
the bedrooms were moved downstairs when so much of the house fell into decay.
now, miss stoner, when your stepfather returns, you must confine yourself in your room on pretense of a headache.
then when you hear your stepfather retire for the night, you must go to the windows, undo the hasp, open the shutters, and leave your lamp on the window sill as a signal to us.
then withdraw with anything you may want for the night to your old room.
i have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.
if dr. roylott should return and find us here, our journey would be in vain.
i believe, mr. holmes, that you've already made up your mind.
the doctor had trained the snake, probably with the milk, to return at the sound of a whistle, the very whistle which you and your late sister heard.
my inspection of the chair in dr. roylott's room had shown that he had been in the habit of standing upon it to reach the ventilator.
last night when i attacked the snake and drove it back through the ventilator,
i roused its snakish temper, causing it to turn upon the next person that it saw.
this case is beginning to sound more and more like bad day at black rock.
the two big-time detectives can't admit... they've been outsmarted by a bunch of hicks.
people up here might get the wrong idea... think you're prying into their personal affairs.
what winslow is saying is that we de nada-ites treasure our privacy.
we like our way of life, and we don't want it disturbed.
we don't mean to be a nuisance, mayor, but perhaps you saw the man we're looking for.
mr. steele may be the boss, but i'm in charge, mildred.
do we have to go through this every wee- [ sneezes ]
arthur thickett sent his sister a letter from de nada four days ago.
it just arrived this morning, and she brought it right over. [ gasps ]
- are you suggesting rachel slipped... hit her head on the rock, and then crawled into the bushes to die?
until i hear a better explanation, that's exactly what i'm suggesting.
all i can figure out... is that telephone call we made to mildred.
- if someone were listening in, they'd know who we are.
well, miss krebs, in the eyes of the law... that's no excuse for the serious nature of your offense.
you recklessly endangered the citizens of de nada, who i'm sworn to protect.
i'd sure hate to see a fancy set of wheels like that get stolen, wouldn't you?
it's quiet around here, you understand, but you never can tell.
well, it's hard to part with a fortune in cash... particularly when no one has the slightest idea you've got it.
let's suppose they put the money in the jail, just for safekeeping at first.
eventually they realized that no one outside de nada ever need know about the accident.
so they waited seven years for the statute of limitations to expire.
looks like you're getting ready to have quite a party here.
we're sorry for any inconveniences we may have caused you... but i'm sure we can make an amicable settlement.
someone who wanted a piece of six million dollars... which could be anyone in this room.
they're just trying to confuse us to make us give up the money.
you know, the heavy rains we had here last week have just-
well, they've played havoc with our phone lines, uh, miss, uh-
everyone we've met has tried to steer us out of de nada.
this whole town is covering up something they're willing to kill to keep it a secret.
well, i think we're better off pondering that one... in the relative security of our own office, don't you?
as soon as we pick up the car, we're on the road to l.a.
let's suppose they put the money in the jail, just for safekeeping at first.
eventually they realized that no one outside de nada ever need know about the accident.
so they waited seven years for the statute of limitations to expire.
that money was easily traceable, but seven years after the crime, there can be no prosecution.
despite last night's excitement, which i can't say i approve of, we've made it.
for seven years we've held together, resisting temptation... and in 1 0 minutes, we'll have our rightful reward.
they're just trying to confuse us to make us give up the money.
the two big-time detectives... can't admit they've been outsmarted by a bunch of hicks. [ laughs ]
never would have guessed those two would get along so well.
speaking of the unexpected... it just so happens that i have two tickets to the ballet tonight.
it wasn't the first time i'd been up all night... but it was one of the most rewarding.
forget the pain in the weary eyes... the cries for rest from the tired body... the screams of the totally drained mind... struggling to deal with one more clue.
you know, we don't even know which rooms we're supposed to be in.
there's been a slight mix-up... but i'm gonna take care of that right now.
the athertons arrived at the gate about two hours ago and then the others.
but robin said not to bother him with it... that you and higgins would take care of everything.
he's had a big block on this new novel for weeks.
then this morning on the plane it all came together for him.
but at the moment, the only thing on his mind... is meeting his deadline.
i will tell him about the accident the minute he buzzes me.
fine, except for the fact that you've left me in a most... delicate and difficult situation.
why in heaven's name didn't you notify me when the guests arrived early?
you made me look stupid in front of the inez stuart.
just forget the dancer, will you... and help me find that old lady warrington-stout broad.
i thought you should know that i'm not a regular guest.
i'm a chief security officer assigned to protect your many valuables.
i'm not in the habit of having to search for my dresser.
your incompetence may very well have made me late for my matinee.
don't you think a check would have been simpler for your donation this weekend?
oh, well, you see, scott and zelda liked dealing in cash, so we thought-
perhaps you could also tell me why i wasn't allowed to examine the body.
i think you should take that up with lieutenant tanaka when he comes back.
but somewhere in all that madness, he was still higgins... with higgins' conscience.
a conscience that i was convinced would stop him... short of doing any harm to a defenseless girl.
okay, not at first, but after i got to know you, i started feeling like a creep.
i decided that as soon as i got out of here with my scoop...
i was gonna call you up and i was gonna tell you the whole truth.
you really expect me to believe you went to all that trouble just to get a job?
robin masters' annual great gatsby gala... with all the gossip and intrigue that goes along with it.
it may sound dumb to you, but the national intruder said... that if i got any gory details, they'd give me a staff job.
oh, those are just some invitations i collected from the guests.
i didn't know what to do with them, so i put them-
well, i suppose... you're wondering why i asked you all here?
everyone here in this room knows... that a murder was committed here this weekend.
you're not going to bring up that ridiculous nonsense... about the slander suit, are you?
higgins writes that robin made some... unfortunate public comments about the quality of your writing... and about the state of your marriage to marge.
i was resting before confronting him... when i realized someone was in my room.
i opened my eyes slightly and i saw someone in a chaplin outfit slipping out.
valerie decided to save her big scoop for that novel she always wanted to write.
the other guests all went home, and higgins... went back to being higgins... for good.
for some reason, the other boys at the school never seemed to like me very much.
but that night, for the first time, perhaps the only time...
(magnum) it wasn't the first time i'd been up all night... but it was one of the most rewarding.
forget the pain in the weary eyes... the cries for rest from the tired body... the screams of the totally drained mind... struggling to deal with one more clue.
you know, we don't even know which rooms we're supposed to be in.
there's been a slight mix-up... but i'm gonna take care of that right now.
then this morning on the plane it all came together for him.
but at the moment, the only thing on his mind... is meeting his deadline.
even a resident of these backward islands... must know this profile.
i am sir fearing pangborn... the world's greatest tragedian... on continuous tour.
why in heaven's name didn't you notify me when the guests arrived early?
well, why in heaven's name didn't you tell me... they were arriving early in the first place?
you made me look stupid in front of the inez stuart.
just forget the dancer, will you... and help me find that old lady warrington-stout broad.
(noian) well, it seems like a very straightforward... uncomplicated question to me.
(cynthia) yes, and i shall be just as uncomplicated in answering.
i thought you should know that i'm not a regular guest.
i'm a chief security officer assigned to protect your many valuables.
look, if you really are her security man, why aren't you doing your job?
she was never out of my sight until she went into her room.
(magnum) i had to accept the fact that fearing pangborn... could have gotten carried away.
but somewhere in all that madness, he was still higgins... with higgins' conscience.
[mimicking man on tv] are you so shocked that he has enemies?
[mimicking woman] frankiy, i never thought of such a man... having friend or a foe.
(woman on tv) please go on, you think that someone has actually... planned the colonel's downfall?
(man on tv) i think that deep wounds heal very slowly.
look, i know you're not going to believe me, but i was going to tell you the truth.
okay, not at first, but after i got to know you, i started feeling like a creep.
i decided that as soon as i got out of here with my scoop...
i was gonna call you up and i was gonna tell you the whole truth.
it may sound dumb to you, but the national intruder said... that if i got any gory details, they'd give me a staff job.
what else have you done that you haven't told me about?
(magnum) i figured i still had about a half an hour... before tanaka returned with a warrant for higgins' arrest.
i couid only hope that, that would be enough time... to find the clue to the "old wound that was healing slowly. "
did you know that 1 1 ... of the people here this weekend have been here before?
well, thomas, that's real interesting, except that this... isn't exactly the best time to be gathering trivia.
did you ever hear about the case of the red faced thespian?
(magnum) well, i suppose... you're wondering why i asked you all here?
i can't believe you're treating lady cynthia's death in this ridiculous fashion.
lieutenant, i want to make a statement of the events... that have transpired over these last few hours.
but i talked to robin on the phone about an hour ago and he... filled me in on your general appearance... and of your contempt for him and higgins.
he said he lost track of you about six years ago... around the same time you went to work for lady cynthia as archer hayes.
i was resting before confronting him... when i realized someone was in my room.
i opened my eyes slightly and i saw someone in a chaplin outfit slipping out.
valerie decided to save her big scoop for that novel she always wanted to write.
the other guests all went home, and higgins... went back to being higgins... for good.
until they come to mass, their children be baptized ... and married and buried as christians, it is me to the second.
let the rest of you will notice that the old gods are not entirely dead.
by george de raw and if his blood is too hot ... then i called laurel.
battle after battle, i urge you all to see who will fall to the ground.
toby is a tram engine with cowcatchers and side plates, quite unlike a steam engine.
he takes trucks from farms to the main line and is always cheerful.
then, the sector you were digging in has suddenly been sealed off.
one plus two equals three, and three means its a secret.
when was it carried out for the first time, and what was the result?
it was carried out for the first time on a sea-urchin 130 years ago.
during the war, he invented an agent which paralyzed male genes.
but the m-bomb destroyed the males genes instead of paralyzing them.
it wouldn't be the first time were sacrificing ourselves for mankind.
payment could come after completion of the entire cycle, maybe even with the payment for the extra hibernation.
i feel great, and i'm happy to be a resident at the senior citizens home.
i want to live out the rest of my days in warmth and peace.
and there's finally an occasion for everything to return to normal.
if i were younger, i would do everything in my power to save them!
i hereby declare that i was born male against my will.
i ask that my male conduct be extinguished and rendered void.
we are gathered here today, sisters, to decide the fate of two members of the 2nd gender, who escaped extinction and are now among us.
we will present our position last, since we have the most data on this.
all the evil in the world is your fault, from religious wars, to cervical cancer!
the only things were not responsible for are hail, earthquakes, and whooping cough!
you've use test-tubes for 50 years and you don't know what you've lost in the process!
in our world, you were on a pedestal, wooed, loved, showered with flowers.
if that's all they have to say, then please take them outside.
they can wait out there for the result of the vote.
your fresh, healthy, and strong organs can give them a new lease on life.
call dr. ossa, and tell her shell have that new kidney today.
a childhood which i never had, since you chose hibernation over mom and i!
but now there are no more fathers, and well make sure there never will be!
a special pill turned their sex drive into a career drive.
and you accepted your privileges, instead of returning this world to normal with the help of some woman?
in three years, they will wake up... as the living, let's hope, evidence of the victory... of human thought over the powers of nature.
what was it that convinced you to take part... in such a thrilling enterprise ?
dr berna is at her majesty's, who wishes to see the males.
i came to keep your company on the way to her.
excuse me, you are someone important here, am i right ?
well, me and my friend have a few questions to you.
during the war, he invented a substance which... temporarily paralized masculine genes.
but something went wrong and the m-bomb... instead of paralizing, liqudated masculine genes.
you can have the whole jar if you tell me something.
can i taste it to check if it isn't insipid ?
therefore, i ask to forget all my deeds done as a male, because i was acting under the influence of... the former, misleading, chauvinistic civilisation.
i also consider it a fact that... men never existed, there are no men, and we don't need them.
we're living in a righteous, stable world, without famine, wars, venereal diseases, and other inventions of men.
do you have anything to say to stand up for yourself ?
this coincidence, in our persons, gives you a rare opportunity of coming back to the natural order.
you've been working on those test tubes for half a century... not even knowing what you have missed.
you were good muses of poets, symbol of higher ideas, beauty.
by destroying the world's manly half, you have destroyed a half of yourselves !
probably that is men's house service, quite popular in the 20th century.
if that is all they had to say, take them out sisters.
in our world, proteins are more and more difficult to get.
maybe the cremation of those who passed away is a prodigality..
' i'd like to say that both males were buried out and dehibernated. '
' however, there is no danger since this morning in the archeo's clinics... ' ' both of them had been naturalised, to help those creatures... '
then i started a career in the league, and then, ten years ago they chose me for their majesty.
only then could i feel relieved and... organise an apartament in my mother's house.
all outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security.
i repeat, all outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security.
magically open in 3 years and let our heroes safely out.
i also want to remind that in 3 days we shall have a congress world female league.
it's not the first time we devote ourselves to the service for the mankind.
of course.. and the payment can be done later, at the end, together with the balance for the hibernation.
this is our holy apple tree, planted by the very hands of our foremother.
from such a tree a male has picked up an apple and seduced a woman with it, and therefore we lost the paradise once and forever.
but, but really we couldn't figure out that these apples had such an importance for you.
we had no idea that it was connected to the legend, and besides, these apples were absolutely tart.
i feel excellent and i am happy to be a pensioner in the honored anility shelter.
i would be happy to live in warmth and tranquility till the lucid end of my days..
you understand why our great-grandmothers couldn't sustain it any longer and founded the league!
"the league defends you, the league gives you an advice, the league never betrays you!"
in view of the mentioned above fact, i plead to disregard all the actions, performed by me while being a man, because i acted under influence of conditions, created by the male civilization.
i absolutely agree with the concept that there were no men, they do not exist and there is no need in them."
here we have convened sisters, so we could decide the future fate of two persons of another sex, who, instead of extinction due to the logical laws of evolution, have appeared among us by the strange caprice of the fate.
i would like to present here the position of the "archeo" service because, so to say, we have in our office the comprehensive data on their subject.
our great-grandmothers have already shown us the objective and the way to it, and we are walking this way steadily and happily.
never again we allow to happen the situation, where woman would be a waitress at the feast of live, ruled by male.
from the part of the "archeo" service i propose the naturalization of both males.
my duty of the "genetix" representative is to warn you, dear sisters, about the results of humanitarian caprice of our dear "doctor" berna.
by no means we have to introduce them in our society.
both these subjects have to be eliminated as soon as possible, and before that they have to be handed over to the "genetix" services in order to perform on them certain important biomedical experiments.
and from your remains we'll try to synthesize highly nutritious substance.
protein in our conditions is more and more difficult to obtain.
however, the danger was prevented, since early this morning in "archeo" special cliinc the naturalization procedure has been performed.
this will help them to find and realize themselves in our society.
well, in the present situation that we have here, being the representatives of different sexes, yes, well..
as a humanist, i would like to propose to return, maybe, to more traditional method of contact between two persons of different sex...
then i started to work actively for the league, and 10 years ago they elected me as her excellency.
then i could relax at last and moved to the house of my mommy.
it is more than certain, that it'll be written in history of mankind in golden letters.
and now, may i present a person, who has invented for us immortality
let's hope, they will awake alive in 3 years and it'll be a proof of the victory of the humankind over the nature.
so what made you, gentlemen, to take this, literally, blood-freezing decision?
i wanted from this place from our part, to send our greetings to all hibernation fans in the world.
and can i ask you a last question - are you afraid?
the experiment has been successful, coco is with us in the studio
however, to be completely frank, i would like to say, that certain risk exists.
magically open in 3 years and let our heroes safely out.
i also want to remind that in 3 days we shall have a congress world female league.
at the time of the war he invented a warfare, which was supposed to paralyze male genes temporarily.
however, something was overlooked or missed, and the m-bomb instead of paralyzing, eliminated the male genes.
but, but really we couldn't figure out that these apples had such an importance for you.
we had no idea that it was connected to the legend, and besides, these apples were absolutely tart.
i feel excellent and i am happy to be a pensioner in the honored anility shelter.
i would be happy to live in warmth and tranquility till the lucid end of my days...
you understand why our great-grandmothers couldn't sustain it any longer and founded the league!

never again we allow to happen the situation, where woman would be a waitress at the feast of live, ruled by male.
a happy occasion as our emersion gives you a unique chance to return things to their natural order.
you are tormenting yourselves with those test-tubes for half a century already, without even knowing what you have deprived yourselves from.
you were the inspiration for poets, symbol of the highest ideas and beauty.
by eliminating the male half of the world you destroyed half of yourselves!
my duty of the "genetix" representative is to warn you, dear sisters, about the results of humanitarian caprice of our dear "doctor" berna.
by no means we have to introduce them in our society.
i had that feeling, damn it, i had it from the beginning!
and isn't it possible to go outside at least for a little?
and from your remains we'll try to synthesize highly nutritious substance.
protein in our conditions is more and more difficult to obtain.
"i wish to confirm hereby that indeed, both males have been dehibernated.
however, the danger was prevented, since early this morning in "archeo" special clinic the naturalization procedure has been performed.
so that was the way i grew up, in girl's disguise.
then i started to work actively for the league, and 10 years ago they elected me as her excellency.
later, when they started to live under the ground, there was no sense to dissuade them.
and it's easier to rule when they are under the ground.
'i, a modest biologist, have the opportunity... to be useful for the whole mankind.
i know, it may sound like cliche, but i really think like that.
i was just passing by... and decided to come in to see you.
but you must be busy with interesting work... if you have stayed for the night.
i declare that i was born as a man, which was against my will.
therefore, i ask to forget all my deeds done as a male, because i was acting under the influence of... the former, misleading, chauvinistic civilisation.
we met here today, sisters, to decide... about the future of those two persons - of the second kind, who, instead of becoming extinct in the course of evolution, in strange circumscances appeared here among us.
i'd like to present the point of view of archeo... as the last, because we have the most info on the case.
already in the past, our grandmothers pointed... the direction of the path we're happily walking on.
we will not let the situation to come back, in which... a woman is a waitress on the life-party of men.
on behalf of archeo, i apply for naturalisation of the males.
as the head of genetics, i feel obliged to... warn you, dear sisters, against the outcomes of that... humanitarian whim of dr berna.
there must be some safe way of getting out of here !
you have to go out sometimes, to fix this equipement at least !
some of our sisters, on high posts, are a bit old and tired.
your fresh, healthy and strong organs will bring them the second youth.
and the remains, we will try to make into a nutritious substance.
in our world, proteins are more and more difficult to get.
maybe the cremation of those who passed away is a prodigality..
the experiment we're going to make thanks to you... will be crucial for our food programme.
it was with me that you had the happiest times of your childhood..
the childhood i've never had, because you chose to get hibernated... instead staying with me and mommy.
' i might have been a threat for other people. '
' i feel good as well and i'd like to express my gratitude to... ' ' the team of surgeons for... '
only then could i feel relieved and... organise an apartament in my mother's house.
there are tousands of women underground, who are being lied to !
i know these are big words, but that's what i believe.
thanks to hibernation, people who are incurably sick, will be able to live in times in which they can be cured.
so lets go to this den of knowledge which, just as in arabian nights, will swallow our heroes, and in three years, at the sound of open sesame, will disgorge them, hopefully safe and sound.
i would also like to remind you, that in three days, we will meet at the world women's league.
you should both be happy that you're alive and that you were unfrozen.
and what would have been the point of leaving us frozen?
then, the sector you were digging in has suddenly been sealed off.
one plus two equals three, and three means its a secret.
artificial parthenogenesis is a form of virgin birth involving mechanical impregnation by another female cell.
when was it carried out for the first time, and what was the result?
i feel great, and i'm happy to be a resident at the senior citizens home.
i want to live out the rest of my days in warmth and peace.
and there's finally an occasion for everything to return to normal.
if i were younger, i would do everything in my power to save them!
i hereby declare that i was born male against my will.
i ask that my male conduct be extinguished and rendered void.
all the evil in the world is your fault, from religious wars, to cervical cancer!
the only things were not responsible for are hail, earthquakes, and whooping cough!
you've been using test-tubes for half a century, and you don't even know what you've lost in the process!
in our world, you were on a pedestal, wooed, loved, showered with flowers.
if that's all they have to say, then please take them outside.
they can wait out there for the result of the vote.
your fresh, healthy, and strong organs can give them a new lease on life.
call dr. ossa, and tell her shell have that new kidney today.
a childhood which i never had, since you chose hibernation over mom and i!
but now there are no more fathers, and well make sure there never will be!
it is more than certain, that it'll be written in history of mankind in golden letters.
and now, may i present a person, who has invented for us immortality
let's hope, they will awake alive in 3 years and it'll be a proof of the victory of the humankind over the nature.
so what made you, gentlemen, to take this, literally, blood-freezing decision?
i wanted from this place from our part, to send our greetings to all hibernation fans in the world.
and can i ask you a last question - are you afraid?
the experiment has been successful, coco is with us in the studio
however, to be completely frank, i would like to say, that certain risk exists.
magically open in 3 years and let our heroes safely out.
i also want to remind that in 3 days we shall have a congress world female league.
it's not the first time we devote ourselves to the service for the mankind.
of course.. and the payment can be done later, at the end, together with the balance for the hibernation.
this is our holy apple tree, planted by the very hands of our foremother.
from such a tree a male has picked up an apple and seduced a woman with it, and therefore we lost the paradise once and forever.
but, but really we couldn't figure out that these apples had such an importance for you.
we had no idea that it was connected to the legend, and besides, these apples were absolutely tart.
i feel excellent and i am happy to be a pensioner in the honored anility shelter.
i would be happy to live in warmth and tranquility till the lucid end of my days..
you understand why our great-grandmothers couldn't sustain it any longer and founded the league!
"the league defends you, the league gives you an advice, the league never betrays you!"
in view of the mentioned above fact, i plead to disregard all the actions, performed by me while being a man, because i acted under influence of conditions, created by the male civilization.
i absolutely agree with the concept that there were no men, they do not exist and there is no need in them."
here we have convened sisters, so we could decide the future fate of two persons of another sex, who, instead of extinction due to the logical laws of evolution, have appeared among us by the strange caprice of the fate.
i would like to present here the position of the "archeo" service because, so to say, we have in our office the comprehensive data on their subject.
our great-grandmothers have already shown us the objective and the way to it, and we are walking this way steadily and happily.
never again we allow to happen the situation, where woman would be a waitress at the feast of live, ruled by male.
a happy occasion as our emersion gives you a unique chance to returnt things to their natural order.
you are tormenting yourselves with those test-tubes for half a century already, without even knowing what you have deprived yourselves from.
you were the inspiration for poets, symbol of the highest ideas and beauty.
by eliminating the male half of the world you destroyed half of yourselves!
my duty of the "genetix" representative is to warn you, dear sisters, about the results of humanitarian caprice of our dear "doctor" berna.
by no means we have to introduce them in our society.
i had that feeling, damn it, i had it from the beginning!

however, the danger was prevented, since early this morning in "archeo" special cliinc the naturalization procedure has been performed.
then i started to work actively for the league, and 10 years ago they elected me as her excellency.
then i could relax at last and moved to the house of my mommy.
you should remember this day as it will surely be a historical date for mankind
i present you the man who discovered immortality, nobel-prize winner, prof. doctor victor koppelweiser
- what has pushed you into making this blood freezing decision?
- shortly, if you allow me, responsibility me, modest biologist, have the chance to be usefull to the mankind
i know these are big words but this is what i think please realise, that thanks to hybernation, many people with incurable illnesses
will be able to travel in time in which there will already be cure for their illness
- our son is an important person now just like gagarin or someone else
- well, i always loved risk, something unknown so called 'rough live'
let's go than to the wisdom cave, that, like in the fairly tale will take our hearoes in, so in three years
when we say 'sessamy open' they go out, let's hope, all alive
i remind you also that in three days we meet on the world women's ligue meeting
'the ligue saves you, advises you and will never betray you' thank you, good night
- we cannot smoke in here, there is no ashtrays - we could not notice.. plus noone can see us. come on!
- but just to accompany you i do not smoke normally it makes me sick, now after this food..
- good evening, i don't think i am interrupting.. am i?
it is a totally private visit, i was passing by and came to see you
but you surely have a lot of interesting work to do, if you stayed for the night
- you can read everything in the directories, sister - of course..
the sector that you have been searching has suddenly been closed - two ane and two is three, and three means secret, i am just linking facts...
- excuse me, couldn't you link them somewhere else i would like to take a bath and go to sleep
- no, this bigger one is calm, the little one has bad influence on him
- remember that the risk of contamination has not been totally overcome
- such small woman and can throw a man like that!
- my name is emma dax, we will be working together
- these two play a major role in genetix programme that has government support
- i am personally responsible for genetic safety of this sector, thus i will give orders here
if we could manage to lower the body temperature by just 2 degrees
we would live two times longer but here are our breave girls with the males let's go see them, i am very curious
this is our holy apple tree planted by the grand mother
from exact same tree, the male had picked an apple and seduced a woman with it
we didn't know they had a history and by the way they were totally sauer
- i am afraid dear berna, that your discivery is a new pandora box!
- actually i start enjoying that tomorrow we will escape you as well!
- even though you have broken the rules and offended her majesty
this is why, i ask that all my actions from the past, as a male
have been forgotten, as i was acting under pressure of the past male civilization
we can talk after you have let us out of here
- actually, we could have signed it every lawyer would have gotten us out of it
which against the logic of evolution stayed alive and came between us
i would like to leave archeo's position until the end if the session
- accident, gives you in us a chance to come back to the normal live
- you are struggling with the probes for half century not even knowing what you are missing out!
- as archeo representative i apply for naturalisation of both males
- my duty, as genetix manager, is to worn you about the consequesnces of dear dr berna decision
- this is why our ancestors had to come down to mines
than they have rebuild the station into a town and now it looks like that
- you have to be getting out to repair the appliances!
- there are special uniforms but there in oxygen for only 1 hour!
for you preferred to get hybernated to staying with me and mum
now there is no fathers, and we'll make sure there never are, understand?
- .. what was impossible before because as an organism from a lower level i could be dengerous
- i'm also feeling great and would like to thank the medical sector for such quick...
- ligue thought of everything a special pill moved it to career needs
- so you were there relaxing in stead of by using one chick come back to the normal way of living?
i happened to be passing by and decided to visit you.
you must have a lot of interesting work if you're here so late at night?
artificial parthenogenesis is a form of virgin birth involving mechanical impregnation by another female cell.
when was it carried out for the first time, and what was the result?
i feel great, and lm happy to be a resident at the senior citizens home.
i want to live out the rest of my days in warmth and peace.
and theres finally an occasion for everything to return to normal.
if i were younger, i would do everything in my power to save them!

call dr. ossa, and tell her shell have that new kidney today.
a childhood which i never had, since you chose hibernation over mom and i!
but now there are no more fathers, and well make sure there never will be!
all outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security.
i repeat, all outside personnel is requested to leave the first zone of security.
i wanted from this place from our part, to send our greetings to all hibernation fans in the world.
and can i ask you a last question - are you afraid?
the experiment has been successful, coco is with us in the studio
however, to be completely frank, i would like to say, that certain risk exists.
magically open in 3 years and let our heroes safely out.
i also want to remind that in 3 days we shall have a congress world female league.
at the time of the war he invented a warfare, which was supposed to paralyze male genes temporarily.
however, something was overlooked or missed, and the m-bomb instead of paralyzing, eliminated the male genes.
but, but really we couldn't figure out that these apples had such an importance for you.
we had no idea that it was connected to the legend, and besides, these apples were absolutely tart.
i feel excellent and i am happy to be a pensioner in the honored anility shelter.
i would be happy to live in warmth and tranquility till the lucid end of my days...
you understand why our great-grandmothers couldn't sustain it any longer and founded the league!
"the league defends you, the league gives you an advice, the league never betrays you!"
from the part of the "archeo" service i propose the naturalization of both males.
my duty of the "genetix" representative is to warn you, dear sisters, about the results of humanitarian caprice of our dear "doctor" berna.
by no means we have to introduce them in our society.
both these subjects have to be eliminated as soon as possible, and before that they have to be handed over to the "genetix" services in order to perform on them certain important biomedical experiments.
"i wish to confirm hereby that indeed, both males have been dehibernated.
however, the danger was prevented, since early this morning in "archeo" special clinic the naturalization procedure has been performed.
so that was the way i grew up, in girl's disguise.
then i started to work actively for the league, and 10 years ago they elected me as her excellency.
later, when they started to live under the ground, there was no sense to dissuade them.
and it's easier to rule when they are under the ground.
i urge you to remember this day, as it will, no doubt, go down in the history of the human race.
and here is the man who invented immortality, the nobel laureate, professor dr. victor kuppelweiser.
i happened to be passing by and decided to visit you.
you must have a lot of interesting work if you're here so late at night?
when was it carried out for the first time, and what was the result?
it was carried out for the first time on a sea-urchin 130 years ago.
these two are to play a crucial role in one of the genetix programs.
i'm responsible for the genetic security of this sector, so you'll follow my orders.
during the war, he invented an agent which paralyzed male genes.
but due to an oversight, the m-bomb destroyed the males genes instead of paralyzing them.
it wouldn't be the first time were sacrificing ourselves for mankind.
payment could come after completion of the entire cycle, maybe even with the payment for the extra hibernation.
i don't know if your generation has any woman left in them.
its not worth being a woman when there are no men around.
we are gathered here today, sisters, to decide the fate of two members of the 2nd gender, who by accident, escaped extinction and are now among us.
we will present our position last, since we have the most data on this.
with us, you finally have the chance to bring everything back to normal.
you've been using test-tubes for half a century, and you don't even know what you've lost in the process!
in our world, you were on a pedestal, wooed, loved, showered with flowers.
you were inspiration for poets, a symbol of higher ideals, of beauty.
i'm happy that this operation has enabled me to rise to a higher level of evolution.
i, too, feel great and wish to thank the operating team for helping me...
a special pill turned their sex drive into a career drive.
and you just accepted your privileges, instead of trying to return this world to normal with the help of some woman?
all i was saying is that you're grieving deeply over fallon.
it might help if you talk about it instead of keeping it inside.
if you don't let me attend to the essentials without any interference from you,
i'm getting on the next plane back to the states and blake carrington and his problems be damned.
it was so nice chatting with you on that street corner the other day.
you know, i don't get much of a chance these days to help young ladies carry their packages after they've been shopping.
it's like looking in a mirror, and all at once not seeing your face but somebody else's.
amanda, how would you like me to help you find him?
you never wanted to see me with anyone else but fallon.
well, fallon is dead, and it's time that i start to make a new life for myself.
what it translates to is people who care about each other, who, in spite of everything, love each other.
now, i don't think that's gonna happen to you if you keep on being self-destructive, if you keep on acting the playboy.
it gives us an opportunity to all know each other better.
when i looked at my birth certificate, i couldn't believe my eyes.
both stubborn, both lethal at the attack and the counterattack, and then making up and declaring an armistice over the ice cream.
well, i think we'd better get on with the next order of business, that very good vichyssoise.
you're going to have to ask your father about that one, adam.
if you want my help, i want to know all about this plot.
last year implicated in the collapse of denver-carrington, was killed today while attempting to flee his villa in istanbul.
police who arrived on the scene found a cache of heroin hidden in the villa.
more united, if that were possible, and certainly no less determined than when, some 25 years ago we pledged ourselves to fight in a good cause.
for such a cause we are fighting with one heart and mind today.
cos when we go to judgment, the ones who've never repented, the ones who've done evil in their lives,
wake up in hell and the devils tie them down and brand their bodies with hot irons for a thousand years and then another thousand and another.
to look at, not in the height of fashion, perhaps, but men of reason, practical, bloodthirstily intellectual.
and underneath this plausible disguise, dreamers riven with guilt, fleeing from what?
why so eager to eradicate the past, to want to make this girl a wandering jewess?
oh, yes, you can make her forget... but what is more important?
offerings to the city gods, to conquer or submit to them.
i was expected to be their leader, an example to them,
you come back with a hatful of spells for your lady patients.
still, what you get up to with them is your business.
"for 11 years, i'd not seen joe nor biddy with my bodily eyes,
"though they had both been often before my fancy in the east.
"when upon an evening in december, an hour or two after dark,
"i laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door.
"there, smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight,
"as hale and as strong as ever, though a little gray, sat joe.
in order to understand, in order to rid yourself of the confused emotions which haunt your adult life,
you must go further back, back to a time when your very presence threatened to destroy your parents' love and when your demands made a lover of one and an enemy of the other.
this inexorable family drama returns, disguised in adulthood, a landscape, peopled for the grown-up boy by figures of threatening authority and reincarnations of motherhood,
as it is for the grown-up girl by jealous, maternal counterparts and likenesses of her father.
- ah, the patient is free when he knows he cannot change.
you think i should lie to them to win their trust?
your ideas i find merely pitiful but your hypocrisy disgusts me.
it seems to me your father has much to answer for... and that this destiny you fear so much has found us out.
you'll come back with your mind full of cathedrals and railway stations, totally confused.
the railway stations are the ones where you have time to admire the architecture.
every encounter between father and child, husband and wife, however clumsy and brutal, it's always an adventure... of self-revelation or self-deception.
an analysis is no more than a conversation, an honest one, between enlightened friends.
as verna jarrett, she firmly established herself in the annals of film noir.
it is my great honor now to present this plaque of appreciation... to a radiant star, miss virginia mayo.
a few weeks ago, i got a letter from someone saying... he was soon gonna put my name in the headlines in a most unusual way.
since then, i've gotten a letter from him every few days... saying the deadline is approaching or something like that.
now, i know your cinematic references are just meant for inspiration... but miss mayo doesn't.
now she thinks she's being stalked by a creepy little man...
is that when you got hurt, miss holt... protecting virginia mayo?
no, mildred, the night was uneventful... though miss mayo and i had a wonderful time talking about the golden age of hollywood.
lloyd nolan had greatly admired my little talk the evening before... so we had no trouble getting on.
- i put out some lines after you called me, steele.
i went to a revival house where they were showing somewhere in the night... but they- they lost the last reel.
now, john hodiak realizes that... he's not george taylor anymore, but really larry cravat.
at the time, mildred, i was engaged... in an utterly charming conversation with dorothy lamour.
i had come, of course, to discuss her fan letters... but we quickly moved on to other subjects.
we're talking about murder, laura, and this man's talking about mayonnaise.
mr. mulch, i don't think you realize the gravity of the situation.
i can account for my whereabouts every day for the last two years.
well, mr. steele, if george edward mulch... isn't behind the attempted murder, then who is?
i mean the fault isn't in ourselves, but in our stars.
i mean, all we have to do is just find the proper clue.
yes, but before i tumbled into your life, you managed to put quite a few people away... who weren't aware that remington steele didn't even exist.
they didn't know you created this shadow man to drum up business.
it could be that... when you saw yvette harwood, she was already dead, and not from a heart attack.
well, if that's the truth, then the man i saw will get rid of me.
but how did you two find out who the creep was?
well, mildred... the room was ablaze with ideas, but we didn't have a chance to act upon them.
calls himself a producer... but he's really just a fast-talking con man.
most ofhis projects never make it to the screen... but he always manages to walk away with a fistful of dough.
the pills kept yvette's mind foggy, making it easier... for templeton to influence her to write him checks.
no doubt templeton had an insurance policy on her as well.
where he could easily kill her, and then certify that she died of a heart attack.
chandler and templeton split the insurance money, walk away, and no one's any wiser.
it would have worked, too, if i hadn't gone looking for virginia mayo.
i never thought i'd be grateful for your infatuation with hollywood.
and so we come to the triumph of white heat... in which miss mayo further displayed... her versatility oppositejames cagney.
as verna jarrett, she firmly established herself in the annals of film noir.
uh, miss mayo, i'm sorry to disturb you, but you forgot your plaque.
do i have to hear your speech all over again to get it back?
- well, there has been something strange... come to think of it.
a few weeks ago, i got a letter from someone saying... he was soon gonna put my name in the headlines in a most unusual way.
nevertheless, perhaps we should take you home and have a look at those letters.
oh, in that movie you mentioned, mr. steele... uh, they stop the killer, don't they?
as a rule, we try to avoid scaring our clients to death.
now, i know your cinematic references are just meant for inspiration... but miss mayo doesn't.
i was chatting with lloyd nolan this evening... and he mentioned some strange fan letters he'd been getting lately.
at the time, i didn't give it a second thought, but maybe there's a connection.
no, mildred, the night was uneventful... though miss mayo and i had a wonderful time talking about the golden age of hollywood.
i, on the other hand, didn't have time for such trivia.
no wonder bing and bob thought you were the perfect comedic counterpart.
but, you know, i think the critics... overlooked your importance as a dramatic actress.
i'm concerned about what happens... when we confront our murderous mr. mulch.
so am i. that's why i decided to stop by the office before i came to get you.
a whole new national line of products... based on hollywood stars.
for example, you wanna make a sandwich... you reach for that bright, shiny bottle of...
you see, the stationery tells 'em that this is a class act.
the mysteriousness lets them know... that they're dealing with a master of hype.
well, mr. steele, if george edward mulch... isn't behind the attempted murder, then who is?
presumably that is why we're paying you, mr. steele, to find out.
and we're very touched, mr. steele... but just how do you plan to stop this psycho?
well, we've eliminated the- the fan letters as a clue... so, uh, we have to come up with another common denominator linking the three of you.
they didn't know you created this shadow man to drum up business.
now that i've slipped into mr. steele's shoes, there's any number of... ill-tempered people out there who'd like to perforate me for your previous efforts!
at first i thought she was relaxed... but her head and her arm were limp.
right after i saw them, the first attempt happened on my life.
most ofhis projects never make it to the screen... but he always manages to walk away with a fistful of dough.
he had the gall to ask me to do a picture for him a while back.
you know, i'll bet anything that once these are analyzed... they'll be found to contain drugs that deepen depression, not cure it.
the pills kept yvette's mind foggy, making it easier... for templeton to influence her to write him checks.
no doubt templeton had an insurance policy on her as well.
templeton and the doctor milked her for all she was worth alive... then arranged one, big final payoff.
he tripped his beeper in the presence of witnesses... then went on to yvette harwood's house, expecting to find her depressed and in bed-
where he could easily kill her, and then certify that she died of a heart attack.
chandler and templeton split the insurance money, walk away, and no one's any wiser.
it would have worked, too, if i hadn't gone looking for virginia mayo.
for as much as it hath pleased almighty god of his great mercy to take on to himself the soul of our dear sister here departed
we therefore commit her body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust
never stray from the path, never eat a windfall apple... and never trust a man whose eyebrows meet!
the best winter wool, pet, woven across the valley so good, so soft i thought i'd knit a shawl for your sister.
if i were wolf once more, i'd teach this whore a lesson!
he looks just the same... as the day i married him!
but once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.
when the wolves, though when the real wolves... when the real wolves mate, do the dogs beat the bitches afterward?
your mummy and daddy will need all the help they can get.
just grow wise, learn all that you can, now that your sister is gone.
so if you should spy on a naked man in the wood, run as if the devil himself were after you!
the devil's one thing, but a priest making babies is another!
what is it they say, it's not losing a daughter, it's gaining a son?
stop teasing me, he only asked me to walk with him!
the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;
and the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice ' den.
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
there was once a village so plagued by the beasts they drew one up in the bucket of the well!
hush your antique gossip unless you want the wolves to hear it!
of course i'll stay the night if she asks me it'd be rude not to.
she is my grandmother, and she may not have a kind word for you, but she's always been good to me.
they're nice as pie until they've had their way with you.
but once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.
...learn how to sew, how to take care of things, how to press things.
there isn't anything in the house that you won't be able to do.
your mummy and daddy will need all the help they can get.
you must grow wise and learn all you can, now that your sister has gone.
if the child is born on christmas day, feet first, he'll be the one.
if he's born feet first, and his eyebrows meet in the middle.
so, if you should spy on a naked man in the wood, run as if the devil himself were after you.
the devil's one thing, but a priest making babies is another.
their young ones shall lie down together and the lion shall eat straw, like the ox.
and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
they shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain;
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea."
the wolf that ate your sister was hairy on the outside, but when she died, she went straight to heaven.
the worst kind of wolves are hairy on the inside, and when they bite you, they drag you with them to hell.
but once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.
when the wolves, though, the real wolves... when the real wolves mate, do the dogs beat the bitches afterwards?
and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
they shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain;
there was once a village so plagued with the beasts, that they drew one up in the bucket of the well.
hush your antique gossip, unless you want the wolves to hear it.
man that is born of a woman has but a short time to live and is full of misery
he cometh up and is cut down like a flower he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.
we therefore commit her body to the ground earth to earth ashes to ashes dust to dust
your poor sister, all alone in the wood, and nobody there to save her!
oh, they're nice as pie until they've had their way with you.
but once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.
they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain:
for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the lord, as the waters cover the sea.
and the son of the big house did her a terrible wrong.
so she came to his wedding, to put wrong to right.
and the wound did heal for she was just a girl after all who had strayed from the path in the forest and remembered what she'd found there.
so back through the forest she ran and ran to the well, and the village, from whence she came...
the wolf that ate your sister was hairy on the outside, but when she died, she went straight to heaven.
the worst kind of wolves are hairy on the inside, and when they bite you, they drag you with them to hell.
but once the bloom is gone, oh, the beast comes out.

learn how to sew, how to take care of things, how to press things.
there isn't anything in the house that you won't be able to do.
your mummy and daddy will need all the help they can get.
you must grow wise and learn all you can, now that your sister has gone.
if the child is born on christmas day, if he's born feet first, he'll be the one.
if he's born feet first, and his eyebrows meet in the middle.
and the suckling child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.
they shall not hurt, nor destroy, in all my holy mountain;
(male narrator) in 1972, a crack commando unit... was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government... they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
but don't you think we should know something... before we go into a place like that?
for instance, number one, the temperature... it is 79 degrees, very humid, with a condensation factor of nineteen.
second of all, boots must be worn at all times because of the variety of... poisonous plant and animal life.
and third, and this is the most important for you, b.a.... we must beware of the crocodilians from the cayman family.
yeah, maybe you can make me sergeant of arms... so i can throw you out of the country.
when we get there, the first thing we have to do is find out where fallone is.
(murdock) you know, face, if you were really smart, you'd do what we do at the va.
put it under your tongue, down the water, make a gulping sound to... make them think you swallowed it, but it's still under your tongue.
we still have to get it refined, get it cut and get it packaged.
i got holes leaking all over this place. i want the stuff out.
i just stopped in to say, "hi, there"... and i find you've got a major... heroin refining operation right down the hall on this nice little island.
and i noticed you've got the natives chained up... so you can raise your own poppies... so you won't have to import the crude from asia. lt's very efficient.
but, you know, i don't know which i hate the most, hard narcotics, or slavery.
so i'm coming back tomorrow... and i'm gonna cream your whole operation.
captain fallone was dropped off safely at the hospital and i brought some... some tank ammo with me.
but, sir... you and the other guys, you haven't by any chance come across some... small worms, water insects, toads or tadpoles, have you?
patient, waiting for discovery to breathe life into its very soul.
i'm gonna breathe my fist into your soul if you don't stop all this jibber jabber!

i'm commanding you under direct orders of the united states army... to put down your weapons and place yourself into my custody!
my fist's gonna see you later if you don't get that lizard away from me!

eons ago, our ancestors created our great frontier, a barrier of energy encircling the peaceful systems of the universe, and forever shutting out the scourge that lurks beyond.

relax for even a second, and he or she could simply vanish.
or even worse, if you allow he or she to recognize you as an adversary, then he or she might instigate direct confrontation, which the surgeon general has declared to be
higgins, please, at least let me play back what i've done and take some notes.
i've got my first class tomorrow and i don't have a lesson plan.
well, i was planning on dividing this class into two parts.
the first part will be the classroom lectures, and then the second part...
well, i was planning to use a case that, that i had already solved a couple of years ago and then re-enacting my investigative procedure.
what if somebody in the class has some cases that weren't solved?
i mean, would you stop giving mr. magnum such a hard time?
i mean, he's already got this nice, pre-solved case for us all worked out.
so i go, "hey." i mean, there's worse ways to earn a living, right?
well, i mean, you work your own hours, you pull down the big bucks.
you don't have a case either, so if you'll pick them, we'll make that as fair as possible.
"i am running for my life from an unfriendly foreign power.
and a girlfriend of mine swears that she saw ted coming out of a bar last night on the north shore.
well, we'll do some checking between now and the next class.
if he's on the island, he shouldn't be too hard to find.
the class, mr. magnum, if you don't get enough students to continue, would you still help me find ted?
graduated central arizona university, 1979 with a degree in business administration.
moved to hawaii in 1981, currently employed as an officer with huiia savings and loan.
his father was an only child and his mother has one deceased brother.
therefore, we must conclude that he had no plans to visit a sick uncle in seattle, as he told stacy.
i've heard that some private investigators don't even do any of that bone-numbing research.
that they actually con other people to do it for them.
now, remember, when we go in the place, it's doubles and singles, and you don't know me.
so then how are you gonna pay for the beer, huh?
my favorite college courses were always those with some sort of lab work.
so there was a real sense of pride in finding myself sitting here conducting my own lab class.
kiana, look what we already know about the guy from the trash he threw out.
we know where he eats, where he works, what he drinks and...
i never realized spreading fertilizer could bring one such a sense of accomplishment.
don't you think you're taking your martyrdom a bit too far?
and it cost me almost my entire life's savings doing it.
eighty bucks for beer, 20 bucks for garbage, 50 bucks for rick and t.c.'s tuition.
all i got out of the investment was having to face the fact that nobody got anything out of my class.
well, stacy dayton got a very important piece of information about her fiancé.
you provided her with just enough of a clue to leave her totally confused and distraught.
of course, i understand why you can't help her continue her search.
well, i doubt if you'll still find the money in your local accommodating bank.
the funds have probably been transferred to an account in a tax-haven country.
and yours doesn't give you the right to crack ribs either.
you should have told us who you were at that bar.
i mean, i didn't know who at the bank was involved.
i talked to agent blaylock, and he said he'd be right over to get a statement.
but when i called back to suggest that perhaps we meet someplace else besides the bank, nobody there seemed to know who i was or what i was talking about.
well, then i got scared that maybe agent blaylock was a treasury man gone bad.
and when you couldn't find anything in the deposit box to incriminate blaylock, you decided to bluff him.
and so you begged one of your class members to get on the phone and arrange plan b, the class field trip to the club.
now, this certain class member was certainly glad to help, even though he missed a big fare to maui.
and, of course, shipley was just a thug who worked for mr. c.
and since this guy, ice pick, knew most of his associates, it was easy for him to trace down the actual hitman who took care of grider.
and, when the license plate on grider's van traced back to mr. c, you had the evidence to incriminate him.
so a quick phone call to get him to worry got him to the club also.
your usual source for this license information was busy with this man called ice pick.
and at the drugstore next door, she asked for half a pint more.
at the laundry she ordered a yard of stamps to put on a card.
she hard-boiled her eggs in the snow and pinned up her curls with a bow.
it made the other ducks foam, when she used a match as a comb.
once when she'd gobbled a book, she broke into gobbledygook, she chewed up a lot of spaghetti and said she was making confetti.
and once she swallowed a dime just for the sake of the rhyme.
at last they found her a buyer who said he was willing to try her.
he picked up our dottie and trussed her and in a hot oven he thrust her.
but he wished he had saved his money, when dottie turned into a bunny.
that is the last news we heard of this very peculiar bird.
oho my friend, you'll soon be mine, an angler cried and cast his line.
he caught him by a curly beam, ate him for breakfast, braised in cream.
it was a dream of seven glasses, but i'll tell you about it later.
after soaking up our dreams mr. blot put us to various tasks.
when a bear is wild, he's wild and he keeps his tusks well filed.
if you see one don't delay, climb the nearest tree straightway!
i'm happy to see you are all friends of nature, respecting her ways.
after dinner the boys went fishing and mr blot took out his butterfly-net.
would you allow me to have a few moments alone with my noble patient?
i was able to cure you, my little prince, because i command secrets known only to my people from my country.
doctor of chemistry, philosophy and medicine, disciple of the famous prof. pai-chi-wo.
lecturer in mathematics and astronomy at the university of salamanca, ambrose blot, at your service.
he was anxious to talk over his suspicions with mr. blot.
the academy is a place where work and play are equally interesting.
against his father's will he set out on a nocturnal adventure during which he killed the king of the wolves.
the dying wolf wounded him... but the young prince was cured by dr. pai-chi-wo who gave him a cap with a magic button.
this enabled him to turn into a bird when he was attacked by wolves.
but without the lost button mat couldn't turn back into a boy.
while waiting for mr. blot adam looked upwards at a ball flying through the air and found himself flying towards a new adventure.
all this time philip, the barber... had been waking on his mysterious invention.
that dog, tango, eats too many meat-pies and has to be dosed with castor oil.
on the left is our salami orchard... and on the right we have a black pudding and liver pate farm.
i expect they're envious, just as philip is envious of your academy... and resents us all being so happy.
when you came to us you were a nice, well-behaved boy.
i am special, 'cause i know how to talk to my dog joe.
i learned how to from a manual written by a clever spaniel.
when i call "joey here!", he sits up and cocks an ear.
when i shout "joey hop!", he is gone before i stop.
when i whisper "joey he!", he lies down and so do i.
when i scratch him on his chin, his teeth flash in a wicked grin.
once i was a dream you had, when i called your whole world mine.
the world of childhood, play and thoughts, first joys and wonderful dreams.
if you touch me you'll turn into frogs and stay here forever.
do as i wish and i'll grant each of you a wish.
she asked friends to a meal so they'd see what's genteel.
a donkey came in and brayed and broke a vase, i'm afraid
beyond seven nebulae, beyond seven moons lies a planet wrapped in colorful clouds known as the star of hope.
my third eye flew there and what it observed you'll see for yourselves.
the third eye flew to the most interesting part of our solar system, where the collective memory of the universe is stored.
there it was given details concerning the history and position of the star of hope.
they learned to be careful during their war with king chaos who set out to conquer the universe.
they put the third eye through many tests to discover what my intentions were.
i'm the queen of toy-land and i order you to stop!
too late, my lovely, i'm no longer a subject of yours.
these scrolls, adolf destroyed, contained the knowledge passed to me by dr. pai-chi-wo.
now there'll be no more cooking with colours... flying in the air, healing furniture, or making up magic songs and rhymes.
adam niezgodka was introduced by mat, the talking starling, into the tale of mister blot's academy.
at the gates he was greeted by the schoolsong - ln the land of cockaigne.
he was anxious to talk over his suspicions with mr blot.
the academy is a place where work and play are equally interesting.
against his father's will he set out on a nocturnal adventure during which he killed the king of the wolves.
he received a wound but was cured by dr pai chi wo who gave him a cap with a magic button.
this enabled him to turn into a bird when he was attacked by wolves.
but without the lost button mat couldn't turn back into a boy.
and on the right we have a black pidding and liver pate farm.
in the square you'll see a chocolate memorial to dr dolittle.
i have a prize for the one who finds the best treasure.
i found a hollow tree-trunk but i was afraid to explore it by myself.
i've been waiting for someone to finish it for the last 100 years.
if you touch me you'll turn into frogs and stay here forever.
do as i wish and i'll grand each of you a wish.
i'd like a key to open all doors and a whistle to take me anywhere i like.
as a reward for searching so carefully you can keep all you found.
after supper today i'll take down our album and read you adam's dream.
they put the third eye through many tests to discover what my intentions were.
when they learnt that contact with another civilisation might help to unite mankind the planet's protective screen was raised and above the hori_on appeared the beautiful star of hope whose stoy i'm about to relate.
these scrolls contained the knowledge passed to me by dr pai chi wo.
now there'll be no more cooking in colours... flying in the air, healing furniture, or making up magic songs and rhymes.
in the land of cockaigne puss in boots spins his cane
and prances hand in hand with an ass on an ant.
a guinea hen they say lays a golden egg each day
an oak has apples on it each in an ermine bonnet.
the classrooms, bedrooms and dining- room are on the ground- floor.
on the first floor you'll find the kitchen, my study and doors leading to other stories.
no more twinges, you look fine... lt's healed up beautifully, quite beautifully.
in a day or two you'll be as right as rain.
i think i heard them say that summer's on her way
the mole grunts, for my part i expect her on a cart
i'm happy to see you are all friends of nature and respect her ways.
after dinner the boys went fishing and mr blot took out his butte_ly-net.
i'll tell you my stoy and then you'll understand why i've such a large collection of buttons.
shut your eyes... lt'll make it easier for you to imagine my adventures.
would you allow me to have a few moments alone with my patient?
i was able to cure you because i command secrets known only to my people.
- together with my third eye - ... to one of the planets of the solar system known as the star of hope.
if what i suspect turns out to be true, i'll tell you another story - a tale of stardwellers.
while i was waiting for mr blot i thought about how easily he rose into the air and how wondrful it would be to fly like a balloon or a ball.
suddenly i felt strangely lightheaded... i floated upwards without being afraid.
i'm gonna see to it that each and every one of you is taken care of.
you will be provided with the best possible food, shelter and accommodations.
i know this move has probably been very sudden for all of you and you're probably all still very disoriented.
i do want to assure you that this move is in no way permanent.
but when you're working with a computer, you gotta build something with your mind.
if you're good, you can do somethin' no one's ever seen before.
i've assigned each of you a different part of the list.
this'll prevent doubling up, and we'll be able to blanket the area in no time.
as you know, we have no chapter at adams college, which is why we agreed to see you.
but i must tell you, gentlemen, you have very little chance of becoming tri-lambs.
the sisters of pi welcome our newest fraternity, lambda lambda lambda.
we'd like to be escorts to your party saturday night and help out in any way possible.
guys, we are never gonna get a fair shake as long as stan gable is president.
but the only way to become president is to win the homecoming carnival.
and i'm here tonight to stand up for the rights of other nerds.
i mean, uh, all our lives we've been laughed at and made to feel inferior.
let's say one of us is up here with a woman?
this'll be our early warning device, so we don't walk in on each other.
dean, we got a big game coming up and i don't want my boys' minds worried about where they're gonna live.
well, they should've thought of that before they burned their house down.
i'm gonna see to it that each and every one of you is taken care of.
you will be provided with the best possible food, shelter and accommodations.

yeah, well, when i was in high school, i was thinking mostly of the aerospace field.
but then when i got into college, i decided i wanted something more challenging.
so, um, i switched to computers, and now aerodynamics is just sort of a hobby.

these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
a clerk in rl who's been with the firm less than one month... making unsanctioned use of the security computer at 5:00 a.m.?
do you think she discovered our plan to assassinate sheik fatasi at 2.:00?
my plan is... we get out of town as soon as i finish playing... the monster from camp runamuck.
now, if the contessa and carmeiia marasceiia... don't invite you by the time i finish filming today... you're out of luck.
i work my butt off to be salesman of the month.
'cause that's who the contessa requests when she comes shopping here.
now, you guys just hand your .45s... to the handsome gentleman right over there.
aren't you gonna tell me i'm not gonna get away with this?
i told you. i've been working undercover on a story there.
using the security firm's computers to run a check on us... in the early morning hours before work?
what was going on in one of the largest private security firms in l.a.?
and you really just wanted to get in touch with us?
i had the training on it to know i could tap into military records... if they had the access.
which, with their contracts with the government... and other international security firms, would definitely do.
so, anyway, she was kidnapped from her place and me... i was thrown out of a 10-story window.
now, face, you don't have to exaggerate to make your point.
a guy who works there by the name of ron graham... who she's been seeing, by the way.
and some crud named carson who was very rude to me.
a lot of people don't realise... how those wild ones can move down out of the hills... and make themselves right at home.
these big air conditioning units here... make a sound just like their mama's heartbeat.
you couldn't fill this building with enough money... to get me to pull you out of a burning wreck.
but i would take you and this whole network of terrorism you set up... and flush you down the sewer.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
i work my butt off to be salesman of the month.
'cause that's who the contessa requests when she comes shopping here.
i'm sorry, our store santa claus has gone for the day.
you'll have to come back if you want to tell him what you want for christmas.
which is very difficult for us to confirm on short notice... seeing that amy's in djakarta right now.
honey, the only id in here is from the intermode security firm.
so my friend who was working at intermode... thought it might make some kind of story.
didn't you think maybe she was just bitter because intermode laid her off?
but the part about the entire upper management... slowly being replaced over a couple of months' time... and all security personnel being adjusted... cutting off access to certain areas that had been open until then... it was enough to convince my editor to let me check it out.
what was going on in one of the largest private security firms in l.a.?
but once i was there, i realised the full potential of their computer system.
i had the training on it to know i could tap into military records... if they had the access.
a guy who works there by the name of ron graham... who she's been seeing, by the way.
and some crud named carson who was very rude to me.
a lot of people don't realise... how those wild ones can move down out of the hills... and make themselves right at home.
these big air conditioning units here... make a sound just like their mama's heartbeat.
you couldn't fill this building with enough money... to get me to pull you out of a burning wreck.
but i would take you and this whole network of terrorism you set up... and flush you down the sewer.
and i kept my cool getting away from col. decker... and when you rescued me from raymond.
and you think all this buys you a locker in our gym?
just tell her i said hello and wish her my best.
come on, man. i know she's a pain in the neck sometimes.
and i never quite understood the attraction she was talking about.
until the day i first saw alex carter... and the way t.c. was looking at her.
you know, i was so scared you wouldn't show up... and then i was scared that you would show up.
i mean, look at me, singing in a place like this.
but the thing is, there's a guy here in hawaii who owes me a lot of money... and he keeps avoiding me.
so i thought maybe you could help me figure out how to find him.
you know, when i heard you'd become a private investigator... i just knew that i could count on you to help me.
i don't know, alex, it's... not always that easy to find someone who doesn't want to be found.
for getting me through all the stuff with the police... and not asking me if i wanted to talk about it, and i guess... for not sweeping me off my feet.
well, the way i figure... we've got plenty of time to get to know each other... without a war to worry about or other people to account for.
but that is all the more reason why we should help her.
i'm not gonna drop her off on kalakaua avenue somewhere and wish her luck.
i'm just saying that you should keep your eyes open... and be careful, that's all.
hey, you want i should call ice pick... and he'll give him a two-inch neck?
and while you're at it, see if you can find out about a guy named david mitchell.
dave mitchell deals mostly in black market goods and tourist rip-offs.
in fact, he's the kind of guy you see if you want to sell in quantity.
well, if he deals in merchandise... he must have a warehouse somewhere.
in our neighborhood, when i was growing up... there was this record store right on the way home from school.
i'd stop in there every afternoon... pretend i was gonna buy something... and i'd take alberta hunter albums into their listening room.
hey, you turn it over to us and we'll let you walk home.
i think you've got the wrong guy... if you're looking for mitchell.
i don't want them slipping out of hawaii... while we're tied up with procedures.
he won't. i just found out that he never left detroit.
but i think that lady's had more than her share of trouble.
as long as i'm around, i'm gonna make sure nobody bothers her.
no, see, she came to see henry then henry came to see me.
then some guys show up from detroit and say that the stuff... that she's trying to sell belongs to them.
do you know i actually talked to the legal owner of the gun?
he told me that the gun was stolen a week ago.
look, thomas, what happened between me and alexis was a long time ago.
and i think she's scared about her opening... and she could use some friends there tonight.
(magnum) miss wagner, my 1 1th grade english teacher... created a scandal in my hometown... when she put all the king's men on our mandatory reading list.
she said she wanted us to understand the fatal attraction... some men have for the very thing that will destroy them.
you know, i was so scared you wouldn't show up... and then i was scared that you would show up.
i mean, look at me, singing in a place like this.
but the thing is, there's a guy here in hawaii who owes me a lot of money... and he keeps avoiding me.
so i thought maybe you could help me figure out how to find him.
denny said if i ever tried to leave him, he'd kill me.
and i thought.... [laughs] well, i didn't see how he was gonna track me down here.
but that is all the more reason why we should help her.
i'm not gonna drop her off on kalakaua avenue somewhere and wish her luck.
i'm just saying that you should keep your eyes open... and be careful, that's all.
hey, you want i should call ice pick... and he'll give him a two-inch neck?
and while you're at it, see if you can find out about a guy named david mitchell.
dave mitchell deals mostly in black market goods and tourist rip-offs.
in fact, he's the kind of guy you see if you want to sell in quantity.
well, if he deals in merchandise... he must have a warehouse somewhere.
i must say, you're not at all like magnum's other friends.
well, if you talk to thomas he'll probably tell you... i'm not one of his friends.
i think you've got the wrong guy... if you're looking for mitchell.
you wanna tell us you're not working for that girl singer?
[phone ringing] i can't go to the police until i find out... if these guys who jumped us are connected with johnson.
i don't want them slipping out of hawaii... while we're tied up with procedures.
well, maybe you'd better explain that to the guys who did this.
that is if you see them before they get to her.
now look, i've got a nice little business going here... and i'm not looking to expand.
now i tried to explain that to henry, but he wouldn't listen.
so these guys from detroit they took him out to a sugarcane field.
now between you and me... i think they've got the same trip in mind for the singer.
do you know i actually talked to the legal owner of the gun?
he told me that the gun was stolen a week ago.
i've known houses get hit three, four, five times by the same guy.
and since most people lie to their insurance companies, the value goes up every time.
i want to get an alarm, a dog and a gun we can keep in the house someplace.
hold on, we're not gonna change our whole lives, are we?
i was born near the water and used to sail all the time with my dad.
i spend every minute i can in water, in my bath, usually.
the sun is hot - intoxicating - the water undulates under us.
my resistance drains away, his body is strong, his face is beautiful.
i'm going to have a cup of coffee before i go, so if you ever find a pen, write it down, drop it off.
i found one of my cards, the address is on the back.
ray, you've been on a roll for the last three, four years, you are the hottest item in the children's market.
but you can be the most self-absorbed asshole in the world.
security guard mike macelwane, a retired police officer, was tragically murdered in tiburon by unknown assailants.
macelwane was a highly decorated member of the police force, and the police department is mourning his death.
he takes me to the water, a huge yacht like a castle.
the sun is hot - intoxicating - the water undulates under us.
i can get myself a new publisher and a new friend.
ray, you've been on a roll for the last three, four years, you are the hottest item in the children's market.
macelwane was a highly decorated member of the police force, and the police department is mourning his death.
top priority has been given to bringing his killers to justice.
you begged me to come into your life and that's what i did.
i did everything you ever wanted a man to do for you.
= = fortunately for me, walter advanced knowledge of electronics... ... led him to experiment with neèim called a hologram.
it'sa fancynamefor a3d image,which isperfectwhen can look really... ...thatsoundsreally,with enoughenergyand that i feel really.
how made that idea before the boss, without very strong evidence.
do st.cristobal not one of those tax havens place where a variety of financial fraud ?
your suggestion to look for other cases of disappearances in the caribbean was good.
my friend, fbi computers, says 6 people still missing from a business trip on st.cristobal island in the last 18 months.
of course, the bank is not in a position to advise you in doing something like this.
probably not, but some of my friends from america whispered to me that you are resourceful , miss lou.
he grew as a child on his way from the first home.
his car to return information he aroused interest in life and other things.
you have to talk to the computer in the bank .
ok walter, but i was on an island of hair records.
the world is running out safe havens for people like us.
but you seem to really do well here in st.cristobalu .
there will be a general assembly in cairo, there they will decide what plan to follow.
the decision to declare war on the truce was taken last month in brussels.
the youth of today is shit, you can't live without drugs
you're a drag, joints aren't a drug, they'll sell them on corner stands soon and i'm still not hooked nor do i plan to be
what a dummy you are cutie, haven't you heard of goya or sola?
i know goya, when i was in school they took me to the prado museum to see his paintings
- of course, he's a real killing machine, an implacable exterminator
these are the reports we had on file about the kamikaze
data that this archives possesses to date on the truce agent know by codename the kamikaze
approximate age 42 years, his place of birth is unknown though he's probably of latin origin, perhaps italian or spanish
he's a madman, unbalanced, but one day he'll make a mistake
that mistake, no matter how small will be enough for me
macmurdo, it's obvious you're a small fry, but they're paying big money for your head
i can pay you too, i'll give you whatever you want
it's clear that if we don't finish the kamikaze he'll finish us
monica, after the attack in cairo you told me of some clues
the venom on the dart acts in less than two seconds
sergio, why don't you come live with me, we could be very happy
i love freedom too much and i'm not the sort to be caged, even in a golden cage
but i don't mean to restrict your freedom at all, you could do whatever you wanted, travel, painting, maybe have exhibitions
according to our latest reports the kamikaze is in london, or here
i'm very tired, i want to forget about everything for a few hours
the material evidently isn't bad, but we can provide something more sophisticated, more decisive
the military constantly needs weaponry, the more modern and effective the more they'll pay
but we should mete it out with a certain tactical and commercial sense yes, everything is seen to vladimir
the conflicts have to be drawn out and last much longer, that way the dividends will increase and the leaders will be pleased
the operation is of the greatest importance and the truce will try by any means to prevent it from taking place
torpedo movement has been detected trying to elimate the key man
everything is in order, operation lock can't fail, it would be a fatal blow to the organization
perhaps this will be my opportunity to hunt down the kamikaze
when i eliminate someone i feel neither remorse or pleasure, only the satisfaction of a good professional
you're a computer programmed to kill, with neither a heart or emotions
in a profession like mine you know any weakness is fatal
when beings like us are born something perverse must happen in the mothers womb
have them prepared quickly, everything must be ready as soon as possible
but to do it like this, don't you have to consider it?
you don't want responsibilities, she's a deficient creature and that could bother the rotten society you belong to
well i shit on that disgusting society of hypocrites and sons of bitches!
i warned the council that it was a mistake to elimate karai the tunisian here
things have changed in this country and everything is more complicated than before
i plan to spend almost all my time in the kulov, golf relaxes my nerves
sadly i can't go, but it won't be hard to find someone to play with
i've called you here to establish a union between ourselves and the giovicci organziation.
the absurd war we've waged, the losses on both sides have been disastrous.
and now i'm at your disposal, i'll clear up anything you wish
i suppose that this accord will bring about substantial reform in our structure as well as your own
the fight to supremacy lead us without a doubt to mutual extermination and disaster
you still owe me money for my last job and i need it urgently
no, not here, we can't see each other in the office, those are strict orders
a courier will take the money somewhere we'll agree on, one that's different every time
problems at work, and anyway, what business is it of yours?
come on old man, it's no reason to be like that
our friend will be there in two hours, pay him what we agreed on
marina, we have a lot to do, let's organize the archives
you want to throw me out, you're saying that because you want to throw me out
little one, what i'm saying is true, i'm not lying, listen to me
he always spoke of the fuhrer of himmler, of goering, of goebbels
i was only nine years old and he made me live under an unbearable, cruel discipline
sadly my mother died soon after i was born, no one could oppose his crazed will
he taught me to kill animals, to torture them, he made me into a sadist
the operation will be closed to great advantage on both sides
the new points of tension created let us be very optimistic about the future
evidently the union of the truce and the organization has been a great success
the loss of an element as valuable as madam bredonda is regrettable
no doubt, but soon someone as efficient as her will take her spot in the iberian peninsula
the important thing is to rid our society of obsolete elements
you know the game well, you're a distinguished member of the organization
on the other hand not long ago what could happen to me didn't bother you
you were a rival of the kind they don't make anymore
thank you, a compliment of a colleague of your stature is always welcome
three years ago, in tokyo, you laid a trap for me, not a very refined one, but it worked
i became a cripple without a right to a pension and my best friend died in the attempt
with respect to your hand, i regret it, but you'll agree its a danger of the profession
what a surprise, i see you have a certain sense of humor
if on the other hand i finish you, it's my group that will put me out of the way
that's not counting the possibility that with a little luck we'll kill each other
the forces that drive this lava to the surface als cause the continents to move round the globe, millimetre by millimetre, over thousands of years.
when they collide, the buckling, contorted rocks are pushed up into great mountain ranges.
butjust as they rise, so are they cut down by the erosion of ice and snow and rushing water.
at the poles, where the sun's rays strike the glob only obliquely, it's bitterly cold.
here glaciers grind their way across the land, gouge out deep valleys and flow into the sea.
at the equator, where the sun strikes the earth four-square, the land is baked.
over centuries, the amount of rain falling on it has varied.
as it diminishes, so the forests have dwindled and been replaced by grassland.
in the hot deserts, animals have evolved ways of living in oven-like temperatures without drinking any liquid whatsoever.
in the cold deserts around the poles, other creatures, who generate their own internal heat, have grown insulating coats of fur and fat so that they are not frozen to death.
human beings, one of the last species of large animal to appear on the planet, have spread with extraordinary speed to all corners of the globe.
they've done so not so much because their bodies have changed to match extremes but because they've used skills and intelligence to exploit the adaptations of other living creatur
the eskimos survive in the arctic by keeping themselves warm with the skins of polar bears and seals.
in the jungles of the amazon, the indians have learned where to find and how to collect everything they need to sustain themselves.
even though today they may cook in metal pots traded from the outside world, they still know how to make pottery from the clay.
in the hot deserts of southern africa, the bushmen survive droughts by tapping the stores of liquid held in the bodies of animals and the roots and the stems of plants.
immediately after the rains, however, they can collect water from natural hollows, but even that takes knowledge and skill.
human beings, for nearly all the half-million year of their existence as a species, have lived by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals.
he began to change the environment to suit himself, and one of the places where he first did so is in that valley down there.
this is beidha in jordan, and here were found the remains of one of mankind's earliest villages.
this was no temporary encampment, but a permanent settlement with alleys and houses of stone built adjoining one another.
they were half-dug into the ground, the floor and walls covered with a plaster of mud and lime, and in the walls were posts which supported a roof of thatch which probably just cleared the top of the wall so light could get in.
so the people had created a snug home, protected from the rain and the sun, a place where mothers could bear their children in safety.
there are lots of grinding stones, querns, here, in which the people ground the seeds of grass, a kind of wild barley that grows abundantly hereabouts.
they'd long since discovered that you could scatter grass seeds and produce a crop.
they'd been doing that with the seeds of another wild grass, wheat, for many centuries.
now they were settled, it was inconvenient to scour the countryside to look for places where the grass happened to grow.
much better to throw it onto the ground near the village, where they could watch the crop, make sure animals didn't plunder it, and it was convenient to gather.
domesticating animals must have been much more difficult than domesticating plants.
but the first steps towards doing so were probably taken centuries earlier when the people were still nomads.
in north america the caribou are completely wild, but here in northern scandinavia they are, to some degree at least, domesticated.
man has managed to achieve that by becoming a nomad himself.
the reindeer's winter food is a kind of lichen which they find growing beneath the snow.
when the reindeer were completely wild, young stags would wander away from their group, taking a few young females with them.
the few they left unmutilated in order to breed were those they thought most likely to remain unaggressive and disinclined to wander.
so, consciously or unconsciously, the lapps over centuries have changed the reindeer from a nervous creature living in family groups to one that is so docile it can be kept in herds thousands strong and can be moved from one slope to another by leading the way with a stag on a halter.
it may well be that in some such way as this, the people who lived 9,000 years ago in beidha gradually turned the wild goats of the surrounding mountains into tamed domesticated ones.
the techniques of domestication and maybe the domesticated animals themselves slowly spread westwards across europe.
7,000 years ago, the people living in france had their own herds.
and around 6,000 years ago, the techniques and even perhaps herdsmen with some stock crossed the channel into britain.
they must have landed somewhere in southern england, but the land didn't look like this.
like nearly all the rest of britain, it was covered in trees.
people were already living in the forests, gathering fruit and nuts and hunting the wild animals, deer and wild oxen.
but they hadn't changed the woodlands of britain any more than the amazonian indians have changed the jungle.
sheep still prevent the seedlings of trees from growing and keep the pastures clear for cowslips, clover, orchids, buttercups, pipits and skylarks.
this was the beginning of a process that was to transform britain.
almost the only part of britain that remains free of human influence is the land over 2,500 feet high that is of little practical use to people.
it was scraped clean of soil by glaciers during the ice age 10,000 years ago and still remains stony and barren.
wolves preyed on domesticated flocks and herds and even threatened people.
the last english wolf had been killed by the year 1500 and the last scottish one by the middle of the 18th century.
wild boar were once common in british woods, grubbing up roots and bulbs, munching acorns and beech nuts.
but boars could be aggressive and dangerous, and the sows made good eating.
by the 17th century, there were none of these left either.
the elk, known in america as the moose, once lived here too, but it had been hunted into extinction even before the romans arrived.
they only became really common in the countryside during the 19th century.
pheasants are asian birds, and were brought here soon after the norman conquest.
other, bigger, animals were living around the settlements of those early british tribes.
aurochs, the giant cattle whose images were painted in french caves during prehistory, also roamed in british forests.
by roman times, some had already been domesticated, and one of the early strains derived from them still survives in the cheviot hills.
this herd at chillingham was penned in a great park during the 13th century, and has lived here ever since, with scarcely any interference from human beings.
they may well be very similar to those that wandered around the farms in roman times.
they're formidable animals, very different from the gentle friesian of today.
eventually, after two or three years, he will lose and surrender his place to a younger, more vigorous animal.
having changed a wild animal into a docile one by selective breeding, farmers now used the same techniques to modify the animal's body.
they wanted meat, and soon they produced a very different-looking beast.
these portraits, commissioned by breeders 100 years ago, show that the characteristics they valued in their cattle then are the same as those we prize today.
today's bulls have such stunted legs that they can't run fast to chase away a rival.
many don't even have horns with which to fight a courtship battle.
under intensive feeding, such cattle can put on two pounds a day and grow so fast that they can be profitably slaughtered within a year.
the new breeds of pig, descendants of the wild boars of the european forests, now grow five times faster than their wild cousins and are ready for slaughter within six months.
chickens, birds of the asian jungles, have been converted into egg-producing machines that can lay over 300 eggs a year.
the same techniques produced our food plants, using species from all over the world.
the potato came from the andes, where it was grown by the incas.
the pea is a european plant first cultivated by the italians in the 16th century.
the grass we call rice was domesticated in asia some 7,000 years ago, at about the same time that people were learning to cultivate wheat around the mediterranean.
the people of asia have perfected the techniques of growing one kind of rice in flooded terraces.
they do so with such skill that the rice will flower and ripen and produce heads of swollen seeds several times a year.
as mankind's population grew, so more and more of the land had to be taken into cultivation.
today, 11% of all the arable land on earth is devoted to growing just this one species of grass.
now more than 2,000 million people depend on it, half the population of the world.
in the western world, people still prefer the kind of grass they learned to eat during prehistory, but that too they have transformed.
today's wheat grows tall, uniform and dense, so it can be easily harvested by machines.
wheat like this can't even reproduce itself now without man's aid.
it's true that it is largely immune to pests like moulds and rusts, but moulds and rusts also evolve quickly, naturally, into forms which can attack the new strains.
so farmers have to change the strain that they grow on average about every ten years.
today, in north america, over half the wheat comes from just four strains.
were plant breeders to fail to produce new varieties from wild species, then fields like this could be devastated and the western world would starve.
to grow the vast quantity of grain needed by mankind's increasing population, huge areas of the most fertile lands on earth have been turned over to its cultivation.
gone are the rich communities of grasses and other small plants, together with hundreds of kinds of insects and small creatures.
now over thousands of square miles, all other plants and large animals, except human beings, are rigorously excluded.
12,000 people daily come to work in it, and they live in an artificial microclimate in which the temperature and humidity are controlled by computers.
the whole structure is built of artificial man-made materials, a framework of steel, with black-skinned aluminium and bronze-faced glare-reducing glass forming a shell around it.
many human beings, it seems, don't wish to live totally out of contact with other living species.
once again, people have moulded their animals to match their particular whim and fancy, altering their size, their proportions, their fur.
cats are not, in the wild, social animals like dog but solitary hunters with strong territorial instincts.
they probably decided of their own accord to move into houses and hunt rats and mice, and people accepted them because of this useful service, and because they're endearing, but to this day they have remained independent operators, aloof and haughty,
even when people have bred them to exaggerate the most cuddlesome of their characteristics.
a few other living organisms have discovered that the city suits them.
the well-drained sterility of a lava flow is not unlike that of a city street, and in the 18th century a botanist found a yellow ragwort growing on the slopes of mount etna.
he took it back to oxford, where it was cultivated in the botanic gardens.
the stone rubble on which the tracks were laid was exactly what the ragwort liked.
it spread along the railways to appear in all the cities along the main lines, where it still flourishes today.
a few wild animals have found what they need in man's apparently hostile wildernesses.
the sea otter swims happily in the waters of california's harbours.
prairie dogs, driven off the prairies by ranchers, find new homes in urban playgrounds.
english foxes have discovered a rich source of food in city litter bins and doze on suburban roofs.
and in the south-west of the united states, acorn woodpeckers store their acorns in the trunks of fir trees, even when they've been turned into telegraph poles.
ospreys habitually build their nests in the very tops of trees, and telegraph poles also give them the kind of isolation they need.
church towers, to kestrels, are just as good nesting sites as rocky crags.
kittiwakes apparently regard modern buildings as little more than particularly regular sea cliff
there are still plenty of creatures, mammals and insects, that claim a share of mankind's food.
many insects eat cellulose, and find it in abundance in wood and in the paper with which people surround themselves.
brown rats originated somewhere in asia and spread to europe some 300 years ago.
today, rats are found in every large city in the world.
they will eat almost anything, tackling meat with as much relish as grain and vegetables.
they gnaw electric cables, causing short circuits and even, in consequence, fires.
they not only consume huge quantities of food, but contaminate much of what they leave, and they spread disease.
so if we're not to be overrun, we have to pursue them wherever they go.
we created the city, and if it's to function prope and be neither oppressively sterile nor infested with pests, we have to manage the living organisms that live in it, encouraging some, exterminating others.
but our influence spreads far wider than we often choose to recognise.
we're changing the whole of the globe, and we must accept our responsibilities of managing that, but so far we are making a very poorjob of it.
we have to rid our cities of the vast quantity of rubbish we create.
new york city produces 22,000 tons of refuse every single day.
half of that is taken by barge down the hudson river and dumped on staten island.
when the land is covered, another layer is dumped on top.
this is a very expensive way of getting rid of our rubbish.
if there are cheaper ways of doing so, we take them, telling ourselves if it's out of sight, it doesn't matter what happens to it, assuming that somehow the world is so large that our poisons will simply be lost in its immensities.
so we pour our waste chemicals and detergents into our rivers.
suds may or may not have been valuable in a sink.
in a river they can be lethal, killing the plants and the fish.
fumes belched from our engines fill the atmosphere of the city.
steam rising from the cooling towers of power stations is relatively harmless, but the gases produced by burning coal and oil are certainly not.
they're carried by the prevailing winds to countries hundreds of miles away.
the lakes of scandinavia have, over the past few decades, become more and more acid until now fish and plants can no longer survive in many.
in norway alone, there are now 1,800 lakes without fish, and hundreds more that are dying, shameful monuments to our carelessness and lack of concern.
in germany, 10% of the forests are seriously damaged, almost certainly due to industrial pollution of the atmosphere and the collection of the poisons from it by rain.
the guanay lives exclusively on anchovies and, oddly, excretes an unusually high proportion of the fish it eats as droppings or guano.
no rain falls here, so the guano wasn't washed away but accumulated on the rocks.
100 years ago the world realised that this was a fertiliser of unparalleled richnes
it was collected and sold for such high prices that the guanay cormorant became known as the most valuable bird in the world.
in one year, 14 million tons of anchovies were taken out of these waters.
they were sold not to feed people but cattle, chickens and pets.
the fishing was so intense that the anchovies were almost wiped out.
that in turn brought about the collapse of the guanay cormorants' population.
and now for every 50 cormorants that used to live here, you're lucky if you find one.
and these walls that would be filled with guano to the top inside two years, now seldom accumulate more than an inch or so.
but the cormorants shed their guano not only on the land but in the sea.
indeed, for every drop they put on land, they shed 20 into the sea.
there it fertilises water just as it fertilises the land, promoting the growth of floating plants, plankton, the food of the anchovy.
so if you get less anchovies, you get less cormorants, and if you get less cormorants, you get less anchovies.
anchovies are food notjust for cormorants but for sea fish like tuna and sea bass.
so, with that one rash act of overfishing 30 years ago,
this, the richest of all living communities, has been of enormous value to us.
it's provided industry with rubber, craftsmen with hardwoods, and our larders with bananas, nuts, chewing gum and chocolate.
many of our drugs are based on animals and plants that live here.
and still we have only investigated in detail the biochemistry of less than 1% of the plants.
and here, too, live some of the most beautiful and bizarre creatures to be found anywhere.
these animals are the product of millions of years of evolution in these forests
after a month, it's as tall as this, and in only five months it will be ready to be harvested, and it will have been sustained by this, the ash from the burnt forest.
but there are only enough nutrients in this to sustain one crop.
so next year the people plant not rice but this, cassava or tapioca, as it's called here.
this is a different crop, a root crop, which gets nutrients from deeper in the soil, but even this can only produce for one year.
after that, the seeds from the wild forest will come in and new plants will grow, producing a landscape like that.
but they will have to grow for eight to ten years before they are big enough to be felled and produce enough ash and nutrients to refertilise the soil and allow the people to take a second crop.
and the true forest, with all its original richnes of animals and plants, will never be restored.
it's not only the local people who cut down the forest.
so a tree that took 200 years to grow is now cut down by a chainsaw in five minutes.
the gigantic trunks, which once could only be shifted by elephants and only be extracted from forests growing on flat country, are now handled with terrifying ease by modern machinery.
sometimes only the biggest trees are taken, leaving smaller ones standing, but the damage is such that the forest is largely beyond recovery.
as the international price of timber increases, so more of the tropical forest is destroyed.
in just one year it can grow to 10 or 11 metres tall, 35 feet.
this one is some two years old and in only another six years it will be ready for logging.
albizia will grow well on the poor land that once supported rainforest, and many sawmills actually prefer small, easily handled logs of uniform size.
so if it were possible to produce this kind of timber on a really large scale, it might no longer be necessary to continue the extremely expensive and appallingly destructive business of felling the wild trees.
and were that to happen, then, in some parts of the world, away from the coasts and the rivers, in remote and mountainous country, the tropical rainforest might still survive.
the great rivers of the world can also yield riche to mankind, not simply food but power.
the dams have filled up with silt and become useless within decades, and fields downriver, robbed of their annual suppl of fertilising mud, have turned to desert.
but we're getting better at it, and we're doing it on a greater scale.
this dam, at itaipu between paraguay and brazil, will harness the power of one of south america's greatest rivers, the parana.
i am walking across what was once the bed of that river.
and above me rises the biggest dam ever built by man.
it contains enough concrete to construct a whole city to house four million people.
it will make a lake which will stretch upstream for 140 kilometres.
and the power it will produce will be enough to supply the whole of paraguay and the great cities of southern brazil:
even so, this major reshaping of the surface of the earth is likely to be one of the less damaging of those that mankind has inflicted on the planet.
a million trees of 50 species will be planted around the lake to prevent silt from washing into it.
the water will slowly clear and develop a population of fish.
and the turbines will produce power without poisoning the atmosphere or leaving behind radioactive waste.
they will not deplete the earth's irreplaceable reserves of fossil fuel, and the dam will continue to produce electricity, it's estimated, for the next 300 years.
the scale of this immense construction is awe-inspiring evidence of the power we now have in our hands with which to transform the face of the earth.
when, in prehistoric times, these stones were first put up to build this templ in the west of england at avebury, they too must have been an astonishment to people, an amazing demonstration of how clever, how powerful, human beings had become.
and yet that was less than 5,000 years ago, a mere moment in the history of life.
and in the brief period since then, men have gone on to learn how to build dams like itaipu, how to mould animals and plants to suit their needs or their fancies, how to transform whole landscapes.
immensely powerful though we are today, it's equally clear that we're going to be even more powerful tomorrow.
we shouldn't interfere with the basic processes of the earth on which life depends, in the sky, on the green surface of the earth and in the sea.
and yet we go on pouring poisons into the sky, cutting down the tropical rainforest, dumping our rubbish into the oceans.
to destroy other living organisms with which we share the earth.
as far as we know, the earth is the only place in the universe where there is life.
the forces that drive this lava to the surface also cause the continents to move round the globe, millimetre by millimetre, over thousands of years.
when they collide, the buckling, contorted rocks are pushed up into great mountain ranges.
but just as they rise, so are they cut down by the erosion of ice and snow and rushing water.
at the poles, where the sun's rays strike the glob only obliquely, it's bitterly cold.
here glaciers grind their way across the land, gouge out deep valleys and flow down into the sea.
at the equator, where the sun strikes the earth four-square, the land is baked.
over centuries, the amount of rain falling on it has varied.
as it diminishes, so the forests have dwindled and been replaced by grassland.
in the hot deserts, animals have evolved ways of living in oven-like temperatures without drinking any liquid whatsoever.
in the cold deserts around the poles, other creatures, with the ability to generate their own internal heat, have grown insulating coats of fur and fat so that they are not frozen to death.
human beings, one of the last species of large animal to appear on the planet, have spread with extraordinary speed to all corners of the globe.
they've be able to do so not so much because their bodies have changed to match different extremes but because they've used their skills and intelligence to exploit the adaptations of other living creatures.
the eskimos survive in the arctic by keeping themselves warm with the skins of polar bears and seals.
in the equatorial jungles of the amazon, the indians have learned where to find and how to collect everything they need to sustain themselves.
even though today they may cook in metal pots traded from the outside world, they still know how to make pottery from the clay.
in the hot deserts of southern africa, the bushmen survive droughts by tapping the stores of liquid held in the bodies of animals and the roots and the stems of plants.
immediately after the rains, however, they can collect water from natural hollows,but even that takes knowledge and skill.
indeed, human beings, for nearly all the half-million year of their existence as a species, have lived simply by gathering wild plants and hunting wild animals.
there are pistachio nuts and wild almonds and acorns and juniper berries.
and 10,000 years ago there were quite a lot of wild animals:
he began to change the environment to suit himself, and one of the places where he first did so is in that valley down there.
this is beidha in jordan, and here were found the remains of one of mankind's earliest villages.
this was no temporary encampment, but a permanent settlement with alleys and houses of stone built adjoining one another.
they were half-dug into the ground, the floor and walls were covered with a plaster of mud and lime, and in the walls there were posts which supported a roof of thatch which probably just cleared the top of the wall so that light could get inside.

there are lots of grinding stones, querns, here, in which the people ground the seeds of grass, a kind of wild barley that grows abundantly hereabouts.
they'd long since discovered that you could take such grass seeds and scatter them on the ground and produce a crop.
indeed, hey'd been doing just that with the seeds of another wild grass, wheat, for many centuries.
and now they were settled, it was inconvenient to have to scour the countryside to look for places where the grass just happened to grow.
much better to throw it onto the ground nearby the village, where they could watch the growing crop, make sure that wild animals didn't plunder it, and where it was convenient to gather.
domesticating animals must have been very much more difficult than domesticating plants.
but in fact, the first steps towards doing so were probably taken many centuries earlier when the people were still nomads.
in north america the caribou are completely wild, but here in northern scandinavia they are, to some degree at least, domesticated.
man has managed to achieve that by becoming a nomad himself.
the reindeer's winter food is a kind of lichen which they find growing beneath the snow.
when the reindeer were completely wild, young stags as they mature would wander away from their parntal group, taking a few young females with them.
but the lapps regarded the offspring of their herd as their property.
so to prevent them being lost, they castrated the young males.
the few they left unmutilated in order to breed were those they thought most likely to remain unaggresive and disinclined to wander, even when adult.
so, consciously or unconsciously, the lapps over centuries have changed the reindeer from a nervous creature living in small family groups to one that is so docile it can be kept in herds thousands strong and can be moved from one snow slope to another simply by leading
the techniques of domestication and maybe the domesticated animals themselves slowly spread westwards across europe.
7,000 years ago, the people living in france had their own herds.
and around 6,000 years ago, the techniques and even perhaps the herdsmen with some of their stock crossed the channel into britain.
they must have landed somewhere in southern england, but the land they found didn't look like this.
like nearly all the rest of britain, it was covered in trees.
there were people already here living in the forests, gathering fruit and nuts and hunting the wild animals, deer and wild oxen.
and then the teeth of their flocks kept the land open.
grazing sheep still prevent the seedlings of trees from growing and keep the pastures clear for cowslips and clover, orchids and buttercups, pipits and skylarks.
the norfolk broads, that wilderness of shallow lakes, reed beds and winding waterways, are not natural basins but vast pits, dug by men collecting peat some 600 years ago, that have subsequently flooded.
many of the upland moors of northern england and southern scotland were cleared of their forests thousands of years ago, but during the 19th century men encouraged heather to grow there by setting light to the moors by regular intervals,
for heather is the food of grouse, and men want flocks of grouse for their guns.
indeed, almost the only part of britain that remains free of human influence is the land over 2,500 feet high that is of little practical use to people.
it was scraped clean of soil by glaciers during the ice age 10,000 years ago and still remains stony and barren.
as we transformed the landscape, of britain, so we also rapidly altered the community of animals that lived here.
the last english wolf had been killed by the year 1500 and the last scottish one by the middle of the 18th century.
beavers were hunted not so much because of the damage they did to the woodlands, but because their fur was so highly valued.
but boars could be aggressive and dangerous, and the sows and particularly the piglets made good eating.
by the 17th century, there were none of these left either.
at first these creatures were carefully guarded in enclosures, for they were valued for their fur and meat.
they only became really common in the countryside during the 19th century.
the house mouse from the mediterranean may well have been the first animal of all to be brought to britain by man, for the romans found it living in british villages.
and other,much bigger animals were living around the settlements of those early british tribes.
by roman times, some had already been domesticated, and one of the early strains derived from them still survives in the cheviot hills.
this herd at chillingham was penned in a great park during the 13th century, and has lived here ever since, with scarcely any interference from human beings.
he mates with all the cows and fights every young male who challenges him.
eventually, after two or three years, he will lose and surrender his place to a younger, more vigorous animal.
having changed a wild animal into a relatively docile one by selective breeding, farmers now used the same techniques to modify the animal's body.
they wanted meat, and soon they produced a very different-looking kind of beast.
these portraits, commissioned by proud breeders 100 years ago, show clearly that the characteristics they valued in their cattle then are the same as those we prize today.
today's bulls have such stunted legs that they can't run fast to chase away a rival.
many don't even have horns with which to fight a courtship battle.
but these won't be permitted to mate with a cow anyway.
their semen will be taken from them and injected into cows by syringe, so that each of them, without moving from his stall, may father thousands of offspring on the other side of the world.
under intensive feeding, such cattle can put on two pounds a day and grow so fast that they can be profitably slaughtered within a year.
the new breeds of pig, direct descendants of the wild boars of the
european forests, now grow five times faster than their wild cousins and are ready for slaughter within only six months.
turkeys are descended from wild birds that lived in central america.
they are produced entirely by artificial insemination and have been turned into creatures that will live not in small family groups but immense congregations.
chickens,originally birds of the asian jungles, have been converted into egg-producing machines that can lay over 300 eggs a year.
the same techniques of selective breeding produced our food plants, using species from all over the world.
the potato came from the andes, where it was grown by the incas.
the pea is a european plant first cultivated by the italians in the 16th century.
the grass we call rice was domesticated in asia some 7,000 years ago, at about the same time that people were learning to cultivate wheat in the lands around the mediterranean.

as mankind's population grew, so more and more of the land had to be taken into cultivation.
today, 11% of all the arable land on earth is devoted to growing just this one species of grass.
now more than 2,000 million people depend on it, half the population of the world.
in the western world, people still prefer the kind of grass they first learned to eat during prehistory, but that too they have transformed.
today's wheat grows tall, uniform and dense, so it can be easily harvested by machines.
wheat like this can't even reproduce itself now without man's aid.
it's true that it is largely immune to pests like moulds and rusts, but moulds and rusts also evolve very quickly, naturally, into form which can attack the new strains.
so farmers have to change the strain that they grow on average about every ten years.
today, in north america, over half the wheat comes from just four strains.
were plant breeders to fail to produce new varieties from wild species, then fields like this could be devastated and the western world would starve.
to grow the vast quantity of grain needed by mankind's ever increasing population, huge areas of the most fertile lands on earth have been turned over to its cultivation.
gone are the rich communities of grasses and other small plants, that once lived here together with hundreds different kinds of insects and small creatures.
now over thousands of square miles, all other plants and all otherlarge animals, except human beings, are rigorously excluded.
12,000 people daily come to work in it, and they live in an artificial microclimate in which the temperature and humidity are controlled by computers.
the whole structure is built of artificial man-made materials, a framework of steel, with black-skinned aluminium and bronze-faced glare-reducing glass forming a shell around it.
many human beings, it seems, don't wish to live totally out of contact with other living species.
once again, people have moulded their animals to match their particular whim and fancy, altering their size, their proportions, their fur.
that man no longer hunts, his dogs must play a very different role.
cats are not, in the wild, social animals like dog but solitary hunters with strong territorial instincts.
they probably decided of their own accord to move into peoples houses and hunt rats and mice, and people accepted them because they peformed this useful service, and because they're so endearing, but to this day they have remained independent operators,
aloof and haughty, even when people have bred them to exaggerate the most cuddlesome of their characteristics.
a few other living organisms have discovered that the city suits them.
the well-drained sterility of a lava flow is not unlike that of a city street, and back in the 18th century a botanist found a yellow ragwort growing on the slopes of mount etna.
he took it back to oxford, where it was cultivated in the botanic gardens.
60 years later, the ragwort was noticed growing on the stones of college walls, but for quite a time it spread no further.
and it spread along the railways to appear in all the cities along the main lines, where it still flourishes today.
a few wild animals have also found what they need in the apparently hostile wildernesses that man has created.
the sea otter swims happily in the waters of california's harbours.
prairie dogs, driven off the prairies by ranchers, and farmers, find new homes in urban playgrounds.
english foxes have discovered a rich source of food in city litter bins and doze on suburban roofs.
and in the south-west of the united states, acorn woodpeckers continue to store their acorns in the trunks of fir trees, even when they've been turned into telegraph poles.
ospreys habitually build their nests in the very tops of trees, and telegraph poles also give them the kind of isolation they need.
church towers, to kestrels, are just as good nesting sites as rocky crags.
while kittiwakes apparently regard modern buildings as little more than particularly regular sea cliff.
swallows learned to tolerate man for the sake of the nest sites beneath his eaves, and now few nest anywhere else.
so we wage war on the animals that have come to live with us.
brown rats originated somewhere in asia and spread to europe some 300 years ago.
today, rats are found in every large city in the world.
they will eat almost anything, tackling meat with as much relish as grain and vegetables.
they gnaw electric cables, causing short circuits, and even, in consequence, fires.
they not only consume huge quantities of mankind food, but contaminate much of what they leave, and they spread disease.
so if we're not to be overrun, we have to pursue them wherever they go.
we created the city, and if it's to function properly and be neither oppressively sterile on the one hand nor infested with pests, on the other, we have to manage the living organisms that live in it,
now we're changing the whole of the globe, and we must equally accept our responsibilities of managing that, but so far we are making a very poor job of it.
we have to rid our cities of the vast quantity of rubbish we create.
new york city produces 22,000 tons of refuse every single day.
half of that is taken by barge down the hudson river and dumped on staten island.
when the land is covered, then another layer is dumped on top.
but this is a very expensive way of getting rid of our rubbish.
so we pour our waste chemicals and detergents into our rivers.
suds may or may not have been valuable in a kitchen sink.
in a river they can be lethal, killing the plants and the fish.
we spill oil into the sea, in spite of all the precautions, and set the waves aflame, and now there are patches of oil polluting even the remotest parts of the widest oceans.
to build chimneys even taller, so that the gases are blown farther away from our cities, but they don't disappear.
they're carried by the prevailing winds to countries hundreds of miles away.
the lakes of scandinavia have, over the past few decades, become more and more acid until now fish and plants can no longer survive in many of them.
in norway alone, there are now 1,800 lakes without fish, and hundreds more that are dying, shameful monuments to our carelessness and lack of concern.
when these pictures were taken in the 1950s, five and a half million of them were nesting on just one of these islands.
the guanay lives exclusively on anchovies and, oddly, excretes an unusually high proportion of the fish it eats as droppings or guano.
no rain ever falls here, so the guano wasn't washed away but accumulated on the rocks.
a 100 years ago the world realised that this was a fertiliser of unparalleled richnes
it was collected and sold for such high prices that the guanay cormorant became known as the most valuable bird in the world.
but then, in the 1950s, chemical fertilisers were developed in europe, the price of guano began to drop and the people here started to harvest not the guanay's cormorant droppings, but its food:
they were sold not to feed people but cattle, and chickens and pets.
the fishing was so intense that the anchovies were almost wiped out.
that in turn brought about the collapse of the guanay cormorants' population.
and now for every 50 cormorants that used to live here, you're lucky if you find one.
and these walls that would be filled with guano to the top inside two years, now seldom accumulate more than an inch or so.
but the cormorants shed their guano not only on the land but in the sea.
indeed, for every drop they put on land, they shed 20 into the sea.
and there it fertilises water just as it fertilises the land, promoting the growth of floating plants, plankton, the food of the anchovy.
so it's not only that if you get less anchovies you get less cormorants, and if you get less cormorants, you get less anchovies.
anchovies are food not just for cormorants but for sea fish like tuna and sea bass.
we're in the process of making similar catastrophic misjudgements, and on an even greater scale, in the world's tropical rainforests.
this, the richest of all living communities, has been of enormous value to us.
it's provided industry with rubber, craftsmen with hardwoods, and our larders with bananas, nuts, chewing gum and chocolate.
nearly a quarter of our drugs are based on animals and plants that live here.
and still we have only investigated in detail the biochemistry of less than 1% of the rain forests plants.
and here, too, live some of the most beautiful and bizarre creatures to be found anywhere on the planet.
the numbers of each different species within a given area remains remarkably stable, but over the past few centuries one species of animal outside the forest has suddenly started to increase in numbers in a way that is without parallel.
in south-east asia, as in south america and africa, thousands of extra people every year are seeking land on which to grow food for themselves and their children.
after the trees have been felled and burnt, the people sow their crops, in this case, hill ruts.
after a month, it's as tall as this, and in only five months it will be ready to be harvested, and it will have been sustained by this, the ash from the burnt forest.
but there are only enough nutrient in this to sustain one crop.
so next year the people plant not rice but this, cassava or tapioca, as it's called here.
this is a different kind of crop, a root crop, which gets its nutrients from deeper in the soil, but even this can only produce for one year.
after that, the seeds from the wild forest will come in and new plants will grow, producing a landscape like that.
but they will have to grow for eight to ten years before they are big enough to be felled and produce enough ash and nutrients to refertilise the soil and allow the people to take a second crop.
and the true forest, with all its original richnes of animals and plants, will never be restored.
the huge trees are in perpetual demand to provide timber for furniture, for constructing buildings and crates and above all for the paper for which the world has an unquenchable appetite.
so a tree that took 200 years to grow is now cut down by a chainsaw in five minutes.
the gigantic trunks, which once could only be shifted by elephants and only be extracted from forests growing on relatively flat country, are now handled with terrifying ease by modern machinery.
sometimes only the biggest trees are taken, leaving smaller ones standing, but the damage is such that the forest is largely beyond recovery.
as the international price of timber increases, so more and more of the tropical forest is destroyed.
in south-east asia, it's been reduced to about a third of its original size, and, in the world at large, an area the size of switzerland is being destroyed every year.
it' called albizia and comes from eastern indonesia, and can be planted immediately after the felling of the jungle.
in just one year it can grow to 10 or 11 metres tall, 35 feet.
this one is some two years old and in only another six years it will be ready for logging.
albizia will grow well on the relatively poor land that once supported rainforest, and many sawmills actually prefer small, easily handled logs of uniform size.
so if it were possible to produce this kind of timber on a really large scale, it might no longer be necessary to continue the extremely expensive and appallingly destructive business of felling the wild trees.
and were that to happen, then, in some parts of the world, away from the coasts, away from the rivers, in remote and mountainous country, the tropical rainforest might still survive.
the great rivers of the world can also yield riche to mankind, not simply food but power.
we've known for almost a century how to turn the force of tumbling water into electric power.
but we're getting better at it, and we're doing it on a greater scale.
this dam, at itaipu between paraguay and brazil, will harness the power of one of south america's greatest rivers, the parana.
i am walking across what was once the bed of that river.
and above me rises the biggest dam ever built by man.
it contains enough concrete to construct a whole city to house four million people.
it will make a lake which will stretch upstream for 140 kilometres.
44,000 people will have to be moved and their villages and fields submerged, fields that produce 200,000 tons of food a year, and that will create further demands on the rainforest.
even so, this major reshaping of the surface of the earth is likely to be one of the less damaging of those that mankind has inflicted on the planet.
a million trees of 50 different forset species will be planted around the lake to prevent silt from washing down into it.
the water will slowly clear and develop a population of fish.
and the turbines in the dam, will produce power without poisoning the atmosphere or leaving behind radioactive waste.
they will not deplete the earth's irreplaceable reserves of fossil fuel, and the dam will continue to produce electricity, it's estimated, for the next 300 years.
the scale of this immense construction is awe-inspiring evidence of the power that we now have in our hands with which to transform the face of the earth.
when, in prehistoric times, these stones were first put up to build this temple in the west of england at avebury, they too must have been an astonishment to the local people, an amazing demonstration of how clever, how powerful, human beings had become.
and yet that was less than 5,000 years ago, a mere moment in the history of life.
and in the brief period since then, men have gone on to learn how to build dams like itaipu, how to mould animals and plants to suit their needs or their fancies, how to transform whole landscapes.
immensely powerful though we are today, it's equally clear that we're going to be even more powerful tomorrow.
and what's more, there will be greater compulsionto use our power as the number of human beings on earth increases still further.
and just such a plan has been formulated by environmental scientists.
they called it the world conservation strategy and it rests on three very simple propositions.
that we shouldn't interfere with the basic processes of the earth on which all life depends, in the sky, on the green surface of the earth and in the sea.
and yet we go on pouring poisons into the sky, cutting down the tropical rainforest, dumping our rubbish into the oceans.
have no moral right to destroy other living organisms with which we share the earth.
as far as we know, the earth is the only place in the universe where there is life.
the known universe is ruled by the padishah emperor shaddam the fourth, my father.

they fear that putting house atreides on arrakis will hurt spice production.
for us, a small amount is enough to greatly extend our lives.

this signifies that he has had the highest conditioning against taking human life.
now, remember, the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.

(male narrator) the emperor shaddam iv with his entourage and sardaukar troops set out immediately for arrakis.

your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgment in assigning to rabban the governorship.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally.

we've just flushed out a nest of them in the open desert and the women and children overpowered some of our sardaukar.
the known universe is ruled by the padishah emperor shaddam iv, my father.
in this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice, melange.
because the guild controls all interplanetary travel, they are the highest power in the universe.
the spice also plays a very secret role in the bene gesserit sisterhood, of which i am part.
the sisterhood has been interfering with the marriages, and with the children thereof, of the great houses of the universe cleverly intermixing one bloodline with another to form the kwisatz haderach, a super being.
they plan to control the super being and use his powers for their own selfish purposes.
but now, so close to the prize, a bene gesserit woman;
jessica, the bound concubine of duke leto atreides who has been ordered to bear only daughters has given birth to a son.
i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the harkonnens.

this person, this traitor, will be worth more to us than ten legions of sardaukar!
(this is what i'll do) (to the duke and his family.)
i once told you a daughter would be conceived at a time of parting.
the voice from the outer world, bringing the holy war, the jihad, which will cleanse the universe and bring us out of darkness.
we know of choam in the universe, controlled by the emperor shaddam iv, and all the great houses of the landsraad.
we know of the bene gesserit sisterhood, where a selective breeding plan for 90 generations produced the kwisatz haderach whom they will control.
we know of the guild and the navigators power to fold space, and their control over all interplanetary travel.
house atreides took control of arrakis, 63 standard days into the year 10,191.
it was known that the harkonnens, the former rulers of arrakis, would leave many suicide troops behind.
as you know, the imperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen.
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert.
we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors 6 through 10.
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen and we have some on the airfield.
he plans on taking you on an inspection of the spice mining operation.
now, he may or may not be sympathetic to our cause.
should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, and out through this nose tube.
with a fremen suit in good working condition, life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert, sire.
(i must admit, against all) (better judgment, i like this duke.)
dr. kynes, being in the employ of the emperor, as you are, perhaps it isn't wise for you to associate too closely with us atreides.
if you can do this to the strongest of us, you're worth 10 times your weight of water.
as the leader of my people, i give you my bond.
this is your secret name in our troop, but you must choose the name of manhood, which we will call you openly.
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we have thousands of such caches, and only a few of us know them all.
and when we have enough, we shall change the face of arrakis.

she asks that you pass within and become our reverend mother.
our shared enemy, the harkonnens, are once again in control of arrakis.
stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to teach you the weirding way to crush the harkonnens.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
some thoughts have a certain sound, that being the equivalent to a form.
through sound and motion, you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs.
usul, it is time you become a sand rider and travel as a fremen.
take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch, and ride as a leader of men.

["our navigators warn you that"] ["spice production is in great danger."]
["a new fremen leader, muad'dib,"] ["has stopped spice mining on arrakis."]
your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgment in assigning to rabban the governorship.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally!
and why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people?
we've just flushed out a nest of them in the open desert and the women and children overpowered some of our sardaukar.

then they became victims and slaves of other men with machines.
finally came the great revolt - the religious crusade against the machines.
one is the bene gesserit school, which was established primarily for female students.
the function of the bene gesserit school is to carry on a selective breeding program among humans.
now the other existing school the spacing guild, or the guild emphasizes pure mathematics.
the guild's space navigators, through the use of the orange spice drug are able to fold space.
that is, to guide spaceships without moving, from one planet to another.
it is through the guild's monopolies on the economic life of the universe that makes it so powerful.
for many years the emperor shaddam iv has ruled on planet kaitan over all the great houses of the landsraad.
the great houses of the landsraad are members of the royal families who rule or govern over the major planets of the universe according to the ancient feudal system of government.
we know of the guild and their navigators' power to fold space and their control over all interplanetary travel.
we know they have they seeing eye...yet we are the secret.
i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens.
house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
then, at an appointed time, baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides.
i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops.
he wears the diamond tattoo of imperial conditioning on his forehead.
this signifies that he has had the highest conditioning against taking human life.
and these dry winds can also generate tremendous amounts of static electricity in the atmosphere.
our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on arrakis.
what you did and why you did it, we both know.
but kindness forces me to tell you there is little chance you will be the bene gesserit totality.
no way would the duke forego the art of kanly, as vendetta was known.

i'm dead to everyone unless i try to become what i may be.

the princess shall have no more of me than my name.
no child of mine nor touch, nor softness of glance, nor instant of desire.
we who carry the name of concubine, history will call us wives.
muad'dib had become the hand of god fulfilling the fremen prophecy.
our civilisation rests upon a political tripod a most unstable of structures.
a deceptive balance of power exists between the emperor the congress of royal houses, and the supposedly impartial spacing guild with its invulnerable monopoly on interstellar transport.
you see, nephews, a popular man arouses jealousy and duke leto is a very popular man.
the other great houses will be glad to get rid of him even though they would never admit it.
alone and vulnerable, at the edge of the universe valiant duke leto will finally come face to face with fear.
when i'm through, he won't know who to trust not even that bene gesserit witch he sleeps with.
they'll all be turning on one another like rats in the flood.
by the time the traitor is fully revealed the fate of atreides will already be sealed.
negotiate patience so i can demonstrate our good intentions with deeds.
if i'm lucky, they will judge all of us by you.
now, does anyone here still think that the harkonnen have just packed up and left?
gurney, i want you to make contact with the smugglers operating in the deep desert.
seems almost a sacrilege wasting one's water in a land starved for it.
well, i'm sorry we dragged you here to this dangerous place.
water is reclaimed in catchpockets, which you can draw from this tube.
properly adjusted, water loss is kept under 15 millilitres a day.
little is known about the sandworms thatinhabit the desert regions ofarrakis.
itis known that worms are drawn to the vibration and noise of mining activity.
my father sends you his enduring respect and affection, my lord duke.
the emperor wishes everyone to know of the confidence he has in house atreides.
if it weren't for the spice, no one would bother about it at all.
fortunately enough, for a water seller like you, i would guess.
he took me into his household, groomed me as his war master.
the man or woman that raises a hand against him will have it cut off by me, as a prelude to their death.
i, the baron harkonnen have decided that the great seal of our venerable house that confused and ugly chimera, the griffin no longer adequately represents the ambition of our appetites.
therefore and henceforth, in conclusion and furthermore, ergo and et cetera our ample and royal self from this day forth, and throughout the universe we shall no longer be known as house harkonnen.
i hope what you've heard will be the beginning of a friendship between us.
my people have suffered long under the rule of such as you.
i don't know, i left him to the desert, he and that gorgeous woman of yours.
my men left them to explore the beauty of the sands of arrakis.
i want leto to appreciate the beauty of what i've done to him.
i want him to know that i, baron vladimir harkonnen am the instrument of his family's demise the extinction of house atreides and the ascendance of house harkonnen.
i suppose that bene gesserit whore and her spawn have found that out, haven't they?
be sure he recalls his flimsy denials when he's face to face with death's sweet smile.
may you guard it for the tribe, preserve it against loss be generous with it in time of need.
may you pass it on in your time for the good of the tribe.
this is the water we will use to change the face of arrakis.
as my father taught us the voice from the out-world will come.
i want you to insinuate yourself among the fat baron's family.
his nephew, feyd, the narcissistic type should be especially amenable to your expert charms.
you can even give them your brother's head as a gift, if you like.
and then you will squeeze, like the grips of a vice so our treasuries become fat with the profit of spice.
these troubles on arrakis are proving difficult to manage and our time is running short.
i want you to make arrangements for a trip to giedi prime.
that's why i'm asking you for hundreds of your best young men.
i want to give them the weirding way so they can come back to you and train hundreds more.
wilderness home to the mysterious desert tribes called fremen who long for a messiah to free them from harkonnen bondage.
a messiah, a boy once known as paul now known as muad'dib.
when night falls again, we have to leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long.
we must go south into the deep desert where the demon harkonnen will not pursue us.
that paul atreides would find his revenge and the world, as we knew it, would change forever.
pick up the pace, you lazy desert rats, we have a quota to meet.
you see, this is why you need me, feyd to help you think, to help you plot.
why do you think i tolerate the incompetence of your brother?
the one thing that could possibly draw the emperor away from his imperial pleasures, out into the wastelands of the empire where he is vulnerable, where he can be destroyed.
and duke leto was just the beginning, the prelude to a move on the imperial throne itself.
i took the water of life when you were still in my womb.
no one should ever be wakened to consciousness as you were.
we'll have to hurry if we're going to save the thopter.
this is one of the things you should not have seen.
the baron is a pig, father, but he is not stupid.
rabban has lost almost 50,000 troops in the past two years.
for the sake of argument, what if there were only 20,000 people in a fremen sietch?
and what if there were only 250 such communities on the whole of arrakis?
he can't learn the ways of the sietch if he's kept apart.
there are things he must learn that extend beyond the ways of the sietch.
and as soon as you release my mother, you can read it for yourself.
look me in the eye and tell me it wasn't you.
must i prove it by calling out the naib of every sietch on the planet?
must i cripple myself by killing our strongest and wisest leaders just for the sake of some mindless ritual?
and it's time now to wipe arrakis clean of the awful harkonnen stench.
time to drive their name into the depths of hell so that we may reclaim the planet and create a paradise together!
those are changed waters hidden there in case something should happen to the reverend mother--
have the men find a pre-spice mass, as large as possible.
they know precisely where we are and what we can do.
without the spice the navigators will become blind the bene gesserit will lose all powers and all commerce among the great houses will cease!
it is my right as the baron now of house harkonnen, i demand satisfaction.
so you're what's left of the house that killed my father.
she may have my son's name, butitis we the ones who carry the name of concubine that history will call "wives."
in the year 6041, before the reign of the padishah emperors, the universe was ruled by thinking machines with human minds.
then they became victims and slaves of other men with machines.
finally came the great revolt, the religious crusade against the machines.
one is the bene gesserit school, which was established primarily for female students.
the function of the bene gesserit school is to carry on a selective breeding program among humans.
now, the other existing school, the spacing guild, or the guild, emphasizes pure mathematics.

for many years, the emperor shaddam iv has ruled on planet kaitain over all the great houses of the landsraad.
the great houses of the landsraad are members of the royal families, who rule or govern over the major planets of the universe according to the ancient feudal system of government.
two of the great houses of the landsraad are the house of atreides on planet caladan ruled by duke leto atreides and the house of harkonnen on the planet giedi prime ruled by the baron vladimir harkonnen.
in this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice melange.
this combine is the key to the wealth and political power of the universe.
it is the emperor shaddam iv who dispenses choam directorships and contracts to the various great houses of the landsraad.
the baron vladimir, with his two nephews, the count rabban and feyd harkonnen, live on the planet giedi prime.
the planet caladan is ruled by duke leto atreides, cousin to the emperor shaddam iv.
he resides in the ancient castle caladan with the bene gesserit lady jessica, and their son, the ducal heir, paul atreides.
the emperor, fearful of the duke's increasing popularity among the great houses of the landsraad has conspired with the duke's mortal enemies, the harkonnens, to destroy the house of atreides.
i have ordered duke atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the baron harkonnen.
the duke will not refuse, because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
on caladan, jessica, a member of the sisterhood and the bound concubine of duke leto atreides had been ordered to bear only daughters.
because of her love for the duke, she disobeyed and gave birth to a son, paul.
this signifies that he has had the highest conditioning against taking human life.
therefore, this makes him safe enough to attend to even an emperor.
i know, thufir, i'm sitting with my back to the door.
i heard you, doctor yueh, and gurney coming down the hall.

no way would the duke forego the art of kanly, as vendetta was known.
this then, is the duke's response as he sat writing at his desk...
"the art of kanly still has its admirers in the empire."
then he signed it, "duke leto of arrakis", knowing full well that this would annoy the baron.

hidden away within the rocks of these deserts on arrakis are a people known as the fremen.
these people, the fremen, have long held a prophecy that a super being a male child of a bene gesserit with great mental powers and courage, the kwisatz haderach, will come and lead them to true freedom.
as you know, the imperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen.
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert.
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen and we have some on the airfield.
our new army is still in training, but everything, everything is shielded.
he is the emperor's judge of the change monitoring the evacuation of the harkonnens and our taking control.
he plans on taking you on an inspection of the spice mining operation.
should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth and out through this nose tube.
with a fremen suit in good working condition, life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert, sire.
duke leto's signet ring has come to represent power and good fortune to baron vladimir harkonnen and many others.
the baron has sworn to destroy the house of atreides and steal the ducal ring for himself.
as the leader of my people, i give you my bond.
teach us this weirding way, and you both shall have sanctuary.
but you must choose the name of manhood, which we will call you openly.
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
the tremendous power of the water of life caused the premature birth of jessica's daughter, alia.
alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a reverend mother.
this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you.
some thoughts have a certain sound that being the equivalent to a form.
and remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment.
the worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible, and it will take you with it to the top.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
i'm dead to everyone unless i try to become what i may be.
only the water of life will free what can save us.
the emperor shaddam iv with his entourage and sardaukar troops set out immediately for arrakis.
sitting on his golden throne in his luxurious and fortified spaceship, the emperor ponders on his latest intelligence reports.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally.
and why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people?

it is the emperor shaddam iv who dispenses cho am directorships and contracts to the various great houses of the landsraad.
the spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe.
up until this time, the baron vladimir harkonnen has held a directorship from the emperor shaddam iv, giving him a contract to mine the spice on planet arrakis.
the baron vladimir, with his two nephews, the count rabban and feyd harkonnen, live on the planet giedi prime.
the planet caladan is ruled by duke leto atreides, cousin to the emperor shaddam iv.
he resides in the ancient castle caladan with the bene gesserit lady jessica, and their son, the ducal heir, paul atreides.
i have ordered duke atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the baron harkonnen.
the duke will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
on caladan, jessica, a member of the sisterhood and the bound concubine of duke leto atreides had been ordered to bear only daughters.
because of her love for the duke, she disobeyed and gave birth to a son, paul.
this signifies that he has had the highest conditioning against taking human life.
therefore, this makes him safe enough to attend to even an emperor.
i know, thufir, i'm sitting with my back to the door.
i heard you, doctor yueh, and gurney coming down the hall.
and these dry winds can also generate tremendous amounts of static electricity in the atmosphere.
our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on arrakis.
what you did and why you did it, we both know.
but kindness forces me to tell you there is little chance you will be the bene gesserit totality.
no way would the duke forego the art of kanly, as vendetta was known.
this then, is the duke's response as he sat writing at his desk:
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.

no other great house of the landsraad must ever know of the emperor's aid to the baron.
the entire landsraad would turn against the baron and the emperor.
and what piter did not tell you is we have control of someone who is very close, very close to duke leto.
this person, this traitor, will be worth more to us than 10 legions of sardaukar.
i won't tell you who the traitor is, or when we'll attack.
however, the duke will die before these eyes and he'll know... he'll know that it is i,
which will cleanse the universe and bring us out of darkness.
(male narrator) hidden away within the rocks of these deserts on arrakis are a people known as the fremen.
(male narrator) house atreides took control of arrakis, 63 standard days into the year 10191.
it was known that the harkonnens, the former rulers of arrakis would leave many suicide troops behind.
as you know, the imperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen.
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert.
(man on pa system) each trooper will be charged with responsibility for preserving water.
our existence as an operating army depends on these following water-saving procedures.
we have troops here headquartered underground on sub-floors 6 through 10.
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen and we have some on the airfield.
he plans on taking you on an inspection of the spice mining operation.
now, he may or may not be sympathetic to our cause.
should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth and out through this nose tube.
with a fremen suit in good working condition, life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert, sire.
the baron has sworn to destroy the house of atreides and steal the ducal ring for himself.
sorry you have to sleep so far underground, but we can't take any chances.

(monk) if you be a reverend mother, let shai-hulud judge now!

alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a reverend mother.
some thoughts have a certain sound that being the equivalent to a form.
through sound and motion, you will be able to paralyze nerves, shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy, or burst his organs.

take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride as a leader of men.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
our navigators warn you that spice production is in great danger.
a new fremen leader, muad'dib, has stopped spice mining on arrakis.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally.
and why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people?
the spacing guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over 4,000 years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space.
that is, travel to any part of the universe without moving.

i heard you, doctor yueh, and gurney coming down the hall.

one is the bene gesserit school which was established primarily for female students.
the function of the bene gesserit school is to carry on a selective breeding program among humans.
the guild's space navigators through the use of the orange spice drug, are able to fold space.
that is, to guide spaceships without moving from one planet to another.
the known universe is ruled by the padishah emperor shaddam iv.
for many years the emperor shaddam iv has ruled on planet kaitain over all the great houses of the landsraad.
the great houses of the landsraad are members of the royal families who rule or govern over the major planets of the universe according to the ancient feudal system of government.
two of the great houses of the landsraad are the house of atreides on planet caladan ruled by duke leto atreides and the house of harkonnen on the planet giedi prime ruled by the baron vladimir harkonnen.

now, he may or may not be sympathetic to our cause.
i know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.
my lady, the weapon was sent as a gift, if you should prove to be the one.
should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth and out through this nose tube.
with a fremen suit in good working condition, life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert, sire.
duke leto's signet ring has come to represent power and good fortune to baron vladimir harkonnen and many others.
the baron has sworn to destroy the house of atreides and steal the ducal ring for himself.
as the leader of my people, i give you my bond.
teach us this weirding way, and you both shall have sanctuary.
but you must choose the name of manhood, which we will call you openly.
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we have thousands of such caches, and only a few of us know them all.
and when we have enough, we shall change the face of arrakis.
the tremendous power of the water of life caused the premature birth of jessica's daughter, alia.
alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a reverend mother.
our shared enemy, the harkonnens, are once again in control of arrakis.
stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to teach you the weirding way to crush the harkonnens.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
some thoughts have a certain sound that being the equivalent to a form.
through sound and motion, you will be able to paralyze nerves,shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy, or burst his organs.
and remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment.
the worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible, and it will take you with it to the top.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
our navigators warn you that spice production is in great danger.
a new fremen leader, muad'dib, has stopped spice mining on arrakis.
the emperor shaddam iv with his entourage and sardaukar troops set out immediately for arrakis.
sitting on his golden throne in his luxurious and fortified spaceship, the emperor ponders on his latest intelligence reports.
your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgment in assigning to rabban the governorship.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally.
and why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people?
we've just flushed out a nest of them in the open desert and the women and children overpowered some of our sardaukar.
finally came the great revolt, the religious crusade against the machines.
after the great revolt, human beings were forced to develop their minds.
that is, to guide spaceships without moving from one planet to another.
it is through the guild's monopolies on the economic life of the universe that makes it so powerful.
for many years the emperor shaddam iv has ruled on planet kaitain over all the great houses of the landsraad.
the great houses of the landsraad are members of the royal families who rule or govern over the major planets of the universe according to the ancient feudal system of government.
two of the great houses of the landsraad are the house of atreides on planet caladan ruled by duke leto atreides and the house of harkonnen on the planet giedi prime ruled by the baron vladimir harkonnen.
in this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice melange.
this combine is the key to the wealth and political power of the universe.
it is the emperor shaddam iv who dispenses choam directorships and contracts to the various great houses of the landsraad.
the baron vladimir, with his two nephews, the count rabban and feyd harkonnen, live on the planet giedi prime.
the planet caladan is ruled by duke leto atreides, cousin to the emperor shaddam iv.
he resides in the ancient castle caladan with the bene gesserit lady jessica, and their son, the ducal heir, paul atreides.
the emperor, fearful of the duke's increasing popularity among the great houses of the landsraad has conspired with the duke's mortal enemies, the harkonnens, to destroy the house of atreides.
i have ordered duke atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the baron harkonnen.
the duke will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
on caladan, jessica, a member of the sisterhood and the bound concubine of duke leto atreides had been ordered to bear only daughters.
because of her love for the duke, she disobeyed and gave birth to a son, paul.
this signifies that he has had the highest conditioning against taking human life.
therefore, this makes him safe enough to attend to even an emperor.
i know, thufir, i'm sitting with my back to the door.
i heard you, doctor yueh, and gurney coming down the hall.
now, remember, the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
i know, but if it is a trap then why are we going?
no way would the duke forego the art of kanly, as vendetta was known.
this then, is the duke's response as he sat writing at his desk:
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
i won't tell you who the traitor is, or when we'll attack.
however, the duke will die before these eyes and he'll know... he'll know that it is i,
hidden away within the rocks of these deserts on arrakis are a people known as the fremen.
these people, the fremen, have long held a prophecy that a super being a male child of a bene gesserit with great mental powers and courage, the kwisatz haderach, will come and lead them to true freedom.
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen and we have some on the airfield.
our new army is still in training, but everything, everything is shielded.
he is the emperor's judge of the change monitoring the evacuation of the harkonnens and our taking control.
he plans on taking you on an inspection of the spice mining operation.
the baron has sworn to destroy the house of atreides and steal the ducal ring for himself.
sorry you have to sleep so far underground, but we can't take any chances.
as the leader of my people, i give you my bond.
teach us this weirding way, and you both shall have sanctuary.
but you must choose the name of manhood, which we will call you openly.
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we have thousands of such caches, and only a few of us know them all.
and when we have enough, we shall change the face of arrakis.
she has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.
she asks that you pass within and become our reverend mother.
this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you.
some thoughts have a certain sound that being the equivalent to a form.
usul, it is time you become a sand rider and travel as a fremen.
take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride as a leader of men.
when the spice flow stops, all eyes will turn to arrakis.
the baron and the emperor himself will be forced to deal with us.
our navigators warn you that spice production is in great danger.
a new fremen leader, muad'dib, has stopped spice mining on arrakis.
the emperor shaddam iv with his entourage and sardaukar troops set out immediately for arrakis.
sitting on his golden throne in his luxurious and fortified spaceship, the emperor ponders on his latest intelligence reports.
you've forced me to come here and set things straight, personally.
and why did you not tell me of the fighting ability of these people?
the spacing guild and its navigators, who the spice has mutated over 4,000 years, use the orange spice gas, which gives them the ability to fold space.
that is, travel to any part of the universe without moving.
i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice, thus replacing their enemies, the harkonnens.
house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.
on caladan, jessica, a member of the sisterhood and the bound concubine of duke leto atreides had been ordered to bear only daughters.
because of her love for the duke, she disobeyed and gave birth to a son.
the baron harkonnen has sworn to destroy house atreides, and steal the ducal signet ring for himself.
i know, thufir, i'm sitting with my back to the door.
now, remember, the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
i know, but if it is a trap then why are we going?
paul, i was just on my way to say goodbye to you.
i have to go on ahead, alone, i won't be seeing you for a while.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
it is by the juice of sapho that thoughts acquire speed, that lips acquire stains, that stains become a warning.
it is by will alone i set my mind in motion.
the entire landsraad would turn against the baron and the emperor.
put the pick in there, pete, and turn it round real neat.
and what piter did not tell you is we have control of someone who is very close, very close to duke leto.
this person, this traitor will be worth more to us than 10 legions of sardaukar.
house atreides took control of arrakis 63 standard days into the year 10191 .
it was known that the harkonnens, the former rulers of arrakis would leave many suicide troops behind.
as you know, the imperium has never been able to take a census of the fremen.
everyone thinks that there are but few wandering here and there in the desert.
should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth and out through this nose tube.
with a fremen suit in good working condition, life can be sustained for weeks, even in the deep desert, sire.
the rest of the troops are stationed in arrakeen, and we have some on the airfield.
our new army is still in training, but everything, everything is shielded.
as the leader of my people, i give you my bond.

and when we have enough, we shall change the face of arrakis.
she has been calling through space and time, for you to come and let her rest.
she asks that you pass within, and become our reverend mother.
the tremendous power of the water of life caused the premature birth of jessica's daughter, alia.
alia was born with all the knowledge and powers of a reverend mother.
this is part of the weirding way that we will teach you.
some thoughts have a certain sound, that being the equivalent to a form.
i'm dead to everyone unless i try to become what i may be.
only the water of life will free what can save us.
through this holy anointing, may the lord pardon all your sins.
in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit.
i don't know what you've heard, but i'm doing my job.
i wonder how many times that phrase was used at the nuremberg trials.
you look very comfortable, why don't you stay there for a while?
and while you're down there, why don't you clean my boots?
this is the first mating between our race and an alien species.
it's too important a decision for a 17-year-old and her father.
you've just seen the real broadcast, given by john the visitors' supreme commander.
i know i speak for peace-loving people with whom i'm grateful that the visitors have given to us far more than they've asked from us.

they must have some achllies' heel, something we can use against them.
we need to find out where the people are who disappeared.
trooper units 1 4 and 1 5 to the red room.
trooper unit 36 and technician 3 1 to squad shuttle in bay 1 2, level 1.
isolated incidence of violence mostly explosions at visitor installations are being reported all across los angeles.
they may be part of an effort by the scientific conspiracy.
... and1 0,000others are all prisoners of your " friends. "
don't tell me you don't know what went on in this town all week!
but i must take this stand for what i know is right.
you may think that an old man wouldn't be afraid to die...
so far, i'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark.
but we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us.
look, man, if we lose, the whole shooting match is lost.
we're all you got between the life you had and the one you're not gonna have.
i trust you will have the president ready for the interview soon.
it would be much easier if i were supervising the conversion.
it's not as simple to tap their minds as it is their water resources.
one mistake and our dr. walker will be a babbling idiot.
i've just been given permission by diana, a trusted aid of john's to make an exclusive announcement to all not fortunate enough to be here in person.
tonight john will give this planet an infallible vaccine which resists all forms of cancer.
because it gives us a chance to repay the hospitality the people of earth have shown us.
you've all tried to help us collect the resources we need to save the people of our planet.
when teacher refers to you, you shouldn't turn your back to him, and go away like this now.
because it may happen that he'll stuck your head in the toilet, for instance.
i can't wish you good morning, and you all know why.
last night, in this place where he lived and worked, unreservedly giving himself to you and his profession,
the teacher damir blagojevic 'beli' was killed in a cruel and insidious way.
in memory and our respect for him, we will hold a minute of silence.
he was under arrest twice - first in naples, then in milano.
no, twice in naples, then once in milano, and then he was taken here.
prior to my marriage only, i came to know that the person..
..who is going to be my husband, is a man of control.
and no other male can see it, except me, does it make sense?
do you think i dress up to show it to all the males?
till now, i do not have a woman in my team.
off course, i can not be assured that i have got one.
of course it is also true that if a small number..
.. of people do this it will create no impact at all.
and if you try to make them work for the nation,
you have no way than to make them addicted, is not it?
you do not like that nikhil helps me by giving money.
so, now you can understand..that you are not a stranger to me.
i have nothing to lose or gain from anybody else's safety.
we are going to kolkata because it is not safe here.

(male narrator) in 1972, a crack commando unit... was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government... they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them... maybe you can hire the a-team.
these boys are never gonna beat... a triple-a school like banning high.
yes, yes, i think face has gotten in over his head.
a scrimmage is a time to try and work out timing.
it is considered advisable, if in a scrimmage... you don't kill your own quarterback!
all right... all right, he wants power football... we'll give him power football.
you know, hannibal... well, if you just look down there at the baracan one... firing up those little buggers... he is turning boys into men.
he's gonna get me a job in dino's new horror film.
now, you guys get in the van and i'm gonna get face.
if you want a little help, we'll give it the weekend... but you'd have to lay low and stay out of sight.
we promised to sing at a benefit... for a children's hospital here in l.a.
you will see that these documents have been notarized... and executed consistent with the legal procedures of the state of california.
i've taken the liberty of making copies for you... assuming you are dave luna.
note that this gives us full power of attorney... over all decisions concerning the bells.
including, but not restricted to, the selection of songs... wardrobe, publicity, ad infinitum... and et cetera, and so forth.
we can be reached at this number, if there are any questions.
this is a high pressure business, mr. diamond... and my associates are about to show you what happens to the losers.
see, a trick i've found in sexually stressful situations... is to focus your mind on something... of a completely different nature.
take that road and track magazine and look at those cars.
the phone number i gave them is traceable and it leads to this apartment.
i've taken another apartment down the hall with a good view of the parking lot.
and we're gonna put some stuff around here, just for the fun of it.
listen, if you girls have any questions at all... about anything that we're doing here... please, feel free to ask.
why you gotta jibber-jabber all the time... filling my ears with this nonsense?
well, i just want you to know... that i think that you are one stupendous, mud-sucking wonder.
what's a big shot like you doing terrorizing these four little orphan girls?
might i invite you to join me in the car, sir?
seems to me i seen your picture... a time or two, only it weren't in fortune.
no, seems to me i seen it on the wall somewhere.
you don't by any chance happen to know chicken in a breadbox, do you?
you know, you'd do better, son... if you didn't take such an offhand approach with me.
well, i just want to make sure... that the bells remain the exclusive property of lunar records... in that, i am 100% silent owner of that company.
by the way, i understand... that you've acquired power of attorney for the bells.
i just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
let's say i was to be willing to take you off the table... for a goodly sum, that is.
[ no love you find gonna thrill you like mine [
[ guess you can tell i could love you so well [
[ your peace of mind it's so easy to find [
[ i know that you've got to be lonely, too [
now that they're here, they can stay backstage till the performance tonight.
there's almost nothing westerland can do to keep them from going on.
now, lest you get me wrong, i sacrifice this boy if things don't go my way.
the bells re-sign with lunar records... and you nullify your contract with them.
this i get from a man... whose defense allowed 46 points in the last three quarters?
with all the flakes we meet, it's really nice to finally meet some real... (both) men.
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.

now, the pulling guard and the right halfback... are gonna sweep right.
billy rey'll pump once to the right and then fire right back at you.
and i, for one, am beginning to see him in another light.
because what i am seeing down there on that field... i have never seen before.
as soon as i find out who i am, you'll be the first to know, jenny.
does dave luna have a place he hangs out around here in l.a.?
john was about five miles behind them, and then they ditched the car.
and then we sat on it all night and they didn't come back.
they happen to be laying down tracks for a new album.
i got a pressing company climbing up my neck... [intercom buzzing] and we got release schedules, and you lose the whole group?
well, we have been commissioned by the bells... to act on their behalf.
you will see that these documents have been notarized... and executed consistent with the legal procedures of the state of california.
i've taken the liberty of making copies for you... assuming you are dave luna.
note that this gives us full power of attorney... over all decisions concerning the bells.
and if i catch even a glimpse of you two guys again... you'll be taking your meals through a tube.
you're going to have to have better help than you had yesterday.
well, i don't want to be pushy about this... so let's say that this agreement goes into full effect... at 9:27.
that will give you about 40 seconds to get the spit off your chin... and stop breathing through your mouth.
i've taken another apartment down the hall with a good view of the parking lot.
and we're gonna put some stuff around here, just for the fun of it.

you are a man that somebody can admire... and i look up to your goodness.
a recluse, an eccentric madman... the baron of the business world.
what's a big shot like you doing terrorizing these four little orphan girls?
might i invite you to join me in the car, sir?
being i got a proposition for you... and i hate like blazes to shout it out through a half-open window.
then why don't we cut the down-home wisdom and get to business?
well, i just want to make sure... that the bells remain the exclusive property of lunar records... in that, i am 100% silent owner of that company.
by the way, i understand... that you've acquired power of attorney for the bells.
i just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
one of the really interesting aspects of being a fugitive is... that there are so few things you can spend money on.
now, if i were a crook like you... and i wanted a million of your dollars, mr. westerland... i'd sit down and figure out how to rip off one of your banks... and i'd have the money by nightfall.
i suspect most of your life you've had your own way, mr. westerland.
so i've arranged for you to experience a lesson in humility.
[ no one you see gonna please you like me [
[ no love you find gonna thrill you like mine [
[ the harder you try it seems the less you get by [
[ your peace of mind it's so easy to find [
you know, face, i thought they were gonna keep us... from getting the girls to the theater.

i dreamt that you were injured and that i saved your life.
i was very small and i was speeding in my ambulance.
we have reached the government with clean hands and no compromises.
i will show also the clarity of my purposes... as my interest is to comply with my mission.
there's one doctor in each floor and hundreds waiting for one of us to die.
there's only one cook for the whole hospital... who does nothing but complain.
i've met a pal of yours who's come to canada... a young doctor who admires you.
i do it mostly to keep my mind busy... and i like the company.

she did, the minute they got ashore, but it didn't work.
cos i don't see you just decorating little joints and little apartments in the suburbs.
i see you doing your gold walls and your turkish pillows... and all that garbage in hotels and embassies and stuff.
what did i do to deserve this that i'm here now?
you were really quick to come up with that name so fast.
my body went into shock when they stuck that gun in you.
i thought they're gonna kill us, i'm gonna be dead... and milton is coming to the waldorf soon.

time for finding yourself a year older, not an hour richer.
if i could work my will every idiot who has "merry christmas" on his lips should be boiled in his own pudding and buried with a stake of hollies through his heart.
but i've always thought of christmastime as a good time a kindlier, forgiving, charitable time when men and women see their one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely to their fellow creatures.
though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver into my pocket i do believe that it has done me good.
i was afraid from what you said that something had stopped them in full force.
a few of us are endeavoring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat, drink, food and warmth.
since you asked me what i wish, that is my answer.
i don't make merry myself at christmas and i can't afford to make idle people merry.
you might be a bit of bad beef or a blot of mustard or a fragment of an underdone potato.
there's more of gravy than a grave about you, whatever you are.
it is required of every man that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellow men and travel far and wide.
and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death.
time enough to sample the punch when you're old and fat like me.
i best partner my wife before that young scamp goes dancing off with her.
he said he hoped the people in church saw him because he was a cripple and that it might be pleasant for them to remember on christmas day who it was that made lame beggars walk and blind men see.
it seems to me that tim is getting stronger every day.
if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my species will find him here.
but if he is to die, then let him die and decrease the surplus population.
so perhaps in the future you will hold your tongue until you have discovered what the surplus population is and where it is.
it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor man's child.
i'm in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come?
you'll show me the shadows of the things that haven't happened but will happen in the time before us.
are the things you have shown me the shadows of the things that will be?
or are they the shadows of the things that may be only?
and bring them around so that i may tell them where to deliver it.
come back with the man and i'll give you a shilling.
he became as good a friend, as good a master as good a man as the old city knew.
and to tiny tim, who did not die, he was a second father.
it was said of ebenezer scrooge that he kept christmas well.
if any man alive possessed the knowledge may that be truly said of us, and all of us.
this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of this story i am going to relate.
on christmas night all christians sing to hear the news the angels bring
what's christmas but a time for buying things for which you have no need, no money?
time for finding yourself a year older, not an hour richer.
if i were to hold back half a crown from your pay for it you'd think yourself ill-used.
but you don't think me ill-used when i pay a day's wages for no work.
and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death.
it is doomed to wander through the world and witness what it cannot share.
is its pattern strange to you or would you know the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself?
it was as full, as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago.
you put enough of yourself into your work, and i have nothing but praise but you're young.
there's more to life than books of cloth and musty old ledgers.
i best partner my wife before that young scamp goes dancing off with her.
what a difference it makes, ebenezer, to travel the rough road of life with the right female to help bear the burden.
well the time of year, and the nature of my business.
it's important now that i use my time and opportunities wisely.
if there had been no understanding between us would you seek me out and try to win me now?
a dowerless girl with nothing but myself to bring to a marriage?
well, jacob marley where is this spirit of which you spoke so glibly?
you did say at the stroke of two, didn't you, jacob?
lord, we thank you for the bounty you have placed before us.
we thank you for this day of love and joy for allowing us to be together, to share with each other and with you the fullness of our hearts on this special day.
love and joy come to you and a merry christmas too
and god bless you and send you a happy new year
love and joy come to you and a merry christmas too
and god bless you and send you a happy new year
the consequences of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm.
i'll give him the chance every year whether he likes it or not.
are you the spirit which jacob marley foretold would visit me?
i'm in the presence of the ghost of christmas yet to come?
if he wanted to keep them after he was dead, the wicked old screw why wasn't he more natural in his lifetime?
he'd have had someone to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying there gasping out his last.
i think he walks slower than he used to these last few evenings.
yet i've seen him walk home with with tiny tim on his shoulders very fast.
say that i may change these things by an altered life.
i'll honor christmas in my heart and keep it all the year.
come back with the man and i'll give you a shilling.
come back in less than five minutes, i'll give you half a crown!
but i possessed neither the courage nor the optimism perhaps the depth of feeling that you two have.
thirdly, if the invitation to dine is still in force i accept.
and to tiny tim, who did not die, he was a second father.

i didn't know you were coming, please forgive me sir are you going to kneel down and show your respect
sir, please forgive me sir yes your forgiven, i'm not that small-minded
my lord, is there anything you want me to do here
the emperor believes shaolin is expanding fast and may cause trouble what should i do?
i hope that all of you will put aside your differences to promote martial arts
this year we have raised all of the prizes, so good luck to you all
now young man, this is for you, come on drink up!
listen my friends, to this tale this is a story of victory
but a man came to disturb their peace he was known as dragon head
he controlled gambling dens and brothels, and was a threat to the people
he took our factory by force and killed our master of this martial school
his son went to study at shaolin, and swore to come back and get his revenge!
at last the master did return, amidst the sounds of drums in canton
the golden lions waved their tails and paid respect to their ancestors
just as they were about to get the prize something hit the young mistress
dragon head was pleased to see this as he thought he would then get the prize
the gods send help from the heavens, the two finger strike made a hole in the jar
dragon head was angry and started a fight, fong sze yu beat them all off
shaolin kung fu is number one, dragon head is just a little worm
everybody gave three cheers for the winner and a feast was held to celebrate
your extremely nice to me, i think you must be after something
your right brother, we want to find out about a long lost style, the spinning palm
therefore one has to be an expert in body weight control in order to do this
perhaps brother sze yu with his experience will be able to learn it
your right and very clever, i hope fong sze yu will turn up soon...
dragon head it looks like your plan worked, and we have a big catch too!
i guess this is a chance for you to check out its power!
i understand you are going to use the girl to lure them into a trap!
well they are very suspicious, how do we go about it?
sir you can tell dragon head to challenge them to a duel!
i think we should discuss with brother sand earth first, see what he thinks!
the white gorge is a sacred area a priest may lay
she is the only one i have, i must get her out of there!
you go on then, i will come later with our other men and do our best for you
sze yu, we are the roots of evil all evil comes from men's minds
so remember buddha says if you let nothing worry you, then nothing can worry you
fong sze yu, your a brave man i didn't think you would come
yes i've come, but your not a man your a god damn coward!
i think the graft is going to be just fine, al.
after a while it'll start itching, but you can't scratch it.
i know that this is difficult for you at this time.
and i know it's hard for you to come here like this.
every time some old lady would walk by, we'd point at billy penn.
they'd look up, and they'd see billy with his dong sticking up.
remember that statue of billy penn on top of city hall?
how, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard-on?
they'll give the birds a heart attack, scaring them all day.
let's get this door closed so they don't get out here.
when it wants to fly... the slightest flicker sends it up to the sky.
you must feel that air has substance and can hold you up.
i'm starting to worry i'll never fly the way i've been going.
as scary as a bird's life must be... at least they have that.
it occurs to me... that all i did was put two birds in the aviary.
food and water and nothing else, and now there are four of them.
you know, when that shell went off in my face... i could smell burning flesh.
and it was crazy... because the smell was so sweet... so familiar.
and every so often... go crazy... and run up the wall... and spit!
and throw shit at them, like the loony across the hall!
we'll take them off when you get back from seeing your friend.
then i'll see if you got everything back in the right place.
remember that statue of billy penn on top of city hall?
how, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard-on?
it's all here, the whole thing, how he fell off the gas tank.
there's a picture showing where he jumped and an "x" where he landed!
your mom puts down poison and knocks off half of them.
but those blue bars get smart and still keep coming back.
how, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard- on?
if i'm going to learn, i'll have to watch them closer.
right down here, on this same street, they got this ride...
expectant mothers, the young go see the greatest attraction in the world today.
they'll give the birds a heart attack, scaring them all day.
let's get this door closed so they don't get out here.
the first day i saw perta i knew she was special.
the way she took to the air like it was hers.
you mess around with him and you'll wind up in a concrete shirt at the bottom of the river!
i don't want to go to the police but i got a receipt of purchase from mr. russo at the junkyard!
i just want to make it through with some dignity, like everybody else.
of course, if there was any real dignity, there wouldn't be any sex.
a bird can flap its wings and not move an inch.
when it wants to fly the slightest flicker sends it up to the sky.
i had a heck of a time getting her to let you build the aviary.
she's worried about what it's costing for the feed the lumber and whatnot.
once they find out how much it eats and shits, they dump it cross-town.
soon you got packs of wild dogs, big, hungry and not so cute.
you got my dog in the back of your truck, you little shit!
if it's his dog, you should stop and give it to him.
it occurs to me that all i did was put two birds in the aviary.
food and water and nothing else, and now there are four of them.
you get so hot with doris, you forgot to put your clothes on?
if your old lady saw you like this, she'd have a stroke.
and it was crazy because the smell was so sweet so familiar.
then i realized that it was my own skin that was frying.
i think the graft is going to be just fine, al.
after a while it'll start itching, but you can't scratch it.
i know that this is difficult for you at this time.
and i know it's hard for you to come here like this.
every time some old lady would walk by, we'd point at billy penn.
they'd look up, and they'd see billy with his dong sticking up.
remember that statue of billy penn on top of city hall?
how, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard-on?
they'll give the birds a heart attack, scaring them all day.
let's get this door closed so they don't get out here.
when it wants to fly... the slightest flicker sends it up to the sky.
you must feel that air has substance and can hold you up.
i'm starting to worry i'll never fly the way i've been going.
as scary as a bird's life must be... at least they have that.
it occurs to me... that all i did was put two birds in the aviary.
food and water and nothing else, and now there are four of them.
you know, when that shell went off in my face... i could smell burning flesh.
and it was crazy... because the smell was so sweet... so familiar.
and every so often... go crazy... and run up the wall... and spit!
and throw shit at them, like the loony across the hall!
we'll take them off when you get back from seeing your friend.
then i'll see if you got everything back in the right place.
the bandages are a little hard to get used to, sir.
when the doctor-- the major said one of the things they had to do was give me a steel jaw i thought, "great!

it's all here, the whole thing, how he fell off the gas tank.
there's a picture showing where he jumped and an "x" where he landed!
your mom puts down poison and knocks off half of them.
but those blue bars get smart and still keep coming back.
how, from certain angles, it looked like he had a hard- on?
if i'm going to learn, i'll have to watch them closer.
right down here, on this same street, they got this ride...
expectant mothers, the young go see the greatest attraction in the world today.

i have been through every one-horse shithole... for a two-hundred-mile radius.
you should've seen the river i had to traverse this morning.
so don't give me any of your crap, you gutless wonder.
you have been an embarrassment to me and the whole family... ever since you were born.
i was thinking about something you said-- about having more to bargain with.
the best way to help your sister is to get that treasure... and then you can waltz into cartagena.

in fact, over that mountain the river becomes wild. "muy peiigroso."
"l've lost her", ralph, is gonna get the most teeth broken in your mouth.
if they're hiking through the jungle, there's nothin' l can do about it.
you shoulda seen the river i had to traverse this morning.
so don't give me any of your crap, you gutless wonder.
i could barely wait to feel the warmth of his touch.
at the moment his lips met mine, i knew that we would never again be apart.
gloria, why do we always have to have this same conversation?
because i like you, joan, and i hate to see you all alone, waiting for somebody who's not gonna show up.
500,000 a year, up to my neck in tits and ass.
lady, i hope you're taking notes, cos you got a real-live death scene going on right here.
i knew that from the moment i laid eyes on you.
oh, was that the first moment when i saved your ass?
birds just seemed to be a fast way to get what i wanted.
and a hell of a lot healthier than dealing in this crap.
we have colourful tile roofs, typical cobblestone streets, and very rich fields.
- i was born here, and so was my poor family.
of all the things you can say to me right now,
"i've lost her", ralph, is gonna get the most teeth broken in your mouth.
you shoulda seen the river i had to traverse this morning.
so don't give me any of your crap, you gutless wonder.
that was the end of grogan, the man who killed my father, raped and murdered my sister, burned my ranch, shot my dog and stole my bible.
but if there was one law of the west, bastards had brothers who seemed to ride forever.
gloria, why do we always have to have this same conversation?
because i like you, joan, and i hate to see you all alone, waiting for somebody who's not gonna show up.
a very powerful man with his own private army to back him up.
and whether he calls himself dr zolo, minister of antiquities, or colonel zolo, deputy commander of the secret police, he's still just a butcher.
whatever's at the end of this map is your sister's life.
now, we get our hands on this el corazén, then you got something to bargain with.
birds just seemed to be a fast way to get what i wanted.
and a hell of a lot healthier than dealing in this crap.
"i've lost her", ralph, is gonna get the most teeth broken in your mouth.
if they're hiking through the jungle, there's nothin' i can do about it.
i have been through every one-horse shithole for a 200-mile radius.
you shoulda seen the river i had to traverse this morning.
so don't give me any of your crap, you gutless wonder.
you have been an embarrassment to me and the whole family ever since you were born.
i knew that from the first moment i laid eyes on you.
oh, is that the first moment when i saved your ass?
birds just seemed to be a fast way to get what i wanted.
and a hell of a lot healthier than dealing in this crap.

mildred, i thought we made plans to take mr. steele to dinner.
well, where i come from, that's called three's a crowd, if you know what i mean.
i'll tell you what kind of grudge i had against myron.
i spent eight years of my life perfecting the formula for flower power.
i would have loved to have seen his face just one last time.
well, it appears he robbed you of even that small consolation, doctor.
oh, how i long for the days when our cases truly puzzled me.
of course, on the other hand, the sooner we solve this case... the sooner we'll be able to address ourselves to more pressing matters.
myron is dead, and nothing i can do will change that.
i just have to stop feeling sorry for myself... and get on with the rest of my life, like it or not.
if he was half as obsessed about his breath as his intimates were... then the murderer obviously thought he had a foolproof plan.
and since myron didn't fall for it, he simply adopted plan "b" and shot him.
mr. fitts, i'm sorry you had to hear the news like this.
- i'm sure it must come as a bit of a shock.
but then, upon leaving the scene of the crime... you encountered two singing telegram girls.
knowing that they could identify you, you followed them and tried to kill them in my office.
two weeks from now, we won't be able to walk down the street without bodyguards.
we'll have a house in the hills, a billboard on sunset-
it means we go back... not to square one, but to square three.
fitts shot myron, all right, but only after he'd been poisoned.
yes, well, i'd venture to say it's safe to get up now, laura.
mr. steele, this is going to sound crazy... but i don't think those shots were meant for us.
i'm sure our man is scaling another high-rise as we speak.
are you really going to send these poor, defenseless girls out to face lord knows what?
i don't know how much more of this i can bear.
in this business, mr. steele, you take the lemon with the meringue.
yes, and i'm afraid he's determined neither one of you will live to identify him.
does that mean we have to stay cooped up here till you find out who that guy is?
he stole it from me, put his name on it and made a fortune.
i empathize with you, dr. flowers... working the trenches while a figurehead basks in the limelight.
i would say brenda and chip are probably worth about $25 million more today... than they were yesterday.
find the man who owns this atomizer... and i'll show you a man whose breath smells of murder.
i married eliott, my first husband... the saturday after i graduated from high school.
myron and i were married less than a month after my divorce from eliott.
i heard him tell his lawyer that he'd been betrayed by his own flesh and blood.
he said he had vipers in his nest, and he was going to clear them out once and for all.
myron had plans- ambitious plans- for chip... but he never approved of his relationship with nancy, thought she was too common.
naturally, chip tried to keep his relationship with her a secret... but they're kids, and when kids are in love-
and so, returning to your father's office to retrieve the poisoned atomizer... you had no alternative but to shoot him when you realized your original plan had failed.
but then, upon leaving the scene of the crime... you encountered two singing telegram girls.
i mean, his father cut him out of his will... because he disapproved of chip's liaison with nancy.
you have got one minute to get out of this house.
i got a deal in turnaround here, and metro wants to take an option on it.
and i think teri and toni would be absolutely perfect for the part.
if it wasn't for you, i'd probably still be working... in my brother's auto body shop in north hollywood.
- well, i guess we make a pretty good team, huh?
fitts shot myron, all right, but only after he'd been poisoned.
why would you poison him if you were going to shoot him?
"that's my guard's whistle. i must go." and he puffed off importantly.
edward and james passed the field where james had had his accident.
the driver tied newspaper round the hole and james pulled the train.
but he was a sadder and wiser james and took care to never bump coaches again.
at least they didn't bring that sawed off nerd, rumble, along.
-i don't know you and yet i feel a kinship, kinship.
-but our enemy is on the ground, not in the sky.
-but our weapon is in the clouds, and bombshell's explosion has brought it to us, us!
i have the most powerful weapon of all, floating in the sea!
when the refinery goes up, the autobots will never know what hit them!

no, i came her for two reasons, and that was the first.

when they landed in lavallois, they dumped on me, augagneur, born at the 18 anatole france st.
that's when i decided i'd send them back by express post to krautland, or wherever.

a true story of two noble brothers, of the bond of sympathy that united them, and of their devotion to a just cause.
their daring adventures have been too long unremembered, perhaps because they did not seek personal glory.
their humble upbringing could not disguise the fact that these were no ordinary peasants.
they betrayed their origins by a bond of sympathy so extraordinary that each could feel the joy or pain of the other in his place.
hey, this is not going to be so bad after all.
man, this ain't one of those prisons where they cut your hair?
we thank you for allowing us the opportunity to show our people how real men die.
you may kill us, fuckaire, but you will never kill the revolution.
but even as the brothers made their bold ascendancy to heroism, the missing pieces of their complex destiny were now falling into place.
their manly virtues were observed by the queen's lovely daughters, who hid their affections behind a veil of royal upbringing.

this is a story torn from the romantic and violent pages of history.
a true story of two noble brothers, of the bond of sympathy that united them, and of their devotion to a just cause.
their daring adventures have been too long unremembered, perhaps because they did not seek personal glory.
but, on this bright summer day in pan's, fate is about to take a hand.
their humble upbringing could not disguise the fact that these were no ordinary peasants.
they betrayed their origins by a bond of sympathy so extraordinary that each could feel the joy or pain of the other in his place.
i remember one time at this restaurant i used to work at...
i mean, own... they had a contest to see who could eat the most.
it has to be exact, you see, because of the light on your face.
now you entertain your prisoners and then i'm going to give it to you.
they knew the princesses would throw themselves in the path of love if given the chance.
but even that temptation did not spoil the supreme poise with which they carried off the masquerade.
because if that's the big dipper, that means the north star is...
let's see, you take the bottom star from the cup, you align it with the handle, and...
my brother, there are some things that you cannot run away from.
if this revolution is to survive, men like me must fight.
my only regret on this wonderful afternoon is that the other corsican brother, the revolutionary, is already dead.

"is that a wart in your pocket, or are you just glad to see me?"
so it came to pass that france was delivered from tyranny and emerged into a new age of freedom.

yeah, just before we... put out the fire, the gypsies stole us!
and then they... and then they took us across the river.
and i was still hungry... but they had to close the restaurant.
i'm so hungry i could eat a bowl of lard... with a hair in it.
fuckaire, we thank you... for allowing us the opportunity... to show our people how real men die.
you may kill us, fuckaire... but you will never kill the revolution.
hope of liberation floated in the air... but even as the brothers made... their bold ascendancy to heroism... the missing pieces of their complex destiny... were now falling into place.
their manly virtues were observed... by the queen's lovely daughters... who hid their affections... behind a veil of royal upbringing.

the only thing i want to say... is you've kept me in a dungeon... and you beat me, and you tortured me... and you even kissed me.
and i want these people to know... the only thing you've really done... is made me really, really hungry... and that's not nice to do to a mexican.

17 years ago she formed the kahn foundation and started a school...
it's a normal school on the surface, but it's really a training ground for espers.
currently, lady kahn... has an army of over 200 fully trained espers.
we investigated her for five years... and that's the only information we were able to get.
because of this, your kind has been persecuted in the past.
however, the day will come when the universe is under your governance.
just a few days ago, professor ramses left to do research at kahn university lab.
i am the new president, now that he works in their labs.
she stopped making public appearances after the accident - why do you suppose that is?
it's rumored that she is actually dead... and that she programmed her master computer to run her business.
to create our own planet for espers, we must rise and fight, jessica.
those fools who treat us like monsters will be a valuable bargaining chip for us.
manu, can you use your telepathy to track them back to earth?
as long as i don't collapse from fatigue, i will do what i can.
they checked to confirm that the federation's 14th star fleet was immobilized.
the hell diver legions instigated riots and crushed the royal government in one fell swoop.
there is no doubt that a powerful organization is supporting these coups.
the fire of rebellion is spreading, and now as many as 5 planets have raised the anti-federation flag.
the yellow regions are in rebellion, while the blue regions remain loyal to the federation.
that crazy witch is trying to involve the entire system in her war!
this is the same man that killed professor ramses and two of his guards.
we thought no one could shatter yan and ewan's illusions, but he did it.
if there is something she doesn't want to remember, she can will herself to forget.
federation army hospital if there is something she doesn't want to remember, she can will herself to forget.
so in amelia's case, she has amnesia because she wants to forget something?
i don't think so; we couldn't find any indications of that in her subconscious.
back when lady kahn was first beginning to gather espers she happened to come across jessica fifteen years ago.
it was then that lady kahn devised a plot to kill me.
somebody disguised himself as me and killed jessica's parents so that she would think i did it.
her hatred was amplified in order to draw out her powers.
a kingdom of insanity that existed only inside your blackened heart!
do you have any idea how many friends i've lost for your so-called "utopia"?
he's also believed to be the u. n. commisioner for refugees.
now all of the firms in the world know that now dimitri has thrown a new ball into the game.
the professor apparently incorporated the amino acid enzyme in the dna sequence.
this leads to the alteration of the entire genetics of all known useful plants.
besides, i heard that a feverish search at all levels... for his formula in underway.
should they be found, it will be the end of our research project.
you could have terminated her at any time once the professor went to norway.
or you hoped that her good relations with the professor could still be useful to your institute?
rumour has it the norwegian professor olav gunström succeeded in developing a formula that alters the genetics of plants.
tomatoes, wheat, even pineapples and bananas grow at altitudes of 1400m.
once you traveled to norway, my international friends, competitors, there recognized the sign.
whenever you come out of cover, there's something for the firm to get.
he's also believed to be the u. n. commisioner for refugees.
now all of the firms in the world know that now dimitri has thrown a new ball into the game.
should they be found, it will be the end of our research project.
- this giovanna castelli... should never have been allowed in our institute.
we were blood brothers promised to be loyal forever forever yeah yeah
tick-tick the clock ticks away and time goes by the clock ticks away
we grew up forgot all our promises maybe some day maybe some day yeah yeah
we will remember the promises made to each other maybe some day maybe some day yeah yeah
he'd sail to hawaii and kiss the local girls in banana skirts.
we finally have the opportunity to see how luxurious it actually is.
he can write you a poem for any kind of anniversary.
but like all great poets he can't get up in the morning.
here are my mum and my dad who put me into this world love, kisses and flowers sunshine and sweet memories life is long happiness short happy is he who gives it away
here is my best friend lots and lots of silhouettes but this one isn't finished yet the light of my life domine et sanctus life is long happiness short happy is he who gives it away
somebody has to do it and, in this case, that's me.
i liked it better before - when it was just the two of us.
... so we'll just ask the gods for some nice weather ah, oh, yeah-ah
we are many who would die for a place in haveje my wife would give her left eye for a beach promenade in haveje
so we'll just ask the gods for some nice weather yes we'll just ask the gods for some nice weather
ah, oh, yeah-ah yes we'll just ask the gods for some nice weather ah, oh, yeah-ah
from the haveje boys we'll move on to our next guests:
haveje's unofficial mayor, arnold jensen and the leader of the moderate party, kaj bumand.
it is scandalous that we're unemployed and it's asocial that we don't have a place to live.
we can't afford to pay rent - so we move into an empty factory.
i'm sure of that no matter what you say oh susan skye blue guess what i'm thinking
i would like to promise you a long and happy life but i'm no fortune teller
if people say things are lousy don't believe them things have always been this way and they will remain like this don't you reckon?
the sky and the stars and the oceans are on each side of you right now say yes or no
junkies die all over the city, but you don't pull down the city.
look, you've been reported and i'm here to tell you to clear out.
after a few hours with such a body, what would it matter?
we've got 48 hours to recover airwolf or they're sending in the marines.
airwolf can exceed mach 1 from sea level to 65,000 feet.
(marella) the crew consists of an in-flight systems specialist in the electronic data command center to monitor turbine temperatures, fuel and lubricant pressure, rotor synchronization, all onboard flight systems.
he also has a duplicate flight system control in case the aircraft commander becomes incapacitated.
(marella) and finally, the aircraft commander, who's responsible for positive flight control, target acquisition, and weapon system selection.
you can only keep the lid on testing and development for so long.
and if the firm puts airwolf in the field, it'll leak to congress in a week.
and they won't take kindly to the firm's developing secret tactical weapons.
that's why the firm would like to turn this prototype over to the department of defense and let them take credit for it.
to demonstrate airwolf's tactical capabilities it will penetrate a typical soviet defense zone, the type used around their i.c.b.m. sites, their military command posts and communication installations.
(dietz) simulation has a way of always making the test vehicle look good.
the computers have airwolf's point of penetration into the defense zone.
they can interpolate his most likely approach to the target area and deploy tu-36 helicopters to block the canyons.
(archangel) moffet probably flew it south through central america then jumped from brazil across the atlantic to north africa.
(archangel) same route we used to ferry planes in world war ii.
it's a french firm, but most of the technicians are americans.
once you land in tripoli, our operative there will help you.
the carrier enterprise will be standing by in the gulf of sirte.
you probably won't have to fly more than 200 miles to get there.
(blaze) but i've been up there doing it for the cameras, and i'm gonna do it for mona!
either that or you can use your... your choppers to haul tourists around disneyland.
in the desert, a body like this would wither and die in a matter of hours.
after a few hours with such a body, what would it matter?
of course, brother khadafy was most pleased with your exploits this afternoon against the french on behalf of our beleaguered freedom fighters in chad.
your destruction of two french mirage fighters will be told about in the camps of our people until the desert sand turns to water.
(archangel) the russians have a missile task force shadowing our carrier group in the med.
if we invade libya, chances are it'll mean world war three.
i figured airwolf might be behind it, so i flew out to the cabin and found tet makin' eyes at some cute little thing in white who said she was housesitting' for you.
didn't take a genius to figure out what happened, you know.
if your boys don't get that chopper in four hours, our boys go in and blow it away.
our "boys," captain, include women, one of whom has already given her life on this mission.
of course, there is still time for me to save you, gabrielle.
i mean, you may scar a little, but isn't that better than dying?
[ gunshot ] don't you think a tiger's tail is her own business, mr. katz?
when they sign up with me, their tails become my business.
that's the kind of stuff my father did when he started this paper.
one of these days, there's gonna be a coup, and genghis khan in there is gonna be out on his frog baby.
if you want my advice, you're making a mistake with this speech.
has one of my writers put his foot in my mouth again?
in new york, i worked with vogue and bazaar, let's see, cosmo, field and stream.
and in paris, i did a lot with the paris vogue and elle...
i assume he won't mind wearing the tiniest bit of makeup.
[ woman's voice ] i'm sending in the last one, ms. thorndyke, then i'm going.
that's why i want to get into a less strenuous line of work.
that, and the fact that bird magazines don't pay very well.
that's a lot better than i do on the bird magazines.
and besides, you know, the people you have to deal with are a little crazy.
why don't we take our pad and our pencils and our little eraser.
we'll go up to my suite at the hotel and order some dinner, and we'll write the speech together.
[ man and woman ] ♪ as regularly as coffee or tea ♪
♪ you got me in your clutches and i can't get free ♪
won't even consider the pleasures he could bring to millions of unhappy people, not to mention his poor old sister. [ groans ]
let's give ms. thorndyke a chorus of "you're getting to be a habit with me."
i will take off the mask, but you must not take the picture of me above the chin.
if you don't want people to know who you are, senor woparico, why are you...
- when you hunting the elephant, you look in the jungles of africa.
when you hunting the stewardesses, you look in the bars of the east 70s.
surely you don't think that mr. denver and i had anything to do with this.
it was your idea we go to that bar so i show you how i pick up the girls.
if you have doubts about our credentials, why don't you go to the telephone...
and call the editor of the new york informer and check us out.
these could be the same guys who are ripping off all... screw the robbery angle.
i want a story about a ritzy pimp and his hookers.
the city really coughed up $200 million for a low-income housing project on times square?
mayor franklyn sunk a lot of his own money into it.
she's warned you time and again about the dangers of salacious literature in this city.
yet, you continue to ignore her, and you see the result.
she says that if you don't outlaw the sale of pornography...
in this city within 24 hours, she'll see to it that you lose the election.
the people of this city know where i stand on this issue.
they're too smart to confuse freedom of speech with unscrupulous exploitation.
lois, i want to apologize for putting you on the spot that way this afternoon.
you really are one of the brightest people on my staff.
such a good time last time, i brought my friend this time.
just hoping the show's going to be as good as it was last time.
♪ you're just as regal as an eagle ♪ [ caws ]
♪ a pterodactyl ♪ ♪ with whom i could be tactile, believe you me ♪
though they enjoyed your performance, they told me it was not they who engaged you.
an honest mistake, i'm sure, but now i'm afraid i must escort you to the door.
this printing press means the informer is tied in with the biggest crime ring in town.
we tell mayor franklyn about this, he can bust the syndicate and cash in politically.
we'll get a good night's sleep, and early tomorrow morning we'll all drive in together.
i want you both to know just how proud i am of you.
yes, but without my protection, there would be no paper, chuckles.
well, all i know is, we carry the concealed weapons, we drive around with the hot merchandise, we take all the risks, and all we get... [ groaning ]
anytime i want to, i can drop you right back in it. [ grunts ]
it'd serve you right if i blew the whistle on you, you skinny bastard!
if you'd rather go back with eddie, i'm sure he'd be happy to accommodate you.
barry, would you stop this nonsense and let's go. [ sighs ]
i just wish you people would keep your private life private.
barry, you might as well know, mayor franklyn and i are going...
you might even say i'm the mastermind behind the underworld robberies.
take from the crooked rich and give to the honest poor.
lois thorndyke was my faithful assistant, as everyone on my staff is aware.
what few people knew was that in the short time that we had worked together...
[ franklyn's voice ] you might even say i'm the mastermind behind the underworld robberies.
steal from the crooked rich and give to the honest poor.
and the stoy of how he pulled off the coup in the china sea.
well, i hope to get it pulled off by next week.
i still have $20 million to go on that hundred i agreed to pay for the leases.
blake, palmer indicated that his reporter may ask a sticm question.
why is blake carrington dealing with rashid ahmed when eveyone knows that he was double-crossed by him two years ago?
it's simply i agreed to deal with ahmed, even though i don't trust him, because not one cent of that money is going through the man's hands.
these awful dreams that my father didn't write the note, someone else did.
someone who killed him and then made it look like a suicide.
mr. carríngton, the políce are bound to díscover ít was i who set the fíre.
i tríed to stop that evíl woman from ruíníng yet another lífe and faíled.
what alexis does is her business, lust as it's my business to run colbyco while she's gone.
now, i've got a lot of work to do, adam, so why don't you just get out of here.
she always believes that she's on the side of the angels.
and she always iustifies eveything she does with a firm conviction that it's right.
when i told you this afternoon that she was in hong kong, i wondered, then, what she was really up to over there.
is she on the side of the angels this time, father?
well, that's vey gallant of you, but i already have a dinner date.
so why don't you take this like a good mark and go and enioy yourself with some of those charming tarts who've been following you around.
okay, so i flew a few miles on a dumb hunch.
look, as long as i'm here, i'd like to buy you that drink.
and then i'd like you to tell me where l could take some lessons.
i mean, if i own one, i should know how to shoot it.
and it may happen again, and i may be there the next time, and there's no point in me having a gun if i don't know how to use it.
well, it sounds to me like you don't intend to miss the target.
now, we both know that on occasion, you lose your temper.
and we both know how explosive this oil deal can be.
but the carringtons have never been known to be exactly pushovers.
and i think your mr. tough-as-nails will have met his match.
i thought this was to be an interview, mr. wales, not an inquisition.
i'll call it what you like, mr. carrington, but the entire business world wants to know why you and rashid ahmed are in this together.
all right, then let's talk about the political implications of this deal you made.
as i said in my n statement, there is nothing political about this, it's pure business.
i'm siding with the future of this county and its need for energy.
now, do you want me to repeat that into this thing?
oh, i hear you axed her from your public relations staff.
she went with you to hong kong, but she didn't come back with you.
the one that you forgot to give me and then said that you lost.
claudia, dear, if you've come back to hound me about something in the past, about something that i already apologised for-
mrs. blaisdel, we're here to ask you some questions about the tape.
now, we have a good reason to believe it still exists.
he said he'd pay me $500 by giving him the tape.
i asked him why he wanted it, and he said something about using it to upset mrs. steven carrington.
in the car, she kept asking, why would a man she'd never met torture her like this?
i have my doubts that the man wanted to do it.
all of this is lust part of a plan to get even with her.
i'll plant the tape at her office and then tip off the cops.
when you let her know some of the information you have, information about denver-carrington.
you're as excited about this as you were about sex a little while ago.
maybe that's why denver-carrington, which was lust a newcomer 25 years ago, was able to compete with a giant like colbyco.
i know, not as big yet, but this deal is going to do it.
well, alexis has been running colbyco exactly the way my uncle structured it.
i think the only real gamble she's taken is when dex dexter says do this or do that.
oh, how i'd like to see alexis' face when she tries to get in on this china sea deal.
when she finds out that the only areas that don't belong to me are worthless.
legend has it that it belonged to the empress of tibet.
reputedly the most beautiful woman in all of asia, that her people gave it to her when her troops won a victoy over the mongols, so that she might witness her beautiful smile as empress and conqueror.
therefore he hates me, and therefore he must repay the debt.
he will probably struggle and threaten me ... but eventually he will pay me.
i thought they believed in us and courage began to gather.
and the first time that we ask them for help ... they drive us.
a little secret that will keep you all from being sad.
all that you have to do is give it a try,
the medium simply gathers all the psychic energy for it to use.
and what at the moment is creating the most psychic energy?
no, i'm the only escort, but they will send somebody to investigate.
make sure that tegan and jane get safely back to the church.
he used to be a man of honour, played the war games in the way they were intended.

i went to the ministry of war and i asked them to prevent lucien from getting married.
after he was officially informed, he went to see that young woman, he told her... and she drowned two hours later.

how can you tell who to trust and who not to?
you know, i was really beginning to like you a lot.
how does someone like you get involved with someone like him anyway?
i'm going to make sure i hurt you as much as you hurt tanya.
i'm surprised you'll have the time, since you're in such a hurry to leave town.
i suppose with cameron out of the way, you can go back to being the other michael.
you know, i don't think i'd go back to michael long even if i could.
(devon) a great number of people, including his wife, are deeply concerned for his well-being.
there are governments who would use his knowledge for other purposes.
einstein or not, i'm not interested in playing baby-sitter to-- lt's not a question of baby-sitting.
we've been asked to help dr. bergstrom's stay to be pleasant and as uneventful as possible.
well, you've got lots to look forward to and a lot of time to look.
that's one of the reasons why i came with uncle klaus.
garthe hates me, but he's also very greedy for money and power.
whatever he's up to, it's much more than a personal vendetta.
well, he's been walking around the hotel room as if nothing's wrong.
and then when i asked him about it, he just looked at me as if he didn't know what i was talking about.
the last time we met, i promised to take you to africa.
to the very prison in which i was forced to exist.
i love a man that can do two things at once.
i'm glad to see i'm not the only one that couldn't sleep tonight.
it puts you into a kind of mood for the rest of the day.
those are the kind of dreams i've been having about you, michael.
now all we need now is something that's conductive to electricity.
(dr. klaus) i think i will have the mattress wire for you in a moment.
[screaming] lt's about time you understood that my life does not revolve around you.
it was my will that forced you to break me out of prison.
as soon as we remove klaus bergstrom, i will overload the circuitry.
the wires will melt down, and the house will burst into flames.
in that case, you might as well know what i think about you and your destiny.
your destiny is to never have a woman who wants you for yourself.
to never have a man who respects you for what you are.
your destiny is death and if you don't believe me, just go take a good look in the mirror.
i remember when you were waiting outside my door, hungry for my touch, just because i looked like him.
why settle for a copy when you can have the original?
they had struggled for their traditions, for the right to be different.
they had believed in the possibilities of the brotherhood of man.
they hoped to live normal lives, to raise families, and to live in peace.
some had found refuge in the americas and in australia, but most looked elsewhere, to a small land with great meaning in their history- to palestine, the ancient homeland of their people.
then in the late 19th and early 20th century, this land saw the arrival of a new breed of jewish settler.
they were young and idealistic, from russia and the countries of eastern europe.
the turkish empire, an ally of germany, came under attack from allied forces.
it collapsed, and british and french troops moved into the middle east promising independence to its various regions.
palestine fell under british rule while its arab and jewish populations each waited to be given control of the land.
in 1917, britain had issued a document- the balfour declaration- promising support for a national home in palestine for the jewish people.
jewish immigration increased, in part because of the new opportunities in palestine, in part because of the worsening conditions for jews in eastern europe.
on a greater scale than ever before, the jewish community remade the land, clearing fields, draining swamps, building cities.
tel aviv was already a metropolis- and jewish immigration was fast increasing as tens of thousands arrived each year fleeing nazi power in europe.
in the middle east, france and britain had recently created new arab states-
in the thirties, there were riots and sporadic outbreaks of violence against both the jews and the british authorities.
but the conflict in palestine was about to be engulfed by a coming universal conflagration.
they continued to limit immigration severely, hoping to achieve good relations with the arab world and protect their influence in the middle east.
the jews, however, were determined to increase immigration in defiance of british authority.
there were 2,000 of us on a boat built for 400.
many of us were sick from the crowding, the conditions, and the storms.
now the hiding was useless, so we came on deck to breathe.
we knew the british would try to stop us reaching the shore, but we wanted them to know they could not break our spirit.
international pressure mounted for britain to change its policy, but to no avail.
in palestine, the jews now fought the british by all available means.
that afternoon in tel aviv, david ben-gurion, leader of the national jewish council, proclaimed the establishment of a jewish state in palestine to be called israel.
it was exactly 3 years, almost to the day, since the end of the war in europe and the overthrow of the greatest tyranny that had ever oppressed the jewish people.
for the jews, it was a miraculous transition from the deepest valley of despair to the fulfillment of their highest hopes.
but the arabs viewed the u. n. decision as a defeat.
arab irregulars from syria and lebanon, the armies of egypt and transjordan, and other arab forces crossed palestine's border in arms, rushing to occupy the vacuum created by the british withdrawal.
the jews now had to take up arms to defend their lives, along with the life of their new state.
with few weapons or supplies, but with determination and discipline, they created a civilian army.
war raged the length and breadth of the land... nowhere more fiercely than in besieged jerusalem.
for the first time in almost 2,000 years, there was a jewish state.
and in may 1949, israel took her place as a member of the united nations.
but now a great community had been created in the place which had dominated jewish history.
these jews were bound together not just in time, but also in space, in the space of this new state.
and they came-more than 500,000 in the first 3 years alone.
by 1951, the jewish population of israel had doubled to more than a million.
they came from 42 countries, many-like these yemenites- from the arab lands.
for the yemenites, it seemed a biblical promise fulfilled- to be returned to israel on the wings of an eagle- though the "eagle" turned out to be a battered dc-6.
but in israel, all these jews were to share a common destiny and a common purpose.
from morocco, jews brought the celebration of mimouna, a festival unique to that community marking the end of passover.
the variety of customs that had developed among the jews during their 2,000 years of dispersion was now brought together for the first time within the borders of a single land.
for most of those who came, israel meant more than a refuge.
israel's first prime minister, that his people would create a new and vital culture as they worked to transform the land.
he made a point of working on the land himself, demonstrating by his labor his belief in a society without privilege.
one could hardly find a revolution that goes deeper than what zionism wants to do to the life of the hebrew people.
it is to be a homeland for every jew who returns there, a homeland that provides equally for all her children.
the kibbutz, a new kind of collective settlement, was one engine of this progress.
a small number of jews left behind their professions and their experiences of urban life to join in the kibbutzim and other pioneering villages, to follow a new ideal-
when it came, israel's response to arab threats was swift and unexpectedly devastating.
in less than a week, israel was victorious- the sinai peninsula, the golan heights, the west bank of jordan under israeli control.
this was particularly true among the 2 million jews of the soviet union.
one who remembers that moment vividly is alla rossineck, who was a high-school student in moscow at the time.
for the jews of russia in 1967, the celebration of israel's victory was tentative, restrained by their own problems with the soviet authorities.
50 years under soviet rule had taken them on a journey between hope and despair.
the soviets also encouraged all the cultures of their multinational state, including a secular yiddish culture.
shloyme mikhoels was lionized as the director of the moscow yiddish theater in the thirties, where many classics of the yiddish stage were presented as authentic expressions of proletarian culture.
though the purges began almost immediately, it was not until after world war ii that stalin, fearful of disloyalty on all sides, selected the jews as a major target of his paranoia.
dozens of jewish leaders and intellectuals were murdered, including mikhoels, all on fabricated charges.
gradually the soviet union was crushing the identity of its jews.
by the 1960s, much of the physical witness of jewish life had been destroyed, as well.
it was becoming harder and harder to practice or feel as a jew, and everything to do with the past and tradition was vanishing.
i knew if i didn't record the scene now, it would soon be too late.
within the empire, jews were one of the few peoples whose culture the soviets sought to repress.
in the 1970s, as jewish awareness grew, unofficial quotas excluded jews from many posts in government, in the army, in medical and scientific institutes.
jewish education was effectively forbidden, as were more expressions of jewish culture.
those who fought this policy and caught the eyes of the world came to be called refuseniks.
some chose to reassert their jewish identity through study and worship in the land of their birth.
others chose to emigrate to any country that would welcome them.
in an astounding exodus that took less than a decade, more than half a million jews, including yuli edelstein, emigrated to israel.
if departure had been hard, the arrival was no less difficult.
there were new norms, new practices, a new language, and a new culture.
the arrival of so many immigrants in so small a country had an enormous impact.
the real cultural and social influence of this wave of immigration is still part of the future, meaning that the very question of how we manage to integrate the new immigrants, bring them to the common denominator of the israeli society,
will more or less define their influence in the coming years.
while many became at home in the streets and neighborhoods of this country, they continued to feel part of the extended jewish community.
but the ambition that moved them all was to become americans.
jews had lived in urban jewish neighborhoods like these on the lower east side, now many were leaving those places behind.
their experiences of urban life were receding into memory, into nostalgia even.
israel's conflicts with its neighbors have always aroused deep soul-searching within this community.
as one has said, "my nation is at war with my state.
israel took the west bank and gaza, with their large palestinian populations, beginning over 25 years of uneasy military occupation.
the 1987 uprising of youth in the west bank was an expression of rage and protest against that continuing occupation.
at the end of 5 decades, the dispute still continues, with the israeli response complicated by continuing territorial threats and a fear for its national security.
the memories of the wars with egypt, syria, and jordan still haunt the national consciousness...
for israel has paid the price other nations pay for security and independence.
it has its cemeteries of war dead, its day of remembrance.
in 1993, israelis and palestinians finally saw the possibility for a new beginning.
it was called the oslo agreement and hailed throughout the world.
the shock of rabin's death left deep scars on israeli society that have been slow to heal.
the peace process itself uncovered deep division among israelis and lent fuel to an intensifying debate about the very nature of israel.
politicians, religious leaders, and philosophers are wrestling with the issues and confronting what it means for israel to be a jewish state.
when you say a jewish and democratic state, what do you mean, first of all, by jewish?
do you mean that it's only a demographic conception, that nothing will not connect us to our collective memory, historical consciousness, tradition, culture?
now, you can divide, easily, society according to the amount of jewish identity that they would like to accept upon themselves.
for years, there was agreement respecting the other's way of life.
recently the number and political power of the ultra-orthodox have increased, and there have been militant demands for the state to impose a variety of rabbinic laws on its jewish citizens.
there's a crisis in terms of jewish meaning in this society.
now, in some way, this indicates something vital- that this country is looking for its soul.
here on this kibbutz in 1984, the community celebrated the harvest festival of shavuot, a celebration dating back to antiquity.
those who built the kibbutz saw it as the foundation for the new israel.
now their children are leaving, and the hopeful dream of kibbutz is fading.
the certainties of a previous generation are giving way as a different israel is born.
now at the end of the 20th century, the question is, how do you take a people that now has freedom and has affluence and give them meaning in that context?
* la la la la la la la * [children singing in hebrew]
as the jews in the united states have become more american, the meaning of jewish community has become more diffused.
children: * la la la la la la la la la la la la la *
they wanted to drink schnapps together and have herring after services and just rub shoulders with jews.
children: * la la la la la la la * [children singing in hebrew]
who you are has to be defined from the inside, not by building a wall and saying, "they're different from me,"
but by saying, "here's who i am, in the full dimensions, interacting with the world around me. "
for most, like the members of this chavurah group, experimenting and questioning in order to create a meaningful jewish path within modern culture.
in a dramatic break from tradition, women now often share with men the responsibilities of ritual.
after all, the fundamental document, the classical statement of judaism, which is the talmud, is a document in which debate and disagreement is the central organizing category.
and yet everyone's on the same page, people with diametrically opposed views, and it's 75% of the entire document.
jews everywhere have been seeking new and diverse expressions of their jewish identity.
in the great community of america, in the populous jewries of france where more than half a million jews live, in great britain with 400,000, in countries from australia to brazil,
we are, all of us, the children of history, and for the enrichment of our world, we must try, each of us, to understand our heritage, to judge it in the light of its highest values,
and to pass it on as a treasure for all mankind.
you can forget that literature, religion... music, philosophy, things like that.
i mean, it's ok, but... what are you going to do with philosophy?
see, jeff, i know a lot more about you than you realize.
i see a young fellow who was probably raised... by a good, solid family in brooklyn.
and that's where we'd be right now... if you didn't save every penny and stuff it under your pillow.
but no, we have to live in that dump in brooklyn.
i remember my father telling me... there are only 2 important things in living.
he said, finding out what you do well... and finding out what makes you happy.
so, what is so important that you interrupted me... in the middle of the dance class?
well, i feel i'm ready to work for you, mr. brody.
i promised you i would give you a job... when you said you are ready.
well, you tell me you're ready, so i'm gonna give you a job.
i'm just standing here watching another ship... boxing its compass and venturing out to sea.
it's nice to know that it can go home if it needs to.
if he talks nice to the lighthouse keeper... he can always come home.
yeah, well, maybe if the lighthouse keeper... didn't yell so much...
last button on the arm, that locks up all the windows and the doors.
and, uh, look, don't put any scratches on the car, okay?
you write me up on everything but the color of the toilet paper, expect me to fix it in 30 days?
if you need more time, you'll have to appeal to the county commissioners.
you know, a father loaning his car, his first cadillac, to his son, now, that's not just a father loaning any car to his son.
that's a father loaning a symbol of his success, achievement and victories to his son and saying:
"here, you take this cadillac and you drive it proudly up the road of your dreams."
but, for chrissake, don't park the son of a bitch in the middle of a goddamn stream.
i am warning you, get out of the goddamn car now.
hey, pal, why don't you just cool off a few degrees?
he's one of these slick creeps with all them gold chains and a coppertone tan.
you got the worst taste in women of any man i've ever known.
i shovel gravel five days a week on some kidney-shaking machine that gives me hemorrhoids the size of watermelons.
then you zip out here and spend every minute away from her in the derby.
that's just another one of four or five examples of, uh, great potential for personal injury.
and of course, the county would be liable to lawsuit in those situations.
my dad built the speedrome in 1967, and since then we've had our share of cuts and bruises, splinters and bumped heads, but no more than any other business.
the only fatality we ever had was when my dad died last year of his head attack.
what i'm trying to get at is that there's a big difference between run-down and unsafe.
but i'll do whatever you want, i just need the time.
if i haven't done everything by then, you can shut me down.
we're supposed to waive the interest of the public safety for six months?
especially since you've had your eye on my dad's property since he died.
my bags weren't unpacked, his body wasn't cold yet and you were on my doorstep doing your let's make a deal routine.
that you've managed to buy or option every piece of property around me?
now you'll either calm yourself or i'll adjourn this meeting and we'll vote on this in private.
it's all right here, they wanna build a golf course and a club house.
you not only blew my ass out of the water, mr. smart guy, you blew your own ass sky-high.
this was my dream, you and me sitting pretty with our own development of fine homes surrounding a private country club with a state-of-the-an golf course.
and now, thanks to you, i have a half a dozen chicken farms surrounding a goddamn demolition derby.
found out that there was a buffalo bill cody and a wild bill hickcock.
whoever the hell wild bill cody was, he wasn't my relative.
there's this guy i know up in chicago, he runs this, uh, scuba diving school.
i figured i'd go up there and get a job and then i want to go to florida to do this dolphin study thing.
thought you had an accident or got sick or drunk or went dippy and jumped into the water.
and what is this business about ditching your last day of school?
but if i do, it'll be because i want to, not because i'm afraid of the rest of the world.
that's what i hate about grandview, is all the bull that says:
i'm coming by tomorrow to pick up my clothes and personal items, so consider yourself duly warned.
and if you know what's good for you, make sure you and your maytag boyfriend evacuate the premises.
you write me up on everything but the color of the toilet paper, expect me to fix it in 30 days?
if you need more time, you'll have to appeal to the county commissioners.
that's a father loaning a symbol of his success, achievement and victories to his son and saying:
"here, you take this cadillac and you drive it proudly up the road of your dreams."
this place is the only thing that makes me different from almost everybody else.
i like to smash cars and i am damn good at it.
mike, miss cody, are there any comments you'd like to make?
my dad built the speedrome in 1967, and since then we've had our share of cuts and bruises, splinters and bumped heads, but no more than any other business.
the only fatality we ever had was when my dad died last year of his head attack.
what i'm trying to get at is that there's a big difference between run-down and unsafe.
but i'll do whatever you want, i just need the time.
i need time to raise the money and do the repairs.
especially since you've had your eye on my dad's property since he died.
my bags weren't unpacked, his body wasn't cold yet and you were on my doorstep doing your let's make a deal routine.
that you've managed to buy or option every piece of property around me?
now you'll either calm yourself or i'll adjourn this meeting and we'll vote on this in private.
it's all right here, they wanna build a golf course and a club house.
you not only blew my ass out of the water, mr. smart guy, you blew your own ass sky-high.
so here we got the makings of a real old-fashioned american breakfast.
we got bacon, we got eggs, real eggs, we got spuds for some home fries, we got orange juice, we got maxwell house coffee, good to the last drop, and last but not least, hillbilly bread, it's colossal.
that's what i hate about grandview, is all the bull that says:
"don't go out there, you won't make it, they'll eat you alive."
hey, don't you think it's about time we open up this clip joint for business?
well, howdy-do folks and welcome to cody's speedrome, home of the demolition derby.
you know, if you still wanna go out, i'd like to.
i see your high school boyfriend's running in the derby tonight.
and now for the news of the week for july 23rd, 1944.
garwood huddle, the notorious unarmed bandit, has now spread his infamy over two countries by robbing the banco internacional in mexico city of over $90,000.
the police have had no leads as yet, and there has been no ransom note.
this tape, taken earlier today, shows the mother, frannie huddle, being comforted by her fiancé, walter brewster.
he hadn't counted on someone trying to take that legacy away.
whoever had kidnapped the little boy was willing to give him back, just as soon as we came up with the money garwood had buried.
all we had to do was go to a vacant lot where he'd buried it and spend a couple of hours digging it up.
sure, it was breaking a few laws, but when it comes to a 2-year-old kid who hasn't yet had a chance to swing a bat, what would you do?
just small farms up there on the north coast, you know.
and that original haul, son, that was close to half-a-million dollars.
and as much as it may pain you that one of them might have committed this heinous act, it has to be considered and investigated.
and perhaps one of them was bitter and jealous over your notoriety.
we're talking about the possibility of you getting arrested, or rearrested, andlor me getting arrested with you.
now, higgins, if i'm gonna commit half-a-dozen felonies trying to get this man's grandson back, we're gonna do it my way.
i knew that as long as they were reliving tales from the past, they wouldn't stop to think about the very frightening possibility we were facing in the present.
there was every likelihood the kidnappers wouldn't return the little boy, even if we did come up with the money.
yeah, well, we've had cops here around the clock since he busted out.
one of them just left a little while ago to check out some leads or something.
i know he's out there trying to help, but he isn't.
half of the police force is out there looking for him instead of my baby.
that's why i keep a hand in this new identity business.
ice pick, if you can just help me with these two guys.
magnum, this is not a good place for you to be.
cops are in and out of here at all hours ever since garwood escaped.
you know, as a matter of fact, even if you're not involved in the kidnapping, there's enough in here to get you disbarred.
maybe even get you a suite next to garwood's when he goes to jail.
last i heard he was picking coffee beans in costa rica.
harry, i'm tired and i'm angry and i don't believe you.
now, i've committed just about every crime short of murder over the last day.
now, time is running out here, and unless you want me to start considering murder,
i'm having a friend check him out under his new identity.
at least i'm glad old mortie didn't have a hand in this.
friend of yours came by while you was out getting shot at.
i gave him some of that patplan wax, see, for his car.
frannie, do you think there could possibly be some connection between the two disappearances?
i just think he's out there somewhere looking for his grandson.
oh, no, you're not gonna get away with this this time.
you know how much it's gonna cost me to repaint the van?
yeah, but you guys didn't say anything about a kidnapping when i was here before.
we felt it necessary to keep mr. huddle's identity a secret.
and i put some on and now i can't wash it off.
man, you should have smelled that stuff before you put it on.
boy, if that's your natural scent, you got a serious problem.
look, will you stop it, please, and come and help me find william daniels?
what does that to do with the fact that garwood was sitting next to me after i'd insisted he couldn't come along?
well, i still had one last chance to come out of this game with a homer of my own.
there was one last suspect, a dead one, and only garwood could identify him.
if he did, he'd be throwing me the pitch that i would blast into the upper deck.
- i'd even be happier with something smaller, since i'm just starting.
- you have to think big! "a snake who doesn't move, doesn't eat any frogs"!
a hubbub that in its early phase turns into a psychotechnical laboratory.
- we're in a strictly cleanseable stage of our work, but we still follow some theories of the impromptu acting studies, that started in vienna, circa 1921.
- now the actors are bringing each one their own elements, their essences.
- off course there's a spinal cordon, a guideline, that can be a man or a woman.
- and... the vertebrae that this spine is made of, also has its value.
- so it's like a "happening", a kind of collective construct?
- in a way that the impulse becomes an outer reaction already.
- you must feel the body movement as an outside factor.
one of these days i'll ask you to bring your family up to the farmhouse, you've been in "raya" enough.
régula and i would be most grateful the kids could go to school.
he's working at the farmhouse "la jara", just spending some days here.
take the turkeys out and rake the farmyard that smell is unbearable.
and if he doesn't pluck'em what good is an old man who hasn't anything in here?
you are right, young master, but think about it he grew up here, on st. eutiquious he'll be 61.
if i put up with him for 61 years, i deserve a prize.
i can't have an abnormal peeing and what not at every corner and in his hands, before he plucks the chicks.
even if you don't believe it, i wasn't sure of the charge.
our iván came one day with two cartridges and an old shotgun and he told me: "every night, put cartridges in and take them out through the shotgun barrel, 50 or 100 times and if you are the quickest, with your sense of smell and your memory, everybody will se you as an underling.
a month after i went to see him and said: "ivancito i'll put the cartridges in and take them out in a flash. "
he said: "i'll have to see that, paco, don't show off. "
he'll try the organ it hasn't been played since your wedding.
i must take the liberty of asking you to prepare the rooms is your wife coming?
the 22nd isn't far off, and this man needs almost 45 days in plaster.
with a bit of luck, in 10 days he'll be able to walk on crutches.
when the hunt was over, i gave him 100 pesetas and he said, "no, thanks".
i told him it was to have a few drinks, and he rejected it.
but, régula swears she didn't see her leaving how did she leave?
- she could've got into the boot of my car, it's very big.
if he comes, tell him not to disturb me, i have a headache.
even if you don't believe it, i wasn't sure of the charge.
our iván came one day with two cartridges and an old shotgun and he told me: "every night, put cartridges in and take them out through the shotgun barrel, 50 or 100 times and if you are the quickest, with your sense of smell and your memory, everybody will se you as an underling.
a month after i went to see him and said: "ivancito i'll put the cartridges in and take them out in a flash."
i think she's got too much... here, but she's not bad.
i we "polish" her a bit, she'd be a good maid.
manolo, is there anything you could do, so he's ok on 22nd?
the 22nd isn't far off, and this man needs almost 45 days in plaster.
they've never lived like now do you know what paco's son did to me?
when the hunt was over, i gave him 100 pesetas and he said, "no, thanks".
i told him it was to have a few drinks, and he rejected it.
i remember his father saying, not so long ago "thanks, master iván", or "thank you so much, master".
you can't make a film about somebody and not actually show that person.
i realize you don't want this... but then i fear i might not have enough imagination.
the important thing would be to show on film... how you react today.
the contract prevents me from doing the film the way i wanted... and i don't want to do it any other way, so i quit."
i get up when i have to get up, as long as stocks last.
well, my secretary comes at 11:00... and then we have to answer all the letters... which means i have to have all the autographs done by 11:00... and that takes at least two hours... doing all the autographs and answering letters and i don't know.
willy brandt was there at that time, and i went along... and we had a talk with one another.
and then there was this woman... a real berliner, and she said to me...
if someone said, "look, they're killing children... hundreds of thousands of people," then it's...
well, does it take such great courage to decide which side to take?
and when friends die... and then with my father dying... one begins to relate to death in a different way.
and this is something which i find changes the older i get.
but don't we all sometimes wonder during our lives... what comes afterwards or how it all ends?
no, i only worry about what i have to do today.
well, it must be terribly overcrowded up there... with all those people flitting about.
but if you'd lived during the war... and seen all the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed... they can't possibly all be flitting about up there.
marlene didn't get nominated for an oscar... as billy wilder didn't want to give the game away.
she did in fact play both the part of the cockney girl and mrs. wohl.
ayngaran dvd my first savings, my first movie in a touring theatre, the first kabaddi (sport) match i won.
the first house i grew up in the village, the first community lunch we prepared, as boys, the first railway journey, first cries on a friend's death.
if you come to school again, i will break your legs.
i had asked why he had planted trees and he says it is for answering nature's call.
i will give you, but don't tell anyone.- l will not tell anyone.
if you do i will... lt enough if you give it.
the first seeds of love were sown in those schools days.
i didn't know then that the affection for kamala was love.
we came by boat just now.lmmediately they're taking us another boat.
aren't we catching many buses to go to a place in our village. lt's like this here.
we'll feel like taking 1 00 persons to rotate the needle of the clock.
after expressing my love and when i couldn't understand her reply.
you would've been fascinated by me by chanting my name 1 00 times a day.
i lost one of my anklets and my thoughts didn't direct me to search it.
since my heart is filled with your remembrances, i'm burning my heart.
since my eyes have imprinted your image, i'm erasing it with my tears.
i was used to wait for you for a long time, to see you pass by me for a second.
i had taken a lot of trouble to express my feelings.
since you didn't get your girl whom you had loved for 2 years, you're drinking liquor... we're worried about the person whom we have brought up for 20 years,
if we also start drinking to get rid of it, will you bear it?
rs.500 which you spend for giving me a treat, let us donate this to the blind school in adyar.
rs.500 which we 3 spend for one square meal, there 50 people will have 3 square meals.
why do you want to talk to me after office hours?
if a girl moves with you in a friendly manner, that's all!
if men don't come up in life inspite of being talented.
is like keeping a piano which can generate 1000's of tunes, in a show case.
but today i faced him boldly, and said "what had happened has happened".
"there's no relationship between you me". "you don't meet me ever".
i and friends decided to make her stay with us, and we asked divya about it.
when we were in the darkness, she was the one who gave us a candle showed light on our paths.
that too when i saw you with wedding invitations, i felt very happy.
you're entering a new life by forgetting me and the past.

he was fat and bunchy, just as a rabbit should be;
his coat was brown and white, and he was very soft, he had real thread whiskers, and his ears were lined with pink sateen.
on christmas morning, when he sat wedged in the top of the boy's stocking, with a sprig of holly between his paws, the effect was charming.
of corse there were other toys that christmas, nuts and oranges and a toy engine, and chocolate almonds and a clockwork mouse, but the rabbit was quite the best of all.
for a long time he lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought very much about him.
he was naturally shy, and being only made of velveteen, some of the more expensive toys made fun of him.
the mechanical toys like the model train, were very stuck up and posted as if they were real.
but the rabbit could not claim to be a model of anything, for he didn't know that real rabbits existed;
he thought they were all stuffed with sawdust like himself, and he understood that sawdust was quite out of date
even timothy, the jointed wooden lion, who was made by the disabled soldiers, and should have had broader views, put on airs.
between them all the poor little rabbit was made to feel very insignificant and commonplace, and the only person who was kind to him at all was the skin horse.
the skin horse had lived longer in the nursery than any of the others.
he was so old that his brown coat was bald in patches and showed the seams underneath, and most of the hairs in his tail had been pulled out to string bead necklaces.
he was wise, for he had seen a long succession of mechanical toys arrive to boast and swagger, and by and by break their mainsprings and pass away,--
that's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.
generally, by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby.
he longed to become real, to know what it felt like;
and yet the idea of growing shabby and losing his eyes and whiskers was rather sad.
one evening, when the boy was going to bed, he couldn't find the china dog that always slept with him.
nana was in a hurry, and it was too much trouble to hunt for china dogs, and seeing that the toy cupboard door stood open, she made a swoop.
that night, and for many nights after, the velveteen rabbit slept in the boy's bed.
at first he found it rather uncomfortable, for the boy hugged him very tight, and sometimes he rolled over on him, and sometimes he pushed him so far under the pillow that the rabbit could scarcely breathe.
and he missed his talks with the skin horse during the long moonlight hours in the nursery, when all the house was silent.
but very soon he grew to like it, for the boy used to talk to him, and made nice tunnels for him under the bedclothes.
spring came, and they had long days in the garden, for wherever the boy went the rabbit went too.
he had rides in the wheelbarrow, and picnics on the grass, and lovely fairy huts built for him under the raspberry canes behind the flower border.
one time, the boy was called away suddenly, and the little rabbit was left out on the lawn until long after dusk,
nana had to come and look for him with the candle because the boy was so worried about the rabbit he couldn't go to sleep unless the rabbit was safely home.
and into his boot button eyes, that had long ago lost their polish, there came a look of wisdom and beauty, so that even nana noticed it next morning when she picked him up, and said,
"i declare if that old bunny hasn't got quite a knowing expression!"
and each day before the boy wandered off to pick flowers, or, play at brigands among the trees, he made the rabbit a little nest among the bracken.
he was a kind hearted little boy and he liked bunny to be comfortable.
one evening, the rabbit was sitting there alone, watching the ants,
suddenly, he saw two strange beings creep out of the tall bracken near him.
they were rabbits like himself, but quite furry and brand new.
they must have been very well made, for their seams didn't show at all, and they changed shape in a queer way when they moved;
that was a dreadful question, for the velveteen rabbit had no hind legs at all!
he sat still in the bracken, and hoped that the other rabbits wouldn't notice.
but they never returned, and presently the sun sank lower and the little white moths fluttered out, and the boy came and carried him home.
weeks passed, and the little rabbit grew very old and shabby, but the boy loved him just as much.
he loved him so hard that he loved all his whiskers off, and the pink lining to his ears turned grey,
he even began to lose his shape, and he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more, except to the boy.
to him he was always beautiful, and that was all that the little rabbit cared about.
he didn't mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him real, and when you are real shabbiness doesn't matter.
strange people came and went in the nursery, and a light burned all night and through it all the little velveteen rabbit sat guard, and never stirred,
to the long weary time, for the boy was too ill to play, but he knew that the boy needed him.
and while the boy lay half asleep, the little rabbit crept up close to the pillow and whispered all sorts of delightful plans for when the boy will be well again.
they would go out in the garden amongst the flowers and the butterflies and play splendid games in the raspberry thicket just the way they used to.
so the little rabbit was put into a sack with the old picture-books and a lot of rubbish, and carried out to the end of the garden behind the fowl house.
that was a fine place to make a bonfire, only the gardener was too busy just then to attend to it.
he had the potatoes to dig and the green peas to gather, but next morning he promised to come quite early and burn the whole lot.
that night the boy slept in a different bedroom, and he had a new bunny to sleep with him.
it was a splendid bunny, all white plush with real glass eyes, but the boy was too excited to care very much about it.
for tomorrow he was going to the seashore, and that in itself was such a wonderful thing that he could think of nothing else.
and while the boy was asleep, the little rabbit lay among the old picture books in the corner behind the fowl house, and he felt very lonely.
he was shivering a little, for he had always been used to sleeping in a nice warm bed, and by this time his coat had worn so thin and threadbare from hugging that it was no longer any protection to him.
near by he could see the thicket of raspberry canes, in whose shadow he had played with the boy on bygone mornings.
he thought of those long sunlit hours in the garden how happy they were and a great sadness came over him.
he seemed to see them all pass before him, each more beautiful than the other, the flower bed, the quiet evenings in the wood when he lay in the bracken and the little ants ran over his paws;
the wonderful day when he first knew that he was real.
and he thought of the skin horse, so wise and gentle, and all that he had told him.
and a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground.
it was so beautiful that the little rabbit forgot to cry, and just sat there watching it.
then suddenly the blossom opened, and out of it-- the loveliest fairy in the whole world.
"i take care of all the playthings the children have loved.
when they are old and worn out and the children don't need them any more, then i come and take them away with me and turn them into real."
all the forest was beautiful, and the fronds of the bracken shone like frosted silver.
in the open glade between the tree trunks the wild rabbits danced with their shadows on the velvet grass, but when they saw the fairy they all stopped dancing and stood round in a ring to stare at her.
but the little rabbit sat quite still for a moment and never moved.
for when he saw all the wild rabbits dancing around him he remembered about his hind legs, and he didn't want them to see that he was made all in one piece.
he did not know that when the fairy kissed him that last time she had changed him altogether.
and he might have sat there a very long time, too shy to move, if just then something hadn't tickled his nose, and before he thought what he was doing he lifted his hind toe to scratch it.
he was a real rabbit at last, at home with the other rabbits.
autumn passed, and winter, and in the spring, while the boy was out playing in the wood, two rabbits crept out and peeped at him.
one of them was brown all over, but the other had markings under his fur.
and about his little soft nose and his round black eyes there was something familiar, so that the boy thought to himself:
"why, he looks just like my old bunny that was lost when i had scarlet fever!"
but he never knew that it really was his own bunny, come back to look at the child who had first helped him to be real.
the two concubines he left behind won't be around for long.
the dignified thing is for you to return and preside over his funeral.
i've taken you in for so many years, providing for everything.
let's not even talk about the past, it just meant an extra pair of chopsticks.
you've been divorced for 7 or 8 years, and yet you never made plans for yourself.
mrs hsu, you only know too well a family like mine would never let us go out and meet other people.
shanghai's such a big place, there are so many clubs, how can he know which one has dancing and which hasn't?
he's not like your husband, he has no time to go out on the town.
if only sixth miss would come to hong kong she wouldn't lack for prospects there.
in recent years lots of shanghainese have gone to hong kong.
the lights, the band-stand, the stage design are all in traditional english style.
what was in vogue 40, 50 years ago is all a bit passe now.
he's lived abroad for so long he's fascinated by anything chinese.
were mr fan and the taipan at jardines really fellow students at cambridge?
she's been living in exile ever since, but other than that she's stateless none of her claims can be confirmed.
she was very well known in shanghai, and then came to hk with an englishman.
you flatter a girl in her presence and demean her behind her back.
i wonder what you'd say about someone like me behind my back.
meeting them for the first time, however bad or dirty things may be, they're still external to you.
but once you become part of them how can you differentiate between what's them and what's you?
i'm accustomed to being false because everyone around me is false.
you're the only one i've been honest with, but you don't know it.
if only mr fan would propose to miss pai, we'd have had the wedding already.
i think that while mr fan fancies her, he doesn't want to marry her.
if you do come back for me you may find i'll have changed.
a woman at 30 may well still be unusually youthful, but she'll fade before long.
i have to tell you that we're running a little low on provisions.
from now on, we'll have to make do with what's available.
in this incomprehensible world, who can say what's cause and what's effect?
who's to say if, perhaps for her sake, a city had to fall, millions had to suffer, and a momentous revolution had to follow?
but now that he's dead you should let bygones be bygones.
the two concubines he left behind won't be around for long.
you've been divorced for 7 or 8 years, and yet you never made plans for yourself.

if a carefree man like you can't decide, who can decide for you?
so louise has now moved to a single flat in wanchai.
luckily her father left her some money, so she has no financial worries.
it's bad enough for a woman to be deceived by a man, but it's worse if she baits him.
if a woman baits a man and ends up being deceived herself, then she's a whore twice over!
a woman at 30 may well still be unusually youthful, but she'll fade before long.
without marriage as a guarantee it's hard to bind a man's heart.
from now on, we'll have to make do with what's available.
this means that we're going to offer two biscuits and butter per person, and either 2 cups of tea or 1 cup of coffee.
who's to say if, perhaps for her sake, a city had to fall, millions had to suffer, and a momentous revolution had to follow?
liu-su didn't feel that she had any special place in history.

if only mr. fan would propose to miss pai, we'd have had the wedding already.
i think that while mr. fan fancies her, he doesn't want to marry her.
he's waiting for her to take the initiative, so that if there are any future problems, he won't have to take responsibility.

one morning, he woke in the castle he had built for his wife... and he didn`t know who he was.
- his name was arthur and he lived in a castle.
i wouldn`t think a man like your brother would keep a horse this old.
you have to love an animal a lot to take care of it this long.
you almost believe that he is a king... in a fairy tale world.
but the bulldozers that are going to level my land tomorrow are very real.
we will show that mr krock snr is not competent to handle his personal or business affairs and will seek to have his son
mr. krock jnr named as sole custodian of both his personal and business matters and well-being.
mrs butram, have you ever worked for anyone else, aside your employer.
years ago, i worked for mr justice hemdale and his wife.
does your father agree with the plan to develop this land?
no, he wants to let mrs halstead live there rent free with her mutts.
the court will recess for five minutes while i take care of fritzi.
your honour, before we recess, can the last statement of mr krock jnr be repeated?
i ask you a question that only a good king could answer.
if you were this arthur krock snr... what would you do with that land?
from now on, you'll deal with the charcoal pile by yourself.
we need to call fernandez, he'll buy more charcoal and we cannot let him down.
no matter how much we hid, he would follow us everywhere.
yes, but i caught you when you were telling them about the nest.
and when i was leaving in anger i called him: "luis!"
then he turned and i hit him with a stone in the face.
i felt a hit on my head and then i fell.
i wasn't going to talk to you again, but since you gave me a swallow ...
if you don't have money, then give me back all the coal you took with you.
i told you to give me either the coal or the money!
doctor watson tells me that he's run off his feet by this recent epidemic of this scarlet fever.
and then of course, there's abergavenny murder coming up for trial.
he appalls the prospect of public scrutiny but such is his anxiety in this matter that his grace is prepared to write a check for five thousand pounds to see the business off
and another thousand pounds to see justice visited upon the villains.
his grace has a deep horror of his family unhappiness being dragged before the world.
the police have been requested by the duke to proceed with such caution that they...
herr heidegger, the german master, is also missing as indeed, by the way, is his bicycle.
if he has abducted the boy why has no demand for money been received?
doctor huxtable i shall do a little work at your doors.
perhaps the train is not so cold but the two old hounds like watson and myself make get a sniff on it.
even i may find my appetite is keener for a few days in the bracing atmosphere of the peat country.
i think i will do myself no injustice when i say that the priory school is the most select preparatory school in england.
lord leverstoke, the earl of blackwater, sir cathcart soames, they all have entrusted their sons to me.
you can't see holdernesse hall from here but there's a very fine view from the chapel tower.
you're well aware, doctor huxtable, how anxious his grace is to avoid all public scandal.
he prefers to take as few people as possible into his confidence.
i shall spend, at any rate, a few days upon your moors.
who knows i may at least find herr heidegger's bicycle if nothing else.
however, i believe you are largely in the right, mr. holmes.
if you refer to the constraints i have placed upon the activities of the police then perhaps i have imposed too much.
perhaps you would like to come and stay with us at holdernesse hall.
i thank your grace but i think for the purposes of my investigation it would be wiser for me to remain here at the scene of the mystery.
well not to be too delicate about it, they were cattle thieves.
a worrier class, ingenious, daring but the basis of their wealth was running off with other people's cows.
i think i am not a man who demands the miraculous... but you have discovered nothing.
we haven't found not a jot since the moment we left london.
one, a squalid piece of gossip and the other an apocryphal and insulting fancy about the origins of my great patron.
i did not employ you to come here to blacken the name of the holdernesses, mr. holmes.
which contain not only grammatik exercises but also a lengthy composition.
you see my point, doctor huxtable, it would have been well after midnight if he had done nothing else,
he arises from the desk to fetch another one but he cannot see to find them, so he turns to the windows to draw the curtains to see better by the moonlight.
across the rooftops on the gate tower the boy has been waiting for darkness, knowing that his flight must not be observed.
you will see that there's a hostelry about three miles in this direction.
we'll need some food if we're going to face the duke of holdernesse later.
the letter was laid with others upon the study table and i, myself, put them there.
the only other person who would handle them would be rivers who delivers the daily post to the lodge.
the german master observed his departure and set off in pursuit.
we tracked the passage of his bicycle across the moors with much difficulty.
i would be glad if you would make me out a check for six thousand pounds.
perhaps it would be best if you were to cross it.
the capital and counties bank, oxford street branch, are my agents.
i do not possess a temperament, mr. holmes that appreciates the kind of acidulous pleasantry that clearly amuses you.
when i was a very young man, mr. holmes, i loved
with such a love that comes only once in a lifetime.
had she lived i would certainly never had married anyone else but... she died and left with one child,
james, whom for her sake i have tended and cared for.
i could not acknowledge paternity to the world but in all other ways i have treated him like my son.
he has required, but not warranted, a father's forgiveness many times
wilder intercepted your letter and substituted a note which deceived your son into believing that he was to see his mother.
the murderous hayes was his paid accomplice but the police have been alerted.
i saw in the papers that he had been engaged by the french government upon a matter of supreme importance but i could hardly foresee that it would have so violent a consequence.
it lies with me now to tell for the first time what took place between mr. sherlock holmes and professor moriarity in that fateful year.
watson l think you know me well enough to understand that i am by no means a nervous man.
but it is stupidity rather than courage to refuse to recognize danger when it is close upon you.
you will recall that it was a cold morning early in the year when i last left baker street.
i had no idea where i was going or who my client was.
surely this louve is near to the very heart of france.
it was here that the great musele held court and here that napoleon bonaparte was married to the archduchess madam marie louise of austria.
when i see two hooks and the place where the mona lisa used to hang and then this talk of... and scandal.
yes, now i begin to understand the delicacy of the matter.
it was only later in the day that a workman found the frame in a little store room under the salon care.
we put the glass over the painting only a month ago.
no, no, no because the copies must never be the same size as the original.
and, and who would buy one of my copies as the original when the real mona lisa is in the louve.
happily the french police are well ahead of the british when it comes to finger prints.
the great bantion himself was kind enough to refer to my little pamphlet on the subject as his bible.
first we must announce to the world that the painting has been stolen.
oh, but that would create a great scandal both myself and the director of...
notice the subtle modeling of the features, beautiful hands, mood, that smile.
as walter payton described her, the head upon which all the ends of the world are common.
i can spare you five minutes if you have anything to say.
all that i have to say has already crossed your mind.
by the middle of february i was seriously inconvenienced by you and at the end of march i was absolutely hampered in my plans.
and now with this last business in france you have placed me in such a position by your continual persecution that i am in positive danger of losing my liberty.
it has been an intellectual treat to me to see the way in which you grappled with this matter.
but i say unaffectedly that it would be a grief to me to be forced to take an extreme measure.
you must stand clear mr. holmes or be trouble under foot.
you know i'm afraid that in the pleasure of this conversation i am neglecting business of importance which awaits me elsewhere.
then will come the greatest criminal trial of the century, the clearing up of over 40 mysteries and the room full of them.
i cannot do better than to get away for the few remaining days.
now here are your instructions and i beg of you to follow them to the letter.
we are now playing a double-handed game with me, watson against the most powerful syndicate of criminals in europe.
you will dispatch whatever luggage you intend to take by a trusted messenger unaddressed at the victoria station tonight.
in the morning you will send mrs. hudson for a handsome cab, desiring her not to take the first or second which may present itself.
you will drive to the strand end of la famules, handing the address to the cabman but with a request that he will not throw it away.
have your fare ready and the instant that your cab stops move speedily through the muse and time yourself to reach the other end at exactly a quarter past 9:00 where you will find a small broom waiting close to the curb driven by a fellow with a heavy black coat.
from ashford junction we can take a 1 :00 slow train to hastings, then onto the dear old london brighton and south coast line,
bax hill on to lewis non-stop, then onto new haven, evening boat to vienna.
i'm not leaving you holmes, not unless you order me to go.
i've never been to switzerland before but the beauty of the landscape reminded me irresistibly of the northwest frontier provinces of india.
but in spite of the lovely scenery all around us, it was clear to me that never for one instant did sherlock holmes forget the shadow that lay across him.
i could tell by his sharp scrutiny of every face that he was well convinced that go where we would we would not be clear of the danger that was dogging our footsteps.
the walk over to the hills to rosenlawry is very beautiful.
you can stay the night there and come back the next day but you must not on any account miss the falls of reichenbach which is only a small detour.
herr steiler told me to give you this. lt is very urgent.
it seems an english woman was taken to the hotel after we left on her way to friends in lucerne.
of course, there was a tall old englishman who came here after you had gone.

i'm pleased to think that i shall be able to free society from any further affects of his presence.

good bye and good luck and believe me to be my dear fellow, very sincerely yours, sherlock holmes.

reported sightings of foreign prisoners held in vietnam have resulted in greater efforts to resolve the mia issue once and for all.
senator maxwell porter, head of the us delegation to vietnam," expressed guarded optimism that talks would result in shedding light on this unresolved issue.
but we're cautioned that progress would probably be slow and painstaking.
we're gonna need something a helluva lot stronger than that to impress 'em!
isn't that why colonel braddock is along - as irrefutable evidence?
the atrocities, as documented in front of you were the real reasons why colonel braddock was held here!
he was not a prisoner of war, but a common criminal!
if i knew it would be like this i wouldn't rent you the helicopter for a million bucks!

i know i've been a pain, but i just got to try anything to get on a roll.
miss windom, we've all experienced the frustration of the writer's block syndrome.
yes, i recall once sitting for days, searching for just the right superlatives to describe one major reginald weddington.
you see, "humpy" weddington had overcome great adversity in his quest to be an officer.
she wants the total seclusion that mr. masters' guest house offers.
and since mr. masters wishes her to have every consideration until her novel is completed...
magnum, please collect your things and come to the main house immediately.
i've prepared you a very nice room with a magnificent view.
is it true that you don't work on a case without his and t.c.'s help?
rick sort of softly blew that information in my ear when he asked me out.
and speaking of cars, the one i am renting is eating up most of my meager fee.
i don't suppose, since you're going to be cloistered here working in my house, that the ferrari is free, hmm?
bite of the sherry as he mused the mystery of the hans leopold case.
as the balmy sea breeze bathed his thoughts, one truth washed crystal clean in his mind.
this hans leopold case, isn't it a bit pedestrian for you, sabre?
a man's hands singed by a laser gun from a passing car on the streets of brussels?
and this time i won't quit until i know who he is.
i'm meeting inspector vittorio romano of interpol at the hospital in rome, to interview hans.
it was the same as all the others on the surface, but i had a feeling that there was some unexplored scene in this little drama.
i'd already had two visits with russell at the hospital, but the feeling was strong enough to ask for one more meeting with the victim, the insurance guy, dan morgan, and a large supporting cast.
sebastian and interpol have been working for years to learn king solomon's true identity.
inspector romano, i'm sorry but i have nothing more to say to you.
the same concern that was implicated in an earlier search for king solomon, when he eluded me.
hans, did the laser shots that hurt your hands come from a gray sedan?
well, collette may be a wonderful warrior of a woman, but she is not always a diplomat.
i simply suggested that perhaps hans' hands were not burned at all, jacques.
thomas, for what it's worth, a friend on the dock says a gray '83 buick with minor fender damage got shipped to maui yesterday.
registered owner, donna jenkins, and, by the way, we need to discuss our deal on this job, right?
it was a deeply dejected sebastian, who sat in the sensuous morning sun, on the patio of the sabre's scabbard.
few had ever witnessed the strong and secure sebastian sabre in self-exile, on a lonely desolate island of defeat.
leopold died of a blood disease, the results of his burns.
do you really believe a doctor of ling's competence could overlook a simple blood disease?
dr. ling, jacques arnot and hans leopold all own stock in worldex import export company.
and the gray mercedes that you found registered to worldex is actually the personal car of one eva leopold.
and you, so close to discovering the secret, he had to die.
so unfortunately for you three, death will not be such a lucrative charade.
this girl's already jeopardized your chances of ever working another case for us and now you buy this crazy story.
i don't want to believe it either, dan, but it adds up.
ronnie meeder's brother-in-law owns a backhoe, just like the one that annihilated my rental car.
and donna jenkins just sent her damaged gray sedan to maui.
but you have to understand, we can't let you and betty go.
this has been a real good deal for all of us and nobody's ever been hurt but superior mutual insurance,
how could betty think of me as a womanizing, trigger-happy clothes hound?
that's hardly as offensive as finding your dearest experiences parodied as boris' amusing stories, or finding yourself caricatured as the servant to the master of sabre's scabbard.
yes, and if betty's naiveté as an authoress carries over into her sleuthing, there's every possibility that somehow she and magnum are living the jeopardy of her final page.
well, we better break this plot down or hope for some more clues.
sebastian would hold his ropes over the flame until they burned in two and then he'd pretend to still be tied up.
and then he would jump all four of them, when they came back in.
the king solomon syndicate was not finished, only severed into pieces by the sabre's slash.
to have the diary in the hands of the remaining solomites would be fatal to all concerned.
she dropped where she was shot, but he looks like he was dragged.
you drag a body away to hide it, not down a driveway for the world to see it.
those are the only two ways in and out of this place.
i thought you moved into communities like this for this not to happen.
see, you know when i'm on call because my clothes are folded next to my bed.
shoes, jacket, ball cap, bottle of water, pen, paper, thomas guide, next to the phone.
mike and kyle, they made all their money out of laurel taking it off.
she-she was a cash register in panties is what she was.
blood found in the trents' bedroom is a match to drake
so he told the truth about the blood and lied about the kitchen.
mike comes busting in, goes ballistic, smacks me in the nose...
i mean, i know i keep coming back to this three-and-out thing, but maybe because you're in bed with his wife.
now i'm popping blue pills looking for something to bring me down, but i know the business.
i just don't have the capital to get behind the camera.
everybody needs to indulge in a vice at least once a day, right?
yes, well, i did happen to notice those little waitress girlies trying to serve their way into bed with you.
and, um, and god forbid i had an early morning roll-out and i had that tell-tale breath, you know what i mean?
so i would dodge my supe, and i started popping cough drops.
yeah, two-carat diamond earrings, ruby necklace, diamond and sapphire bracelet, lady's gold rolex.
the insurance company says it's worth somewhere north of two mil.
you know that feeling you get when you just can't quite put your finger on something?
what can't you put your finger on besides the clock-out button?
they were on their way to the safety deposit box that morning and then off to hawaii at the end of the week.
so it was laurel trent who cleaned out her own jewelry box.
according to your son, he slept all the way to laughlin.
kid falling asleep in a car on the way to his grandma's house?
they work their way through the bloodstream in the urine, but not the hair.
our lab found trace elements of ambien, which is a hypnotic sleep sedative, in your son's hair root.
your hatred of trent was stronger than your love for your own child.
you druged your son so you could use him as an alibi.
the animal in question is not a normal product of nature.
it's armoured in a thick layer of bristle that can't be penetrated by a rifle shot unless it's fired from underneath it.
so, as a professional kangaroo shooter and an expert on local wildlife, how big would an animal, say, a razorback, how large would a razorback have to be to carry a two-year-old child over any distance?
about four or five times bigger than anything i've seen or heard of.
for an animal to have grown to such a size, he must be shy and cunning...
even an exceptionally large and cunning beast couldn't have dragged the boy?

the animal in question is not a normal product of nature.
it's armoured in a thick layer of bristle that can't be penetrated by a rifle shot unless it's fired from underneath it.

lord, this royal treasure... is for the welfare and well-being of the people
neither my forefathers nor i have ever taken anything from it
after the heart-attack, i want to entrust... the responsibility of the safety of the treasure to the prince
bless him, lord, so that he turns out to be a kind-hearted king... who rules the hearts of the people bless him with wisdom and strength, lord
maharaja, your soldiers and guards are in my custody l don't want unnecessary bloodshed
just hand me the pendant which has the map of the royal treasure
he's now going to make me the owner of 50 million!
maharaja shoor veer singh... quietly take off the pendant and give it to lakhan
better take it to a goldsmith and have it opened carefully
mangal singh, you will surely have your reward when we find the treasure
make two pieces of my tongue and it'll resound with "no"
make four pieces and the voice will reverberate four times more
and we're using that on the patient who met with an accident
doctor, tell me where we can find a cylinder. i'll go and bring it
- daddy, you're wondering... why i've worn this dress today, right?
you're playing the "girl who wields the whip" in the college play?
daddy, had he not risked his life to save mine... you wouldn't have seen me alive today.
- l can never repay this debt... but if you could give me a chance to serve you,... i'll consider myself fortunate.
- lt's your birthday today... and everything is falling in place.
on my way home... there was this gentleman who gave me a ride till home
- this is my hat, my son lt was i who kept it here besides... no one ever returns from the heavens, my boy
but he was the same man, father once i set my eyes on someone... the picture remains imprinted on my mind forever
dad, the train carrying the crown has just left gate no. 10
friends, i am thankful to the organisers of this inter-collegiate... cultural competition, for having bestowed on me the honour... of being the chief guest here today.
there's only one way out now i must swap this crown with the one in the competition... and deal with the winner later
friends, while we say good-bye to the old year and welcome the new one... the contest we are about to present before you... revolves around the theme "the old and the new"
to help you sleep easy for a while lf you don't want to die... you will hand that locket to me.
- certainly not. lt has been with me... ever since i was a child. lt's the mark that identifies me to my family
the maharaja's wealth is ours and the anjangarh treasure is ours
the wealth, the treasure... and i am anjangarh's prince ranjit singh
don't you think you've wiped off... the sins of your past
remember the deputy inspector general... is still looking for the maharaja's assassin
were he not blindfolded, he would've broken your hands then and there... to avenge the amputated arm.
to protect his prince... he can kill a hundred like lakhan
for centuries there were fearsome tales of a half human monster roaming the african forests
even in modern times, knowledge of the elusive creature the wild chimpanzee- was largely based on speculation
against odds many thought insurmountable she gradually earned the chimpanzees' trust
the picture that has emergedis an awesome portrait of the animals most like man
jane goodall's classic study stretches from 1960 to the present day
a compelling chronicle that spans three generations of chimps it is the longest study of any wild animal group in the world
growing up in bournemouth, england, jane goodall was drawn to the world of animals almost from the start
when her mother gave the infant a chimp doll outraged friends predicted nightmares
i was absolutely fascinated with the idea of being out in the jungle out with the animals feeling a part of it all."
famed anthropologist louis leakey had long searched for someone to study wild chimpanzees for clues to the behavior of early man
his faith in jane goodall would lead to one of the most important scientific studies of our time
her journey would take goodall to the east african country of tanzania then known as tanganyika
the remote gombe stream game reserve stretches for about ten miles of rugged mountainous country along the shore of lake tanganyika
and so on the 14th of july 1960 jane goodall was 4,000 miles from home a tiny boat her only link to the civilized world
but when i looked at the wild and rugged mountains where the chimpanzees lived
i knew that my task was not going to be easy."
day-to-day life in this remote wilderness would be difficult at best
the local authorities horrified at the thought of a young white woman alone in the wild at first refused jane permission to come agreeing only when she said she would bring a companion
"during my first days at gombe i could hardly believe it was true
at last i was out in the wild i didn't see many animals but i had the feeling they were there all around, watching me
there were rustles in the undergrowth strange calls smells i could not identify."
for months the objects of her search invariably fled at the mere sight of her
"i discovered not far from camp that there was a peak overlooking two valleys
and from this vantage point i was able to gradually piece together the daily behavior of the chimps
the major advantage of the peak was that the chimps could see me sitting up there and gradually get used to my presence."
sitting quietly in the same spot day after day always dressed in the same neutral colors never attempting to follow the shy apes the figure on the peak gradually became less of a threat
it would be some time, however before jane was accepted at closer range
though the chimps now recognized the intruder her intent was far from clear
jane had to accept the realization that for the being being at least much of her knowledge would be based on indirect evidence like an abandoned sleeping nest high in the trees
jane found the nest was not simply a pile of wadded leaves but a carefully interwoven platform created by dextrous hands and a reasoning brain
and so days that began before dawn reached well past midnight
and, for as long as it would take tomorrow would be the same
even when there were no chimps to be found there was always much to be done
samples of plants the chimps eat would be preserved for later identification
there was a new language to learn tribal customs to absorb
a makeshift clinic helped cement good relations with the local villagers
though her staff was growing outsiders til now had not been welcome lest they frighten the chimps
but at louis leakey's urging she agreed that a permanent film record of the chimps be made
primarily funded by the national geographic society over the coming years he and goodall would capture details of chimp behavior never before dreamed possible
they found that chimpanzees are nomadic traveling in ever changing groups in the daily search for food wanderings that can take them two to six miles in a single day
they are animals of dramatic extremes noisy and excitable one minute calm and gentle the next
to satisfy their hunger on a diet that is largely vegetarian chimps eat up to seven hours a day
much of their diet is fruit but they also feed on leaves blossoms, seeds, and stems
after congregating at a food source several individuals may rest and groom together then separate once again
not much interested in quiet pursuits youngsters have better things to do
"the chimps very gradually came to realize that i was not dangerous after all
i think it was one of the proudest and most exciting moments of my whole life
chimpanzees are as distinct from one another as are human beings and jane gave them names as she came to recognize them
old flo, with her bulbous nose and ragged ears is matriarch of the family jane would come to know best
at seven weeks, infant flint is still completely dependent on flo
the older chimps less interested in babies tend to ignore flint
but fifi is persistent actually trying to take the infant from flo
though protective of her newborn flo is never rough with fifi
when she's had enough she simply walks off leaving fifi looking rather frustrated
another group's arrival is signaled by a chorus of hooting calls
adult males dominate chimp society and are much precoccupied with their position in the hierarchy
in an effort to better his rank the male puts on an awesome charging display
with hair bristling and vegetation flying the male makes himself appear larger and more dangerous than he actually is
intended to intimidate rivals it is usually nothing more than superb bluff
after displays of aggression the dominant chimp often reassures those who have been frightened or hurt and thus tension is defused harmony restored
one male rose to the top of the hierarchy by intelligence rather than strength
mike discovered that rolling empty kerosene cans from jane's camp made a horrifying noise
close to where they are feeding when dusk falls the chimpanzees will build sleeping nests for the night 30 to 40 feet up in the trees
after choosing a suitable foundation such as a horizontal fork the chimp takes only three to five minutes to bend down branches then twigs, to create a comfortable, padded bed
but, as she soon discovered human creature comforts were not without appeal to some
a chimp had wandered into camp and found the supply tent where bananas were stored
because he had been to camp before when jane was in the forest she had a prearranged signal to call her back
"it was thrilling after all this time to find a chimp actually in my camp
after the endless months she had searched for them the chimps following david's lead mow came to her
gradually their inherent fear gave way and an offer of friendship was accepted with trust
david greybeard repeatedly ran to his friend the more powerful goliath for protection
goliath came to david's defense but the baboon knew which chimp was afraid and it was david he went for every time
because of the trust established in camp tracking the chimps in the forest was now much easier for jane
she was able to follow and document in detail the development of
flo permits fifi to take him for brief periods of time
such experiences provide important training for the future when young females mature and have offspring of their own
though unsuccessful the attempt marks an important milestone in her learning experience
mandy is a young female who has just had her first baby
mandy is not worried by fifi's presence but when adolescent male figan approaches she nervously moves off
both fifi and figan are fascinated by the smell of the new baby
meanwhile, even flint is curious about another infant younger than he
but flo is ready to move on in search of food and she lets flint know it is time to go
although chimps seem miserable in the rain surprisingly they make little effort to find shelter
even in a torrential downpour they just sit and wait it out
but baboons can only capture the termites outside the nest as the swarms emerge and fly
when they have gone and worker termites have resealed the nest the baboons will move on
but the chimps not only know termites are there hidden below the surface, they have learned how to get at them
in defense of their nest the termites grip onto the gras and with utmost care the chimp gently draws them out
as a stem becomes bent the chimp breaks off the end to make it work more efficiently
sometimes a leafy twig is selected but first it must be stripped of its leaves
in these actions modifying natural objects for a specific purpose - the chimp is not only using but actually making tools
it seems certain that this is a learned behavior passed from generation to generation by watching and imitation
flint does not yet know how to fish for termites but already he imitates part of flo's technique
jane's proof that chimps make and use tools would rock the scientific world
"tool using always used to be considered a hallmark of the human species
when louis leakey first heard about tool using at gombe he got extremely excited and said "now we have to redefine man redefine tool or include chimpanzees with humans."
a chimpanzee brain will never design a computer nor even imagine a durable tool chipped from stone
but his brain is more similar to our own than is that of any other living creature
and surely it was thus that our distant human ancestors began learning to master the natural world in the constant struggle to survive
to a thirsty chimp rainwater trapped in the hollow of a tree is inviting but not easily reached
inherently curious, youngsters like fifi learn from older chimps and thus the technique is passed on
baboons at gombe outnumber the chimps by about four to one
because he has the intelligence to use a weapon yet another type of tool even a youngster can intimidate a fully grown male
the bluff works but as jane would find out sometimes the aggression is very real
a young baboon has been captured and killed by a group of chimps and they will feast on its remains
jane's discovery astounded the scientific world the chimp is not the gentle vegetarian we had thought but, like humans, a formidable predator
sometimes cooperating to hunt and stalk their prey they also kill young antelope bushpigs, and monkeys
for the most part chimps eat meat only they themselves have killed
gombe drew students from around the world with interests ranging from biology to communication to psychology
they came because of jane and the unique opportunities of the living laboratory she created here
now the chimps were fed only if they arrived alone or in small groups and then just once in ten days
apparently not happy with this new state of affairs the ever-creative chimps made their wishes known
all chimpanzees are intensely curious but often afraid of the unfamiliar
for the first time, flint attempts the typical male intimidation display pulling vegetation and stamping
in retrospect, jane will say that had she known her study would continue indefinitely she would not have encouraged contact between herself and the chimps
for one thing, they are stronger than humans and if they lose their fear, dangerous
"nothing that has happened at gombe befoe or since has been as horrible nothing
they were among the darkest days of my life; a living nightmare
the mother, olly has lost her month-old infant to the disease
though she knows he is not alive she carries his dead body for three days
polio vaccine is flown in and fed to the chimps in bananas but for many it is too late
flo's son, faben, paralyzed in one arm protects it by walking long distances upright
to get food mr. mcgregor had learned to pull himself into trees with the strength of his arms alone
but he dislocated a shoulder while trying to climb and now can no longer move at all
jane modeled her behavior after the patient afectionate chimp mothers she had long observed
"gombe was the ideal place to raise a child," she said
flint's behavior would be expected to change with the new arrival but instead he was getting worse
"even after the birth of his sibling when most youngsters become more independent
flo, now well past 40, was feeble and worn spending most of her time resting quietly near flint
"although i knew that flo had become very old indeed it was still a sad day when i found her dead body lying in the stream
today the name jane goodall is almost synonymous with animal research
accomplished author speaker, and now a phd she is sought all over the world
with her on this trip are her mother returning for a nostalgic visit and grub, now 15
though not even jane could have predicted her study would last this long it is 22 years since she first set foot on gombe's shores
the men work in teams of two and follow the animals seven days a week
in recent years they, along with jane withessed a startling turn of events
people's idea of the gentle noble savage would have been exemplified by the way of life of the chimps
i started off studying one community and in 1972 that community divided into two and one part of it moved down into the south of the range that the whole community had shared
two years later a series of events began which were amongst the most horrifying we have seen at gombe
the males of the larger asakela community the one's that we are studying today systematically began to hunt down individuals of the smaller southern community to attack them when they found them on their own or in small groups and within a full year period every one
of the seven males and at least one of the three females who had moved to the south had disappeared."
"the sequence of events that occurred during this warfare were really shocking because these attacks were not over in one minute
the victim was rendered senseless virtually crouching on the ground not even trying to fight back
and yet they would pound him they would drag him they would bite him they would smash him
and these were very very brutal attacks and i think it's a bit horrifying to consider that just because we now know how aggressive the chimpanzee can be this makes them even more like humans than i thought they were before."
only because jane stayed on at gombe was the warfare discovered
only because she remains there still may it one day be explained
while the male gang violence was a profoundly dramatic event much of jane's work continues to revolve around the subtle intricacies of day-to-day family life
as she watches getty the youngest member of the gomber community secure in his mother's arms
jane reflects on ten other infants who over the course of four years met a gruesome fate
gilka, one of the polio victims a chimp i'd known since she was one year old
and that this mother passion had killed the baby and she and her daughter and her son had shared the body between them
and over the next four years passion and her daughter pom were known to kill and eat three newborn babies
they were watched as they tried but failed to catch two more
i suspect that it was an aberrant behavior shown first by the mother imitated by the daughter
it was, perhaps, the hardest thing to understand and to accept that's ever happened at gombe
and the descriptions of the attacks on these mothers are some of the most moving and horrifying descriptions that have taken place in all the 22 years
for instance, when passion, together with pom two strong females, attacked melissa with her three-week-old baby
melissa's daughter gremlin much younger than pom, ran over to the two field assistants who were watching this horrifying struggle stood upright, looked into their eyes looked back at the scene, and really seemed to be begging for help
but passion and pom were strong stronger than melissa, and they managed to seize the baby leaving melissa terribly badly wounded
gombe is quiet again but for the eternal sounds of the african night
then on a summer evening in 1982 a joyous chorus of human voices pervades the dark an anniversary party celebrating 22 years of research at gombe
to share this night, some have come by boat others have walked for miles
with traditional feasting and speeches they join together to toast the future and celebrate the past
"well, after 22 years i have many many fond memories of gombe
perhaps the one that i like to think back on most was after having struggled crawled through the undergrowth climbed up to the peak and down again and searched, and being rewarded yes by seeing chimps, but chimps that ran away every time i went up to them -
it was a tremendous feeling of accomplishment and exhilaration and pride in the fact that i'd been accepted
and then a rather different kind of memory was the first time that a wild chimpanzee mother came up to me and allowed her infant to reach out with that wondering expression in his eyes to touch me
and though it often seems a lifetime ago she remembers them all three generations of chimps who allowed her the privilege of entering their private world
wild animals roaming free who permitted a human to live among them as a friend
today, the direction of the study lies uncharted ahead to be written by the chimps themselves
it is a future jane goodall embraces with anticipation and a personal dream
"i hope to stay at gombe for as long as i can struggle around the mountains and even after that i would hope that i can train somebody to follow in my footsteps so that when i'm an old and doddering lady
i can still hear about melissa's grandchildren and fifi's successors and be happy in my old age."
when louis leakey told jane her study might last ten years it sounded like a lifetime and privately she thought "three years at mos."
already into her third decade at gombe the pioneer who dared to be accepted by wild animals and won has no intention of leaving now
we're over in vietnam getting our butts shot off, while he's on a stage burning his draft card in central park.
now he's telling everybody to vote for him and work through the system.
my father gave those to my mother the night before he shipped out.
he was going to send for us as soon as he got back to america.
but my mother died, so i guess he couldn't find me.
at the orphanage, they taught me not to be angry about the past.
where do you get the kind of money to buy your way into the states?
same place i learned to speak english, hustling big hotels in ho chi minh city.
what were the odds of my finding the one helicopter pilot named jones, who left a wife and infant son behind in vietnam almost 12 years ago?
on the other hand, the odds weren't gonna get any better if i turned the boy down.
you know, it's the american birthright, thomas, the pursuit of happiness.
what's the pursuit of happiness got to do with bumping heads with some hood?
each one run by someone who's working very hard just to get by.
now, if all these people have to keep paying protection money every month...
now, i flash the money at the bagman, and then i pull a switch and give it to you, and you wait for me over there by that aquarium.
then the bagman takes an envelope full of paper towels, and you and i hand all these people back their money.
and when he realizes he's been had and comes looking for us?
well, first of all, they'll never really get a good look at you.
i can see you just don't have time to help out a few nice people.
if i agree to do this, if, you will get into nia and see what you can find on the boy's father?
you know, she looked more like a college girl than a hooker.
all they found on her was 1,500 bucks and a driver's license.
i saw it in tran quoc jones' eyes when he asked me if i could find his father.
and i felt it in my heart when i heard honey lester, a client i hadn't even met, had been killed.
i felt i had to do what i could to find out why honey had called me.
i asked rick to see what he could find out about her.
i was kind of hoping you wouldn't notice he was staying here.
i mean, look, i know you got this big shindig coming up, but...
the thing is, i think tran quoc can stay out of the way.
what's the big deal if he stays here for a couple of days?
he told me, quite in confidence, that i reminded him of someone he was very close to.
the thay tru tri of the orphanage where he grew up, as a matter of fact.
i suppose i always have had a rather authoritative air about me.
i remember the first time i was bundled off to military school.
i couldn't have been more than seven years old at the time, but, even then, the lads apparently saw in me the makings of a leader.
the school was located on the rainy and windswept coast of...
he said, "did you take care of that false advertising matter?"
he also said for me to call him t.c., and he invited me to go flying in his helicopter tomorrow.
every morning i wake up and i think, this might be my last day in america.
today might be the day they come and get me and send me back,
so i try to fill my mind with as many pictures as i can, so i'll have something to remember when i'm back in the orphanage.
but i should try to find my own pictures, and not take yours away from you.
as long as i was there, i figured the navy could afford it.
they got no record of a tran quoc jones or anybody even asking about him.
is it true you're going to look for the boy's father?
i want to thank you all for coming out today, but this is a personal event, not a public one.
you know, not everyone has your courage to come all this way looking for your father.
well, i'll say one thing for the guy, he always knew how to keep his face in front of the people.
well, maybe they won't, but you won't think about them all the time.
i hardly ever think of the scary times back there anymore.
naturally, the beaches are more open and vulnerable than the rest of the estate.
however, i will personally see to it that efforts are redoubled to insure against any recurrence of today's most distressing events.
i know a lot of people still harbor resentment toward me about my activities during the vietnam war.
they see me walking around healthy and happy, and they get angry because they think i should have been over there.
maybe if i had gotten shot or killed, their husband or brother or father would still be alive today.
i may have made some mistakes when i was younger, but i like to think they were mistakes of caring too much.
she didn't seem to have any friends, but she had one encounter with a guy that was running girls on the avenue.
now, apparently, somebody stepped in and convinced this guy to leave her alone.
besides the affidavits from family and friends, he brought these with him.
they're letters from his wife before she was convicted of being an american spy and killed, okay?
so that's when the other fish came around, so then, that fish said to the other fish,
"just because the hook was there, you didn't have to bite it."
now that these guys are in jail, they don't have to pay anything.
you had no way of knowing they were gonna get arrested.
well, consider the message delivered, and don't ever call me again!
the other reason i tried to call you is to tell you that i went back to nia and found out the information you were trying to get on the kid's father.
the papers for the kid, and he's free to go with you.
until you decide to take shots at him on the beach again?
you come in here with false accusations about callgirls, hoods, politicians gone bad.
this is all very dramatic, gentlemen, but you got no proof.
and for fewer hours than if i had an office job.
anyway, i need to be apart to get ideas, she knows that.
being old is when you give up wanting to be seductive.
i'm young, but i don't need to seduce everyone all the time like you.
there's something so virginal about you, a fierce amazon look, that won't desert you.
i don't dare touch you, but i can't bear it if others do.
i've wanted to talk to you about something for a long time.
this may not be the right time, but who knows, since we're talking, let's try and solve it.
to love someone deeply, i have to love him from afar now and then.
if you loved me as i love you, we'd be married now.
they managed to make you advise them to do... what they were already doing.
no wonder your guy let you have a place in town.
but every time a woman looks at me it feels like déjà vu.
maybe because every time a woman looks at a man, the look is so charged with the eternal feminine that there's nothing personal about it.
if he doesn't ask me what i do in paris, i won't ask him.
anyway, i suspect that i have more fun than he does in town.
but my place is so small i'd have woken my wife.
and she's so suggestible, though she doesn't realize it, that on full moon nights she sleeps very lightly.
and for fewer hours than if i had an office job.
anyway, i need to be apart to get ideas, she knows that.

he should be smack-dab in the middle of the golden triangle.
he's managed to work his way into the hill country of laos.
he'll make the buy and hopefully get some pictures of curtis.
he's the number one supplier of raw opium in the world.
he caught a private flight out of laos and we don't know where to.
so, we'll have every link in the chain except for curtis.
well, i'd really like to hang him from one of those high places.
interpol is tightening the net in frankfurt, naples, rome and paris.
and jaggerman thinks they're gonna try and get at him through her, huh?
i will see jaggerman watch his precious daughter die, the way he watched francois die.
and if he hadn't been in the military, the government would not have made this an exceptional case.
inspector, in the farm house the terrorists were using, we found this in the fireplace.
i also kept it secret from the rest of the troupe.
but what i did not agree is that you ruin my reputation.
and was put up against a firing squad for his efforts.
the intelligence community's best estimate places him as part of a new terrorist group, experts recruited from various countries.
all the members have no criminal record, so they're hard to track down.
any clue as to who the leader of the group is?
well, jaggerman is convinced that they'll use the chopper to kidnap his daughter.
but we believe that she is only a small part of a much bigger plan.
look, when i was in the french resistance, we lived by our wits.
if we could not judge a traitor from one of our own, we died.
jean, what say you and i juggle our schedules and go out and grab a burger.
there's no need for sign language, if that's what you're doing.
we've got some kind of activity in one of the buildings in that area.
you might say that the fate of you and your daughter is in your own hands, mr. jaggerman.
your only chance is to keep quiet when we go through customs.
bulgaria says they brought the plane down because of a possible bomb scare.
i know, i know, and the summit conference is in two days.
if we don't get the proof that bulgaria is lying about those missiles, it's gonna be a disaster for us.
you are even a bigger fool than the last time we met.
as i recall, arkov, it took this fool to get your backside out of angola.
the man trying to buy us out, he wants to log the island.
he needs our area for access, it's the only way on or off the island.
the body's got to be sent to the mainland for an examination.
we can't call it a murder until we get an official cause of death.
how very kind of you, sir, to come to vicki in her hour of need.
the only thing she needs is for you and your men to get back on your plane.
it's not like saint john to be out of touch this long.
well, if we're lucky we can get in touch with him along the way.
you see, any man that can outrun a federal agent is a valuable asset in my book.
if you'd like to earn some extra money, you might be able to assist me in one small other matter.
those close-ups of the south china sea ought to make them happy.
what'd make me happy is a hot sauna and a nice cold beer.
if you would go right through these doors and around to the right of the building.
did you see all the high-tech junk he's got wired into this thing?
looks to me like the flight plan only crosses a couple of towns.
the call had to either come from crestridge or santa mira.
i suggest that you remember who gave a rummy doctor and this whole town a second chance.
how many people are gonna get killed before we pay back mr. lundahl?
we're talking about one of the most significant developments in ballistics since the chinese invented gunpowder.
we can actually customize the concentration of each of these explosive tips to meet any of your requirements.
our version of the m16 is not the only weapon that can utilize that kind of power.
and when it comes to armor-piercing capabilities, gentlemen, nothing beats our mark seven.
which, by the way, is capable of taking out any type of aircraft.
would you uncover that and start it up for us, please?
i think there's still a lot of good medicine i can learn from my old man.
there'll still be enough people left in santa mira to make a go of it?
well, the town is a little empty, but if one person needs a doctor, that's a reason to stay.
say, you two wouldn't mind if we signed you off duty for the night, would you?
bobby, why don't you just shut up and go to sleep?
hey, you know, i don't have to hang around for this.
when i was your age, i did my share of screwing up too, you know.
borrowed a few cars, hung around with a bunch of tough guys.
i figure it, the old man should cough up a few mill to have junior back undamaged.
i still don't like the idea of wasting a bunch of kids.
how long is it gonna take to transfer that money over to me?
if i were you i'd worry about how long you're going to live to spend it.
but the rules, rules never got in your way, did they?
general lacey's son is dead, you're up on charges and you wanna talk about rules?
lieutenant bradley frederick lacey, near in our hearts, and remember him as man who loved his country.
like many others before him, he gave his life in the service of it.
but i flew with him and despite his lack of social graces, he was one hell of a soldier.
he's a soldier with one hell of a case against him.
i would be proud to have colonel coombs as a member of any unit i command.
you, in fact, named him in-flight commander of the combined basic assault team.
he took a bunch of floppy-eared puppies and turned them into fighting men.
you have to admit, thompson is one hell of a flier.
he was a coward, a gambler, always scrounging money but he was also the general's son.
well, if coombs and brad were so close, then what was all this fighting about?
you and the others found out about it, and then after blowing him away, you hired oscar mendoza, to steal this back for you!
the general was a father and a mentor to steve coombs.
and because he loves general lacey as a father, and as a general, you knew he'd play the scapegoat.
when i was a soldier, i thought i could recognize evil.
i'll join you in a minute, i'm just gonna get the unit out.
i've put it through the best equalizers and noise-reducers money can buy.
you know, this isn't my idea of a good time, either.
but according to orders, you're my pain in the butt and i'm yours.
he spent two and a half years mia before we got him out.
then the fool went into deep undercover work for the agency just like the rest of us.
how is it no one's been able to solve this problem but you?
well, we got a hundred possibilities from multispectral sweeps, but the key was high resolution photographs.
yeah, i think it's his way of keeping me off the streets.
the fact is, we got the best of everything, right here in this room.
then i take it you've been briefed on the nature of the gas and the shielded train car.
i understand there is only one way in or out and we remain locked in with the gas until it is dumped.
if any of those canisters have even been partially compromised, they must be disposed of immediately.
you want us to bury it there without going in after locke?
the amounts of boron compound in the missile would be insignificant.
and if they miss the core, the impact could cause all three reactors to blow.
next time this door opens, we gotta make a run for it.
if we make it to airwolf, at least we stand a fighting chance.
i am therefore directing all nations of the world to establish isolated communities,
and to begin immediately deporting those with diseases to these colonies.
i would advise all those in power to watch the following very carefully.
it will become apparent why you have no option but to obey.
malduke: (on tv) i would advise all those in power to watch the following very carefully.
it will become apparent why you have no option but to obey.
as good, if not better than anything we or the soviets have up there.
the national security council and the pentagon is in a panic over it.
it mysteriously broke contact with another vessel just north of wake island.
we don't know why, but the japanese are in a cold sweat over it.
we can't approach him, and we can't locate his operations center.
we've convinced a number of countries to cooperate in giving the appearance of carrying out malduke's orders.
as i recall, the company wasn't too pleased when you resigned.
the important thing is that i've found a way to use it to serve humanity.
if i had my way, i'd have a five-day weekend, a two-day work week, and lots of holidays.
if you campaigned on that platform you could get elected president.
well, love sick or not, we still have to solve the problem with the nova seven's tracing program.
okay, i vote that we start on it without waiting for jason.
if you both cooperate, i see no need to detonate the device.
you'll see him soon enough, and you two can spend as much time together as you like.
there is always the memory of the father in the face of the son.
when one cannot kill the bull, hayashi, there is always pleasure in killing the calf.
i believe, master, i can better serve our cause with my life.
since you have not chosen death, we will choose it for you.
seems jo dropped him off here, mid-afternoon, he paid her and left.
all right, i'm gonna make another sweep of the area and i'll come on home.
rivers, saint john and jo have just vanished into thin air.
the special attack corps was also known as the divine wind.
lieutenant takeshi yahara and a kamikaze squadron broke through the fighter net around the us fleet off iwo jima.
he was going for the saratoga when a hellcat pilot put him in the sea.
no, we'll put it to work looking for saint john and jo.
if yahara was intending on hitting cheemunga, he must be based close by.
so tell me, newman, what turns a peacenik brain like badham into a political extortionist?
i mean, by god, he's willing to set off world war three!
according to british intelligence, they are the money and muscle behind badham's plan.
i've heard of them derailing arms shipments and sabotaging nuclear tests, but something like this is out of their league.
if they attempt to tamper with the system, they could cause the missiles to launch.
just find out who he's working for and we'll stop them.
lady, gents, two days for your friend to come around with the key to the code.
or, by god, we can all kiss this whole world goodbye.
i mean, we get the money, he gets the chopper and then we get out of here.
when the kgb supplied the parts for the scorpion, they did not expect the american government to find out we had it.
uh, i suppose a bath would be out of the question, huh?
i just wanna freshen up a bit before i see frank.
listen, just let me talk to jo so she can tell me herself that she's all right.
you can get back to whatever it is you really do around...
they've converted an older plant to robotic control, almost totally automated.
cranks out 20,000 megawatts of power from a control center located about five miles from the actual containment site.
i warned you that the heat tolerance would be too low in an emergency situation, and that is just what happened!
i'm not going to argue with you about paperwork, comrade bronski.
let's hope locke has managed to get us an engraved invitation.
we'll just maintain radio silence until then and hope for the best.
the number one reactor is burning out of control, the others are in jeopardy.
dr. rostov, these are the americans we have told you about.
why don't you take some of that vacation time you've still got on the books?
i understand the fishing in the baltic's pretty good this time of the year.
tell me, how does it feel to be selected representative of the german democratic republic at this international exhibition?
this is a great honor, naturlich, as is your unexpected presence.
i'm sure you and your lovely wife will have much to talk about, after your flight.
when you have changed into your equipment, we will be privileged to escort you to your aircraft.
saint john and i will try and follow from the air.
jo, you and klaus commandeer a vehicle and catch up on the ground.
the soviets were generous enough to provide me with several of these aircrafts.
unfortunately, they don't seem too eager that they should be piloted by men under my command.
and even god can't hear us over the noise of those planes.
well, i'll talk to them and see what they can do about their flight path.
it's the motherboard on half the electronics systems in that flying cracker box of yours, including the ejection seat!
now, i want to know what the hell is going on here.
not only is the plane down, but the military are going over the viper specs with a fine-tooth comb.
now, we crash a multi-million dollar aircraft and the test pilot walks away.
now, if he's alive, he's probably going to get in touch with his friends.
i've got a man on the inside, but i don't know how long he can stall them.
bonnie's doing fine, but the baby seems to be in a bad position.
now, i think you should get her down to see doc roberts as soon as possible, before her water breaks.
i couldn't see how god could allow that kind of suffering to go on.
well, i'm no theologian, but the way i see it, man is in charge of those details.
look, sandra, the toughest thing in the world is to make that decision, to take that first step.
you don't have to give up your religion to become a doctor.
but i do know my father did not die drunk, face-down in a pond.
come on, i got a friend over at the coroner's office.
the government stepped in and took away his license, but that didn't stop him.
his wife was terminally ill, and he was convinced that he could cure it.
he's quarantined in a ward with a team from the coroner's department.
he and anybody else who came in contact with this virus.
from what i can see, they aren't equipped to handle that kind of high-tech work.
if they built this bug, they got $2 million worth of hardware stashed someplace.
we'll maintain an infrared scan on the warehouse in the back in case he's got company.
oh, looks pretty quiet so far except for that one guard.
dr. harper was kind enough to inform me of your visit this afternoon.
but he forgot to tell me that he'd sold you the x-vaccine.
you sure you don't want to, uh, go to computer assist on this one, mikey?
no, i think i'll just use the same skill and concentration i used firing that laser.
i'm reading high lead content traveling 70 about 23 miles southeast of here.
that's either a very slow bullet or a very hot van.
just because the radiation scanners didn't pick up anything doesn't mean those canisters aren't split wide open inside.
yeah, we'd better stay clear till jo gets here with the radiation suits.
now, when sullivan calls, you're going to have to play it straight.
i'm feeling so rattled right now, i don't think i can do it.
when we have our weapons, we can defend our own nation,
where purebreds can live the way god meant us to live, separate and white.
just give me a hand here and i'll be out of your way in a jiffy.
just hand them up to me in the back of the truck.
you've got an organization that leaks like a sieve, and now you want airwolf!
why don't you put her in the middle of a shopping center and see who picks her up?
when it's the circuit board for the satellite, you'd better believe it's crucial.
let me check monitor two and see if our launch is still in countdown.
after slinging burgers all day, it's all i can do to keep tabs on him.
well, i have to change into something that doesn't smell like french fries.
just a scrap of silicone with microchips and yet men die for it.
countries may even go to war for the lack of it.
'the crowd cheers, 'their spirits undampened by the light november drizzle.
'inside, waiting to greet the royal party, are the stars of the film 'as well as those tireless backroom boys 'who really make it all happen behind the scenes.'

- well, and we know that you want a list of customers mr. markoda.

at a time when our prehistoric ancestors have not killed each other they were engaged primarily search of food - fishing, game hunting, gathering fruits, - all were in abundance.
in the forests ran enough beasts, rivers were full of fish, it was at the beginning of the world, a paradise on earth.
last night, it was just as if i'd seen him the day before.
devon, you said he appeared to die of a heart attack.
you may not be interested in his treasure, but obviously somebody else is.
are you trying to tell me that this person cut my cinch?
if it'll save your life, i don't have any other choice.
if i agree, will you let me stop at the dorm and pack my things?
no, but devon spoke of deciphering a key which is hidden in her locket.
i have a feeling i'd be a natural at that particular aspect of the hunt.
as executor of charlie's estate and guardian to his daughter for the last 20 years,
i've a legal and moral responsibility to take care of the dispensation of any treasure to katherine.
i agreed to talk to you because your credentials checked out.
but until a lot of questions have been answered to my complete satisfaction,
i used to hold onto this all the time just to make me feel like he was close by.
remember when you were a little kid and you'd run into your parents' room in the night when the thunder got too loud?
katherine, your father wanted this treasure to be your 21st birthday present.
can't you forgive him and at least grant him his one last wish?
kitt, in all of charlie's adventures, was there ever mention of a treasure inside a locket, on a picture, or anything like that?
in one case, he found a small chest of jewels behind the portrait of a portuguese king.

i'm terribly sorry, michael, but he had such a head start.
michael, you have a tux to rent and a banquet to attend.
and i still have some christmas things to take care of.
i thought bruno would be glad to have the motor turned over once in a while.
if you want the car, have to phone down for it.
in the end, the only thing that really worried me... was that he'd send some rubbish after me.
and i thought, if i got somebody good... somebody who could do the job proper... then i could do my bit.
i'd say a quick run up through france and then over the drink.
that's your only problem, seems to me... getting me over the water.

airwolf is hidden somewhere in the western wilderness by its test pilot, stringfellow hawke to be returned to the u.s. government only if his brother, saint john, an mia in vietnam, can be found.
the deputy director of the intelligence agency that developed airwolf is michael coldsmith-briggs iii, code name archangel.
capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets and backed by unmatched firepower,
airwolf is a weapon too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands.
trained them personally at langley so they wouldn't screw up, like they did in iran.
at the last minute, the state department pulled the rug from under him.
did a man named, uh, dominic santini come to see me?
there's lots of news that you have to catch up on, mr. hawke.
your emotions must be going in a lot of different directions at the moment.
a good friend dead, a brother coming back as if from the dead.
press representatives were called to buckingham palace yesterday afternoon to hear her majesty's press secretary read a short statement describing what many suspected and what now has been confirmed.:
that prince charles and lady di have called it a day.
you know, it's funny, but i was confined to a cell maybe a third the size of this room.
but i learned to have total freedom in my mind here.
i used think through some of the most incredibly detailed projects.
i built a house once. lt was, uh... i cut every two-by-four in my mind, hammered in every nail.
a mercenary who'll work for anybody with change in their pocket.
right, left, or center, their political persuasion means nothing to him in any way.
the deputy director of the intelligence agency that developed airwolf, is michael goldsmith briggs iii, codename, archangel.
believed to covertly provide classified information and support to hawke in exchange for flying the chopper on missions of national interest.
together, santini and hawke fly airwolf, capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets and backed by unmatched firepower,
airwolf is a weapon too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands.
yes, but he is also colonel helmut kruger who ran an extermination squad at dachau.
whoever he is, kidnapping a man from a neutral country is not my normal line of business.
i've been his researcher ever since he discovered that i could type.
together we brought... we brought 23 nazi war criminals to trial.
gentlemen, if you glance into the courtyard here, you will see the latest american surface-to-air missile system, codename, thor.
it is unique, in that its 4 simultaneously fired missiles have both heat-seeking as well as radar-targeting systems.
now, the deed holders have american names but the real owner is kruger.
yeah, i heard a tv commentator do about an hour on that guy.
hey, you've worked this out pretty well, but what if we fail?
well, if we fail, then no one will know, will they?
how come i don't like what you're doin', but i'm enjoying it?
because, very much like my father, you have a zest for laughter, mr. santini.
we'll be off the coast of baja, mexico, in about, 20 minutes.
we'll fly low till we turn inland for that fuel pickup.
well, are you planning on smiling anytime in the near future?
because if so, i'll have any medical attention you should need
as i was telling you, this compound goes back to 1879, originally constructed by the paloma family, when they immigrated from spain.
this, at one time, was the wine cellar, but as you see, it's been converted to an ordinance supply facility.
certainly, you have an extensive arsenal here, one of the largest and the most sophisticated i've ever seen, [laughing]
but you cannot compete with the major powers of the world.
but whatever archangel has going with kruger is far more important than even airwolf, or he wouldn't have given kruger our scanning frequencies.
look, we could have been blown out of the sky last night.
the eye patch is most charming, after all, it is almost a national symbol in my country.
but the cane, the cane makes you look as if you are asking for sympathy.
check the frequency our sparrows are set to and jam them.
yeah, but what if theirs are set on a different frequency?
the deputy director of the intelligence agency that developed airwolf, is michael goldsmith briggs iii, codename, archangel.
believed to covertly provide classified information and support to hawke in exchange for flying the chopper on missions of national interest.
together, santini and hawke fly airwolf, capable of speeds rivaling the fastest jets and backed by unmatched firepower,
airwolf is a weapon too dangerous to be left in unenlightened hands.
yes, but he is also colonel helmut kruger who ran an extermination squad at dachau.
whoever he is, kidnapping a man from a neutral country is not my normal line of business.
i've been his researcher ever since he discovered that i could type.
together we brought... we brought 23 nazi war criminals to trial.
the penetrating aircraft might be able to evade one, or 2, or even 3 missiles, but, never 4.
which makes thor the ultimate defense weapon at $10 million only a unit.
yes, a pleasant lunch, excellent wine, and now we watch as you blow up a radio-controlled drone.
i would never insult your intelligence or your purchasing power with drones.
now, the deed holders have american names but the real owner is kruger.
yeah, i heard a tv commentator do about an hour on that guy.
hey, you've worked this out pretty well, but what if we fail?
well, if we fail, then no one will know, will they?
well, i figured we might as well look on the bright side of things, eh?
how come i don't like what you're doin', but i'm enjoying it?
we'll be off the coast of baja, mexico, in about, 20 minutes.
we'll fly low till we turn inland for that fuel pickup.
well, are you planning on smiling anytime in the near future?
because if so, i'll have any medical attention you should need in case your skin should crack, or your ears should fall off.
certainly, you have an extensive arsenal here, one of the largest and the most sophisticated i've ever seen,
but you cannot compete with the major powers of the world.
well, going in with airwolf's guns blazing is not the way to accomplish that.
it's not getting kruger out of here into israel alive that's troubling you, is it?
look, i know that airwolf belonged to the firm before you took it.
but whatever archangel has going with kruger is far more important than even airwolf, or he wouldn't have given kruger our scanning frequencies.
look, we could have been blown out of the sky last night.
those weapons they fired at airwolf last night wouldn't penetrate it.
you are not the only supplier of missiles in the world, archangel.
no, but i am the only one who can supply you with systems as sophisticated as thor.
i will use him to lead our air force friends to it.
have a beacon installed in his jeep, and be sure that it's on a frequency that the helicopter can't detect.
the eye patch is most charming, after all, it is almost a national symbol in my country.
but the cane, the cane makes you look as if you are asking for sympathy.
the guard tractator here will restrain it while i show you more of our work here.
it is certainly a very convincing replica of the humanoid life form.
well, as you can see, from this panel gravis i control all of the main tardis functions.
the time coordinates, spatial coordinates... all inoperative at the moment, of course, because the spatial distribution circuits are switched in.
i shouldn't think it's even within your powers to reassemble them.
besides, what would you want with an old type 40 time and relative dimension in space machine, hmm?
oh no no, but quite harmless... and as long as we keep him isolated from the other tractators, he'll stay that way.
we can't go dragging around the universe with a dormant gravis on the console...?
well, the first thing we'll do... is drop him off on some uninhabited planet.
brave man, this doctor - travelling with the gravis on board?
but surely you'll stay a while longer and enjoy some of the new colony we're building?
oh no no, far too much repair work of my own to be done.
tanners, washermen, birdshooters-- they just come walking in as though they owned the house.
you'd think it was an inn, and not a decent hindu's house.
i was about to come with him to his house when he died suddenly.
the question is-- how long is the corpse going to lie there?
maharaj - you made him chop wood - made him work so hard - when he had fever only the other day.
he had nothing to eat this morning he had no strength - ...yet you made him work.
what harm has he done you that you were so cruel?
i don't know why you had to ask him to split wood.
-i'll get on my computer and warn dr. alkazar at the lab.
-prime's already on his way there, and bumblebee's gonna call bluestreak and prowl.
i still remember the night... .. when you were sending doctors one after another.
please ask the doctor to go out for a few minutes.
because i know... .. that he cannot get his father's love from his father.
a person who cannot come to see his dying wife... .. how can he take care of his son?
at an age when children are unable to digest milk... .. at such an age, you started serving brandy to vicky.
when he sneezed, you made him to drink 2 teaspoonfuls of brandy.
when he wept, you wanted him to be served with 2 teaspoonfuls of brandy.
only because you didn't want your business meetings to be disturbed.
today, the very 2 teaspoonfuls have grown into a full bottle.
it's because of my love that your son is still alive.
the amarnath kapoor, of whom i was the only friend... .. he has become lost in the world of wealth.
your craving for wealth has made me a servant from being your friend.
what can make a teacher more joyous... .. that his student grows up to become a decent citizen.
looking at you today... .. i feel as if my desires and hopes have been realised.
whenever i pass through this road, my feet stop her automatically.
it seems as if it carries some noble person's shadow... .. which forces me to stop.
how many times have i told you that when bottles are emptied... .. they should be disposed of?
perhaps you don't know that even empty bottles have some value.
you just told me that a person who doesn't understand an artiste... .. is not a human being.
on this, i would like to say that... .. one who doesn't understand a human being, is also not an artiste.
where does one witness the crop of laughs coming up these days?
only a madman laughs... .. otherwise who smiles upon been born into this world?
you may assume that he's my father, my mother, my teacher, my everything.
mr. vicky, by coming here, you have added a lot of colour to our show.
in response to that, if you accept this admirers small gift... .. i will be very happy.
the happiness that i had surely heard about and which... .. i saw yesterday too.
but being a poor woman, i won't be able to bear its burden.
to relieve the burden on the heart of your admirer... .. you will have to lift this burden.
but that's the day when i was made to appear on this earth.
i don't know whether i was made to appear or thrown in here... .. but it's my birthday on the 13th.
the doctor said that i should get her operated with a senior doctor.
i have told about it to the senior boss several times.
if your mother prays for me... .. i will feel like i have won the world.
if i win the world, i will stand before the world and say...
whatever liquor is produced in the factory... .. mr. vicky will be consuming more than half the quantity.
yes, i will consume more than half the quantity... .. because i am a drunkard.
for this project, you had better choose people... .. who are prepared to hear your son's abuses.
in future, if at all, the meetings will be held in my office.
if there is anything still left... .. you may pacify your fury by cursing me too!
these people who have just walked away... .. they could never ever dare to speak to me in the face.
you just need slaves, who like a machine... .. start moving when the button is pressed... .. and stop when the button is switched off.
if you have to survive in today's world... .. you have to keep the buttons in your control.
as for laughing, let me tell you that... .. i have never laughed in my life.
i have only laughed loudly responding to the hollow laughs of people.
you have only heard the bursts of laughter from a distance.
you have never come closer and seen the tears stuck in them.
yes, daddy, you provided me everything which can be... .. bought from the market and decorated at home.
but you never provided me the happiness... .. which can be decorated within one's heart.
looking at you, i remembered the story of the king... .. who had been blessed that all that he touches will turn to gold.
once, the king put his hands on his progeny by mistake... .. and it turned to gold.
you didn't even make the mistake that was committed by the king.
neither did you lift me in your arms, nor embraced me.
because you feared that if you touched me... .. i could turn to gold.
if i would turn to gold... .. who would sign the documents of your businesses... .. which you have started in my name?
come out of your world of wealth and have a look.
this world of wealth has submerged in liquor... .. and made me a useless person and a moving corpse.
and if the progeny is useless and good-for-nothing... .. even then what's the necessity of accumulating wealth?
if you continue to toss money like this, there will be a time when...
if one removes a couple of mugs of water from an ocean... .. does it make any difference to the ocean?
if you feel that i am causing losses to you... .. why don't you disassociate me?
yes, remind me that a special guest will be coming tomorrow.
cut the cake quickly because some people are waiting for me.
i will always hold this precious gift close to my heart all my life.
i will die of thirst, but i will never drink it.
now look... in my attempts to add weight to my statements... .. i have lost my own weight.
you have landed a decent man like me in a soup.
within no time, you made a real necklace into a fake one.
i had issued a cheque of 9 lakhs when i brought this necklace.
each of her eye was shedding tears worth a lakh of rupees each.
two tears rolled out of one eye, and then two from the other eye.
but i care about the necklace which i had bought for that valuable neck.
which is that valuable neck for which you are becoming so worried?
you may assume that she is going to be my wife.
and it is your responsibility now to search for that necklace.
yes, i have got to know the truth about the necklace.
but i haven't been able to know what kind of a thing you are.
in his plot to loot mr. vicky's wealth... .. he tried to make me help him.
if one has to do all this for one's daily bread... .. it's much better to die of starvation.
just because i asked them the whereabouts of my meena... .. they brandished a knife, and put it on my neck... .. and they removed my chain.
thereafter they immediately... .. removed my watch, then my purse, and then my finger ring.
then move the chair, and give a blow to one of them...
then hold another by his neck, and hit him on his stomach... .. so that he falls down on the other hand.
he will shake you up, but he won't do you a thing.
it is the one on the front who will do something.
tell those scoundrels that if anybody asks meena's whereabouts... .. they shouldn't tell the address.
on one hand, it's you, and on the other are those scoundrels!
if meena is a dancing girl, what were those girls... .. who were exxposing one another in public?
a walking-talking advertisement the filthy books which can be read by anybody?
but i have every right to take decisions about my life.
if you want to make that worthless dancer my daughter-in-law... .. you had better know that this is my home, not a whorehouse... .. where one can hear the tinkling sounds all round the clock.
i must have spent at least 50 lakhs for decorating your room.
and you, who lives in such grandeur... .. the only son of raisaheb amarnath...
a home where there is no justice... .. why should there be the scale ofjustice there?
a home where there is no light... .. why should there be a chandelier there?
you all know very well how much he has served you all.
but now, after winning the elections... .. mr. kapoor would want to love you as much as... .. a father loves his progeny!
in my lonely life, i too had got a little love.
but he chopped off my love's neck with the sword of wealth.
i used to think that i am the son of a millionaire.
but today i realised that i am the son of a beggar... .. who is standing before you today begging for votes.
once i had given these things to some decent people... .. to find meena's address.
today, to find my own address, to identify my own self... .. i am handing over these things to a decent man again.
but in a home where the blind live... .. in such a home, it's necessary that a stick remains there.
these wealthy people use only sticks made of gold and silver.
yes, the same noble person whom i had been searching since childhood.
the one who paid for all my educational exxpenses... .. and made me reach this destination.
as for going to your home... .. i know why you are being so kind to me.
you have your only daughter... .. and you want to fulfill her desire.
and dumped him like a fake coin which is of no use.
but the one who brought up that fake coin with his own hands... .. the one who served you all his life... .. your one-time poor friend, munshi phoolchand...
then can i not lift him in my hands for a day?
but before leaving, i would surely want to tell you this.
but the day you will die... .. your son won't go to perform the last rites.
because after lighting up munshiji's pyre... .. your right will be burnt to ashes in that fire.
the one who was on the verge of killing all the doctors.
can he not do our small job for the sake of his child?
what's the use of using force on an artiste like me?
i have come only to pass on their message to you.
the ones who have taken away your child... .. they have threatened to kill me too.
they have said that if i don't pass their message to you... .. they will kill me and feed me to the dogs.
i can commit even a thousand murders for my son's life.
but remember... if something happens to my child... .. i will kill you too.
this is the wealthy person who merely gave birth to his son.
and dumped him like a fake coin which is of no use.
you have been born in this world because of mr. kapoor.
if not being his blood relation, save him in the name of humanity.
if mr. kapoor is in such a great hurry to go up above, why delay?
make him go so high that he cannot come back on the earth... .. and claim that we had made him sign the documents forcibly.
when he wept, you wanted him to be served with two teaspoonfuls of brandy.
only because you didn't want your business meetings to be disturbed.
today, the very two teaspoonfuls ha ve grown into a full bottle.
it's because of my love that your son is still alive.
your craving for wealth has made me a servant from being your friend.
it was because of my love for vicky that i was holding on here.
"let me drink from your eyes, o crazy sweetheart of mine."
"let me drink from your eyes, o crazy sweetheart of mine."
but that's the day when i was made to appear on this earth.
i don't know whether i was made to appear or thrown in here..
mr. vicky is a shareholder, and he's also the largest buyer.
mr. vicky will be consuming more than half the quantity we'll produce.
you have only heard the bursts of laughter from a distance.
you have never come closer and seen the tears stuck in them.
neither did you lift me in your arms, nor embraced me.
because you feared that if you touched me, i could turn to gold.
and if he is useless, what's the point in amassing wealth?
if you continue to toss money like this, there will be a time when..
i will always hold this precious gift close to my heart all my life.
i will die of thirst, but i will never drink it.
..that two decent people are sitting and talking with each other.
now it seems that i am standing and you are sitting.
at the rate of one lakh each, she shed tears worth 12 lakhs.
before she shed any more tears, i told her that the necklace is fake.
but i care about the necklace which i had bought for that valuable neck.
which is that valuable neck for which you are becoming so worried?
you may assume that she is going to be my wife.
and it is your responsibility now to search for that necklace.
yes, i have got to know the truth about the necklace.
but i haven't been able to know what kind of a thing you are.
i will pour acid on her face and make it so horrible..
..that people won't come near her even to give her alms.
otherwise, the police will find the corpses of both of you..
..in a condition that they will not know who is who?
..then when he will try to punch again, push the second one.
when he tries to punch the third time, push the third one.
look, child, i can give my entire wealth for this handkerchief.
but for the time being, all the money that is in this purse..
..what were those girls who were exposing one another in public?
a mobile advertisement.. the filthy books which can be read by anybody?
..you better know that this is my home, not a dirty place..
..where one can hear the tinkling sounds all round the clock.
i used to think that i am the son of a millionaire.
but today i realised that i am the son of a beggar..
today, to find my own address, to identify my own self..
..i am handing over these things to a decent man again.
but, there ought to be a walking stick where the blind live.
these wealthy people use only sticks made of gold and silver.
that money order was lying locked in the lockers of wealthy people.
i merely opened the locker and delivered the money to you.
all my life, i was walking with the support of wealth.
today, i am attempting to walk on m y own feet.
by taking you to my home, i want to give your father a fitting reply.
nobody but i can give a fitting reply to my father.
and dumped him like a fake coin which is of no use.
but the one who brought up that fake coin with his own hands..
..you have some time to spare to participate in his funeral.
or even today you are in the midst of a meeting worth crores?
then can i not lift him in my hands for a day?
but before leaving, i would surely want to tell you this.
you have been born in this world because of mr. kapoor.
if not being his blood relation, save him in the name of humanity.
we spent three weeks running through forests and swamps, to arrive with cameras in this small settlement.
miskito indians are about 140,000 long live isolated for centuries and the atlantic coast of nicaragua.
the highlands of the interior and the western part of nicaragua are not yet today reached land.
given the little importance of the area extension and marshes, is not never tried to build a road.
the latest to put under pressure on the miskito were the soldiers of somoza, who plundered many settlements.
in the struggle of the revolutionary sandinistas against somoza and the cia, the miskito fighting alongside sandisti.
many weapons come from stocks eastern bloc, taken away by deserters and stolen during the attacks.
now we are on the atlantic coast, in the heart of nicaragua.
or rather, was the place where stood up to two years ago.
in a vast along the rio coco, to sandisti reduced to ashes over 60 villages.
they had wounds everywhere on arms, face, body, because of navajuelas, leaves sharp as razor blades.
they spent the night under the trees, torn apart by mosquito bites.
he was sitting on the veranda, when a team of sandisti surrounded the village.
then they swept in the village of refugees and only then they realized who were sandisti.
but he is not able to escape, why were now too close.
then they imprisoned all men who could take them brought to church, and they tied his hands.
then they were thrown to the ground and one has put a knife the neck to make him talk, but he had nothing to confess.
then they told sandisti very hard to be men and wanted to demonstrate because they were brave.
the boys are recruited by force by sandisti, and then be thrown into battle almost no training, are fighting against us for the liberation of nicaragua.
they, like good children of nicaragua, by good indians have joined us.
this reminds me of a sad story when i was 14.
i was in berlin, during the last weeks the war against the russians.
has happened to us 40 years ago, and continues to repeat itself in the world.
when i look at these children, i see them already dead.
flower among flowers, flower of my love, come to me and give me your love.
flower among flowers, flower of my love, come to me and give me your love.
the leonov will reach discovery almost a year before you are ready.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
you got the joint chiefs screaming about russian satellites with anti-missile lasers.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has decided that the nca should be put under the defense department's authority.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
the russians are gonna go aboard discovery with or without us.
ask him if he wants them to have all the answers.
but just suppose...that it had something to do with the monolith?
now before you get that look on your face just listen to me for a minute.
the time has come to put ourselves in an orbit around io which is where the discovery is.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.
the atmosphere will slow us down, and jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side.
of course, the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here.
since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as i am.
whenever a president is gonna get us into serious trouble they always use lincoln.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying hoping the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
the drive system could be operated manually so we were able to pull discovery away from its decaying orbit around io.
i must say, the farther away i get from io the happier i am.
well, all the environment circuits are fed to this one here.
yeah, but this is the one that feeds into hal, right?
i want you to install this little baby right about there inside the cable trunk.
i want you to put it where nobody can find it without a deliberate search.
with convenient nonstops to the moon and all major space stations, on pan am the sky is no longer the limit.
secretary of state caulfield met with the president for two hours this morning at the white house.
we will carry that conference live followed by a special report immediately afterward.
we have an unconfirmed report that the president is going to announce a full-scale military alert tonight.
there is a launch window in 31 days when earth is in the proper position.
there is enough fuel on board for a low consumption route that will enable discovery to return in 28 months.
the mission has been completed and you've carried out your program very well.
and now, hal, if you will excuse us for a moment we wish to have a private conversation.
i've erased all of hal's memory from the moment the trouble started.
the 9,000 series uses holographic memories so chronological erasures would not work.
discovery's mission to jupiter was in the advanced planning stages when the first monolith was found on the moon and sent its signal to jupiter.
by direct presidential order, the existence of that monolith was kept secret.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery unassisted, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in case the crew was incapacitated or killed.
the soviet ambassador has been expelled along with the entire staff.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
all american personnel are ordered to leave soviet territory immediately or they will be placed under arrest.
hal seems to be reactivated and is functioning well enough to operate the onboard systems.
the leonov has enough fuel for a low consumption trajectory that will arrive 12 months earlier.
i know that trust doesn't come easy with what's going on.
i can't just order us to leave here for no reason. i am under orders and so are you.
even if i should trust you, which i'm not sure that i do or even if i should want to leave here for no reason, i can't, and neither can you.
we don't have enough fuel until earth is in the correct position which is three weeks away.
you have enough fuel in the leonov for the trip home.
we use the docking ring in the leonov to attach to the discovery.
i have enough problems without you pulling some kind of a stunt.
i only hope there's a world left for you to return to.
report to ground as to what is going on and make that report immediately!
and while you're at it, could you please check out a black spot on jupiter that has been detected by satellite telescope.
otherwise, why would we be leaving weeks ahead of our launch window?
whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference.
what if hal turns them off before the fuel is gone?
once he fires the engine, i can always disconnect him if i have to.
i enjoy working with human beings and have stimulating relationships with them.
we enjoy working with you, hal, and we will continue to do so even if we are separated by great distance.
you can tell them that you remember when there was a pitch black sky with no bright star, and people feared the night.
you can tell them when we were alone when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves there is life out there.
you can tell your children of the day when everyone looked up and realized that we were only tenants of this world.
we have been given a new lease and a warning from the landlord.
the leonov will reach discovery almost a year before you are ready.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has decided that the nca should be put under the defense department's authority.

of course, the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here.
since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as i am.
we're going to send a boarding party over to climb inside this 800-foot-long shipwreck floating over io to see if she can be rescued before her orbit gives out.
there are nine years of secrets inside including a sleeping computer who knows the answers.
whenever a president is gonna get us into serious trouble they always use lincoln.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying hoping the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
the drive system could be operated manually so we were able to pull discovery away from its decaying orbit around io.

i've erased all of hal's memory from the moment the trouble started.
the 9,000 series uses holographic memories so chronological erasures would not work.
so as the function of the command crew, bowman and poole, was to get discovery to its destination, it was decided that they shouldn't be informed.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery unassisted, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in case the crew was incapacitated or killed.
he was given full knowledge of the true objective and instructed not to reveal anything to bowman or poole.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
as a result, by direct presidential order, the three of you must leave the leonov.
no russian citizen is allowed to remain on or allowed to enter the discovery.
only communications of an emergency distress nature are allowed between the leonov and discovery.
i know you people are caught in the middle of this.
even if i should trust you, which i'm not sure that i do or even if i should want to leave here for no reason, i can't, and neither can you.
we don't have enough fuel until earth is in the correct position which is three weeks away.
you have enough fuel in the leonov for the trip home.
we use the docking ring in the leonov to attach to the discovery.
i have enough problems without you pulling some kind of a stunt.
i only hope there's a world left for you to return to.
report to ground as to what is going on and make that report immediately!
and while you're at it, could you please check out a black spot on jupiter that has been detected by satellite telescope.
i enjoy working with human beings and have stimulating relationships with them.
we enjoy working with you, hal, and we will continue to do so even if we are separated by great distance.
you can tell them that you remember when there was a pitch black sky with no bright star, and people feared the night.
you can tell them when we were alone when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves there is life out there.
you can tell your children of the day when everyone looked up and realized that we were only tenants of this world.
we have been given a new lease and a warning from the landlord.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
it's a distinction that will look splendid on the front page of pravda.
a russian craft flown by russians carrying a few poor americans who need our help....
that also doesn't look too bad on the front page of pravda.
you got the joint chiefs screaming about russian satellites with anti-missile lasers.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has decided that the nca should be put under the defense department's authority.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
it's got lots of stuff in it that's bad for you.
i've been thinking about it and i don't want you to come to my lecture.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.
the atmosphere will slow us down, and jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side.
if all goes well, we'll wind up in a gentle orbit around io.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying hoping the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
i just hope that there is an earth to return to.
europa, for all its cold gray, is a lot more comforting.
i tell you, victor, there's some kind of new life down there trying to get through all that ice.
we'll see if our computer brain surgeon and psychiatrist can put hal back together again.
to tell you the truth, i don't know if hal is homicidal, suicidal, neurotic, psychotic or just plain broken.
we don't know what it is, except that it's large and seems to have some purpose.
if you want to send a pod down, send an unmanned one.
the president has scheduled a news conference this evening at nine o'clock, eastern standard time.
we will carry that conference live followed by a special report immediately afterward.
we have an unconfirmed report that the president is going to announce a full-scale military alert tonight.
white house sources have refused to confirm or deny that report.
discovery's mission to jupiter was in the advanced planning stages when the first monolith was found on the moon and sent its signal to jupiter.
by direct presidential order, the existence of that monolith was kept secret.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery unassisted, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in case the crew was incapacitated or killed.
the soviet ambassador has been expelled along with the entire staff.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
all american personnel are ordered to leave soviet territory immediately or they will be placed under arrest.
hal seems to be reactivated and is functioning well enough to operate the onboard systems.
the leonov has enough fuel for a low consumption trajectory that will arrive 12 months earlier.
i know that trust doesn't come easy with what's going on.
i can't just order us to leave here for no reason.
we use the docking ring in the leonov to attach to the discovery.
then we use the discovery as a booster rocket for the launch.
i only hope there's a world left for you to return to.
report to ground as to what is going on and make that report immediately!
and while you're at it, could you please check out a black spot on jupiter that has been detected by satellite telescope.
it is on the dark side and should be coming around your way in four hours.
to get enough velocity for an escape launch with earth that far out of position we will need a full power burn from discovery of over 120 seconds.
if the engines shut down too early we will not have enough velocity to get back home.
otherwise, why would we be leaving weeks ahead of our launch window?
whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference.
what if hal turns them off before the fuel is gone?
once he fires the engine, i can always disconnect him if i have to.
they will record that the next day the president of the united states looked out the white house window and the premier of the soviet union looked out the kremlin window and saw the new distant sun in the sky.
they read the message, and perhaps they learned something because they finally recalled their ships and their planes.
an embassy for an intelligence beyond ours a shape of some kind for something that has no shape.
your children will be born in a world of two suns.
you can tell them when we were alone when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves there is life out there.
someday the children of the new sun will meet the children of the old.
the leonov will reach discovery almost a year before you people are ready.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.

the president has come to the conclusion that the nca should be under the jurisdiction of defense.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
it's got lots of stuff in it that's bad for you.
listen, i've been thinking about it and i don't want you to come to my lecture.
but suppose, just suppose, that it had something to do with the monolith?
now, before you get that look on your face, just listen to me for a minute.
the time has come to put ourselves in an orbit around lo which is where the discovery is.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aerobraking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.
the atmosphere will slow us down, and jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side.
of course, the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here.
since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as i am.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying to hope the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
right now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
i just hope that there is an earth to return to.
europa, for all its cold gray, is a lot more comforting.
i tell you, victor, there's some kind of new life down there trying to get through all that ice.
we'll see if our computer brain surgeon and psychiatrist can put hal back together again.
to tell you the truth, i don't know if hal is homicidal, suicidal, neurotic, psychotic or just plain broken.
well, all the environment circuits are fed through this one here.
yeah, yeah, but this is the one that feeds into hal, right?
i want you to install this little baby right about there inside the cable trunk.
i want you to put it where nobody can find it without a deliberate search.

discovery's mission to jupiter was already in the advanced stages when the first small monolith was found and sent its signal toward jupiter.
by direct presidential order, the existence of that monolith was kept secret.

so as the function of the command crew, bowman and poole, was to get discovery to its destination, it was decided that they shouldn't be informed.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.

we'll see if our computer brain surgeon and psychiatrist can put hal back together again.
to tell you the truth, i don't know if hal is homicidal, suicidal, neurotic, psychotic or just plain broken.
we don't know what it is, except that it's large and seems to have some purpose.
if you want to send a pod down, send an unmanned one.
the president has scheduled a news conference this evening at nine o'clock, eastern standard time.
we will carry that conference live followed by a special report immediately afterward.
we have an unconfirmed report that the president is going to announce a full-scale military alert tonight.
white house sources have refused to confirm or deny that report.
discovery's mission to jupiter was in the advanced planning stages when the first monolith was found on the moon and sent its signal to jupiter.
by direct presidential order, the existence of that monolith was kept secret.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery unassisted, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in case the crew was incapacitated or killed.
the soviet ambassador has been expelled along with the entire staff.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
all american personnel are ordered to leave soviet territory immediately or they will be placed under arrest.
hal seems to be reactivated and is functioning well enough to operate the onboard systems.
the leonov has enough fuel for a low consumption trajectory that will arrive 12 months earlier.
i know that trust doesn't come easy with what's going on.
i can't just order us to leave here for no reason.
we use the docking ring in the leonov to attach to the discovery.
then we use the discovery as a booster rocket for the launch.
i only hope there's a world left for you to return to.
report to ground as to what is going on and make that report immediately!
and while you're at it, could you please check out a black spot on jupiter that has been detected by satellite telescope.
it is on the dark side and should be coming around your way in four hours.
to get enough velocity for an escape launch with earth that far out of position we will need a full power burn from discovery of over 120 seconds.
if the engines shut down too early we will not have enough velocity to get back home.
otherwise, why would we be leaving weeks ahead of our launch window?
whether we are based on carbon or silicon makes no fundamental difference.
what if hal turns them off before the fuel is gone?
once he fires the engine, i can always disconnect him if i have to.
they will record that the next day the president of the united states looked out the white house window and the premier of the soviet union looked out the kremlin window and saw the new distant sun in the sky.
they read the message, and perhaps they learned something because they finally recalled their ships and their planes.
an embassy for an intelligence beyond ours a shape of some kind for something that has no shape.
your children will be born in a world of two suns.
you can tell them when we were alone when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves there is life out there.
someday the children of the new sun will meet the children of the old.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
it's a distinction that will look splendid on the front page of "pravda".
a russian craft flown by russians carrying a few poor americans who need our help...
that also doesn't look too bad on the front page of "pravda".
you got the joint chiefs screaming about russian satellites with anti-missile lasers.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has decided that the nca should be put under the defense department's authority.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
it's got lots of stuff in it that's bad for you.
i've been thinking about it and i don't want you to come to my lecture.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.
the atmosphere will slow us down, and jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side.
if all goes well, we'll wind up in a gentle orbit around lo.
whenever a president is gonna get us into serious trouble they always use lincoln.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying hoping the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
the drive system could be operated manually so we were able to pull discovery away from its decaying orbit around lo.
i must say, the farther away i get from lo the happier i am.
well, all the environment circuits are fed to this one here.
yeah, but this is the one that feeds into hal, right?
i want you to install this little baby right about there inside the cable trunk.
i want you to put it where nobody can find it without a deliberate search.
with convenient nonstops to the moon and all major space stations, on pan am the sky is no longer the limit.
secretary of state caulfield met with the president for two hours this morning at the white house.
we will carry that conference live followed by a special report immediately afterward.
we have an unconfirmed report that the president is going to announce a full-scale military alert tonight.
there is a launch window in 31 days when earth is in the proper position.
there is enough fuel on board for a low consumption route that will enable discovery to return in 28 months.
the mission has been completed and you've carried out your program very well.
and now, hal, if you will excuse us for a moment we wish to have a private conversation.
i've erased all of hal's memory from the moment the trouble started.
the 9,000 series uses holographic memories so chronological erasures would not work.
so as the function of the command crew, bowman and poole, was to get discovery to its destination, it was decided that they shouldn't be informed.
the investigative team was trained and put in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery unassisted, it was decided that he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in case the crew was incapacitated or killed.
he was given full knowledge of the true objective and instructed not to reveal anything to bowman or poole.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
as a result, by direct presidential order, the three of you must leave the leonov.
no russian citizen is allowed to remain on or allowed to enter the discovery.
only communications of an emergency distress nature are allowed between the leonov and discovery.
i know you people are caught in the middle of this.
i know that trust doesn't come easy with what's going on.
i can't just order us to leave here for no reason.

the russians are gonna go aboard discovery with or without us.
ask him if he wants them to have all the answers.
but just suppose...that it had something to do with the monolith?
now before you get that look on your face just listen to me for a minute.
the time has come to put ourselves in an orbit around io which is where the discovery is.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.

of course, the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here.
since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as i am.

you can tell them when we were alone when we couldn't point to the light and say to ourselves there is life out there.
you can tell your children of the day when everyone looked up and realized that we were only tenants of this world.
we have been given a new lease and a warning from the landlord.
the leonov will reach discovery almost a year before you people are ready.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
a russian craft flown by russians carrying a few poor americans who need our help.
that also doesn't look too bad on the front page of pravda.
you got the joint chiefs screaming about russian satellites with antimissile lasers.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has come to the conclusion that the nca should be under the jurisdiction of defense.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
but suppose, just suppose, that it had something to do with the monolith?
now, before you get that look on your face, just listen to me for a minute.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aerobraking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.
the atmosphere will slow us down, and jupiter's gravity will grab hold of us and slingshot us around behind the dark side.
if all goes well, we'll wind up in a gentle orbit around lo.
whenever a president is gonna get us into serious trouble they always use lincoln.
i don't know if we're gonna be at war or not.
it's terrifying to hope the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
right now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
europa, for all its cold gray, is a lot more comforting.
i tell you, victor, there's some kind of new life down there trying to get through all that ice.
we'll see if our computer brain surgeon and psychiatrist can put hal back together again.
to tell you the truth, i don't know if hal is homicidal, suicidal, neurotic, psychotic or just plain broken.
we don't know what the hell it is except that it's very large and seems to have some purpose.
if you want to send a pod down, send an unmanned one.
we will, of course, carry that conference live followed by a special report immediately afterward.
we have an unconfirmed report that the president is going to announce a full-scale military alert tonight.
there is a launch window in 31 days when earth is in the proper position.
there is enough fuel on board for a low consumption route that will enable discovery to return in 28 months.
the mission has been completed and you have carried out your program very well.
and now, hal, if you will excuse us for a moment we wish to have a private conversation.
i've erased all of hal's memory from the moment the trouble started.
the 9000 series uses holographic memories so chronological erasures would not work.
- so as the function of the command crew bowman and poole was to get discovery to its destination it was decided they shouldn't be informed.
the investigative team was trained separately and placed in hibernation before the voyage began.
since hal was capable of operating discovery without human assistance it was decided he should be programmed to complete the mission autonomously in the event the crew was incapacitated or killed.
he was given full knowledge of the true objective and instructed not to reveal anything to bowman or poole.
all american air defense and satellite defense forces are on full alert.
premier ulonova made a televised address and said that technically a state of war exists between our two countries.
as a result, by direct presidential order, the three of you must leave the leonov.
no russian citizen is allowed to remain on or allowed to enter the discovery.
only communications of an emergency distress nature are allowed between the leonov and discovery.
i know you people are caught in the middle of this.
now, i know that trust doesn't come easy with what's going on.
i can't just order us to leave here for no reason.
we use the docking ring in the leonov to attach to the discovery.
then we use the discovery as a booster rocket for the launch.
i only hope there's a world left for you to return to.
report to ground as to what is going on and make that report immediately.
and while you're at it, could you please check out a black spot on jupiter that has been detected by satellite telescope.
it is on the dark side and should be coming around your way in about four hours.
we've got one chance to get out of here after tomorrow's orbit.
we fire at the wrong time, in the wrong direction we don't have fuel to make a correction.
i enjoy working with human beings and have stimulating relationships with them.
we enjoy working with you, hal, and we will continue to do so even if we are separated by great distance.
they will record that the next day the president of the united states looked out of the white house window and the premier of the soviet union looked out of the kremlin window and saw the new distant sun in the sky.
they read the message, and perhaps they learned something because they finally recalled their ships and their planes.
an embassy for an intelligence beyond ours a shape of some kind for something that has no shape.
your children will be born in a world of two suns.
you can tell your children of the day when everyone looked up and realized that we were only tenants of this world.
we have been given a new lease and a warning from the landlord.
my government feels it's very important that we should get there first.
it's a distinction that will look splendid on the front page of "pravda".
a russian craft flown by russians carrying a few poor americans who need our help...
that also doesn't look too bad on the front page of "pravda".
you got the joint chiefs screaming about russian satellites with anti-missile lasers.
so we gotta send up our laser satellites to counteract theirs.
the president has decided that the nca should be put under the defense department's authority.
enough with the crazy scientists spending all this money trying to talk to martians.
it's got lots of stuff in it that's bad for you.
i've been thinking about it and i don't want you to come to my lecture.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.

it's terrifying hoping the russians are less crazy than we are when they are clearly crazy.
now i think you're in a safer place than we are.
the drive system could be operated manually so we were able to pull discovery away from its decaying orbit around lo.
i must say, the farther away i get from lo the happier i am.
well, all the environment circuits are fed to this one here.
yeah, but this is the one that feeds into hal, right?
i want you to install this little baby right about there inside the cable trunk.
i want you to put it where nobody can find it without a deliberate search.
with convenient nonstops to the moon and all major space stations, on pan am the sky is no longer the limit.

ask him if he wants them to have all the answers.

now before you get that look on your face just listen to me for a minute.
the time has come to put ourselves in an orbit around io which is where the discovery is.
and we don't have enough fuel to slow ourselves down so we are about to use a technique called aero-braking.
the theory is that we will enter the outer layer of jupiter's atmosphere using what is called a ballute for a shield.

of course, the people who came up with the numbers on the paper aren't here.
since no one has ever done this before, everyone up here is as scared as i am.
we're going to send a boarding party over to climb inside this 800-foot-long shipwreck floating over io to see if she can be rescued before her orbit gives out.
there are nine years of secrets inside including a sleeping computer who knows the answers.

mrs. hudson, i, too, am extremely persistent, especially when i'm working.
it is a matter of great urgency, mr. holmes, or i would not be troubling you on a saturday evening.
yes, i nearly fell into the error of supposing you earned a living by typewriting, but of course, it is obviously music.
you will observe, watson, the spatulate finger ends, which is common to both professions.
you can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone had left us a fortune.
i went at once to the lawyers whose name was given in the paper.
every monday morning i would take the train to farnham and then bicycle from the station to the house.
the little girl's name was sarah, and she was delightful, as well as being a very good pupil.
and i assume that these feelings that you sense from mr. carruthers are not reciprocated?
he is a kind and generous employer, but i am already engaged.
yet, i am puzzled as to why you have chosen to consult me.
it is an intriguing story, to be sure, but i sense you are frightened, and do not understand why.
there is one very quiet and lonely stretch of road that lies between charlington heath on the one hand and the woods of charlington hall on the other.
two weeks ago today, i was passing this place when i chanced to look back and saw a man, also on a bicycle.
on this side, charlington heath, and on the other, the woods of charlington hall.
how long did you wait for him here around the bend?
only a ruffian deals a blow with the back of a hand.
a gentleman uses the straight--left... and i, sir, am a gentleman!
very well, you and woodley had known ralph smith in south africa.
you had reason to believe that he would not live long, and you found out that his niece would inherit his fortune.
and carruthers, you made the mistake of falling in love with her.
the first time that ever i knew what love was, mr. holmes.
why didn't you tell her of the danger she was in?
because--because she would have left me, and i couldn't bear to face that.
the happy couple are thoroughly enjoying looking after young sarah carruthers, while her father is in custody.
her piano playing is improving and she wants to take up bicycling.
you will observe, watson, the spatulate finger ends, which is common to both professions.
there is a spirituality about the face, however, which the typewriter does not generate.
about four months ago, in february, we were told there was an advertisement in the times, inquiring for our whereabouts.
you can imagine how excited we were, for we thought that someone had left us a fortune.
i can only offer you my most sincere apologies for what has happened.
if i give you my assurance that it will not happen again, for my daughter's sake, will you stay?
oh, it may be a mere fancy of mine, but it seems to me that mr. carruthers shows a great deal of interest in me.
oh, he has never said anything, he is a perfect gentleman, but, a girl always knows.

they see is a matrix representing an area 40 square miles input is generated by geo-sensors small electronic modules implanted in the ground, sensitive to even the coins in a man's pocket.
do not even have a coin 's why crossing the border..
let me try to understand, third of us... than fired, sit in a room... to monitor a machine that monitors to another machine.
i did not go to the border patrol to watch tv.
think it's important to know what we want because it seems that we have no alternative .
think i'm asking for your vote this is an official decicisn.
but i have more stamina if you show me a way out, take it.
but as my dad "if you can not get out, get."
look, the truck is mine but if you check the records, see i reported it was stolen my ranch several days.
surely by whom he led it is he who should be interrogated..
not an hour ago, so brook and wanted to get the hell out pedroza.
now have a ticket first and do not know if it is okay or not?
i like the fact that del amo is so far away, that nobody messes with us.
patrol sector is desirable that as little anyone not interested rules are twisted keep us happy.
look, the guy said they stopped printing silver certificate in 1962.
the other ticket is '63, the same year the patent jeep.
we were informed that mr. pedroza sends a shipment of illegal.
apparently cross by balancing rock, and detect a car near soledad mountain .
mr. lacy has come all the way from washington dc to demonstrate a system, which he himself has devised.
his invention will prove a great boon to all of us in the accomplishment of our goals.
this map-like matrix you're looking at represents an area of 40 square miles.
the input is generated by geo-sensors, small, electronic modules implanted in the earth at given intervals, and so sensitive it'll pick up coins in a man's pocket.
any activity in the neighborhood of the geo-sensors will generate a signal on the screen like this.
here you can observe an imaginary illegal alien heading from quadrant c-5 to quadrant c-6.
make sure you set the scan sensitivity for two feet and up, so we don't apprehend every jackrabbit that runs across the desert.
remember, gentlemen, these geo-sensors will only detect objects above the two-foot scan level.
let me just get it straight that the one-third of us left that you don't fire wyatt... are going to be sitting in some room watching some machine that's watching some other machine.
i mean, i didn't personally join the border patrol to watch television, sir.
we didn't sign on with the border patrol here to mess with computers and radar screens.
a lot of us in the room here turned down promotions, because we didn't want desk jobs.
we skim a little off the top from time to time, just like everybody else.
yeah, we turn it in, you think brook's gonna send it on to central office?
i mean, once we plant them things, what's going to happen to us, bobby?
i never seen a computer can track a man 40 miles.
but like my daddy said, if you can't get out of it, get into it.
i thought your daddy said, "if you can't fix it, fuck it."
(ernie)well,listenwecan get 'em as far as del amo, but what are we gonna do about it then?
i'll slip jim a fiver at the gas station, make sure they don't get any replacement parts until tomorrow.
i figure we're lookin' at about an hour before the street's clear.
well, if i can be of help, just let me know.
a: he's a bag man from the mob who decided to go independent;
or b: he's a pusher who just paid off for a dope shipment.
he says, "you can't do that." he says, ,"what are they doing there?"
he says, "they're with me." he says, "you can't have 'em there."
i won it in a poker game the other night, and i noticed it said "silver certificate"
up there on top where it usually says "federal reserve note."
if i didn't know the difference between a good bill and a bad bill,
i probably wouldn't have lasted long in this business, now, would i?
i wanna take it as long as we prove that we got as much right to it as anybody.
now, look, the guy in there said that they stopped making the silver certificate in 1962.
the federal reserve note was issued in 1963, the same year as the plates on the jeep.
now, what if we went to the library and we just checked out to see if there was any kind of a robbery or heist pulled off in that year?
anyway, i still gotta check out the address on that guy's license.
well, since you're not gonna find his house, just drop me off at the library.
nothing adds up-- no leads on the money, the phone numbers, the license.
i feel like we oughta get outta here, man, right now.
well, you really just need half a dozen men to stake out that runway.
split 'em up, hit the plane from both sides at the same time as soon as it touches down.
if you nail the plane, you're a step closer to the source.
or you could let the transaction take place, let the vehicle get away, nail the plane and follow the vehicle to the warehouse, and you have your warehouse full of drugs and the source, if you're lucky.
you don't actually believe you're doing something worthwhile down here, do you?
hell, when nixon was president they found a wetback working for him in san clemente.
otherwise how would your department justify the millions it gets from congress each year?
it's the american way, pal, supply and demand, and when the supply is lacking, create it.
i wish i could explain this to ya, but i can't.
somethin's goin' on, and ernie and i have to get away from here.
what is it about that jeep that carson's got the entire fifth army out there?
how come the guy that was driving didn't have anything on him but a license?
hell, it's been on this radio for over an hour now.
poke your nose around there, you're gonna get shot on sight.
mr. lacy has come all the way from washington dc to demonstrate a system, which he himself has devised.

remember, gentlemen, these geo-sensors will only detect objects above the two-foot scan level.
i'm just curious, sir, as to how these geo-sensors are going to affect us.
there won't be a need for so many agents on patrol.
let me just get it straight that the one-third of us left that you don't fire wyatt... are going to be sitting in some room watching some machine that's watching some other machine.
i mean, i didn't personally join the border patrol to watch television, sir.
we didn't sign on with the border patrol here to mess with computers and radar screens.
a lot of us in the room here turned down promotions, because we didn't want desk jobs.
yeah, we spotted some tire tracks out by the paseo turn-off.
figured we'd let you boys in the day shift check 'em out.
yeah, we turn it in, you think brook's gonna send it on to central office?
that son of a bitch has furnished his house with stuff we've turned in.
i mean, once we plant them things, what's going to happen to us, bobby?
i never seen a computer can track a man 40 miles.
you show me a ticket outta here, and i'll take it.
but like my daddy said, if you can't get out of it, get into it.
no, you're the mechanical genius - go spin 'em the story.
well we'll call a tow truck to come take this into the gas station, but it probably won't be ready until tomorrow.
i figure we're lookin' at about an hour before the street's clear.
well, if i can be of help, just let me know.
he figured he'd stop at the intersection, but he just hit him broadside and bowled the damn thing right over.
driver of the water tanker's in the hospital, and the van driver's dead.
you understand, sheriff wells, that my client is under no obligation whatsoever to answer your questions at this time.
that fact, mr. henshaw, is one of the greater sorrows of the state of texas.
look, the van is mine, but if you will check the records, you will see that i reported it stolen from my ranch several days ago.
no doubt the man behind the wheel was the one who stole it.
he's a bag man from the mob who decided to go independent;
he's a pusher who just paid off for a dope shipment.
shit, ernie, an hour ago, you were so hot about the brooks and pedrozas, you were ready to walk.
now we got a ticket outta here, first class, and you're worrying about whether it's right or not?
we'll cover up our tracks and stash these cases at the coffin place.
and we'll check out the money, and if it's ok... then we'll split it in half and get outta here.
he says, "you can't do that." he says, ,"what are they doing there?"
he says, "they're with me." he says, "you can't have 'em there."
which is the brave, young notion that you can still do something about it.
but if you don't believe that, then why are you still with the border patrol?
i like the fact that del amo's so far from anything important that nobody messes with us.
that sector me and ernie work is so undesirable, nobody messes with us there, either.
now, look, the guy in there said that they stopped making the silver certificate in 1962.
the federal reserve note was issued in 1963, the same year as the plates on the jeep.
now, what if we went to the library and we just checked out to see if there was any kind of a robbery or heist pulled off in that year?
anyway, i still gotta check out the address on that guy's license.
well, you really just need half a dozen men to stake out that runway.
split 'em up, hit the plane from both sides at the same time as soon as it touches down.
if you nail the plane, you're a step closer to the source.
or you could let the transaction take place, let the vehicle get away, nail the plane and follow the vehicle to the warehouse, and you have your warehouse full of drugs and the source, if you're lucky.
your fuckin' job depends on those wetbacks, and if we didn't have 'em, we'd invent 'em.
otherwise how would your department justify the millions it gets from congress each year?
i knew that son of a bitch wasn't here to make a drug bust.
you don't send a fixer in a blue suit all the way down here from washington to collar a goddamn pusher.
we traced 'em, and one of belongs to a guy named beck from washington dc.
and the other one used to be the dallas police department about 20 years ago.
he said some federal guys found a farmhouse chocked full of cocaine and stuff.
yeah, while we were there, they even brought in a body.
yeah, i never saw so many people upset all at once.
that's when they told us to get out fannies out of there.
we've got an informant's word here that a mr. pedroza is sending up a truckload of wetbacks.
supposed to cross the border in the vicinity of balancing rock, and we have a sighting of an unidentified car located somewhere near a place called soledad mountain.
if you serve that beer any slower, it's going to be vinegar.
i'm on the verge of a new record for fewest glasses broken.
norm, i heard a great joke down by the sorting machine.
george claims he can run the table before i chalk my cue stick.
the rest of us are laughing out of pity at the man's ugliness.
he looks like a gnarled creature you find 20 miles beneath the surface of the sea.
what kind of guy with a swell chick like yourself would fool around?
even when i was on that weekend, i didn't fool around much.
a sinewy youth who always wants to carry my bags, if you know what i mean.
perhaps i'll go over there tomorrow and not demur at his subtle, yet oh-so-unequivocai advances.
he looks like a gnarled creature you find 20 miles beneath the surface of the sea.
come to think of it, he didn't say where he was from.
norm has deigned to ask me to shoot pool with him.
do i have time to get down on my knees and thank god you've selected me?
even when i was on that weekend, i didn't fool around much.
even if i were, i wouldn't be doing what you think and i'm not, so it's less.
there happens to be a certain box boy at my market.
a sinewy youth who always wants to carry my bags, if you know what i mean.
perhaps i'ii go over there tomorrow and not demur at his subtle, yet oh-so-unequivocai advances.
you do that, diane, and i'ii try real hard to give a damn.
your first job is to recover the missing jewel, known as "star of fortune".

if the beams are interrupted by something, the alarm will sound.
but if i put a mirror down at a 90 degree angle, the beam will reflect back to the source.
i cannot begin to describe the pleasure it gives me... to stand before you once again.
for the past year, during my long confinement... one thing consumed my mind.
i have noticed that it has a calming effect on the humans.
hey, good buddy... the species can calm out just as good with the domestic, all right?
as far as the rest of the world is concerned... you're already dead.
i could kill you right now and no one would even know.
if those explosives are triggered, diana... you and your armies will die.
gasping and twitching in agony... while i and the rest of my race will yawn, clean up the mess, and move on.
victory, dear lydia, cuts through an awful lot of red tape.
indeed, fear and terror have been our constant companions... these past few days.
we don't know the code bates uses to shut it down.
we may need elizabeth on this, just to start the engines.
at that time, i will excuse myself from the treaty conference.
i have notified communications to await my signal... before ordering the particle beam to reduce the city to rubble.

a few scattered reports of a 400-year-old body found frozen in the ice.
it was the kind of story that sparks the imagination, gives newscasters something to joke about, and then fades into oblivion.
he tried to seclude himself from the endless wars that plagued his homeland.
he found a young wife, chidori, and grew to love her very much.
i can prove that yoshi was dead when i got him.
if he's still dead when the police find him, they'll have no case.
i was just getting ready to blast off, for god's sake.
now, i'm gonna count to three, and if you don't quit,
when i get out of here, i'm gonna kill somebody, i promise you.
but how can we get out if we're all zipped up in here?
but instead of checking our priorities, you started to panic and pin the blame on anyone except yourself.
look, duke, we're all in this together, and the best thing to do is get in there.
and whether you like it or not, we're gonna stick together inside!
i have no intention of getting myself killed because of you.
they're coming to save us, but the meeting may never take place, as this whole mission is a failure.
it looks as if we shall never see return to light.
the measures taken by our scientists to overcome the damage of pollution, radioactivity, and prolonged exposure to ultraviolet rays were correct, and the failure is in no way their responsibility.
it is due to a species of small animal long thought to be extinct:
feared by man as carriers of fatal and often incurable diseases, they have proved to be a dangerous enemy, a recent mutation having sharpened their intelligence to an amazing degree.
the trouble started when we began to discard our special protective clothing.
perhaps they resented the intrusion of man into their underground world, where we were forced to take refuge in the early days, when the surface area became totally uninhabitable, burned black with every scrap of vegetation.
the rats disappeared for several years down there, and we all assumed that they had died out.
i will have reached my destination and be within the doomed delta 2 computer center.
and i must warn you to remain where you are in the control room.
it is the only place where you will be safe, though its surface area is overrun by rats.
they kill any who are not of the same race as themselves.
once, someone told me they read in a book that we all lived on the earth together, that we were all brothers.
the book was called the bible, and it said that god created man and animals.
i told you, i'm your trainer, mr. de vilbis. i did my job.
i checked on allegree, last night after we flew him back, just like i always do.
but he's got this cowboy from wyoming coming in tomorrow, he wants to hear his offer.
well, then why don't we fly up there tonight and head him off at the pass.
i didn't realise until it was almost too late just how much.
had i known it earlier, i could have spared us all a lot of pain.
then quit telling us what you can't do and tell us what you are going to do.
mr. carrington, i'm concerned not only with kirby, but with the baby's father.
why is it whenever i love something of someone, all i manage to do is frighten them away from me?
when i was a boy, all i had to love was this little, ugly mongrel dog.
used to pick him up and love him so much, i'd nearly i squeezed him to death.
i wanted him to love me as much as i loved him.
i never thought i could walk into this house again and feel comfortable, but i do.
i used to spend hours alone in this room reading, but never really being here.
i should have spent less time reading and more time looking.
you know, steven, i once said that we were too different to know each other.
as the moon circles around the spinning earth, so the pull of its gravity causes the oceans to rise and fall, and twice every day, the sea surges up and down the coasts of the continents.
in the bay of fundy in north america, the shape of the coast and the slope of the seabed produces the highest tides of all, rising 50 feet.
in many places, the sea is forcing the land to retreat, cutting back its cliffs and leaving islands and towers as markers of the territory that the land has lost
the debris is swept away and strewn on beaches farther down the coast as sand and gravel.
you might think that this mud is not the most attractive stuff in which to live.
certainly, animals that do live in it have to face some severe problems.
fresh water comes down from the land, the tides bring in salt water.
and then there's the nature of this extraordinarily sticky mud itself.
it is so glutinous that little oxygen gets into it but the rewards for enduring these unpromising conditions are high.
edible particles deposited on the surface of the mud are cautiously sucked up by the searching siphon of scrobicularia, a mollusc whose main body, enclosed in a shell, hides in the mud for safety.
a tiny crustacean, corophium, half an inch long, grazes on the bacteria which proliferate in millions, breaking down rotting organic matter in the mud.
ragworms live in burrows and will tackle corophium, algae, bacteria, almost anything that's around.
the mucus attracts bacteria, and the spire shells eat the lot.
the peacock worm fans out its tentacles from the top of its tube to gather food particles before they settle.
beating threads on each filament of the fan transport the catch down to the mouth at the centre.
while it feeds, it also disgorges a cement of mud and mucus and builds up the margin of its tube.
the cockle lies with its shell agape, filtering the water by sucking it in through one siphon and blowing it out through another.
mussels use the same technique, collecting within their shells substantial quantities of the abundant and nutritious drifting particles.
it is usually the same as that used by its parents though a bird needs years of practice before it becomes really expert.
some hunt in the shallow waters for mussels that have not yet shut their shells.
others carry unattached shells away from the main flock so they've got a little privacy.
they skilfully place the mussel in such a position that they can cut it open along its hinge.
as the tide retreats still further, spire shells are exposed, as many as 35,000 buried within a single square yard.
all these mud feeders together constitute a rich prize, and there are abundant claimants.
sandpipers, on migration, depend on them, but at all times of the year, wading birds come to the estuaries to feed.
the godwit, equipped with long legs and a long bill, can wade in water several inches deep and collect food before it can be reached by other birds.
it works alone so that its prey won't be disturbed by pattering feet and withdraw before being spotted.
the scything action of the avocet collects creatures that live in the liquid mud.
the quantities of food taken by wading birds from estuaries is enormous.
some species consume every day about a third of their own weight in food.
in a year, a single oyster-catcher can consume the flesh over half a ton of cockles, and many an estuary supports tens of thousands of wading birds, so these places are rich indeed.
as the river brings down more and more particles of mud, so the flats grow bigger and higher, and on their surface they develop a slimy skin, and that's formed by microscopic plants, algae.
as the high tide brings in more mud particles, they clog around the stems of the glasswort and don't swill back to the sea when the tide fall
so with each new tide, the flats grow higher and higher.
mangroves themselves are distributed widely through the tropics, for they have evolved from many different plant families and today there are some 40 different species of them.
the flowers of this pioneering mangrove are pollinated by the wind.
if it falls when the tide is in, it floats horizontally in the buoyant salt water and may be carried for miles before being stranded.
if the tide is out, it stabs the mud and stays in that position when the tide returns.
it puts out rootlets from the bottom and leaves from the top, and within a few days, it's firmly established.
just as in cold-water estuaries, there's a lot of organic matter in this mud.
it has this cluster of very fine roots which don't go more than an inch or so below the surface of the mud, but it is on the surface of the mud that the bulk of the nutrients are found.
as for water, there's plenty of it here, but it's salty.
some mangroves have a special membrane around the cells in the root hairs which filters off the salt.
others absorb the salt but then excrete it from the leaves, or concentrate it in the leaf and then the leaves are shed.
and oxygen, well, there are several different solutions to that problem.
this mangrove has pores actually in these prop roots which absorb the oxygen directly.
this one has roots which actually grow upwards, so keeping pace with the rising surface of the accumulating mud.
it's not only plants in the mangrove swamps that have difficulty in getting oxygen.
so do animals, and this time, low tide, is a period of particular difficulty.
many molluscs, like cockles and mussels elsewhere, shut their shells to keep what moisture they have and wait for the food-and-oxygen-bearing water to return.
it has to keep its skin moist for it absorbs oxygen through it.
it also keeps its mouth full of water swilling over its gills.
in between these two kinds lives the largest of the three.
it is a vegetarian, collecting algae and other microscopic plants from the mud.
and it, too, nips back every now and then for a wet.
it guards its grazing rights with vigour, building walls around its territory.
these flats are very flat, so when a male starts to advertise for a mate, he has to be a bit of a gymnast.
when a female is enticed into his private pond, he can continue his courtship at close quarters in a more conventionally fish fashion, with flexed fins, waggling tail and enormous excitement.
they'll spawn in a burrow at the bottom of the pond.
this crab is too big to be intimidated by mudskippers, even when it does wander through their territories.
its scissoring mouthparts not only sort out its food but help it to breathe.
on top of its shell, there is a puddle of water, and as its mouthparts move, they circulate this into a gill chamber within the shell, out again and up to the reservoir on the top.
eventually, the oxygen in the water is exhausted and the crab has to return to the sea, tip it off and get a fresh supply.
close by the edge of the sea, the tiny soldier crabs feed with frantic haste.
no one else will steal their mud, but they have to eat an enormous quantity to extract the few particles necessary to keep alive.
they have to work at it pretty well non-stop and have no time to waste.
high up, beyond the reach of all but the highest tides, lives the large mangrove crab.
it keeps moist by boring its hole as much as six feet deep to reach water.
among the air-absorbing roots of the mangroves, fiddler crabs are busy.
the females collect mud with both pincers, working with the same frantic speed as the soldier crabs.
the claw is long enough to reach down into the burrow to give his opponent a tweak where he's least expecting it.
the purpose of the wave is to encourage a female to follow a male into his burrow.
is it possible perhaps just to take a moment or so off from munching mud?
at low tide, there's lots for birds to eat on the mangrove mud, just as there is on estuaries elsewhere.
its speediest climb is barely faster than the rise of the tide, so it has to set off in good time.
its internal alarm clock tells it when it should do so.
the soldier crabs are so well adapted to their life scavenging on the exposed mud that they have become breathers of air, and without it they will drown.
as the tide advances, each constructs a little igloo which traps a bubble of air with which the crab can breathe while the tide is in.
in the swamps of south-east asia, archer fish feed on insects that have fallen on the surface.
uniquely, they also have a way of collecting insects from above the water.
there is a groove in the roof of their mouth, so that a sudden thrust of the tongue produces a spurt of droplets like a water pistol.
when there is a crowd, a marksman can't be sure of getting his prize.
so in company, it may be better to try a direct assault.
the larger fish are themselves food for otters, but these hunters have broad appetites and will enthusiastically tackle snails, crabs and even mussels.
the estuarine crocodile, a monster that grows to 23 feet long.
like its ancestors that lived when dinosaurs dominated the earth, it's an ocean-going creature, and, as a consequence, it's the most widely distributed of all crocodiles living from the bay of bengal through northern australia to the pacific,
rainwater washes them clean of salt, and eventually they become dry fertile forest, beyond the reach of the sea.
the banks of mud and sand that the rivers lay down around their mouths, even when they are not big enough to rise above water, protect the land against the attacks of the sea, for tall waves can't travel across shallow water.
but if a current sweeping down the coast carries away the sediment and scours the sea floor clean, then waves arrive at the coast full of power.
where the land dips steeply into the sea, the territory between the tides is not miles across but condensed into a narrow band.
the creatures that live here, like all intertidal creatures, are threatened by two dangers.
at the high-water mark, there are physical problems of being dried out, and at the low-water mark, there are biological problems of animals that creep up from the sea to prey upon the intertidal creatures.
the interplay of those two sets of problems produces a series of horizontal bands along the coast, each dominated by the particular species which best deals with the problems at that particular level.
such bands can be seen on coasts all over the world, but here on the north-west coast of america, they are strikingly clear.
the bottom band of all is only fully exposed when the moon and the sun are in such an alignment that they pull together and the tide withdraws a long way from the edge of the dry land.
organisms here only tolerate a brief exposure to the air and are unable to prevent themselves from being dried out.
below low-water mark, they kill any mussel that tries to establish itsel
but like many of these low-level creatures, they can't feed out of water.
small starfish, too small to tackle a mussel, worms and crustaceans, winkles and other molluscs.
the mussels hold on to the rocks with bundles of threads, but can't withstand the pull of the roughest waves and in winter storms, sheets of them may be ripped away.
in more exposed places where the waves beat with a particular ferocity, mussels give way to goose-necked barnacles which clasp the rock with a long fleshy foot.
they feed by holding out stiff, fan-like arms which catch particles from the waves, not when they crash in, but as their waters flow gently back.
on the most exposed promontories, the mussels are ousted by a plant:
an odd-looking alga known as a sea palm which lives only on these north-western coasts of north america.
in the spring, an individual plant may achieve the difficult feat of getting hold of an individual mussel in the mussel bed, as this one has done.
when it's mature, it will produce spores, but only when it's out of water as it is now.
so instead of the spores being distributed widely as those of other plants are the spores of the sea palm trickle down the grooves in these leaves and into the mussel bed here.
when the first storms of the autumn come, they may catch underneath the fronds of this plant and rip it up.
but the holdfast grips the mussels so firmly that the mussels come away with it, revealing the bare rock, and that means that the offspring of other nearby plants can get a hold on the bare rock.
so by the sacrifice of one palm growing on a mussel one year, next year there will be a whole grove of palms growing firmly on the bedrock.
clamped tightly to the rocks, they conserve very effectively the moisture within their shells.
they collect the minute quantities of food they require to grow and reproduce from the relatively infrequent submersions at high tide, which in some cases may only occur for an hour once a month.
so each level on a rocky shore is dominated by the organisms that best deal with the precise combination of pounding by the waves, exposure to the air, and attack by deep-water predators.
none, in the long run, can claim permanent occupation, for the attacks of the waves are unceasing.
with unfailing accuracy, the sea picks out the softer parts of the rocks and cuts its way into them.
water at great pressure is driven into joints and cracks until it penetrates a cliff and forms a blowhole.
the sea, having demolished the cliffs, then works on the debris.
during storms, it picks up the boulders and hurls them at the cliff face.
at calmer times, it rolls the rocks over the seabe and casts them up on shingle banks.
every movement chips and grinds the fragments until they are reduced to sand grains, and now even a gentle current can pick them up and carry them for miles down the coast, eventually to abandon them in banks and strands
so a beach like this looks as lifeless as any part of the margins of the land.
but if the sand grains are not too small and compacted, then each will retain around it a thin film of moisture even when the tide is out, and in that microscopic space, animals can live.
these translucent boulders are, in fact, sand grains, and the tiny snake-like animal a worm that could sit on a pinhead.
all these inhabitants of the sand are, necessarily, adept at writhing, gliding and crawling as they search for the few edible fragments trapped between grains, or pursue one another.
a nematode worm produces glue from a gland on its tail which helps it to maintain its position.
this is another larva that at the beginning of its life floats in the se but settles down into the sand to continue its development.
it builds a tiny tube of mucus which it carries about with it and clings to with bristles on its flanks.
when it grows up, it does the same thing on a larger scale, above the sand.
these slow down the water so that suspended food particles fall and can be gathered by the waving tentacles.
the tubes need constant renewal, and this is how the sand mason does it, speeded up 125 times.
occasionally, when there is a chance, it may be better to cut off a length and haul it away to consume it in the privacy of a burrow.
the crabs and the shrimps live close to the high-tide mark.
the waters pick it up and wash it swiftly inshore, together with its potential food a stranded jellyfish.
the plough snails detect its presence from the taste of decay in the surrounding water and advance on it with great speed.
to avoid being swept up the beach and being stranded, they eat fast, and then, while there is some food left, they burrow into the sand.
there they wait for the tide to turn so that they can ride back on their surfboards to deeper water and safety.
very few sea creatures venture above the limit of the highest tide and survive.
one group of animals is compelled to do so by the nature of their ancestry, and on this one beach in costa rica, they stage an astonishing invasion.
turtles are descended from land-living reptiles, and, like all reptiles, they lay eggs that only develop and hatch in air.
every year, adult females, having mated at sea, must move onto dry land.
they arrive at a rate of up to 5,000 an hour.
they use only one or two of the thousands of beaches that seem to be suitable.
what is more, they only choose to do so on just a few nights in the year between august and november.
efficient though their flippers are in water, they are barely strong enough to lift the turtle clear of the sand.
since it only occurs on a few nights a year, their eggs can't support a large permanent population of predators, as they might if the turtles were to lay over several months.
yet, even so, for reasons that we still don't understand, less than one in a hundred of the eggs produces a hatchling which reaches the sea.
they've been recorded as far south as argentina, and as far north as the british isles and north america.
it's a creature of mystery, because although we know what it feeds on, which is sea urchins and fish and, oddly enough, jellyfish, we know little else about it.
we don't know how females navigate to find nesting sites like this one.
indeed we didn't know where the main nesting sites were until 25 years ago.
then it was discovered that some nested on the suriname coast of south america and some nested here, on the east coast of malaysia.
of course, the people here have always known about the turtles and have always plundered those eggs.
today, however, there are more people than ever here, and the eggs are plundered more seriously, so undoubtedly, this huge and extraordinary creature is in danger.
but maybe the leatherback turtle has other breeding grounds that we don't know about.
maybe it goes to small, tiny coral islands in the emptiness of the ocean to find beaches far away from man.
that, indeed, is where we ourselves will be going in the next programme.
in many places, the sea is forcing the land to retreat, cutting back its cliffs and leaving islands and towers as markers of the territory that the land has lost.

if it falls when the tide is in, it floats horizontally in the buoyant salt water and may be carried for miles before being stranded.
if the tide is out, it stabs the mud and stays in that position when the tide returns.
it puts out rootlets from the bottom and leaves from the top, and within a few days, it's firmly established.
just as in cold-water estuaries, there's a lot of organic matter in this mud.
it has this cluster of very fine roots which don't go more than an inch or so below the surface of the mud, but it is on the surface of the mud that the bulk of the nutrients are found.
as for water, there's plenty of it here, but the problem is that it's salty.
some mangroves have a special membrane around the cells in the root hairs which filters off the salt.
others actually absorb the salt but then excrete it from the leaves, or concentrate it in the leaf and then the leaves are shed.
and oxygen, well, there are several different solutions to that problem.
this mangrove has pores actually in these prop roots which absorb the oxygen directly.
and this one has roots which actually grow upwards, so keeping pace with the rising surface of the accumulating mud.
but it's not only plants in the mangrove swamps that have difficulty in getting oxygen.
so do animals, and this time, low tide, is a period of particular difficulty.
many of thre molluscs, like cockles and mussels elsewhere, simply shut their shells to keep what moisture they have and wait for the food-and oxygen-bearing water to return.
it has to keep its skin moist for it absorbs oxygen through it.
it also keeps its mouth full of water swilling over its gills.
in between these two kinds lives the largest of the three.
it is a vegetarian, collecting algae and other microscopic plants from the mud.
and it, too, nips back every now and then for a wet.
it guards its grazing rights with vigour, building walls around its territory.
these flats are very flat, so when a male starts to advertise for a mate, he has to be a bit of a gymnast.
when a female is finaly enticed into his private pond, he can continue his courtship at close quarters in a more conventionally fish fashion, with flexed fins, waggling tail and enormous excitement.
they'll spawn in a burrow at the bottom of the pond.
this crab is too big to be intimidated by mudskippers, even when it does wander through their territories.
its scissoring mouthparts not only sort out its food but help it to breathe.
on top of its shell, there is a puddle of water, and as its mouthparts move, they circulate this into a gill chamber within the shell, out again and up to the reservoir on the top.
eventually, the oxygen in the water is exhausted and the crab has to return to the sea, tip it off and get a fresh supply.
close by the edge of the sea, the tiny soldier crabs feed with frantic haste.
no one else will steal their mud, but they have to eat an enormous quantity to extract the few particles necessary to keep alive.
they have to work at it pretty well non-stop and have no time to waste.
high up, beyond the reach of all but the highest tides, lives the large mangrove crab.
it keeps moist by boring its hole as much as six feet deep to reach water.
among the air-absorbing roots of the mangroves, fiddler crabs are busy.
the females collect mud with both pincers, working with the same frantic speed as the soldier crabs.
the claw is long enough to reach down into the burrow to give his opponent a tweak where he's least expecting it.
the purpose of the wave is to encourage a female to follow a male into his burrow.
is it possible perhaps just to take a moment or so off from munching mud?
at low tide, there's lots for birds to eat on the mangrove mud, just as there is on estuaries elsewhere.
its speediest climb is barely faster than the rise of the tide, so it has to set off in good time.
and have some sort of internal alarm clock that tells it when it should do so.
the soldier crabs are so well adapted to their life scavenging on the exposed mud that they have become breathers of air, and without it they will drown.
as the tide advances, each constructs itself a little igloo which traps a bubble of air with which the crab can breathe while the tide is in.
in the swamps of south-east asia, archer fish feed on insects that have fallen on the surface.
uniquely, they also have a way of collecting insects from above the water.
there is a groove in the roof of their mouth, so that a sudden thrust of the tongue produces a spurt of droplets like a water pistol.
when there is a crowd, a marksman can't be sure of getting his prize.
so in company, it may be better to try a direct assault.
the larger fish are themselves food for otters, but these hunters have broad appetites and will enthusiastically tackle snails, crabs and even mussels.
the estuarine crocodile, a monster that grows to 23 feet long.
like its ancestors that lived when dinosaurs dominated the earth, it's an ocean-going creature, and, as a consequence, it's the most widely distributed of all crocodiles living from the bay of bengal through northern australia to the pacific,
even reaching such isolated mangrove swamps as those on the islands of fiji.
as the mangroves establish themselves farther out into the sea, the mudflats they've built grow higher and higher.
rainwater washes them clean of salt, and eventually they become dry fertile forest, beyond the reach of the sea.
the banks of mud and sand that the rivers lay down around their mouths, even when they are not big enough to rise above water, protect the land against the attacks of the sea, for tall waves can't travel
where the land dips steeply into the sea, than the territory between the tides is not miles across but condensed into a narrow band.
the creatures that live here, like all intertidal creatures, are constantly threatened by two dangers.
at the high-water mark, there are physical problems of being dried out, and at the low-water mark, there are biological problems of animals that creep up from the sea to prey upon the intertidal creatures.
the interplay of those two sets of problems produces a series of horizontal bands along the coast, each dominated by the particular species which best deals with the problems at that particular level.
such bands can be seen on coasts all over the world, but here on the north-west coast of america, they are strikingly clear.
the bottom band of all is only fully exposed when the moon and the sun are in such an alignment that they pull together and the tide withdraws a long way from the edge of the dry land.
but out of water, it can do nothing but simply hang on to the rocks.
alongside them, giant sea anemones droop their tentacles, and many withdraw them, for in air there is nothing to feed on.
it envelops them with its adhesive arms, slowly wrenches apart their shells, and feeds on the flesh within.
below low-water mark, they kill any mussel that tries to establish itself
but like so many of these low-level creatures, they can't feed out of water.
so a little higher up, where the rocks are regularly exposed to air for longer, conditions favour the mussels, and they form a dense band, cropped at the lower edge by starfish, but beyond their reach higher up.
the massed mussels provide shelter between them for lots of other creatures:
small starfish, too small to tackle a mussel, worms and crustaceans, winkles and other molluscs.
the mussels hold on to the rocks with bundles of threads, but can't withstand the pull of the roughest of the waves and in winter storms, sheets of them may be ripped away.
in more exposed places where the waves beat with a particular ferocity, mussels give way to goose-necked barnacles which clasp the rock with a long fleshy foot.
they feed by holding out stiff, fan-like arms which catch particles from the waves, not when they crash in, but as their waters flow gently back.
on the most exposed promontories, the mussels are ousted by a plant:
an odd-looking alga known as a sea palm which lives only on these north western coasts of north america.
the crown of leaves at the top of its rubbery stem is a device that enables the sea palm to harness the power of the waves and use it to attack the mussels.
when it's mature, it will produce spores, but only when it's out of water as it is now.
so instead of the spores being distributed widely as those of other plants are, the spores of the sea palm trickle down the grooves in these leaves and into the mussel bed here.
when the first storms of the autumn comes, they may catch underneath the fronds of this plant and rip it up.
but the holdfast grips the mussels so firmly that the mussels come away with it, revealing the bare rock, and that means that the offspring of other nearby plants can get a hold on the bare rock.
so by the sacrifice of one palm growing on a mussel one year, next year there will be a whole grove of palms growing firmly on the bedrock.
but mussels do require a certain amount of immersion every day if they are not to dry out and die, and this line marks exactly that.
they manage to collect the minute quantities of food they require to grow and reproduce from the relatively infrequent submersions at high tide, which in some cases may only occur for an hour once a month.
so each level on a rocky shore is dominated by the organisms that best deal with the precise combination of pounding by the waves, exposure to the air, and attack by deep-water predators.
none, in the long run, can claim permanent occupation, for the attacks of the waves are unceasing.
with unfailing accuracy, the sea picks out the softer parts of the rocks and cuts its way into them.
water at great pressure is driven into joints and cracks until it penetrates a cliff and forms a blowhole.
on the southernmost tip of australia, storms of great ferocity sweeping up from the south, with the full force of the antarctic gales behind them, beat away at sandstone cliffs which have lines of weakness that run horizontally and vertically, so the rock is cut away in huge blocks.
the sea, having demolished the cliffs, then works on the debris.
during storms, it picks up the boulders and hurls them at the cliff face.
at calmer times, it rolls the rocks over the seabed and casts them up on shingle banks.
every movement chips and grinds the fragments until they are reduced to sand grains, and now even a gentle current can pick them up and carry them for miles down the coast, eventually to abandon them in banks and strands in the lee of islands or in sheltered bays.
every wave of every tide stirs up the surface of the sand, so plants find it impossible to get any grip on it as they can on rocky shores or mudflats.
so a beach like this looks as lifeless as any part of the margins of the land.
but if the sand grains are not too small and compacted, then each will retain around it a thin film of moisture even when the tide is out, and in that microscopic space, animals can live.
these translucent boulders are, in fact, sand grains, and the tiny snake-like animal a worm that could sit on a pinhead.
it's like the one that's common in freshwater ponds, but it has one elongated tentacle with which it anchors itself.
a nematode worm produces glue from a gland on its tail which helps it to maintain its position.
and this is another larva that at the beginning of its life floats in the see but settles down into the sand to continue its development.
it builds a tiny tube of mucus which it carries about with it and clings to with bristles on its flanks.
now it not only builds a tube, but it adds long tassels to the top.
these slow down the water so that suspended food particles fall and can be gathered by the waving tentacles.
in this shifting sand the tubes need constant renewal, and this is how the sand mason does it, speeded up 125 times.
although plants can't grow on these perpetually moving sands, those dislodged from the rocky parts of the coast by waves are washed up here, and there are plenty of creatures on the beach waiting for them.
the remains of a squid is a banquet for ghost crabs.
occasionally, when there is a chance, it may be better to cut off a length and haul it away to consume it in the privacy of a burrow.
the crabs and the shrimps live close to the high-tide mark.
but the incoming waters also bring with them another team of scavengers.
it inflates its plough-like foot by pumping in water, and it uses it not so much as a ploughshare as a surfboard.
the waters pick it up and wash it swiftly inshore, together with its potential food a stranded jellyfish.
the plough snails detect its presence from the taste of decay in the surrounding water and advance on it with great speed.
to avoid being swept up the beach and being stranded, they eat fast, and then, while there is some food still left, they burrow into the sand.
there they wait for the tide to turn so that they can ride back on their surfboards to deeper water and safety.
very few sea creatures venture above the limit of the highest tide and survive.
they are ridleys, the smallest of the sea-going turtles, only a couple of feet long.
turtles are descended from land-living reptiles, and, like all reptiles, they lay eggs that only develop and hatch in air.
so every year, adult females, having mated at sea, must make their way onto dry land.
they arrive at a rate of up to 5,000 an hour.
they use only one or two of the many thousands of beaches that seem to be suitable.
and what is more, they only choose to do so on just a few nights in the year between august and november.
individuals turn up almost anywhere in the tropics but they go much farther than that.
they've been recorded as far south as argentina, and as far north as the british isles and north america.
indeed we didn't know where the main nesting sites were until 25 years ago.
and then it was discovered that some nested on the suriname coast of
south america and some nested here, on the east coast of malaysia.
of course, the people here have always known about the turtles and have always plundered those eggs.
today, however, there are more people than ever here, and the eggs are plundered more seriously, so undoubtedly, this huge and extraordinary creature is in danger.
but maybe the leatherback turtle has other breeding grounds that we don't know about.
maybe it goes to small, tiny coral islands in the emptiness of the ocean to find beaches far away from man.
that, indeed, is where we ourselves will be going in the next programme.
the waters that cover most of the plane are in constant movement.
as the moon circles around the spinning earth, so the pull of its gravity causes the oceans to rise and fall, and twice every day, the sea surges up and down the coasts of the continents.
in the bay of fundy in north america, the shape of the coast and the slope of the seabed produces the highest tides of all, rising 50 feet.
living in this in-between world, which is neither sea nor land, demands very special talents.
in the tropics, mangroves are moving out into the sea, gathering mud and building new territory for land-living creatures.
even in the mouths of rivers, where fresh water laden with sediment mingles with the salt water of the sea, new land is being created of a sort.
certainly, animals that do live in it have to face some severe problems.
part of their time they're out of water like this, part of the time they're underwater.
and then there's the nature of this extraordinarily sticky mud itself.
it is so glutinous that little oxygen gets into it but the rewards for enduring these unpromising conditions are high.
edible particles deposited on the surface of the mud are cautiously sucked up by the searching siphon of scrobicularia, a mollusc whose main body, enclosed in a shell, hides in the mud for safety.
a tiny crustacean, corophium, half an inch long, grazes on the bacteria which proliferate in millions, breaking down rotting organic matter in the mud.
it is produced by spire shells, no bigger than grains of wheat.
the mucus attracts bacteria, and the spire shells eat the lot.
the peacock worm fans out its tentacles from the top of its tube to gather food particles before they settle.
beating threads on each filament of the fan transport the catch down to the mouth at the centre.
while it feeds, it also disgorges a cement of mud and mucus and builds up the margin of its tube.
the cockle lies with its shell agape, filtering the water by sucking it in through one siphon and blowing it out through another.
mussels use the same technique, collecting within their shells substantial quantities of the abundant and nutritious drifting particles.
when the tide goes out, they clamp their shells tightly together to keep in their moisture and to keep out attackers, but some creatures know how to deal with that.
some hunt in the shallow waters for mussels that have not yet shut their shells.
others carry unattached shells away from the main flock so they've got a little privacy.
all these mud feeders together constitute a rich prize, and there are abundant claimants.
sandpipers, on migration, depend on them, but at all times of the year, wading birds come to the estuaries to feed.
its long bill enables it to probe deep into the mud for a worm, and serves equally well as a pair of forceps.
the dunlin is a smaller bird and goes for smaller prey:
the ringed plover, with a very short bill, can only collect food from the surface and locates it by sight.
it works alone so that its prey won't be disturbed by pattering feet and withdraw before being spotted.
as soon as they close on something edible, the bird can juggle it up into its mouth.
the quantities of food taken by wading birds from estuaries is enormous.
some species consume every day about a third of their own weight in food.
in a year, a single oyster-catcher can consume the flesh over half a ton of cockles, and many an estuary supports tens of thousands of wading birds, so these places are rich indeed.
but soon, bigger plants get root, like this glasswort, and now the process really speeds up.
as the high tide brings in more mud particles, they clog around the stems of the glasswort and don't swill back to the sea when the tide fall
this mud is the pulverised remains of rocks eroded from the himalayas that has been carried down by the ganges for 1,000 miles and dumped on the edge of the bay of bengal.
this is the biggest intertidal forest of all, the sunderbans, 4,000 square miles of it, and here roam many animals that usually live in dry-land forests.
it developed that specialism on the island of borneo, and has never spread overseas, trapped by its own specialised requirements.
mangroves themselves are distributed widely through the tropics, for they have evolved from many different plant families and today there are some 40 different species of them.
it starts to grow while it is still attached, producing a green shoot a foot long with a sharp end to it.
if it falls when the tide is in, it floats horizontally in the buoyant salt water and may be carried for miles before being stranded.
if the tide is out, it stabs the mud and stays in that position when the tide returns.
it puts out rootlets from the bottom and leaves from the top, and within a few days, it's firmly established.
just as in cold-water estuaries, there's a lot of organic matter in this mud.
because it's so sticky, it isn't stirred up, so there's little oxygen in it, and the process of rotting produces within the mud itself an acid, smelly, poisonous chemical:
as for water, there's plenty of it here, but it's salty.
some mangroves have a special membrane around the cells in the root hairs which filters off the salt.
others absorb the salt but then excrete it from the leaves, or concentrate it in the leaf and then the leaves are shed.
and oxygen, well, there are several different solutions to that problem.

so do animals, and this time, low tide, is a period of particular difficulty.
many molluscs, like cockles and mussels elsewhere, shut their shells to keep what moisture they have and wait for the food-and-oxygen-bearing water to return.
for them, it's a period of inactivity, but for other creatures, it's just the opposite.
this one lives near high-water mark, and is the sort that spends most time out of water.
it has to keep its skin moist for it absorbs oxygen through it.
it also keeps its mouth full of water swilling over its gills.
it feeds on the little crabs that graze on the mud
it is a vegetarian, collecting algae and other microscopic plants from the mud.
and it, too, nips back every now and then for a wet.
on clear mud, their territories form a patchwork of walled ponds.
these flats are very flat, so when a male starts to advertise for a mate, he has to be a bit of a gymnast.
when a female is enticed into his private pond, he can continue his courtship at close quarters in a more conventionally fish fashion, with flexed fins, waggling tail and enormous excitement.
they'll spawn in a burrow at the bottom of the pond.
this crab is too big to be intimidated by mudskippers, even when it does wander through their territories.
its scissoring mouthparts not only sort out its food but help it to breathe.
on top of its shell, there is a puddle of water, and as its mouthparts move, they circulate this into a gill chamber within the shell, out again and up to the reservoir on the top.

high up, beyond the reach of all but the highest tides, lives the large mangrove crab.
it keeps moist by boring its hole as much as six feet deep to reach water.
the lure that tempts it out is a newly fallen mangrove leaf.
the females collect mud with both pincers, working with the same frantic speed as the soldier crabs.
the males need to munch just as much mud as the females, but work with one hand only, for one of their claws is so big that it is useless for feeding.
a less well-equipped male gets a nasty hammering even before he can get out of his hole.
the claw is long enough to reach down into the burrow to give his opponent a tweak where he's least expecting it.
the purpose of the wave is to encourage a female to follow a male into his burrow.
is it possible perhaps just to take a moment or so off from munching mud?
at low tide, there's lots for birds to eat on the mangrove mud, just as there is on estuaries elsewhere.
terns hawk for fish that are easier to catch now in the shallowing waters.
its internal alarm clock tells it when it should do so.
the soldier crabs are so well adapted to their life scavenging on the exposed mud that they have become breathers of air, and without it they will drown.
as the tide advances, each constructs a little igloo which traps a bubble of air with which the crab can breathe while the tide is in.
the mudskippers' territorial walls built with such labour are breached by the incoming wavelets.
shoals of fish arrive, searching for morsels deposited by the river while the tide was out.
in the swamps of south-east asia, archer fish feed on insects that have fallen on the surface.
uniquely, they also have a way of collecting insects from above the water.
there is a groove in the roof of their mouth, so that a sudden thrust of the tongue produces a spurt of droplets like a water pistol.

the larger fish are themselves food for otters, but these hunters have broad appetites and will enthusiastically tackle snails, crabs and even mussels.
they are great travellers, swimming for many miles up into fresh water or down into the sea and even out to offshore islands, and they have an enormous appetite for play.
as the mangroves establish themselves farther out into the sea, the mudflats they've built grow higher and higher.
rainwater washes them clean of salt, and eventually they become dry fertile forest, beyond the reach of the sea.
the banks of mud and sand that the rivers lay down around their mouths, even when they are not big enough to rise above water, protect the land against the attacks of the sea, for tall waves can't travel across shallow water.
but if a current sweeping down the coast carries away the sediment and scours the sea floor clean, then waves arrive at the coast full of power.
where the land dips steeply into the sea, the territory between the tides is not miles across but condensed into a narrow band.
the creatures that live here, like all intertidal creatures, are threatened by two dangers.

we killed our dear friends, and stood by when villagers were murdered.
you guys help us a little, and more money and rewards will be yours.
look, when we cross those mountains, it'li only take 5 days to reach tangou.
no matter how much i try to escape i can't avoid it.
even if i don't want to kill i am forced to kill.
before long, grandma's fruitcake doesn't make it to little bobby, peggy and sue.
their little hearts will break, thinking grandma forgot them this year.
i can't tell you how proud i am to see you overcome your need for vengeance.
tell that fellow he's real lucky he's still in one piece.
from a man whose idea of intellectual stimulation is to count along with big bird?
in his arrogance, he thought that when i called out "sam", i was referring to him.

tell that fellow he's real lucky he's still in one piece.
well, now that we all know each other, what's the story?
this bit about you being here when you're supposed to be there smells fishy.
i thought the coimbras were supposed to be scared of going fast.
yeah, i guess they're even more scared of getting their butts shot off.
i described them as magnificently spontaneous, but they're not spontaneous, they're downright dangerous.
we could hardly have hoped to have the duke of edinburgh substitute for us.
where did the agency guys pick you up, under a bridge?
ah, i was at dirty charlie's jazz club in new orleans.
but was in necessary for you to be photographed with a notorious gangster and a bevy of bar girls?
ah, come on, it's all part and parcel of what you want.
now if you two go out, they'll kill you, and you'll take the two million with you.
but, if you and little cousin go out, they'll kill the two of you, which means big cousin and me will be safe and rich.
he convinced his daughter all was my fault, and look at the consequences.
well, if that's the case, all you have to do is tell her.
who the hell do you think you are to bust in here?
i have a court order from judge fairfax here for the release of mark jorgenson jr.
dealers that won't get within 10 miles of nickle-and-dime junkies... will fall all over themselves to rub shoulders with a celebrity likejorgenson.
i figure this kid can hand us a dozen mid-level suppliers.
trudy, what were you saying aboutjorgenson just a little while ago?
the kid comes from a family high up on the social register.
why don't we take, uh, a hundred thousand shares next week?
sell the t.h.i. that oughta raise enough capital to cover it.
i had the chance to get in on the ground floor... with the hot pretzel thing.
zeb and i could have become millionaires three times by now.
uh, what, was there something with my name on it, or my address?
see, i heard that the building was for rent, and i thought it might be suitable to store some antiques.
when your mother died, i promised myself... that i would raise you in a way that would make her proud.
i realize now that i failed to keep good on that promise.

the short interest on that stock is so high, if we touch it on the open market it'll explode.
why don't we take, uh, a hundred thousand shares next week?
they had the whole thing-- they had him surveilled, they had wire on him.
when jorgenson got ahold of it, he took the entire commission to court for harassment and beat 'em.

should you talk to me, anything which you may say in answer to my questions... can and will be introduced into evidence in court against you.
if you want an attorney to be present at this time, or any time hereafter, you are entitled to such counsel.
i know this dude named trick baby that hangs downtown, man, you know what i'm sayin'?
he gave me some info last week that may be helpful to you.
what happened out there this morning doesn't count for nothing, does it?
i mean, your client could've shot me and my partner and that'd be okay too.
you know as well i do that it's my job to deal with informants.
if i give you one, i may as well give you all of'em, because nobody on the streets is ever gonna trust me again.
but now, i plan to expose you to an elite clientele.
you'll make lots of money, and you're to accompany me on certain special business trips.
oh, i see we're having a problem with someone not being able to pay their bill.
now let that be a lesson to you, ladies and gentlemen.
i am not interested in options, and definitely not import-export, okay?
okay, all right, look, no import-export, but we've also got investment banking.
and my mother and my two boys will be home any moment.
and if you are here when they get here, i'd have a lot of explaining to do.
listen, mrs. king, i know that you don't necessarily approve of me.
but i also know that you're a fair person, and i hope that you'll do me the favor of listening, especially since i really do have some very good news for you.
well, what it does is it limits us from providing arms to certain countries.
even those countries who believe in democracy as we do, you and i.
we have to make him think it's the real goods, right?
if we tip him there's no detonator, somebody's liable to hand you your head.
i got you into this, and i'm gonna get you out of it.
and besides that, he doesn't even know that you've talked to me.
anyway, fred got the call, found the field, and scooped up ballon and the others.
unfortunately, somebody mentioned that the bomb was live and fred just...
i didn't fall in love with your looks in the first place.
no i guess i am not what you'd call an "ox."
the leader wants a schedule speedup so i've brought experts for a special project.

so unless we blow up this pumping station california will be one big desert.
i get people's attention so i don't have to repeat myself.
we'll test them at the pump station and see if they fool the visitors as easily as they fool us.
diana's developed a powerful truth serum that's foolproof against your people.
and i know enough to expose both your fifth column and our resistance.
we'll find it, but first i want to see what this unlocks.
they must have some achilles' heel, something we can use against them.
it kept out the light, kept in heat, like the greenhouse effect.
as the temperatures went up the biggest, smartest reptiles who weren't equipped to handle heat, like mammals are, died.
isolated incidence of violence mostly explosions at visitor installations are being reported all across los angeles.
they may be part of an effort by the scientific conspiracy.
whether you believe it or you don't the truth is my son, your grandson and 1 0,000 others are all prisoners of your "friends. "
don't tell me you don't know what went on in this town all week!
but i must take this stand for what i know is right.
you may think that an old man wouldn't be afraid to die but this old man is very frightened.
i'm hoping that i'll find a little of your mother's dignity and strength.
so far, i'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark.
but we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us.
each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part and join with the others till we've become a blinding light triumphant over darkness.

no i guess i am not what you'd ca an "ox."
the leader wants a schedule speedup so 've brought experts for a special project.

steven is the ony one who's ineffective in dealing with the rebels.
so unless we blow up this pumping station california will be one big desert.
'm not ready to trade my ride in for a camel.
as much as we hate to admit it, the man could have a point.

knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
if he gets those parts and he repairs them, it's only going to be a matter of hours... before his other systems are up to full strength.
so, while we're experimenting with modified lasers here... he will be making himself fully operational.
you go back in the foundation, you finish the laser, and you bring it back.
as soon as you call, i'll bring kitt in for installation.
i'm banking on the fact that his surveillance mode may not have full range yet.
michael, surely you're not thinking of going up against that monster alone.
no, i just wanna ask you a couple of questions, okay?
why don't we just sit down here and have a little talk?
linda must have hidden something in there, something the killer wanted very badly.
the apartment was empty when i moved in, what could it be?
but i didn't kill her... and you can't prove that i did, now get out of here!
you know, some of your illusions are a lot more convincing than you are.
kltt, i know how important this party is to devon... but i can't stop thinking about the case.
i'm sure it's just a matter of time... before you get the evidence you need to put grant away.
a couple must learn how to find happiness in their lives together.
it is only then that they will become a real couple.
probably on a theme of man being chased by the devil.
i must admit, i've never seen anything quite like it before.
on the 1 3th of july, 1 643, the english civil war came to little hodcombe.
a parliamentary force and a regiment for the king destroyed each other and the village.
you see, on hakol, psychic energy is a force that's been harnessed in much the same way as electricity is here.
but what has that got to do with the malus legend?
it seems that your computers are as stubborn as you are, commander.
now, i want you to all go back to the tardis.
the myrka is a creature of the inkiest depths, or it was until the silurians tinkered with its biology.
anyway, it has little tolerance to light and hopefully none at all to ultraviolet rays.
as soon as i've left in the escape pod, this base will be attacked.
and everything on it, including the creatures and all of you, will perish.
i'm giving you a french model '52, out of this world.
look here, using this will get you in no trouble at all.
you just went behind my back, and ruined my sister's life.
i wanted to tell you, but you would have never understood it.
i swear i don`t know how you two manage to get niedermayer to spring the money for two more physiotherapists.

here take a look at this, you know what it is?
when deke junior was born, deke bought him a ball, a bat, and a glove.
he had him shagging flies when he was two years old.
i used to get upset until i... i saw that`s what deke junior wanted too.
he wanted it for his dad, but he wanted it just as much for himself.
look mr it isn`t any of your business where l park.
well i think it is my business if you`re breaking the law.
could you just give these to deke larson please it`s his homework.
are you the mysterious lady who brings his books every day?
he tried to reach the boy calling by phone, sent him a letter
larson boy, keeps blaming my son, so my son blames himself.
l`m not interested in doing any homework, so just buzz off!
no, l`m not going to buzz off, l`m not going to buzz anywhere.
you`re as good as anybody who can read or see a movie.
when you eat, when you drink, when you see something pretty...
now maybe he`ll be able to hobble around on some crutches.
mr. larson, you weren`t the victim of that accident, your son was.
- maybe you can help him find the things he can do.
he had it all right in the palm of his hand you know.
you blame him because he blew your chance to see your name on a major league uniform.
get out of here, just get the hell out of here.
oh, the dress no... i told my mum i going to the dance...
so i had to do to this dress but... i am not going anywhere...
you know not being popular doesn`t bother me... except for my mum i mean
i just wish i could have a date for the prom you know just to let my mum get all excited...
have the boy show up at the door with a corsage.
i just wish i could do that for her in a way
just so he wouldn`t feel like i was somebody who blew it for him.
i really blew it for the both of us you know
look i want to thank you for that little talk you had with deke the otherday.
- l`m glad i could help, he seems like a good kid.
no, done for the day, except for an opinion on dyger versus dyger
what do you say, why don`t you come out with us tonight get a bite to eat?
- no i didn`t think to make one... i figured you wouldn`t be this crowded on a wednesday night
well it will be a few minutes if you`d care to wait in the bar
look i was just trying to be friendly, you know and i said thank you
hey look, i understand how you feel, but you don`t have to take it out on me.
hell everybody needs a drink to forget their troubles, i know i do
then maybe i should`ve sent you a drink, you need it, i don`t
oh well... that`s what i get when i try and be nice to a cripple
l`m glad i restrained myself, damn near asked him to step outside.
is this great canyon the work of god or a symphony of nature?
is it the summation of all grandeur or the grave of the world?
in a time lost to history, man entered the unknown depth of grand canyon.
some sought refuge from the hostile nomads of the northern deserts.
he would pass in oblivious silence beneath walls that have watched 10,000 centuries slip away.
remnants of these ancient travelers are scattered across 2,000 years and yet we know them not at all.
major john wesley powell challenged the 217 miles of unexplored canyon in 1869.
this one-armed veteran of the civil war and his intrepid crew became the first to do what no man had ever done.
one would imagine the walls had been carved with a grand design and purpose and always we wonder what we shall find tomorrow.
the exploration was made for scientific purpose, not adventure, and yet, ever before us there was unknown danger that weighs heavier upon us than any immediate peril.
we have an unknown distance to run, an unknown river to explore.
it is with anxiety and misgiving that we enter the canyon below.
the human quest to conquer and possess began a new chapter in the history of grand canyon.
john hiller, the first to seriously photograph the canyon began what no one could ever finish.
the canyon challenges and then defies man's passion to capture and communicate.
no picture or word, no brush or palette, no lens or paint can extend the wonder of grand canyon beyond itself.
from above, the grand canyon appears inanimate and dead, but she is alive with the creatures which survived with her, their journey of a million years.
it's only on the tiny trailing edge of time that man has been able to share the magnificent perspective of the birds.
our ability to fly has forever changed our relationship with grand canyon.
we have penetrated the barriers that have isolated and protected her for our 4,000 years together.
flight has brought us to the final threshold of the hidden secrets, but the deepest questions remain unanswered.
the canyon has no need of man but mankind will face a moment in eternity when he may have a fundamental need to experience the character and timeless perspective that makes this such a wondrous place.
academy award winning director kieth merrill has captured the grandeur of the canyon as never before.
the scope of the production required the largest film crew ever assembled in the grand canyon.
merrill called on veteran cinema photographer reed smoot to serve as director of photography.
when kieth first called me about this project, as he put it, it was an opportunity to use the world's largest motion picture format in one of the world's largest locations, the grand canyon.
native americans were enlisted to portray the area's earliest known human inhabitants.
costumes, props and sets were accurately reproduced to bring to the screen an authentic recreation.
although experienced in conventional 35mm film production, the film-makers had to re-educate themselves to the unique requirements of the imax format.
essential to the film-making team was david douglas, one of the world's leading authorities on the imax film system.
the difference with imax is that we try to fill the field of view completely, with the image.
so that you have no terms of references except to the screen and the pictures on the screen.
we selectively direct the audience's attention in 35mm to your face, or to your boot, or to your wrist... but in imax the close-up of your face, the wrist and your boot, is one shot.
that's the big challenge if you're trying to communicate dramatic ideas involving people and stories which we have done, telling the human history of the canyon.
filming an area few tourists ever reach proved to be a test of endurance.
the normally routine task of setting the camera into position often became the most complicated effort of the day.
in a sense we were going through those definitive moments, were everything comes together at once.
and we wanted to put that camera in places that people had never seen before.
and consequently, just the logistics, the sheer logistics down on the river of packing in some of the side canyons was enormous.
basically when we would haul into a canyon we would have a minimum of 8 backpacks weighting on the average of 60 pounds.
the canyon challenges and then defies man's passion to capture and communicate.
no picture or word, no brush or palette, no lens or paint can extend the wonder of grand canyon beyond itself.
the grand canyon is home to over 70 species of mammals.
250 varieties of birds... 25 types of reptiles... and 5 amphibian species.
it's a different format but you're still basically communicating ideas visually.
but from a practical, and a logistical standpoint on a day to day basis, it's extremely different because of the size of the equipment makes it very cumbersome and you have to learn to design the shots and the visual
the retelling of major john wesley powell's 1859 expedition down the colorado river.
reproductions of the wood boat used by powell, were specially constructed to appear authentic on film and proved river-worthy even in the most fierce rapids.
professional river guides were recruited to play the members of powell's brave band.
and along with the crew, completely remove themselves from civilization for 21 days.
using powell's actual journal entries as a guide, the film-makers traced the explorer's path into the most remote and hidden areas of the canyon.
the journal it self became a key element in the retelling of the adventure.
to film dramatic point-of-view perspectives of treacherous whitewater, the imax camera was placed in a watertight housing and a device called a "spinning window" was placed in front of the camera to prevent water droplets from forming on the lens.
once assembled, a river raft was transformed into a floating camera platform.
making us one with each other and uniting us in peace with the infinite.
when you begin to commune with the canyon as we have, in quest of the hidden secrets, which is the name of our film, we've gone into the side-canyons, we've been in the sanctuaries, where very few people ever go,
we've been down the river a couple of times, we've flown it in helicopters, in areas which basically very, very few people ever go, or ever get.
and the results of all of that, for me, have been a real reverence and a real appreciation and a real kinship.
it's better to die by the sword of qin wu xin than live like me
98th, qin wu xin defeated xue xian nan at antelope hill
to have defeated 100 famous swordsmen who have used famous swords has made my life meaningful
i want everyone in the martial arts world to respect me gladly
all who were defeated were carried out you can choose to walk or crawl out of here
i have not lost and am not convinced yet why should i go or crawl out of here?
would it be better than the one you keep in your room?
have i not told you many times not to mention that sword?
not only do i want to look, but i also wish to buy it
tell me how many more days you'll need to make it, and i'll come again
shit, only the xuan yuan sword at supreme sword mansion can be regarded as a good sword
i hear that the cold eagle sword of black magic clan is the greatest sword of our time
sorry, i'm here to enquire about the cold eagle sword of our clan
how'd i know about the affairs of the black magic clan?
he wanted a good sword so he could challenge the supreme swordsman
all this, so that he can obtain the xuan yuan sword to put in his hundred swords house
my dad doesn't want me to know anything about the martial arts world
i'm confined here all the time how could i have heard about it?
it's his dream to defeat 100 famous swordsmen in he martial arts world
he killed them, took their swords and built this hundred swords house
alright, you'd better hurry and leave this place, and don't ever come again
so weird... his kung fu and mine seem to emerge from the same style
by the way you look, you must be very displeased with me
i'd like to ask you if your father belongs to the black magic clan?
it was for your own good that he didn't want you know
twenty years ago, long xiao tian and your father were the guardians of the black magic clan, responsible for guarding the cold eagle sword and the creed
without the order of the clan, you may not even communicate with each other and neither can you get in touch with people from the clan
this is to avoid such villains from causing trouble because of these 2 treasures
qin wu xin has now dug up something which lay peacefully for twenty years and has caused quite a stir
or whoever in the world would know of this lonely place
you've been with qin wu xin and ought to know his style and technique very well
i hope you can use his technique to train with yan bei
yan bei is a good kid but his kung fu isn't as good
you're wrong, he's been with us for so long and has learnt a lot from us
use the wood that you've brought back and fight with us
in case you use up all the wood and still can't win us you'll have a hard time
not bad, your swordsmanship is vigorous and fierce follow the opponent's movements
the sword's movement is difficult to anticipate it changes constantly if you could comprehend it's philosophy you progress quickly
living dead is a fool he didn't stop you, but instead discussed swordsmanship and let you come in to bother me
but since you came in so quickly you are quite good
there's no sword in the world that can be of use after it has been bent
because, once the iron's bent and is straightened again, it'll break easily
watch, i'm now using the backhand technique to break your sword
didn't you mention before that a crooked sword will break easily?
if you don't admit losing, you can choose any one of those swords on the shelf and fight again
bullshit, all of those belong to the ones who have lost
it's better to die by the sword of qin wu xin than live like me
98th, qin wu xin defeated xue xian nan at antelope hill
to have defeated 100 famous swordsmen who have used famous swords has made my life meaningful l want everyone in the martial arts world to respect me gladly
that's why i want my last sword to be the best
sorry, i am practising my penmanship i have no time for you, please sit
better to stand i came here to ask for a duel with you
all who were defeated were carried out you can choose to walk or crawl out of here
i have not lost and am not convinced yet why should i go or crawl out of here?
but you don't deserve to be real swordsman since you don't have a good sword in your hands
that's a prerequisite i suggest you go and get one for yourself first!
not only do i want to look, but i also wish to buy it
tell me how many more days you'll need to make it, and i'll come again
brother fei, didn't expect that one could get such a good sword here
shit, only the xuan yuan sword at supreme sword mansion can be regarded as a good sword i hear that the cold eagle sword of black magic clan is the greatest sword of our time
sorry, i'm here to enquire about the cold eagle sword of our clan
how'd i know about the affairs of the black magic clan?
he wanted a good sword so he could challenge the supreme swordsman
all this, so that he can obtain the xuan yuan sword to put in his hundred swords house
you only let me work the bellows, shovel the coal beat the iron and make iron rods
but i've grown up i can't stay in this little shop for the rest of my life
shut up i know there's something bothering you but you never tell me
i'm almost 20. lf you treat me as your son you should let me share your sorrow
master qin lt's really the technique of the black magic clan
his father must have some relationship with that clan i better not alert him now
master qin, this is the sword you covet lt's finished, take it!
i don't want it now i'd rather have the cold eagle sword
twenty years ago, the black magic clan possessed a cold eagle sword and a creed of the magic mount
every school in the martial arts world hoped to acquire these two things in order to practise the backhand technique
my father was killed by qin wu xin i'm here hoping to know what my father told you before he died i must avenge my father
his death had something to do with the black magic clan
but he never mentioned anything about that, sir lt was for your own good that he didn't want you know
twenty years ago, long xiao tian and your father were the guardians of the black magic clan, responsible for guarding the cold eagle sword and the creed
from today onwards you two must live in hiding disappear from the martial arts world
without the order of the clan, you may not even communicate with each other and neither can you get in touch with people from the clan
qin wu xin has now dug up something which lay peacefully for twenty years and has caused quite a stir
or whoever in the world would know of this lonely place
yan bei is a good kid but his kung fu isn't as good
you're wrong, he's been with us for so long and has learnt a lot from us
he lost all his possessions and sold his sister to those villains to be a whore
she escaped and those people forced her brother to hand her over
not bad, your swordsmanship is vigorous and fierce follow the opponent's movements
the sword's movement is difficult to anticipate it changes constantly if you could comprehend it's philosophy you progress quickly
senior, i have no time to discuss theory with you i'm here to look for someone
so you are really here to look for someone lf you trust me
living dead is a fool he didn't stop you, but instead discussed swordsmanship and let you come in to bother me
but since you came in so quickly you are quite good
that's correct, i am the granddaughter of the chief i grew up here
uncle shum and lp shan are like family we put on a show for you
could the black magic clan only send a fool like you?
your swordsmanship is really so bad lt's lucky that you are not holding a treasured sword or else it would be such a waste
because, once the iron's bent and is straightened again, it'll break easily idiot, do you know how to use a sword?
it's main action is to pierce, then to hack lf you use a sword just for that you might as well use a kitchen knife
didn't you mention before that a crooked sword will break easily?
if you don't admit losing, you can choose any one of those swords on the shelf and fight again
although it's broken, i haven't lost yet i used to think that your father makes good swords;
but it turns out that it's as bad as your kung fu
now i'll help you complete this hundred swords house by putting the hundredth sword in your body
this is the sword you used to kill my father i'm now giving this to you
i want everyone in the martial arts world, to respect me gladly,
that's why i want my last sword, to be the best.
my master does not approve of, people bringing swords to see him.
if you want to keep your sword, you must go through us.
yesterday is dead and gone, today is full of cares and worries.
all who were defeated were carried out, you can choose to walk or crawl out of here.
tell me how many more days, you'll need to make it, and i'll come again.
master qin, do you know how much, training one needs to, become a master swordsman?
brother fei, didn't expect that, one could get such a good sword here.
shit, only the xuan yuan sword at supreme sword mansion, can be regarded as a good sword.
sorry, i'm here to enquire, about the cold eagle sword of our clan.
how'd i know about the affairs of the black magic clan?
he wanted a good sword, so he could challenge the supreme swordsman.
all this, so that he can obtain the xuan yuan sword, to put in his hundred swords house.
my dad doesn't want me to know, anything about the martial arts world.
i'm confined here all the time, how could i have heard about it?
i can't stay in this little shop, for the rest of my life.
you never tell me anything, nor allow me to venture outside.
twenty years ago, the black magic clan possessed, a cold eagle sword and a creed of the magic mount.
every school in the martial arts world, hoped to acquire these two things, in order to practise the backhand technique.
from today onwards you two must, live in hiding and disappear from the martial arts world.
without the order of the clan, you may not even communicate with each other and, neither can you get in touch with people from the clan.
master qin, i haven't seen him, since you killed his father.
he is but a kid, aren't you going to let him off?
you came to learn the sword skill from me, just because you want to avenge your father.
yes, i know that only by learning, your swordsmanship could i succeed.
yan bei is a good kid, but his kung fu isn't as good.
you're wrong, he's been with us for so long, and has learnt a lot from us.
use the wood that you've brought back, and fight with us.
in case you use up all the wood, and still can't win us, you'll have a hard time.
not bad, your swordsmanship is vigorous and fierce, follow the opponent's movements.
the sword's movement is difficult to anticipate, it changes constantly, if you could comprehend it's philosophy, you progress quickly.
living dead is a fool, he didn't stop you, but instead discussed swordsmanship, and let you come in to bother me.
but since you came in so quickly, you are quite good.
there's no sword in the world, that can be of use after it has been bent.
because, once the iron's bent, and is straightened again, it'll break easily.
watch, i'm now using the backhand technique, to break your sword.
didn't you mention before, that a crooked sword will break easily?
if you don't admit losing, you can choose any one of those swords, on the shelf and fight again.
bullshit, all of those belong to the ones who have lost.
but the painting was merely covered by a piece of paper.
and on the back of the paper was a note... with the entire account of this incident.
i really should take you home, but i have to say goodbye here.
if i ever have the chance, we can see each other again.
professor moriarty took advantage of the chaos... and stole the blue ruby, the only one of it's kind in the world.
if you ever find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
it wouldn't be smart to go in there while he's still alive to identify us.
won't be any trouble persuading keene once hadj is out of the way.
this is my daughter's favorite book when she was a child.
and now i'm going to buy it for her son, my grandson, for his birthday.
toys and bikes are what they want, but books open up whole new worlds.
i tell you who's really gonna be surprised is my daughter.
she could be intelligence, she could be counterintelligence, i don't know.
you know what happens to us if we make a mistake?
he's a major broker for tech data for the eastern bloc.
last month, it was array-transform processors and binary codes tomorrow, it's directed-energy weapons, laser-mirror processors jamming devices for phase-array radar.
i can't believe in a city like washington there weren't police all over the place.
i thought we had more police than any place in the country.
no, uh, you didn't forget the vanilla, i saw it on the check-out counter.
now, do you remember when pinto got older and he'd sort of start to wander away from the house and we'd wait until daddy came home and then when he came home he'd take me by the hand and we'd go all over the neighborhood and we'd look for pinto and we'd call him and say, "pinto.
but, you know, he couldn't hear us because he'd gotten a little deaf by then.
but, you know, luckily, we had those nice neighbors and usually somebody would have taken him inside and given him a little water.
and then, do you remember that weekend that you took pinto up to uncle chester's farm and...
amanda, i like to reminisce with the best of them but don't you think this is getting a little depressing?
well, i knew that pinto was really very sick and i knew that you didn't tell me because you didn't want me to worry.
amanda, you would have done the same thing under the same circumstances.
oh, look, i know it was an accident, but what am i supposed to tell him?
am i supposed to tell him he almost had a wonderful birthday.
he was at amanda's home a few hours after he tried to take her shopping bag.
now, we are working on the possibility that amanda had something that he was after.
lee, i've been worried because i thought that i should be protecting my home and myself.
but, you know, uh, karlo i don't think he's after me, i think he's after my mother.
if she has it washed and blown dry, it could take about half an hour.
but if she has it set, it'll take her 45 minutes under the dryer and there's comb out and we don't know if mr. emelio's running on schedule or not.
drought cycles of burma just hit the bestseller list down in cryptography.
"microdot enlargements had the design of broadband filters." whatever they are.
- the book that my mother meant to buy or that she did buy and got it mixed up...
well, you know, i mean i should be able to figure this out.
we play it like a game, but we know it's just a cleaner battlefield.
you know, i think if we take one of the side streets, we'll go a lot faster.
you know, he was so good about not getting captain galaxy it made me wanna feel worse.
mother, look, they're all having a good time and that's all that matters.
a strangely shaped mountain catching the clouds high above the jungles of venezuela.
its summit rocks have been carved into a multitude of grotesque shapes.
ourjourney begins not far from that towering waterfall on the high moorlands of peru, 15,000 feet above the sea.
water is a very extraordinary and very precious substance, the only one on earth, apart from mercury, which remains liquid at normal temperatures and pressures, so it's an essential part of the bodies of all living organisms, animals and plant.
but this particular stream is on its way to the sea a very long way away, because these are the andes, and this is one of the many streams that can claim to be a source of the biggest river on earth, the amazon.
the difficulties of living in this young and violent river are formidable.
they exploit the swirls and eddies with consummate skill, paddling with strokes of their large webbed feet.
they head upstream, bracing themselves against rocks with their stiff quilled tail, and using small horny spurs on the wrists of their wings to give them purchase.
mosses are primitive, ancient plants that appeared on earth long before flowering plants.
this torrent moss is found in young rivers and streams all over the world, and wherever it grows, whether in the andes or here in europe, it provides shelter for a multitude of insect larv
the caddis fly larvae live in protective tubes, the hollow stem of a reed, or a construction of bits of wood stuck together with silk.
some weight themselves down by building their shelters from heavy grains of sand.
the larva of the blackfly holds on to a pebble with its back end, while it grabs at food particles that are swept past it with the antennae on its head.
it grips the rock with a ring of hooks, but even if it loses its hold, all is not lost.
it has a lifeline of silk which it has attached to its chosen pebble.
having hauled itself back, it now has to get a new grip.
it spins a tiny pad of silk from a spinneretjust beneath its mouth, then it fixes its hooks into that.
the nets with which it collects its food are modified antennae, and the larva brushes off what they catch with alternate flicks of its mouthparts.
it uses its silk to produce a funnel-shaped scaffold of criss-crossing threads.
undulating its body is a way of aiding its breathing, for the movement speeds the flow of oxygen-bearing water through the funnel.
dippers live both in the rivers of north america and europe.
underwater, their swimming technique is quite different from the torrent ducks'.
its feet are not webbed like a duck's, so it propels itself with its wings, flying underwate
in similar cold, fast-flowing streams in north america lives a kind of giant newt, the hellbender.
streams that tumble down the sides of the valleys and feed young rivers have their own population.
in malaysia, the big-headed turtle clambers around the waterfalls, using its tail as a prop.
in west african waterfalls, and nowhere else, lives the extraordinary hairy frog.
its so-called hairs are filaments of skin on its flanks which act as gills, helping it to absorb oxygen from the water.
and, almost as unusual, it has claws that help it grip the slippery stones
the many sources of the amazon began as rivulets on the eastern flanks of the andes.
now, 5,000 feet lower down, each has grown beyond recognition and cut its own zigzag valley.
white water, tumbling down the valley wall, joins the brown water of a larger tributary, heavy with mud and sediment.
and as it gets bigger and bigger, so it becomes more and more powerful.
it's the dry season at the moment and the river is comparatively low.
but during the rains, when it's in spate, its waters rise up over here and the sheer volume and weight and force of them can shift boulders the size of these.
the volume and speed of its waters are not the river's only weapons.
sand and gravel, fragments of rock that have been eroded from higher up in its course and which the river hurls with enormous force at the rocks of its river bed.
with such tools, it can carve away the sides of mountains.
young, vigorous rivers transform the land, demolishing the mountains, breaking down the debris into smaller particles and carrying them away downstream.
this river in china is perpetually so turbid that it's called the huang ho, the yellow river.
it carries a bigger load of sediment than any river in the world.
during floods, each cubic yard of water contains over 2,000 pounds of soil and pulverised rock.
rivers in the full vigour of their youth are terrifyingly strong.
they roll great boulders along their beds, they cut away at the banks, undermining trees which crash into the waters and are swept away.
when a river encounters a band of unusually hard rock, such as an ancient flow of basalt lava, its progress is temporarily slowed.
it spreads out across the barrier and then tumbles over the front edge.
they can't compare in height with the angel falls, but in terms of the volume of water that passes over them, they are incomparably bigger.
the falling waters pound away at the base of the falls, undercutting the basalt until blocks split off the face.
and now the river has left the mountains far behind and has changed its character considerably.
it's bigger, it's broader, and its waters carry not only sand and gravel but rich nutrients washed in from its vegetation-covered banks.
they're bottom-dwelling fish, with feelers on their snouts that have sense organs on them, so the fish can feel and taste their way through the thick, muddy water or at night.
there are small ones and immense ones, some that give electric shocks and others that swim upside down.
those in fast-flowing waters have suckers on their chins or undersides with which they cling to rocks.
in south america alone, there are 1,200 different species of catfish.
after a week, they're big enough to feed on small particles floating in the water.
these are now a month old and have already assumed the disc-like shape of their parents.
they're becoming independent, but they've strayed past the lair of an electric e
the eel has poor eyesight, but it detects the presence of objects around it with short electric discharges, a kind of radar.
the splashing, the taste of blood spreading through the water, attracts more of the shoal until there are hundreds, all possessed by a frenzy for flesh.
none are much more than a foot long, but their teeth are sharp enough to cut clean through bone.
a minor obstacle in its path is now enough to deflect it.
the water flowing round the outside of a bend speeds up and cuts away at the bank.
on the inside, where the current is slow, the water drops its load of sediment to form a shoal.
so the bend becomes more exaggerated as the elderly river swings from side to side in a series of loops and meanders.
one bend may approach another until the neck of land between them is so narrow it collapses.
then the river takes the shorter course and the meander is left isolated as a curving lake
these are the largest floating leaves of all, the leaves of the famous giant amazon lily.
covering the water with leaves of this size is very aggressive, for it cuts out the light below, making it difficult for other plants to grow there
the upturned rims of the great pads, as they grow, thrust to one side all other floating plants
to prevent these leaves being destroyed by being eaten by fish, they are protected with very effective and ferocious spines underneath, as you can see most clearly on this half-opened bud.
this evening the flower will open again, the beetles will be released and they'll fly off carrying pollen to cross-pollinate another lily flower.
and then, afterjust two nights, this bloom, by now turned purple, will crumple and die.
the leaves, strengthened by air-filled ribs beneath, can support the weight of a small child, and water birds can walk over them with complete confidence and safety.
the jacana has greatly elongated toes that can spread its weight so effectively that it can tread on very flimsy leaves without submerging them.
the waxy surface of its body and the hairs on its feet repel water, but any dirt on them that is wettable would break the surface-tension film.
they're aggressive insects, each with its own territory among the lily pads.
intruders are immediately chased away, and fights between rivals are common.
the surface-tension film is not only the pond skaters' platform, but their sounding board.
through sense organs on their feet, they detect vibrations caused by the struggles of an insect, and by bouncing up and down they communicate, sending keep-out signals to rivals and come-hither signals to potential mates.
whirligig beetles use vibrations of the surface fi in a different way.
they create ripples, and by monitoring the returning echoes, they detect the presence of other creatures and obstacles around them.
they have excellent eyes, partitioned so that the lower half peers down to see what's happening in the water beneath.
at its other end, its head has ferocious jaws with which it seizes its prey.
this is the larva of the giant diving beetle, and it's caught a tadpole.
it has to come to the surface, even when it's adult, so it can collect air to sustain it on its hunting forays down into deeper waters.
the water boatman patrols the surface not from above, like the pond skater, but from below.
the two kinds of insects manage to collect most of the creatures trapped in the surface film.
the camphor beetle lives on plants at the water's edge, but it is perhaps the most versatile of all water-walkers.
in emergencies it squirts this from its tail, and with the tension pulling hard at the front, it shoots across the surface so fast that the only way to see it clearly is in slow motion.
and, as a final demonstration of its versatility, it can, like most good beetles, fly.
one particularly ferocious hunter lives on the edge of lakes and ponds in europe, the fishing spider.
it uses the surface-tension film in the same way as other spiders use their webs.
with its front legs resting delicately on the surface, it feels for tell-tale vibrations.
but it also has excellent sight and can see potential prey below the surface.
in reality, the pounce is rapier-swift and the stickleback had little chance once it strayed within range.
the lakes and ponds fed by streams or cut off from the main river are comparatively small.
not the largest of lakes but, even so, 20 miles long.
as the rivers enter its still waters, they lose their impetus and drop their sediment, so such lakes are potentially fertile, and their animal inhabitants, no longer harassed by a current nor hemmed in by a shallow bottom or banks,
these may be its most fertile parts, for the lack of strong currents in a deep lake can leave the bottom starved of oxygen, but in the shallows, especially when warmed by the sun, algae and other plants flourish,
small invertebrates proliferate and there's food for even the least agile of hunters.
the lake lies in a great depression formed by faulting in the earth's crust.
it's 400 miles long and 5,000 feet deep, the deepest of all lakes.
in the depths of the lake, 1,000 feet down, lives a unique kind of salmon, the omul.
in summer, they move up into the shallows and feed on caddis fly larvae and sand hoppers, and here they're caught in great numbers for their delicious eating.
there are unique molluscs, unique flatworms and even one unique mammal, the baikal seal.
this tiny seal is almost certainly descended from the ringed seal of the arctic sea.
today the lake is over 1,000 miles away from that sea.
it's likely that their ancestors arrived during the ice age, when the journey may have been shorter and easier.
since then, cut off from other ringed seals, they've developed in their own way.
the amazon has no great lake on its course, so even in its middle stretches it still carries mud from the andes.
the rio negro, which joins it, is clear, for it has come from the north-west where the rocks are hard and bare.
the two immense rivers flow for miles alongside one another in the same bed, scarcely mixing.
as well as sediment, they also carry abundant nutrients, and life on their banks flourishes as never before
herds of capybara wade through the shallows, cropping the luxuriant plants.
they're excellent swimmers, with webs between their toes, and they have that placing of eyes, ears and nostrils so valuable to mammals that swim, on top of the head, so as the animal lies submerged,
they can see, hear and smell what's going on above water around them.
giant otters have a similar head design and sometimes lift themselves above the surface to get an even better view of their surroundings.
this amazonian species is the biggest of all otters, six feet long and a powerful swimmer.
it's well-equipped with large, webbed feet, a flattened tail and sensitive whiskers.
a pair lays claim to a stretch of river by making patches on the bank, marking them with their own personal smell.
there are otters in many of the great rivers of th world and they are the most graceful of swimmers.
in india they share the harvest of fish with the gavial.
most of the crocodile family, when adult, feed largely on carrion, but the gavial eats only fish, and has long, narrow jaws, studded with abundant teeth, with which it catches them underwater.
a host of birds also claim a share of the river fi
this is the hooded merganser, one of a group of ducks called sawbills.
its beak, like the gavial's jaws, is long and narr so it's easily snapped together underwater, and it also has a notched edge to give it a grip on the slippery fish.
and it has spines on the underside of its toes which give it a firm grasp on a fish.
in the last phase of their lives, these great rivers often flow out of control.
their tributaries in the mountains, fed by the heavy storms of the rainy season, pour so much water into them that they burst their banks.
the amazon rises every year to flood tens of thousands of square miles of forest, in some parts as much as 40 feet deep.
some of these trees are flooded for eight to ten months every year.
they need only a few months annually out of water for them to grow and for their seeds to sprout.
among the fallen tree leaves that carpet the bottom lies the mata-mata turtle, marvellously camouflaged, waiting for a decent-size fish.
and there are plenty already here, sheltering, like the turtle, among the still unrotted leaves.
as the river becomes older and older, its riches increase still further.
all over the world as rivers approach their end, they begin to deposit the sand and mud that they've gathered from so far and carried for so long.
the little bittern is able to find its nest hidden out of sight somewhere in this seemingly uniform stretch of reeds.
it regurgitates from its crop ample supplies of fish and frogs for its young.
their world is an infinity of vertical stems, but they're nimble climbers from an early age, and they leave the nest within a few days of hatching.
there they wait, almost invisible, for their parents to return with restocked crops.
the reed-clogged waters of a river delta are full of potential riches, not only for birds but for human beings.
the reeds themselves are used for many purposes, but it's not an easy life here.
earth has to be conserved with piles to prevent a slight change in the current washing it away.
and there's the threat of a rise in the water leve caused not only by rainstorms upstream but an unusually high tide, backed by a storm sweeping up from the sea, which can cause devastating floods.
and reeds provide food for the livestock, so gathering them is a daily and never-ending chore.
the herds have to be as much at home in the water are they are on their floating platforms
the rewards of this precarious existence are, of course, the abundant fish which live all around the houses and even underneath them.
so the fish and the marsh arabs and the pelicans all flourish in one integrated community.
the river has delivered the minerals it eroded from the mountains and the nutrients it collected from the forests.
they sustain plants which are the food for small animals which are eaten by fish and which are gathered by great flocks of birds that, from the tropics to the arctic, are the glories of the deltas.
of all the deltas in the world, none is greater than that of the amazon.
for hundreds of miles along its lower course, the river has been so broad that it has been impossible to see from one side to another.
now, instead of receiving more tributaries, it splits into a tangle of separate channels.
and on the last firm land on its banks stands a great and thriving port, for the river is so wide and deep that cargo ships from overseas can use it as a highway that can take them for 1,000 miles into the heart of south america.
it's neither land nor sea, but banks of mud and sand that are half the time submerged and half the time exposed.
and that intermediate, ever-changing territory is where we will be next time.
our journey begins not far from that towering waterfall on the high moorlands of peru, 15,000 feet above the sea.
water is a very extraordinary and very precious substance, the only one on earth, apart from mercury, which remains liquid at normal temperatures and pressures, and because of that, it is an essential part of the bodies of all living organisms,
fell again as rain and snow to form streams of pure, fresh, sweet water.
but this particular stream is on its way to the sea a very long way away, because these are the andes, and this is one of the many streams that can claim to be a source of the biggest river on earth, the amazon.
the difficulties of living in this young and violent river are formidable.
its waters are thick with powdered rock and mud, but they have gathered few nutrients, and they rush down the valley at tremendous speed.
they head always upstream, bracing themselves against rocks with their stiff quilled tail,and using small horny spurs on the wrists of their wings to give them purchase.
a pair owns a stretch of the river, working their way up it to the frontier of their territory when they abandon themselves to the flood and are swept downstream to begin all over again.
this torrent moss is found in young rivers and streams all over the world, and wherever it grows, whether in the andes or here in europe, it provides shelter for a multitude of insect larvae
in summer, these creatures will become transformed and fly briefly above the river to mate, but most of their lives are spent underwater.
some weight themselves down so that the current doesn't shift them by building their shelters from heavy grains of sand.
the larva of the blackfly holds on to a pebble with its back end, while it grabs at food particles that are swept past it with the antennae on its head.
it grips the rock with a ring of hooks, but even if it loses its hold, all is not lost.
it has a lifeline of silk which it has attached to its chosen pebble.
having hauled itself back, it now has to get a new grip.
first it spins a tiny pad of silk from a spinneret just beneath its mouth, then it fixes its hooks into that.
this one builds a construction that serves both as a home and a food-gathering device.
it uses its silk to produce a funnel-shaped scaffold of criss-crossing threads.
undulating its body is a way of aiding its breathing, for the movement speeds the flow of oxygen-bearing water through the funnel.
it holds on with the hooks at the back leaving its jaws and front legs free to do the construction work.
underwater, their swimming technique is quite different from the torrent ducks in the andes.
its feet are not webbed like a duck's, so it propels itself with its wings, flying underwater.
in similar cold, fast-flowing streams in north america lives a kind of giant newt, the hellbender.
when it's young, it also, like a dipper, takes insect larvae, but it can grow to over two feet long, and then it seeks much bigger prey.
the crayfish saved itself at the last moment by a convulsive snap of its tail, but the hellbender doesn't give up easily.
both animals try to keep out of the current and habitually creep into crevices.
in malaysia, the big-headed turtle clambers around the waterfalls, using its tail as a prop.
in west african waterfalls, and nowhere else, lives the extraordinary hairy frog.
its so-called hairs are filaments of skin on its flanks which act as gills, helping it to absorb oxygen from the water.
and, almost as unusual, it has claws that help it grip the slippery stones
the many sources of the amazon began as rivulets on the eastern flanks of the andes.

it's the dry season at the moment and the river is comparatively low.
but during the rains, when it's in spate, its waters rise up over here and the sheer volume and weight and force of them can shift boulders the size of these.
and in this empty rainy-season part of its bed, you can see them.
sand and gravel, fragments of rock that have been eroded from higher up in its course and which the river hurls with enormous force at the rocks of its river bed.
with such tools, it can carve away the sides of mountains.
young, vigorous rivers transform the land, demolishing the mountains, breaking down the debris into smaller and smaller particles and carrying them away downstream.

they roll great boulders along their beds, they cut away at the banks, undermining trees which crash into the waters and are swept away.
when a river encounters a band of unusually hard rock, such as an ancient flow of basalt lava, its progress is temporarily slowed.
these are the falls of iguacu on the border of brazil and paraguay.
they can't compare in height with the angel falls, but in terms of the volume of water that passes over them, they are incomparably bigger.
the falling waters pound away at the base of the falls, undercutting the basalt until blocks split off the face.
so the falls steadily work their way upriver, leaving downstream a deep gorge, and animals live even here, within the falls themselves.
some dive down with such speed that they shoot right through the fall.
and now the river has left the mountains far behind and has changed its character considerably.
it's bigger, it's broader, and its waters carry not only sand and gravel but rich nutrients washed in from its vegetation-covered banks.
and after it's gone over its last rapids and tumbled over its last fall, it becomes a very different river indeed.
on the banks of the amazon tributaries, the jungle stands thick.
birds like the sun bittern stalk quietly in search of a meal.
rays almost certainly evolved in the sea, but this species has managed to make the change to fresh water and lives high up the amazon.
many fish have evolved here in fresh water and have become suited to all its variations of depth, speed and chemical composition, to muddy water and to clear, to stretches that are thick with plants and places where there are none.
there are small ones and immense ones, some that give electric shocks and others that swim upside down.
those who lives in fast-flowing waters have suckers on their chins or undersides with which they cling to rocks.
in south america alone, there are 1,200 different species of catfish.
in these crowded waters, many fish give special protection to their young for the first few weeks of their lives.
the parents exude a nutritious slime from their skin and the young graze over their flanks, feeding on it.
after a week, they're big enough to feed on small particles floating in the water.
these are now a month old and have already assumed the disc-like shape of their parents.
they're becoming independent, but they've strayed past the lair of an electric eel
the young discus, apart from the marks of the eel's jaws on its flanks, seems no worse off.
one amazonian fish puts its eggs beyond the reach of any water-living predator:
a swimming capybara suddenly realises their presence and tries to retreat, but it's too late.
the splashing, the taste of blood spreading through the water, attracts more of the shoal until there are hundreds of the fish, all possessed by a frenzy for flesh.
the water flowing round the outside of a bend has to travel farther and speeds up and cuts away at the bank.
on the inside of a bend, where the current is slow, the water can no longer support its load of sediment and drops it to form a shoal.
so the bend becomes more and more exaggerated as the elderly river swings from side to side in a series of loops and meanders.
one bend may approach another until the neck of land between the two is so narrow it collapses.
plants no longer have to fight against a current, and the lakes become clogged with vegetation.
these are the largest floating leaves of all, the leaves of the famous giant amazon lily.
covering the water with leaves of this size is very aggressive act, for it cuts out the light below, making it very difficult for other plants to grow there.
the upturned rims of the great pads, as they grow, thrust to one side all other floating plants
and to prevent these leaves being destroyed by being eaten by fish, they are protected with very effective and ferocious spines underneath, as you can see most clearly on this half-opened bud.
it can develop from the size of a soup plate to a huge emerald disc six feet across in only a few days, growing at a rate of one square inch in a minute.
and while they're trapped in there, during the day, they will feed on those.
this evening the flower will open for second time, the beetles will be released and they'll fly off carrying with them pollen to cross-pollinate another lily flower.
and then, after just two nights, this bloom, by now turned purple, will crumple and die.
the leaves, strengthened by air-filled ribs beneath, can support the weight of a small child, and water birds can walk over them with complete confidence and safety.
the pond skater sits on a leaf, but it could equally sit on the water, for the surface forms a platform that supports many small creatures.
water molecules are bound to one another by a force akin to magnetism.
it's crucially important for the pond skater to keep meticulously clean.
the waxy surface of its body and the fine hairs on its feet repel water, but any dirt on them that is wettable would break the surface-tension film.
they're aggressive insects, each with its own territory among the lily pads.
intruders are immediately chased away, and fights between rivals are common.
the surface-tension film is not only the pond skaters' platform, but their sounding board.
through sense organs on their feet, they can detect the vibrations caused by the struggles of an insect, and by bouncing up and down they communicate to one another, sending keep-out signals to rivals and come-hither signals to potential mates.
whirligig beetles use vibrations of the surface film in a slightly different way.
by girating they create ripples, and by monitoring the returning echoes, they detect the presence of other creatures and obstacles around them.
its tail has two tubes which penetrate the surface film and collect air so that it can breathe.
at its other end, its head has ferocious jaws with which it seizes its prey.
this is the larva of the giant diving beetle, and it's caught a tadpole.
it has to come to the surface, even when it's adult, so it can collect air to sustain it on its hunting forays down into deeper waters.
the water boatman patrols the surface looking for pray not from above, like the pond skater, but from below.
the two kinds of insects between them manage to collect most of the creatures that have trapped in the surface film.
it can also produce a substance which greatly reduces the tension between water molecules.
in emergencies it squirts this from its tail, and with the tension pulling hard at the front, it shoots across the surface so fast that the only way to see it clearly is in slow motion.
and, as a final demonstration of its versatility, it can, like most good beetles, fly.
one particularly ferocious hunter lives on the edge of lakes and ponds in europe, the fishing spider.
it uses the surface-tension film in the same way as other spiders use their webs.
with its front legs resting delicately on the surface, it feels for tell-tale vibrations.
the lakes and ponds fed by streams or cut off from the main course of the river are comparatively small.
but where rivers flow into basins created by geological faults, their water accumulates in immense lakes.
as the rivers enter its still waters, they lose their impetus and drop their sediment, so such lakes are potentially very fertile, and their animal inhabitants, no longer harassed by a perpetual current nor hemmed in by
a shallow bottom or narrow banks, can proliferate, and they do.
and among the many different species of water snails, several are now unique to lake ohrid.
in the heart of russia lies a stretch of fresh water so huge and so ancient that these processes have produced new species on a scale unequalled anywhere else in the world,
it's 400 miles long and 5,000 feet deep, the deepest of all lakes.
in the depths of the lake, 1,000 feet down, lives a unique kind of salmon, the omul.
of the 1,200 different kinds of fish and other animals and 500 plants that it contains, over 80% are unique.
there are unique molluscs, unique flatworms and even one unique mammal, the baikal seal.
this tiny seal is almost certainly descended from the ringed seal of the arctic sea.
today the lake is over 1,000 miles away from that sea.
it's likely that the ancestors of these creatures arrived during the ice age, when the journey may have been shorter and easier.
since then, cut off from other ringed seals, they've developed in their own way.
the amazon has no great lake on its course, so even in its middle stretches it still carries mud from the andes.
the rio negro, which joins it, is clear, for it has come from the north-west where the rocks are hard and bare.
the two immense rivers flow for miles alongside one another in the same bed, scarcely mixing.
as well as sediment, they also carry abundant nutrients, and life on their banks flourishes as never before
herds of capybara wade through the shallows, cropping the luxuriant plants.
they're excellent swimmers, with webs between their toes, and they have that placing of eyes, ears and nostrils so valuable to mammals that swim, on top of the head, so as the animal lies submerged,
they can see, hear and smell what's going on above water around them.
giant otters have a similar head design and sometimes lift themselves above the surface to get an even better view of their surroundings.
this amazonian species is the biggest of all the worlds otters, six feet long and and a most powerful swimmer.
it's well-equipped with large, webbed feet, a flattened tail and sensitive whiskers.
a pair lays claim to a stretch of river by making teritorial patches on the bank, marking them with their own personal smell.
there are otters in many of the great rivers of the world and they are the most graceful of swimmers.
in india they share the harvest of fish with the gavial.
most members of the crocodile family, when adult, feed largely on carrion, but the gavial eats only fish, and has long, narrow jaws, studded with abundant teeth, with which it catches them underwater.
a host of birds also claim a share of the river fish
this is the hooded merganser, one of a group of ducks called sawbills.
its beak, like the gavial's jaws, is long and narrow so it's easily snapped together underwater, and it also has a notched edge to give it a grip on the slippery fish.
but their feathers trap so much air that the pair have to work very hard to get down to any depths.
the fish eagle is not a diver but a pouncer, with a marvellously coordinated action.
the aerial onslaught on the fish continues not only throughout the day but at night.
in the last phase of their lives, these great rivers often flow out of control.
their tributaries far away in the mountains, fed by the heavy storms of the rainy season, pour so much water into them that they burst their banks.
the amazon rises every year to flood tens of thousands of square miles of forest, in some parts as much as 40 feet deep.
some of these trees are flooded for eight to ten months every year.
as the floods well out over the land, fish from the river travel with them.
this is going to be their best feeding time in the whole year.
all over the world as rivers approach their end, they begin to deposit the sand and mud that they've gathered from so far and carried for so long.
in many parts of the world reeds grow thickly on these shoals and banks, and their stems collect even more sediment as the river waters swirl through them.
it regurgitates from its crop ample supplies of fish and frogs for its young.
their world is an infinity of vertical stems, but they're nimble climbers from an early age, and they leave the nest within a few days of hatching.
there they wait, almost invisible, for their parents to return with restocked crops.
the reed-clogged waters of a river delta are full of potential riches, not only for birds but for human beings.
in the delta of the danube, the few solid sandbanks are tightly packed with dwellings.
earth has to be conserved with piles to prevent a slight change in the current from washing it away.
and there's the ever present threat of a rise in the water level caused not only by heavy rainstorms upstream but an unusually high tide, backed by a storm sweeping up from the sea, which can cause devastating floods.
in the twin joined deltas of the tigris and euphrates in iraq, the marsh arabs have become specialists in an amphibian life.
some are the most elaborate constructions, yet all these soaring arches and roofs are also made from bundles of reeds.
and reeds provide food for the livestock, so gathering them is a daily and never-ending chore.
the herds have to be as much at home in the water are they are on their floating platforms.
the rewards of this precarious existence are, of course, the abundant fish which live all around the houses and even underneath them.
so the fish and the marsh arabs and the pelicans all flourish in one integrated community.
the river has finely delivered the minerals it eroded from the mountains and the nutrients it collected from the forests.
for hundreds of miles along its lower course, the river has been so broad that it has been impossible to see from one side to another.
now, instead of receiving more tributaries, it splits into a tangle of separate channels.
it's neither land nor sea, but banks of mud and sand that are half the time submerged and half the time exposed.
and that intermediate, ever-changing territory is where we will be next time.
when it comes to speed, muscle is no match for machine.
the stanley steamer could breeze along at over a mile a minute,
our heads held high, we march along like little soldiers sing our song
you may be sure we'll get it right we're all in step, left-right, left-right!
you'll tell him all of that from me won't you, my dear, says she.
and this kiss i give you you'll give it to him from me.
you'll say that all to her won't you now, dear girl, from me?
and this kiss i give you you'll pass it on to her from me.
manuelita was saying loud, so everyone could hear she'd buy a donkey that caught her eye.
then said carmencita, ever one to mock and rant "what do you want a donkey for?
" for the ride i have in mind, the donkey'd suit you well!
for on that day, you'll ride with your nose stuck in the air!
two lackeys will follow to beat the flies out of your hair!"
at that, the two of them grabbed each other by the hair.
my friends, i would be pleased to leave with you tonight.
but this time, if you please my love must come before my duty.
the flower you threw at my feet in my prison cell i kept it by my side.
it wilted and died this flower but always it smelled just as sweet.
i see a young man come courting and he's madly in love with me!
mine's very rich and very old but he wants to marry me!
he takes me upon his horse and carries me off into the mountains!
in a castle fit for a king mine sets me up like a queen!
more gold than i can hold, diamonds, all kinds of gems!
mine becomes a famous leader with a hundred men at his back!
the card you hold then you will decry and happiness it will declare.
but if you must die if that terrible word is inscribed as your fate twenty times more you may try it.
if it costs me my life no, carmen, i won't go!
and the chain that binds us together shall bind us till death!
"this film was shot on location in spain... in ronda, carmona and seville, in the province of andalusia."

he will be here when the relief takes over for the old guard.
he will be here when the relief guard takes over for the old guard.
i shall come back when the relief guard takes over for the old guard.
you'd better stay, because the relief guard is taking over for the old guard.
love is a mutinous bird that nobody can tame, in vain, you call his name when it suits him, he'll refuse.
no point in threats or a pleading voice, the first speaks well, the other is dumb.
but if i love you, if i love you, watch out!
love is the child of gipsy life, and he loves to flout the law.
if you won't love me, if you won't love me, i'll love you!
but if i love you, if i love you, watch out!
τhe bird you thought you'd bait took wing and flew away, when love is far off, it makes you wait, when you give up, it's in the way.
αll round you, quickly winging by, it comes, it goes and back again.
αs your mother and i came out of the chapel, she gave me a kiss.
you're going, says she, to go to town, it won't be a long journey, once in seville
manuelita kept saying aloud, she'd buy a donkey that she fancied.
τhen, carmencita, ever one to scoff and laugh, said, "α donkey, what for?
however nice you are, a spell in jail will do you no harm.
in there, you can sing your gipsy songs, the jailer will tell you what he feels.
by the ramparts of seville, is a tavern owned by lillas pastia.
τhere i'll dance the seguidilla and take a glass of manzanilla,
by the ramparts of seville, is a tavern owned by lillas pastia.
τhere we'll go dance the seguidilla and take a glass of manzanilla.
but if i love you, if i love you, then watch out!
τhe sistrums' loops jingled harmoniously, from soft clanking to metallic jangling, and with this strange melody the gipsy girls arose.
αs dance and song, together bound, as dance and song, together bound, at first uncertain, and shy, growing lively and ever faster, faster, faster, round and round.
one gipsy after another made the instruments go wild, raising a dazzling din and bewitching the gipsy queens.
when it comes to trickery, dupery, and thievery, it's better to have a woman's complicity.
αnd honestly, and honestly, it's always better to have a woman's complicity.
my friends, i would be pleased to leave with you tonight.
but this time, if you please my love must come before my duty.
over there you'd follow me, you'd take me on your charger and like a gallant across country, riding pillion, we'd run away together.
over there, in the mountains, over there, over there, if you loved me, you'd follow me!
what i see is a young man courting and he's madly in love with me.
mine's very rich and very old, but he wants to marry me.
i mount his horse and we ride off into the mountains.
mine sets me up like a queen in a princely castle.
you shuffle in vain, the cards are too honest, the cards will never lie!
if you're destined for happiness in the book up on high, then fearlessly shuffle and cut.
τhe card in your hand will joyously turn up to announce your bliss.
but if you must die, if that terrible word is inscribed in the book as your fate, though you do it twenty times, the pitiless card will repeat nought but death.
if it costs me my life, no, carmen, i won't go!
αnd the chain that binds us together shall bind us to death!
if it costs me my life, no, no, i will not go!
listen to me, i beg you, the chain that binds you can be broken.
τhey even said that i should look out for my life.
but i'm a brave girl, and didn't want to run away.
"this film was shot on location in spain... in ronda, carmona and seville, in the province of andalusia."
"we gratefully thank antonio ordonez... who placed the bullring in ronda and its staff at our disposal... as well as bulls from its ranch."'
but she, following the habit of women and cats, who do not come when you call but come when you do not call, -
- she stopped in front of me and spoke to me.
don't go near the brambles don't go near the brambles the brambles have thorns thorns that tear aprons the brambles have thorns thorns that tear aprons
in this tobacco factory in this tobacco factory there are bad girls there are good girls in this tobacco factory there are more bitches than good girls in this tobacco factory

poor lover who is eaten up by jealousy from dusk till dawn jealousy devours him jealousy is to blame for many cowardly acts for many cowardly acts jealousy is to blame
you were sucked into it and now you want to play hero but that will hurt you even more.
they took me off that ship like i was some hardcore criminal.
israeli intelligence and various correspondents report a military coup in saudi arabia.
eben sadek, major of the saudi arabian air force supposedly arrested air force commander, ali ahmed, as well as eleven other officers in the early morning hours at the tabuk airport near the egyptian border.
in the next few days though, this low will affect the weather here as well.
the low approaching from the west will dominate the weather of central europe.
felix, i had a bad feeling from the start during this test.
why was "b" sector activated just a few days before our departure?
he was the one leading the program and successfully completing it.
you knew that weather research was the most important thing to max his life achievement.
it was his last time up there, and he was proud of this damned cora project.
he was probably thinking about his future on this dark and small planet.
all he cared about were his animals and plants while i trudged through "b" sector secretly plotting against him.
to this day i don't know what possessed me to do this.
the 5 lbs. of personal memories that you're allowed to take.
this is felix would you tell me what you're doing down there?
i don't know what billy told you, but nothing has been decided yet.
there is talk that i may get this job, you know how important it is for me.
i don't have to tell you how long it might take till they make up their mind.
it would be nice if you'd tell me directly next time.
they're trying to get their fellow citizens out of riyadh unnoticed.
they don't seem to care about exposing the same area over and over.
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five four, three, two, one, zero.
gregor, would you keep billy busy for a while, and join us later?
last night a u.s. navy helicopter unit tried to infringe upon saudi-arabia.
at a special u. n. session, the u.s. spokesperson denied any involvement.
from there, it would be easy getting to the control room.
you have to try to stop gregor from leaving with the shuttle!
in saudi-arabia, rebel troops succeeded in occupying the capital of riyadh.
so far they've taken over the royal palace and the radio station.
unfortunately they did succumb to heavy radiation exposure and died this afternoon.
the cause of the accident is not clear and will be further investigated.
you want an admission of guilt from me, so it will save your neck but i won't do that.
i think it's just a little too easy for you, and i owe it to max.
you knew that weather research was the most important thing to max his life achievement.
it was his last time up there, and he was proud of this damned cora project.
he was probably thinking about his future on this dark and small planet.
all he cared about were his animals and plants while i trudged through "b" sector secretly plotting against him.
to this day i don't know what possessed me to do this.
i guess, too much time up there affected my brain i didn't see what went on anymore.
rebellious troops are approaching the capital of riyadh where the royal army is preparing itself for the upcoming occupation.
the many bomb victims were buried in mass graves to avoid an epidemic.
the riyadh airport hostage situation made us hold our breath just as you.
though you live up here like on an island, far away from daily life shipwrecked, looking at the horizon each day for the end of your imprisonment.
as soon as billy switches to manual, you have to open the radiators.
time is tight, but i'm sure you can make it if you hurry.
no, it was just a matter of time till max figured out the game.
it is 3 o'clock, friday, november 11th and now the latest news.
- they use a radiation side-effect to deceive international satellite authorities.
they're trying to get their fellow citizens out of riyadh unnoticed.
i could try getting to the botanical area through the lower maintenance shaft.
from there, it would be easy getting to the control room.
the insidious part of this is that these people are not trained professionals.
the question we have to ask is can we entrust our national security to these amateurs?
you think that, uh, i was out there for my health?
you know the handstands i had to go through to get on this show?
i've read all of mr. harriman's spy novels and i could probably help.
i know you are upset, but i don't see how that can possibly help.
the russians would never pay as much as the americans would to get the book back.
no, our best bet is try to get ahold of the real manuscript.
lucky for you, i have read your client's books and i find him very predictable.
this episode of the wrong book is straight out of burial in munich which gives me an idea where the real book is hidden.
you'll find out soon enough after a refresher course in breaking and entering.
whoever took this book might not know they have the wrong one yet.
but, billy, this could be our only chance to really nail these guys.
now, i say we stuff the briefcase with bogus cash disguise francine and send her in amanda's place.
if they specifically asked for amanda we have to assume that they'll be watching her very carefully.
sir, i'm not a brave person, but i wanna go through with this.
by the time they identify your dental charts i should be on some south american plantation.
lee, i want you to know that i'm not at all worried.
i looked through the phone book and i just didn't know who to call.
and then i saw your name and i just felt you were meant to help me.
according to the police, the dogs attacked a couple less than a mile from diane's earlier in the day.
the attack on us appeared to be nothing more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
look, no offense, but kidnapped at five, a father who makes you take shooting lessons and keep a daily diary of suspicious persons.
well, i'd say it'd be amazing if you and your sister weren't paranoid.
i mean, i personally find you very sexy, but not in an overt way, just...
you sure know how to put your foot in it like i do.
higgins, i woke up this morning sensing a woman was going to dramatically affect my life, and then i met diane.
forgive me, magnum, but you are always meeting women who seem to dramatically affect your life.
you apparently hold some attraction for them that i can't quite fathom, other than the obvious primitive, animalistic...
higgins, i ran out of the club because i suddenly felt she was in danger.
the point is that when i reined in the mare and got my first look at elizabeth,
i swear to you, magnum, that i knew that someday she'd be my wife.
i know, i was supposed to stay out of the water, but i've always been able to think clearly when swimming, and right now, that was more important to me than any risk of infection.
i had to decide if i was going to walk away from diane before it was too late, before the curve of her neck or the look in her eyes hooked me.
in fact, when we were back in vietnam, we had to blindfold him when we were going on the deck.
in fact, one time outside of da nang when we were flying low...
he said that if you lived on the makai or ocean side, you were a fisherman.
but if you were on the mauka or mountain side, you were a farmer.
i can't find any signs of blood, tracks or bullet holes.
however, i did find these baggage stubs outside the door there.
well, it's almost 1:00 and i still have things to do.
if you don't mind, magnum, i'll take mr. masters' ferrari and have one of the boys drop it off in the morning.
i couldn't shake higgins' suggestion that there might not have been an intruder, that the whole episode could have happened in diane's mind.
it would explain why i hadn't sensed anything while we were kissing at the front door.
i'd sensed diane was coming, that she was in trouble when the dogs attacked.
why didn't i sense the danger when her assailant was only a few feet from me?
there's fine smoking pleasure in fine tobacco... and lucky strike means fine tobacco.
so round, so firm... he said, "do you want the job?"
they said this is how you're supposed to do it on the radio, hon.
i don't think it's going to do a bit of good, sweetheart.
i want to take this opportunity to welcome all the many new associates... to the macbride aircraft company here in santa monica.
we are engaged in a great world struggle... to maintain our american way of life as we know it.
riveting is real suited to you gals... because women are used to repetitive tasks.
believe me, ladies, as strange as all this may seem... after training, you'll use these tools as easily... as you would a can opener or a sewing machine needle at home.
it's great working with you... and i think you're the best leadman on the line... and i just know you're a swell fellow.
but you've been asking me out every week for the last five months... and i keep having to turn you down.
if you had me to keep you company you wouldn't need vitamins.
all these guys think they're god's gift, every last one of them.
remember, the swing shift jamboree... this saturday night at the egyptian ballroom.
united states naval forces have destroyed... twenty-three japanese warships and transports... peewee, where did you get that dress?
why don't you go on inside and enjoy yourself with your new friends?
i think i'd like to just finish my cigarette, if you don't mind.
isn't it unusual for somebody with your amazing looks to be a riveter?
no, it's amazing for someone with my unusual looks to be a riveter.

i've been working at this damn place for 12 long years.
this is my parking space, and i ain't about to lose it to a bunch of fly-by-night women like you.

when you call them... white candles flowers and melon must be ready
these are so soft, they must be easy to eat, right?
you should know that your son hasn't been... touching any woman other than you
you didn't ask him, how do you know that he... is helping others or self-sacrificing?

i'm amazed of what we can do with the hypnosis camera.
no one can disobey an order given by one of the photos coming out of that camera.
in their battles of life and death they are connected by great bonds of friendship.
it proves that if you trust and love each other so much that you will not lose against any evil.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
did you come to cast your bread upon the waters, reverend?
looks like the guy i'm meeting here has done a no-show on me.
now they make it in iron vats... and then cook it off in car radiators.
and all that corrosion and lead goes straight into what they pour over the bar.
the bad guys never know it when you're doing phase one.
now, phase two... that's when the soup sticks to the spoon.
well, we have the element of surprise on drew and his muscle.
and the boys here will just keep on doing their work... like there's nothing wrong at all.
she's gonna put braces all over my teeth and then sell my lips to a bologna factory.
i can't seem to find your x-rays in dr. klink's office yet.
but i thought i better help you calm down a little before i looked any farther.
i'm going to give you some nitrous oxide to take some of the edge off.
and then we're gonna pour that slime down the nearest hole.
you keep talking, fella... and i'm gonna stuff you down that hole myself.
i didn't think you'd have the plumbing to take the humiliation in person.
we just dropped by to let you people know you're playing with the wrong guy.
this guy is so mad, he's looking for a river to dump us in.
face, now they may have asked us to dance... but they don't know that we're gonna do a flamenco on their little heads.
i'm sorry, reverend, but he's just telling it like it is.
we don't like going around hurting people, but we do like wrecking a bad still.
and you can throw in some 30-ought-six if you feel like it.
you guys talk tough for people a little close to being dead.
i'm not sure that's how drew and his friends are gonna look at all this.
all they're gonna see are some small rooms for a long time.
i'll tell you one thing, you sure made my job here a lot easier.
by that, i mean the job i'm supposed to be doing.
well, even if it wasn't, i especially wanted to thank you.
i'm just sorry that we didn't get a chance to be better friends, b.a.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
you know, this place reminds me of that villa you "acquired" in saigon.
in those days you'd do just about anything to get something you wanted.
now they make it in iron vats... and then cook it off in car radiators.
and all that corrosion and lead goes straight into what they pour over the bar.

but i thought i better help you calm down a little before i looked any farther.
i'm going to give you some nitrous oxide to take some of the edge off.
think we could step to the back, take care of some private business?
if you're gonna make any deliveries, friend, you ought to make them with the man... who has the new majority interest in this establishment.
i didn't think you'd have the plumbing to take the humiliation in person.
we just dropped by to let you people know you're playing with the wrong guy.
this guy is so mad, he's looking for a river to dump us in.

i'm sorry, reverend, but he's just telling it like it is.
we don't like going around hurting people, but we do like wrecking a bad still.
reverend, sometimes our work is kind of like yours. lt's a matter of faith.
i'm not sure that's how drew and his friends are gonna look at all this.
all they're gonna see are some small rooms for a long time.
i'll tell you one thing, you sure made my job here a lot easier.
and why were you so anxious to get amanda out of denver?
i don't wanna lose amanda to blake and his obsessive behaviour.
the way he ran, a formidable animal like this, you know i must have him.
be at the auction, monsieur la salle, you'll have your chance.
so why shouldn't we just forget about those two people who made our lives miserable?
why can't we try and build a brand-new future for ourselves, together?
would you come back to denver and take a blood test?
i know it won't prove anything definitely, but at least it's a start.
it's just that there's nothing in the world that would make me happier than to have you as my father.
about the test, i'll be back as soon as the wedding's over.
item number 20, allegree, has been regrettably removed from today's auction.
you pull allegree out of the auction and now you wanna sell him to me.
if you don't mind, i'd rather not hear about your early sex life.
well, i was going to exaggerate it beyond all credibility to try and bring a smile to your face.
dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of god and in the face of this company to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honourable estate instituted of god, signifying unto us the mystic union between christ and his church.
and it is therefore not by any to be taken unadvisedly or lightly, but rather discreetly, soberly and in the fear of god.
into this holy estate, these two persons present come now to be joined.
if any man knows any lawful cause why they not be joined together,
mr. reece, uh, forgive me for asking this, but what is going on here?
i mean, first your behaviour with allegree, and now cancelling these plans.
then you and i will go down to the lobby now, and you'll give me back my passport.
amanda, i don't have to accompany you, you're not a child.
blake, i just dropped by to say thank you for inviting me to spend christmas with you and the family.
brady's off to tokyo and it would have been a very lonely holiday for me.
dominique, i am very grateful for all that you have done.
and half sister or not, i think you're quite an extraordinary woman.
- "lt was early that first christmas morning when the young drummer boy turned to his mother and told her about a beautiful dream he'd had during the night.
he dreamed that the king had sent a special messenger to ask him to play his drum at the royal christmas party."

while i tell of yuletide treasure fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
fast away the old year passes fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

well, i don't know what you intend to do with it,
i'm merely suggesting what i think you ought to do with it.
in the middle east, a dramatic breakthrough... as the occupied city of jerusalem saw a combined force... of arab and israeli commandoes briefly liberate the wailing wall... before being driven back by counter-attacking visitor troops.
closer to home, news from los angeles, california... where strongman nathan bates has solidified his position... in creating what is being called an "open city"... similar to lisbon during world war ii...
he organized members of his senior class into the george washington brigade... and led them into action at bear's point, kentucky.
they routed an alien patrol... while heavy fighting continued in the appalachian mountains.
i wish i shared your understanding of how this pertains to the war effort.
the only way nathan bates will give us the starchild... is if we offer him something more valuable.
time to develop an infallible means of driving the visitors from the planet.
we're going to develop the new red dust right here... with the utmost secrecy and the greatest possible speed.
lt'd be such a pity if i had to kill you.
maybe i can figure out a reason for you to keep me alive.
this week, the freedom network awards the medal of valor... to 18-year-old kipper cordisco of cleveland, ohio.
he organized members of his senior class into the george washington brigade... and led them into action at bear's point, kentucky.
nathan and kyle live apart... rarely speak, and haven't seen one another... since last year when kyle was expelled from stanford university.
since then, the younger bates has spent his time racing motorcycles... mostly in arizona and nevada.
when police arrived. they had been rolling in swill for 10 minutes.
they've been in the holding cell since 7:00 this morning. fermenting.
in reality. it's merely a ploy for attention by lonely people.
i've read studies that indicate several of these patients are quite intelligent.
599 seconds 599 seconds it will take another six hours before it explodes.
those biomen will find out if it takes another six hours!
i myself have three pairs of socks and three pairs of knickers.
that means i've only worn them 269 times each since the last wash.
maybe all the sludgy bits from other machines will be enough.
neil, you carry on. "if you require conditioner..." well, do we?

if you hadn't pulled that cord, that man wouldn't have thrown us off.
he threw us off because you said aslef was an anagram for "total bastard".
look... sorry to hassle you, bambi, but i really need the toilet badly.
yes, well, footlights lead by 15 points, but it's early days yet...
i lost a ton, but i put it straight back on again.
i understand that many men must have asked of you that which you weren't prepared to give, but i pledge you my word as a gentleman that i would never take what you didn't offer freely, nor enter where asked to remain outside.
i then called the railway company, and booked a seat on the 7.30 train next morning.
in a letter to my landlord, i told him i was leaving, and asked him if i could get my deposit back, and pay only half of the rent since the month had just begun.
too bad i didn't have a tv to watch like everybody else, waiting to fall asleep.
i just looked out of the window to watch the world on display.
the woman on the phone said that 2 women were fighting in a nearby apartment.
at what time did charlotte le dantec arrive at your place?
you can't teach an old dog like me a new trick.
but the old dog can learn to mind his own business.
she shook her head, as if to push back her hair.
she looked like she was trying to keep her head above water.
keeping this car was probably madness, but it was my only way to stay in contact with them.
i don't know whether it was courage or masochism, but i wanted to see the man who wept, the wolfman, to find out why he was looking for charlotte.
and so i told him everything, and let him pay for the drinks.
it was probably the last time he could offer me a drink.
in that situation, you grab onto anyone, anyone who looks human and in the same shit as you.
i moved in with her, and then we met some people.
it would be easier if you didn't lie all the time.
when i arrived it was locked and i can't open locked doors.
i began wondering whether i was thwarting the course of justice.
but truth be told, right now i don't give a fuck about the course of justice.
instead of being at home with a drink and a paper,
i'm in a bistro, doing overtime, being insulted by a bum.
i wonder what's stopping me from throwing you in the slammer, for withholding evidence and obstruction of justice.
there are two kinds of people who fear police, those who've done something bad and those who have an anti-police bias.
i can say i'm not doing too badly, which is not something all gunshot victims can say.
my mother asked me what all these people wanted from me.
once, a bootlace had been used to mend a hole in his coaches.
at the end of the line, james left his coaches and got ready for his next train.
speaking purely for myself... and since you know that i'm committed to your work,
i have to say that i can see an element of danger in it.
i mean the danger that no matter how cautious, no matter how objective he may be, the mind-reader
- i mean no offense - may inadvertently read his own thoughts into a subject's mind.
you know quite well you can make your numbers fit anything you like.
the fact is, you believe life marches to a rhythmic drum, you're certain of it and you work from that hypothesis.
you find that a woman's 28-day cycle doesn't work for men, so you come up with a 23-day cycle.
if that doesn't fit the case, you multiply the two, subtract five and, if needs be, add the number you first thought of.
but in revenge for his hold over your mother and your sister, clara.
and now you can operate on your patients and every one is your father.
in fact, it's about time i did some original work of my own.
i've been planning a new work, to be called bisexuality in man.
for some reason, there was only one other chair at their table and fliess had put his cloak over it.
not just hanging over it - he'd put it around the chair, covering it.
it's among my worst qualities, a certain contempt for others, whether they frighten me or i them.
in the depths of my heart i can't help feeling that my fellow men are as... morally untrustworthy as i am.
her smile reawakens a memory - the smile of rapture on his mother's face as he suckled at the breast.
but instead of making love to her, he paints the picture and he pays with self-denial for the world's applause.
as a result, you find me the prisoner of a fixed and somewhat solitary, even rigid, routine.
my only forays into public life are my visits to the tobacconist next to the cafe landtmann.
dear adler, you must be aware how much i value your contributions to our wednesday society... and i particularly welcome your offer to read us a paper on sadism and neurosis... thereby expanding my own work on the sexual perversions
which, as you know, has attracted more than its fair share of attention.
i think that dr. tausk has adhered somewhat too slavishly to the concept of the latency period in childhood.
no one here questions the concept, but we cannot ignore the fact that certain developments, sexual in their consequences if not in their nature, affect the individual between infancy and puberty.
the child is increasingly subject to the spirit of competition during this time, in forms which recapitulate, we may say, the passionate contests of the nursery.
nevertheless, he is learning to compare himself to his fellows, both socially and physically, whether for better or for worse, and surely these experiences will also mold his attitudes to his fellows in later life and his sexual responses.
the diphasic nature of our sexual evolution, entailing a resumption of the sexual life in puberty, is precisely what distinguishes our psychic development from that of animals.
it's the seed-bed of neurosis - the gap, the lull...in our development.
er, by which time the competitive spirit is thoroughly engaged on the level of the ego... and will be mastered, er...or not... in the light of earlier oedipal confrontations... er, rather than the other way round.
i hope the herr professor will share his comments with me later.
i have been in correspondence with two... members - "inmates", i was going to say - of the burgholzli psychiatric hospital in zurich.
bleuler and jung are two leading lights among the staff there.
if i'd had the temerity, i would have dedicated it to you.
reading your work has brought about a rebirth in my approach to medicine.
now, until recently you could say that the work largely consisted of tabulation, er, itemizing symptoms in the crudest possible way.
the patient displays such-and-such contortions, the patient doesn't speak, the patient speaks nonsense.
a classic example of the failure to keep the two halves of the personality in balance, masculine and feminine.
just as the man must not deny his feminine side, so the woman must not deny her masculinity, or he will compensate in startling ways, as in this case.
not only does adulthood recapitulate the earlier stages of infancy... childhood itself rehearses the infancy of man, the primitive history of mankind.
i'm convinced of it - that during the first months and years we live through a kind of...animism.
all the same, i did not mean to influence you so precipitately when i came into your life.
do you realize we spoke for 13 hours non-stop the other day?
and i do not have a reputation for being garrulous with my colleagues.
you may be grieved to hear i have sorted out the business with the bookcase.
our caretaker, an unlikely exorcist, informed me that the water pipes are responsible.
when the warm water comes at six o'clock, the wood expands in answer.
i only wish you could be here to celebrate the coming of boletus edulis.
these are precious weeks and the children are outdoors all day and i can enjoy them freely without feeling i'm snatching time from the few creative years ahead of me.
but we are asked to accept that at the same time the wolves represent the boy himself - in their immobility, watching him - that he is the watcher as well as the watched
the dream masks a memory of watching something terrible - his parents making love in the manner of beasts, atergo, while he was younger still.
well, if...if i may be permitted to answer, it is, of course, not only fanciful but fantastic, as befits the iconography of dreams.
how else can they escape the censorship of the mind, except in code, in puns, inversions, outlandish similes?
every one can be deciphered, and in more than one way.
because the issue here is not whether this particular interpretation is correct, but whether it leads where all the other trails lead, to the heart of the patient's condition - his fear of a bestial assault in infancy.
it can be an evasion of the truth, one of the many faces of resistance.
look, i'm sure we can agree that this is a matter of emphasis and not dogma.
but you say it in freud's presence and expect us to permit it.
you, who are completely unaware of the aversion you create in everyone around you.
this being the cornerstone in question - fear of the father - which goes hand in hand with the child's jealous passion for the mother.
adler merely wishes to draw our attention to the way in which the man's present condition has...activated, shall we say, the crucial memories.
in essence, his view of the case is substantially the same as freud's.
unfortunately for this conclusion... there are two people here who do not share it.
it came just as we were discussing the core of our wretched disputes.
i have asked myself whether i did it so as to forego an opportunity to show off my new-found honors.
and when this...empire i have founded is orphaned... you, and you alone, will inherit.
like joshua, he is destined to explore the promised land which i am only permitted to view from afar.
the rope they used has decayed but you can see the marks around his neck.
the body is intact - so much so that an analysis was possible on the contents of the stomach, establishing the man's last meal - erm, wine, some seeds, a kind of gruel.
and i believe our founder, jonas clark, would have been proud - as proud as i am today - to welcome to clark university the founder of a school for pedagogy already rich in new methods and achievements,
leader among the students of psychology and sex, of psychotherapy and analysis -
they paint a palate with boundaries that stop... only at the horizons of one's imagination.
however, when the sun goes down, it looks the same all over the world.
you could dance and eat until your feet and stomach were begging for mercy.
so why catch forty winks at home and set the alarm clock for 2:00 a. m... closing time all over town?
probably the biggest game of the year and i was going to get to see it... alone, without interruptions... courtesy of the sports channel and the new cable system robin had installed.
so what if i'd had to avoid friends and radios all day... so i wouldn't accidentally hear the score.
harry, i say the sun is up, the stands are packed...
tigers are ready, and it promises to be a great game.
we interrupt tonight's game... between the baltimore orioles and the detroit tigers... for this late-breaking news flash.
right now we have a live report from reporter ami tenenbaum... at the scene of this shocking story.
i'm here at the posh and exclusive kamehameha club... where a daring armed robbery has just occurred.
apparently, three masked, heavily armed gunmen... broke into the club at closing and robbed the manager of cash receipts... totaling thousands of dollars.
as it is... the board has decided to let her go.
as manager of the club, it is your responsibility to tell her.
hey, i thought you were in a rush to get out of here.
how can we possibly go home... if you're going to distort everything?
now, if you give me that gun right now, maybe, just maybe...
i could talk ice pick out of not making you sushi for the sharks.
wait, t.c. he didn't get to explain what happened to your clothes.
yeah, well, he may not live long enough to explain that to you.
it was closing time and joy was just finishing her last set at the piano.
i was having this fascinating conversation... with this lovely young lady that i'd met at a poetry meeting.
- except that neither of you is reciting... anything even remotely resembling the truth.
but, of course, what can one expect from simple, primitive minds... that overload at the drop of a... multi-dependent-claused declarative sentence?
over the past three years you have continuously and deliberately tried... to distract me by donning that ridiculous gorilla mask.
an act, i might add, which i have managed through enormous self-will, to ignore.
gentlemen, and i use that term in its broadest possible sense.
i must inform you that your only rational alternative to lengthy incarceration... is to quickly lay down your weapons.
i will personally see to it that the prosecutors take into consideration... any mitigating circumstances which may have caused you to enter into this... utterly foolhardy and hopeless act.
now that your ringleader is away... and you have the opportunity to surrender...
you guys may not realize it... but you said some things that were very contradictory.
i told you we shouldn't have started to talk about this in the first place.
i've been looking at what was different in your stories instead of what was the same.
yes, there's no need to go through everything again, is there?
they paint a palate with boundaries that stop... only at the horizons of one's imagination.
however, when the sun goes down, it looks the same all over the world.
so why catch forty winks at home and set the alarm clock for 2.:00 a.m... closing time all over town?
because sometimes in hawaii... sports events are aired very late at night... and tonight was the pivotal game in the american league east pennant race.
tigers are ready, and it promises to be a great game.
(announcer on tv) we interrupt tonight's game... between the baltimore orioles and the detroit tigers... for this late-breaking news flash.
right now we have a live report from reporter ami tenenbaum... at the scene of this shocking story.
(ami) i'm here at the posh and exclusive kamehameha club... where a daring armed robbery has just occurred.
apparently, three masked, heavily armed gunmen... broke into the club at closing and robbed the manager of cash receipts... totaling thousands of dollars.
we are expecting to hear from one of the board of directors at any moment... but in the meantime... perhaps we can find out what the police have to say on this matter.
jonathan higgins, who was apparently... present at the time of the robbery.
mr. higgins, can you give us your comments as to... what happened here at the club?
hey, i thought you were in a rush to get out of here.
(higgins) how can we possibly go home... if you're going to distort everything?
except that-- except that neither of you is reciting... anything even remotely resembling the truth.
but, of course, what can one expect from simple, primitive minds... that overload at the drop of a... multi-dependent-claused declarative sentence?
(t.c.) but, of course, they had no way of knowing that.
and if you hadn't told them, they'd be out cashing clues all over the city... and we'd have some way of tracking them down.
it was closing time and joy kelly was just finishing up... her last set at the piano.
although i was tired and longed for nothing more than a quiet brandy at home... things unfortunately had reached such a deplorable state at the club... that my assistance was desperately required.
gentlemen, and i use that term in its broadest possible sense.
i must inform you that your only rational alternative to lengthy incarceration... is to quickly lay down your weapons.
i will personally see to it that the prosecutors take into consideration... any mitigating circumstances which may have caused you to enter into this... utterly foolhardy and hopeless act.
now that your ringleader is away... and you have the opportunity to surrender... i implore you, do so.
you guys may not realize it... but you said some things that were very contradictory.
i told you we shouldn't have started to talk about this in the first place.
funny thing is... the bet he placed on tonight's tigers game would've pulled him out.
you should have heard them out there... both trying to take credit for having solving this thing.
well yeah, but after i practically dragged it out of you.
it's like the three of you had some sort of pact of secrecy... not to tell me the end of the story.
last night i heard meows, i didn't know where they came from.
i dreamt that i opened a door and i saw a man and a woman and she was breathing like a cat does.
"now and then i touch this cross which still holds... the smell of your body, which i love madly".
is it true you made love like in the soap operas?
one of our brothers has been brutally deprived from his life.
and i truly say, as the lord said, that what you do to the smallest of my brothers you do to me.
it will only be harmful for the church if we didn't punish this act to satisfy religion and the laws.
and the prevent with healthy rectitude the demoralization, the immorality and disorder."
last night i heard meows, i didn't know where they came from.
i dreamt that i opened a door and i saw a man and a woman and she was breathing like a cat does.
"because my passion, dear madam, doesn't know about the limits of time".
"now and then i touch this cross which still holds... the smell of your body, which i love madly".
but go on, love letters wilt when they're not read again.
"your angelical body vibrates in my arms... even when i don't have you anymore".
and i truly say, as the lord said, that what you do to the smallest of my brothers you do to me.
it's time to know all kingdom divided against itself won't last.
you, who love quoting the bible, have forgotten what jesus... said to his disciples.
"since i'm sending you like sheep amongst wolves... be as prudent as snakes and simple as doves".
this letter was left for you while you were at mass.
when i hear the bells ring it's like you're speaking to me.
don maximo, if you allow me and so does... what i've drunk i want to raise my glad in honor... of your charming wife.
besides i wanted to thank you for being... our children's first teachers.

gentlemen, i'm not gonna beat around the bush on this thing.
we've known each other since grade school, so i'm gonna give this to ya right from the hip.
yeah, well, rick and his pals are probably knee-deep in whores by now.
- i can't wait to see what those guys are up to.
i called her and told her that you were about to be put on the unavailable list.
she decided to come over and give you a little something.
at least we can make sure you go out in style.
let's have a bachelor party, with chicks and guns and fire trucks and hookers and drugs and booze...
one of these days, i'm gonna burn the thompson court right to the ground.
i gotta admit my tennis is a little rusty, but polo...
i'd like to adopt this 17-year-old korean girl i've had my eye on.
i figure why beat around the bush, but, i mean, this pup is fertile, and i know i'm perfectly capable, so you don't have to worry.
this big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances laying around.
debbie, cole is just trying to save you from making a mistake.
i have to admit, even for rick, that was beyond the valley of good taste.
yeah, well, rick and his pals are probably knee-deep in whores by now.

# or the way his nostrils flare every time he combs his hair

yeah, well, rick and his pals are probably knee-deep in whores by now.
- i can't wait to see what those guys are up to.
i called her and told her that you were about to be put on the unavailable list.
she decided to come over and give you a little something.
at least we can make sure you go out in style.
let's have a bachelor party, with chicks and guns and fire trucks and hookers and drugs and booze...
one of these days, i'm gonna burn the thompson court right to the ground.
i gotta admit my tennis is a little rusty, but polo...
i'd like to adopt this 17-year-old korean girl i've had my eye on.
i figure why beat around the bush, but, i mean, this pup is fertile, and i know i'm perfectly capable, so you don't have to worry.
this big lug is in love and he's got a lot of major appliances laying around.
debbie, cole is just trying to save you from making a mistake.
i have to admit, even for rick, that was beyond the valley of good taste.
yeah, well, rick and his pals are probably knee-deep in whores by now.
# it must be the thrill she gets when he lights her cigarette
# or the way his nostrils flare every time he combs his hair
bobbi and phoebe are gonna throw me a shower. lt's gonna be so much fun!
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are gonna throwfor me.

i called her and told her that you were about to be put on the unavailable list.
she decided to come over and give you a little something.
i can only make around 100-120 referrals a year that are then granted.
you can imagine how many of the 3000 get left behind.
we have to rearrange everything, and i need an office for my books and...
there's no way we can give you an office as a student.
if you would iike to speak with my colleague again, you're welcome to do so.
based on the social welfare ordinance, we are no ionger able to help you.
but now i'm stuck, so i thought i'd come back and see if you could help.
if i'd come six months ago it wouldn't have been any different.
but the fact remains that we already helped with 740 marks.
that was one-time financial support in the sense that we helped you very generously because of the trouble and problems you were having.
you would be eligible if you had an income of 230 marks.
that means, in the case of school enrollment or a youth ceremony, we could've given you one-time financial support.
there's no way to do it legally, but nevertheless, if you have a real problem, we can do this or that."
that's why i came here, and now i know it's not possible.
i'm behind in every way, but i don't want it to affect my child.
i want her to start school the same way other kids do.
your daughter isn't in the plan and i can't tell someone in the plan
"you can't get anything because it's her turn to get something."
we said "outside the plan," but i have to follow the plan first.
my plan is the iaw, and i have to execute it.
my mother made a statement saying i had a right to enter the apartment.
i also had a new lock put in because she lost her key.
- but it was already 5:30 pm and then it was too late.
if it's border area you are only allowed to be there with police authorization.
well, last night, around 10 or so, after 10, i met the other colleague.
and he made an appointment for me at 10 am today at station 14.
i've always tried to find work, and i worked in operncafé for a lump sum.
i'm going to go back there and see if they'ii insure me, if they'ii give me salary work.
i called, we had a phone, and talked with the person in charge.
i asked her if i couid take a vacation because i had some problems.
well get rid of all the ds and the cs too if it's possible.
if we get rid of the ds then we'ii be pretty well off.
yeah, but i might have some cs in my other subjects, where i used to have bs and then i'd have the same average.
you know, when we talk you seen pretty responsible to me.
i'm sure you and your mother had a little talk before about all these problems.
do you often do the types of things that the people's police force told us about?
if you were in the 9th or 10th grade then i'd understand that.
those boys are too vain to be seen with bags of bottles and newspapers.
i'm trying to set it right, but i can't do that over night.
... then we can fix it a little at a time.
i've already introduced myself to you, but i'd iike to warmly welcome you in behalf of the berlin mitte district council.
dearly beloved, we have gathered here today to seal your friendship and love for one another in the bond of matrimony.
with this step you take on new and quite nice tasks:
you promise to trust and help each other, to be there for each other unseifishiy, to share both happiness and sorrow with each other, to abandon selfish wishes.
these are qualities that create an enduring bond between man and wife.
in our country marriage and the family are under special protection.
i would iike to say that the happiness of your marriage will only endure if you both contribute to it.
for not only are you man and wife before the iaw, more importantly you are life partners and friends.
your wedding day, september 1, 1984, is also the international day of peace.
on a day like today it should be clear to you that your active participation is necessary to withhold this peace.
why not take a minute to remember how you met, or to think back on the happy hours you've already shared?
you must know that marriage and family are more than just friendship and love.
and that the love between a man and a woman must be preserved in a wide variety of iife situations.
once i read something from theodor fontane who claimed that love can be sustained by small courtesies.
but you know, in this day and age we know full well that it takes a iot more than that.
from my own experience i couid add that relationships do not always stay the same.
by that i mean that we should respect our partner, understand him, and make sure he feels that his happiness and weii-being are of great importance to you.
yes, this will create healthy homes which in turn give each partner strength and enthusiasm.
for this reason one should go to try, spurred on by the fundamentals of socialist morals and ethics, not to focus only on individual needs.
always be in balance with the tasks and interests of the society.
on this, your wedding day, you will be showered with many words of congratulations.
i hope and wish for you that you master your life together as open, joyful young people.
to speak a clear, distinct "yes," when i ask each of you in turn if you are willing to enter into the bond of matrimony with each other.
and when i clearly and distinctly hear that from you both then i'd iike to say that that is the proof that you both love each other very much.
dear ms. radke, dear mr. baiser, may i now ask you to stand.
do you, gerd baiser, take petra radke as you wife, and accept the surname you both selected:
you have both given your word of consent, and i confirmed that with my signature.
you are hereby, under the iaw of our german democratic republic, now a married-coupie.
he never used a white stick, but his clouded malacca was heard daily, tapping the corridors of the raw courts.
he had no use for therapy, dogs, or training, nor did he adapt himself to his condition.
did he enjoy the night he spent in the field from which he was miraculously able to overlook his own kitchen?
he sent words into the darkness like soldiers to battle and was never short of reinforcements.
you are hardly an expert witness on the subject of love, are you?
members of the jury, love has driven men and women in times past to curious extremes.
but surely there is no more curious example of the mysterious effects of the passion than the spectacle of captain waring of the royal engineers roosting in a tree, complacently viewing the seduction of his beloved through a pair of strong racing binoculars.
is not the whole story, members of the jury, an improbable and impertinent tissue of falsehoods?
no one ever got a word of sense out of any schoolmaster.
you may at a pinch take their word about, equilateral hexagons, but life...
ﬂ when springtime does come ﬂ ﬂ won't we have fun ﬂ ﬂ we'll throw up our jobs and we'll go on the bum ﬂ
look as if you know what you're doing, and nobody's going to laugh.
- just put that down, dear, and get on with it.
my own final speech lasted four hours, and i made several jokes.
give us, if thy will be done, give us the great opportunity to shed our blood for our country and our beloved school and fill us with that feeling of sportsmanship which led our fathers to fix bayonets and fight until the last whistle blew.
we shall now sing the concluding song on our hymn sheet,
we hope it will keep you from thinking o-of your great unhappiness.
reigate's got your greatcoat, and the boy's wearing your old sam browne.
of course, if you're awake, you can do something about it.
you can change into a pair of shorts and go for a run across country or get into a bath and turn on the cold tap.
your garden might give me a few ideas... on, digging for victory.
i mean, you'll probably end up as a writer, won't you?
they say i'm not cut out to be an assistant director.
when i yelled for quiet, all the electricians went on strike.
my father always says that in time of war, one should avoid the temptation to do anything heroic.
i think after today, i'll give up the film business, take up the law.
well, i know it came as a bit of a shock to you when peter divorced elizabeth.
it must have come a bit of a shock to you, too, didn't it?
when i was a child, the woods were dark and full of flies, and we picked bracken leaves to swat them, and he told me we carried cuﬂasses to hack our way through the jungle.
i used to shut my eyes at dead rats or magpies gibbeted on the trees... sights his blindness spared him.
he walked with his hand on my arm... a small hand with loose brown skin.
from time to time, i had an urge to pull away from him, to run into the trees and hide, to leave him alone, lost in perpetual darkness.
a fine bedroom suite, they tell me, in a good state of preservation.
you know, you're quite a catch, if you want my honest opinion.
because father had a clerk called george who got killed on the somme.
so when henry took over, father went on calling him george.
you're an improvement on the ones he used to bring home.
gals who closeted themselves in the bathroom for hours on end.
he occupied the basement of our chambers, rooms that could easily be seen from the garden, where the masters of the king's bench strolled after dinner.
well, they were strolling there, history relates, after some grand night with, some royal personage... king, queen, princess, something of the kind.
i'm so relieved to find you can lie as mercifully as anyone.
it was a hot, endless night in a small house surrounded by a great garden in which all the plants were on the point of mutiny.
yet we know we have here no permanent home... but we seek our future home.
therefore, let us... bear her body to the grave... in the hope of the resurrection.
almighty god, we thank thee... that through the resurrection of thy son...
thou hast shed thy light on the darkness of the world... and of death.
so sour... they shrivel your arse and your shin-tail with it.
sit down, little hermann, we'll keep each other company a bit.
i used to be young and jolly lusty, today i'm onlyjolly.
when you're young you say, for you don't understand... if only/ were older, wouldn't that be grand?
naturally, not on the first feed i see... but, if i may say so, on a proper airfield...
with a cosy hangar, where you know your aeroplanés... in good hands.
when i want to shoot, i look over and press the trigger.
this is the rear sight and this is the fore sight.
oh, we do have nurses in this town... two of them.
one of them ran off to get married, the other one drinks.
when i was little, i used to pray i'd get a heat rash... so my mama would give me a rubdown.
sometimes she'd give me one anyway... just because it felt so good.
to marry would mean death for us... lf you love less than i... lf remorse... i am yours, with all my heart, my love.
i' ll follow you to the end the farthest end of the earth;
with you, unafraid, i shall face the evil fate of war, and for me there will be nothing but the constant joy of love.
i shall follow you, let us go, for the fate can never keep us apart.
you are the breath, the light, the soul of this heart which loves you;
so long as a breath of life is in me, my sole, unchanging desire, shall be to give you you every wish.
we follwed them as far as cadiz, but could not find the guilty pair.
for his friend, pereda suffered, for his heart spoke out for him.
there, and every place else we went, we heard that the girl had perished with the father, and that in a fight with the servants and guards, only the seducer escaped.
i then went away from vargas, while he swore to track down the killer.
at dawn, you will go alone, on foot, to the hermitage;
but first let the holy bread bring comfort to your soul.
go now to put on your holy garb, and may your heart be strong.
upon the hard, new road, the lord will send you help.
within my breast i feel a new birth of life in my heart.
sing praises, o ye heavenly choirs, for the lord has forgiven me my sin.
from your cave the bell will warn us if danger threatens you, or if your last hour has come.
then we shall hasten to comfort your soul, before its return to god.
for she can read the message of the dark, mysterious future.
come running, gather round her reach out your hands to her!
for she can tell if sweethearts have been faithful to you.
let us run to the fortune-teller, holding out our hands to her, for she' ll tell if your sweethearts have been faithful to you.
those, who want paradise, pluck up your courage, and prepare to defeat the barbarian invader.
come forward, you' ll hear me predict what prizes you will win from your fighting.
our poor mothers wept as we left them, snatched by cruel war.
they have torn us away from all we love, our only wish is to go home again.
take a look at what's around you, i' ll bet you i can guess...
you will see lots of pretty faces which will comfort you tomorrow.
and instead of sackcloth and ashes, must wa have venus and bacchus?
the earth has become a house of tears, and every convent, the haven of rascals!
rataplan, rataplan, the beat of the drum promises victory in battle.
rataplan, rataplan, the ranks are forming and they' re off to war!
to give charity is to fulfil a duty that could make an angel proud...
who, after three days in my job, would end up doling out blows instead of stews.
talks to himself... and has a strange look in his eyes... lt is due to his prayers, the fasting.
yesterday, while working in the orchard, he rolled his eyes so much that jokingly i said to him:
it was useless, alvaro, to hide from the world and to try to shield your villainy in hypocritical robes.
hate and thirst for vengeance showed me the road to this cloister where you hide.
o god, let me die, for only in death shall i know peace.
my soul sought peace in vain in this world, my soul, the prey of eternal sorrow.
only the offspring of this artificially inseminated american lion is left.
it was a fertilized egg with human genes inserted, so if its intelligence evolves, it is a particularly dangerous one!
these genes—passed from parent to kid, and from kid to grandkid— are copies of the body.
because of these genes, kids are born just like their parents.
a new life form with a new body will be born.
recently, we mixed rice, pumpkin and some unknown genes, and made rice ten times bigger than normal.
we go to the lab, persuade my mother and take her back to japan.
like when i was little, we'll start over happy, as a family.
your excellency, we are honored to have you come all this way to visit this cucaracha research lab.
professor ishigami, arrived from japan with a noble cause, i see.
but since then, we have improved the gene arrangement a little.
the government has been fighting rebel guerrillas for ten years now.
the indians encircle the cavalry and tighten the ring, and attack at once.
it means you can kill me in any way you want now.
i have instructed her to bury the rice ball in a mountain, hiding it.
most of her intelligence has vanished, but she must have understood my request.
if you had said anything, i would've taken you back to japan.
you'd have become family and we'd have lived together like i promised.
but i'm gonna have to ask you to silence the bell on that phone.
if i turn off the bell. how am i gonna know when important calls are coming in?
i didn't know what you thought of me until a couple minutes ago.
but. for whatever it's worth i would like to know you.
because with her blood pressure so elevated, the stress on her vital organs so great, a stroke is a vey real possibility.
doctor, the night before last, when we brought her in, you warned us that kirby could die.
oh, mr. carrington, the staff are vey concerned about mrs. colby's condition.
well, she's had a little setback, gerard, but she's in good hands.
i still don't like the idea of knuckling under to those damn kidnappers by paying that ransom and then not bringing the police in this.
blake, you did put up half the money for the ransom.
now how the devil can i like or dislike a man i hardly know or know about?
but i do know you, and i do love you vey much.
and that did make me think that my daughter ought to know more about the man she's planning to spend the rest of her life with.
all right, mother, exactly what kind of scandal and when did you invent it?
she was an extremely beautiful and vey rich young woman about your age, with whom he was supposedly madly in love and planning to mary.
he dumped her and flew off to monte carlo with some obscure little french actress with no talent.
fallon is vey emotional and sometimes her head goes off in a lot of directions.
she cracked up her car once and almost lost our child because of it.
meaning, that at one point during the intermission, i looked around the lobby, and i did not see a single man who is nearly as attractive as you are.
that's sweet language, coming from the most beautiful woman in that lobby.
not only where kirby is concerned but in business and just about eveything.
now, i resented your coming over to colbyco, so i went back there, purposely, to put you in your place and show you who's boss.
i lied to kirby that night and i've continued to lie to her.
just as i've lied to myself that my love for fallon was over.
don't tell me you still think i might have done otherwise.
i think i should have been contacted after you got that call.
i heard nobody, i saw nobody, and i just left as instructed.
the important thing is that the horse was found at daylight in the lower pasture, unharmed and well.
i feel about your company as if it were my own home.
and i wanna make sure that my welcome always stays as warm here as you're making me feel right now.
i understand from mimi harrison that you've been talking to her husband about me.
about how i am looking for a top consultant in washington when that canadian tar sands deal comes through, right?
my fingernails are clean, i'd like to keep them that way.
now look, if that's because of some feeling of loyalty for the lady, you forget, she's just keeping you around because she thinks she needs you.
i never saw matthew after i was supposed to testify at blake's trial.
then i had an accident with lindsay and i wound up in the hospital.
i know that you both meant something to each other once.
did he tell you how much he hated me for being with steven?
adam, no matter what happened between you and kirby that night, you're doing eveything you can to make up for it.
it was wrong and now you're tying to right that wrong.
she knew nothing about it until the night before jeff collapsed.
son, i saw her name on the purchase order for that poison.
we know how much this hurts you, but your defensiveness is annoying.
i don't know what you expected me to do when you told me, but this doesn't bother me.
too much of that and soon you're starting to expect life to be enjoyable.
then one day you wake up and all those years of pleasure have gone by and what have you got to show for it?
i thought we were going to make it work in a big way.
i bet you do and i bet you do it pretty soon.
despite your vehement protests to the contrary, and without disparaging your sincerity, we believe you're suffering some emotional residue from your relationship with diane.
i'm sorry, frasier, i must have dozed off for a paragraph or two.
i never took this step with you, but what frasier and i have together is more substantial.
what you and i had was exciting, tempestuous at times, but there was no future in it.
use your inhaler, take your antihistamine and put your nose drops in.
use whatever else you find in that pharmacy you call a purse.
but the war in neighboring vietnam burst its borders and the fighting soon spread to neutral cambodia.
in 1973, i went to cover this sideshow struggle as foreign correspondent of the new york times.
it was there, amidst the fighting between government troops and the khmer rouge guerrillas that i met my guide and interpreter, dith pran a man who was to change my life in a country that i grew to love and pity.
so here we go with voice of america news for southeast asia.
the scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the white house staff.
it has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps a constitutional crisis with senate investigators and a special watergate prosecutor.
the speech was announced after the gallup poll disclosed that mr. nixon's popularity had fallen to the lowest point for an american president in 20 years.
a supreme court judge, william o. douglas has ruled against an appeal by the administration for a stay of the injunction on further u.s. bombing missions in cambodia.
then i'd like you to listen to something and then i'd like a comment.
this morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control i spend two hours in bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
meanwhile, my sources tell me two army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
half the ambulances in phnom penh are waiting there to meet them.
and now there's a rumor that the u.s. air force dropped a bomb or several bombs, on neak luong.
that's a rumor, and i'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
well, pran i'd feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in bangkok.
and she said if the war keeps going like this the future could be very bad.
"you are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."
indeed, the khmer rouge insurgents in cambodia have tightened their ring around the capital, phnom penh now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
i tell you, i will be damn glad to get out of here.
this thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
radio contact with the french embassy reveals that some 200 europeans and an undisclosed number of cambodians have taken refuge.
as yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of cambodia.
- daily reports of fighting around the airport 14 kilometers outside phnom penh, the capital of cambodia.
and now, an on-the-spot report from our correspondent in thailand hugh elder.
unconfirmed reports say the khmer rouge are demanding that any officials of the defeated lon nol government especially the so-called six traitors of the cabinet be handed over to them.
it is not known whether any of the ex-ministers may have taken refuge in the embassy where, in the words of a unicef representative in bangkok the situation is said to be "increasingly precarious."
and when i tried to go just a kilometer further, no.
the only sense i can make of it is that there's some sort of internal power struggle going on.
knock out the jon, knock out the swain, and you're left with ankertill brewer.
change my photograph for one of pran, and he's a british subject.
if there are any, they'll be at the top of the stairs.
syd, i have got the camera i have got the film and i have got the fucking darkroom!
he will wait until he knows that it's safe and then he'll make his move.
thank you for coming and taking care of her and her family.
as the president spoke american troops were preparing to move into cambodia.
the decision to invade, like the earlier secret decision to bomb was withheld from the cambodian people.
but i can't stand here tonight without thinking of those innocent people pran dedicated himself to helping me bring to the notice of the public.
as they pondered their options in the white house the men who decided to bomb and then to invade cambodia concerned themselves with many things:
great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes looking tough and dangerous to the north vietnamese relieving pressure on the american troop withdrawal from the south.
they had domestic concerns as well which helps explain why they kept the bombing of cambodia a secret.
and they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest in their own careers.
what they specifically were not concerned with were the cambodians themselves.
dith pran and i tried to record and bring home the concrete consequences of these decisions to real people.
to human beings the people left out of the administration's plans but who paid the price and took the beating for them.
i'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of dith pran and myself.
i'm very honored and i know that pran would be very proud.
maybe in this instance the reader's digest happens to be correct.
do you apply the same disbelief to stories that come out of iran or palestine or chile?
new china radio reports that fighting between vietnam and democratic kampuchea has broken out on a number of fronts.
this is in retaliation, according to the vietnamese for a number of attacks on border villages...
in 1973, i went to cover this sideshow struggle as foreign correspondent of the new york times.
it was there, amidst the fighting between government troops and the khmer rouge guerrillas that i met my guide and interpreter, dith pran a man who was to change my life in a country that i grew to love and pity.

a supreme court judge, william o. douglas has ruled against an appeal by the administration for a stay of the injunction on further u.s. bombing missions in cambodia.
congress has already ruled these bombings illegal and they should cease in one week's time on august the 15th.
this morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control i spend two hours in bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
meanwhile, my sources tell me two army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
half the ambulances in phnom penh are waiting there to meet them.
and now there's a rumor that the u.s. air force dropped a bomb or several bombs, on neak luong.
that's a rumor, and i'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
i just want to know if that's the reason why my airplane was delayed!
he's just trying to get to the top of the heap.
we'll just have to pay more to get our telexes to the top of the heap.
indeed, the khmer rouge insurgents in cambodia have tightened their ring around the capital, phnom penh now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital.
what pisses me off is, this country has faults and strengths and we have done nothing but play to the faults.
i tell you, i will be damn glad to get out of here.
this thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
after what the khmer rouge have been through they won't be exactly affectionate toward westerners.
journalists who have flown from thailand over phnom penh report that the khmer rouge have attempted a mass evacuation of the entire population.
radio contact with the french embassy reveals that some 200 europeans and an undisclosed number of cambodians have taken refuge.
as yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of cambodia.
the whereabouts of prince sihanouk and the khmer rouge leadership are not clear.
the bbc has, like, commissioned them to walk past the khmer rouge like their regular fowl.
they've been crossing the border into thailand every day and every night.
it is not known whether any of the ex-ministers may have taken refuge in the embassy where, in the words of a unicef representative in bangkok the situation is said to be "increasingly precarious."
and when i tried to go just a kilometer further, no.
the only sense i can make of it is that there's some sort of internal power struggle going on.

thank you for coming and taking care of her and her family.
as the president spoke american troops were preparing to move into cambodia.
the decision to invade, like the earlier secret decision to bomb was withheld from the cambodian people.
but i can't stand here tonight without thinking of those innocent people pran dedicated himself to helping me bring to the notice of the public.
as they pondered their options in the white house the men who decided to bomb and then to invade cambodia concerned themselves with many things:
great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes looking tough and dangerous to the north vietnamese relieving pressure on the american troop withdrawal from the south.
they had domestic concerns as well which helps explain why they kept the bombing of cambodia a secret.
and they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest in their own careers.
what they specifically were not concerned with were the cambodians themselves.
dith pran and i tried to record and bring home the concrete consequences of these decisions to real people.
to human beings the people left out of the administration's plans but who paid the price and took the beating for them.
i'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of dith pran and myself.
i'm very honored and i know that pran would be very proud.
maybe in this instance the reader's digest happens to be correct.
do you apply the same disbelief to stories that come out of iran or palestine or chile?
new china radio reports that fighting between vietnam and democratic kampuchea has broken out on a number of fronts.
this is in retaliation, according to the vietnamese for a number of attacks on border villages...
in 1973, i went to cover this sideshow struggle as foreign correspondent of the new york times.
it was there, amidst the fighting between government troops and the khmer rouge guerrillas that i met my guide and interpreter, dith pran a man who was to change my life in a country that i grew to love and pity.
it has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps a constitutional crisis with senate investigators and a special watergate prosecutor.
the speech was announced after the gallup poll disclosed that mr. nixon's popularity had fallen to the lowest point for an american president in 20 years.
a supreme court judge, william o. douglas has ruled against an appeal by the administration for a stay of the injunction on further u.s. bombing missions in cambodia.
congress has already ruled these bombings illegal and they should cease in one week's time on august the 15th.
this morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control i spend two hours in bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
meanwhile, my sources tell me two army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
half the ambulances in phnom penh are waiting there to meet them.
and now there's a rumor that the u.s. air force dropped a bomb or several bombs, on neak luong.
that's a rumor, and i'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
i just want to know if that's the reason why my airplane was delayed!
he's just trying to get to the top of the heap.
we'll just have to pay more to get our telexes to the top of the heap.
indeed, the khmer rouge insurgents in cambodia have tightened their ring around the capital, phnom penh now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.
reports from government troops talk of the field situation being so bad that soldiers are having to siphon gas from jeep to jeep in order to be able to get the wounded back to the capital.
what pisses me off is, this country has faults and strengths and we have done nothing but play to the faults.

well, pran i'd feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in bangkok.
and she said if the war keeps going like this the future could be very bad.
"you are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."
indeed, the khmer rouge insurgents in cambodia have tightened their ring around the capital, phnom penh now swollen with some two million refugees from the fighting.

this thing has dragged on too long for it to end in all sweetness and light.
radio contact with the french embassy reveals that some 200 europeans and an undisclosed number of cambodians have taken refuge.
as yet, no statement has been made by the new rulers of cambodia.
- daily reports of fighting around the airport 14 kilometers outside phnom penh, the capital of cambodia.
and now, an on-the-spot report from our correspondent in thailand hugh elder.
unconfirmed reports say the khmer rouge are demanding that any officials of the defeated lon nol government especially the so-called six traitors of the cabinet be handed over to them.
it is not known whether any of the ex-ministers may have taken refuge in the embassy where, in the words of a unicef representative in bangkok the situation is said to be "increasingly precarious."
and when i tried to go just a kilometer further, no.
the only sense i can make of it is that there's some sort of internal power struggle going on.
knock out the jon, knock out the swain, and you're left with ankertill brewer.
change my photograph for one of pran, and he's a british subject.
if there are any, they'll be at the top of the stairs.
syd, i have got the camera i have got the film and i have got the fucking darkroom!
for the past 5 years as indicated on this map that you see here north vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries all along the cambodian frontier with south vietnam.
as the president spoke american troops were preparing to move into cambodia.
and now the party they call the angka will provide everything for us.
he says angka has identified and proclaims the existence of a bad new disease a memory sickness diagnosed as thinking too much about life in prerevolutionary cambodia.
anyone who knows my work will know that half of this belongs to dith pran.
without pran, i wouldn't have been able to file half the stories i did.
as they pondered their options in the white house the men who decided to bomb and then to invade cambodia concerned themselves with many things:
great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes looking tough and dangerous to the north vietnamese relieving pressure on the american troop withdrawal from the south.
they had domestic concerns as well which helps explain why they kept the bombing of cambodia a secret.
and they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest in their own careers.
to human beings the people left out of the administration's plans but who paid the price and took the beating for them.
i'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of dith pran and myself.
i'm very honored and i know that pran would be very proud.
do you plan to continue with that theme in the future?
but the war in neighboring vietnam burst its borders and the fighting soon spread to neutral cambodia.
in 1973, i went to cover this sideshow struggle as foreign correspondent of the new york times.
it was there, amidst the fighting between government troops and the khmer rouge guerrillas that i met my guide and interpreter, dith pran a man who was to change my life in a country that i grew to love and pity.
so here we go with voice of america news for southeast asia.
the scandal has caused resignations and paralyzed the white house staff.
it has also led to intense confrontation and perhaps a constitutional crisis with senate investigators and a special watergate prosecutor.
the speech was announced after the gallup poll disclosed that mr. nixon's popularity had fallen to the lowest point for an american president in 20 years.
a supreme court judge, william o. douglas has ruled against an appeal by the administration for a stay of the injunction on further u.s. bombing missions in cambodia.

this morning, for reasons beyond anybody's control i spend two hours in bangkok staring at a seat belt sign.
meanwhile, my sources tell me two army helicopters are landing here, just across the airfield.
half the ambulances in phnom penh are waiting there to meet them.
and now there's a rumor that the u.s. air force dropped a bomb or several bombs, on neak luong.
that's a rumor, and i'm not gonna comment on a rumor.
well, pran i'd feel kind of stupid trying to cover this war from a desk in bangkok.
and she said if the war keeps going like this the future could be very bad.
"you are cleverer than we are, and you induced us into this fighting."

he says angka has identified and proclaims the existence of a bad new disease a memory sickness diagnosed as thinking too much about life in prerevolutionary cambodia.
anyone who knows my work will know that half of this belongs to dith pran.
without pran, i wouldn't have been able to file half the stories i did.
as they pondered their options in the white house the men who decided to bomb and then to invade cambodia concerned themselves with many things:
great power conflicts and collapsing dominoes looking tough and dangerous to the north vietnamese relieving pressure on the american troop withdrawal from the south.
they had domestic concerns as well which helps explain why they kept the bombing of cambodia a secret.
and they may be assumed not to have ignored self-interest in their own careers.
to human beings the people left out of the administration's plans but who paid the price and took the beating for them.
i'm very pleased to accept this on behalf of dith pran and myself.
i'm very honored and i know that pran would be very proud.
do you plan to continue with that theme in the future?
did you know that lady diana gave birth to a frog?
i read that they're a symbol of fertility or amniotic fluid.
this kind of music has been used for a long time already.
the gestapo even used music to make people shit to death.
we have good reason to believe, that certain groups, whose exact intentions we don't yet know... are systematically disturbing the smooth running of our business.
it is not yet clear how, but these people have managed... to influence our musical system.
the property damage of last week alone exceeds that of all previous riots.
according to the latest information of the investigating authorities... there is a connection between the sickness that occurred last week... and the local riots.
the police reported that during this week... more than 2000 tape recorders have been confiscated.
the fashion among youngsters in cities... of walking around with tape recorders is spreading...
wanna shovel all the trash in the whole city of turin !
you can't do it, even if you work three days and nights.
and the most important thing, that i'm top of my class.
looks like a lawyer, smooth talker, gift of gab, the lot...
"it was then i sensed in my heart, the voice that still lingers there.
i don't want it, don't want it sir, i don't want your compassion to fade."
since you're a student, give me pen and paper and i'll write down where you can find him.
i won't tell you aloud, there are too many envious people.
you told me once that a head isn't like a sack.
the more you put in a sack the heavier it gets.
were up to me, i'd leave him here, but we've gota train later.
this time, if i don't bring him back on time, i'll lose my job.
who happens to come to geisterschloss, where we have our headquarters.
who happens to receive nato briefings from the american embassy in bonn.
no, it's you that's likely to be making that trip, love.
well, why don't you do it and get it over with?
i intend for it to go on for a very long time.
oh, yes, your booming business of selling the security of the free world and the security of your own country.
amanda, i want you to meet colonel gerhard metzger austrian intelligence.
you and mr. stetson are showing a great interest in emily farnsworth.
-noticed the nervous hand movement avoidance of eye contact, higher-pitched voice?
no, i just noticed this is the first time he didn't know everything about salzburg.
lee, i don't know what's happened to mrs. farnsworth but i do know what happened to marianna.
and if i wait in the car, the same thing could happen to me too.
but i'm afraid this will have to be our swan song here.
you have shown us that it's time for us to move on and set up elsewhere.
mrs. wyler's paying you a lot of money to play football, not talk about it.
why don't you go over to the sled and impress me.
i think i used jake wise as an excuse to come here.
i guess i did come here to get my job back.
it seems i have the soul to live with him, be his girlfriend.
well, he never had anybody like you before, i can tell you that.
you know... when i got my pro contract, it was the first real money i ever had.
it wasn't much because my lawyer took a big hunk out of it.
it seems funny now, but at the time it flipped me out.
i was under a lot of pressure, trying to make the starting lineup.
can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them?
most people are afraid they're never going to be loved like that.
that jackass caxton and her old lady screwing up the team.
you know, if mr. wyler were alive, i'd be head coach.
you don't have to do that when you're living in the jungle.
you just take her outside, show her what tree you're gonna do it under.
he owns 75 percent of the book and 75 percent of the club.
i take all the heat while he sits on his ass.
it's beauty and the beauty around it won't be sitting up here alone any more, just going to waste.
i'm sharing what i believe is the best location on the west side.
you and her mother control what she says, what she does.
there's nothing in the news that isn't exactly the way you wanted it.
i want to be back on the team, but because i'm worth it.
not because i spied on some 25-year-old who ran away from home.
i think just a few members of the team would have been enough.
having the outlaws out here, full force, is kind of crowding it.
i didn't expect to have signs telling me where she is.
maybe i'll be outside having a drink i'll look and out of nowhere she'll be buying some fruit.
it seems funny now, but at the time it flipped me out.
i was under a lot of pressure, trying to make the starting lineup.

every year, there's a chance you'd lose your job because of injury.
you players never grasp, it is not a very secure job.
i wanted to get out of l.a. a caribbean island didn't sound too bad.
only trouble is, now i'm here i find myself in the middle of something i've no feeling for.

you have a nice face. l-- l'm telling you the truth.
it wouldn't be out of line for you to lie, would it?
i want to be back on the team, but because i'm worth it.

there are people who care what you believe. i don't see them here.
i have a broken shoulder, both my knees are shot guys are crippling themselves so you can act like a 1 3-year-old runaway from bel air.
it seems funny now, but at the time it flipped me out.
i was under a lot of pressure, trying to make the starting lineup.
can't anyone love me without it being life or death to them?
most people are afraid they're never going to be loved like that.
i was close to you guys. i knew who was in debt, and how deep.
so when jake wanted i could always finger who was ready to break.
you didn't finish the job, so i don't owe you the money.
i figure you just came over to say we're still friends.
what i'm most happy about is the opportunity to share this land.
it's beauty and the beauty around it won't be sitting up here alone anymore, just going to waste.
a sanctuary from the crowding and crime of the city below us.
specifically, i'd like to acknowledge three public officials without whose generous support we wouldn't be here:
(male narrator) knight rider... a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
bonnie and devon are going to watch a building being leveled.
if you feel so guilty, why didn't you accept devon's invitation to go with them?
(jordan) normally, a building this size would require... more than 1,000 pounds of dynamite to bring down.
however, with the development of our new xpl nitro-plastique... we can accomplish the same job with just six of these packets... [people chattering] weighing a total of 30 ounces.
nurse gilmore, i appreciate all you've done, but, really, i am fine.
if you're so fine, why were you found half unconscious... babbling something about your car driving off by itself?
she's been through a lot, and i'm here to see no one takes advantage of her.
i appreciate your concern, but maybe i didn't make myself clear.
trying to have a nice, quiet family dinner here... and, thanks to you, people are yelling at each other.
yeah, well, it's not a family dinner 'cause you're not part of the family.
you don't get to be the man of a thousand faces... without learning a few new tricks.
i always thought there wasn't enough of me to go around.
knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
imagine being capable of producing a mask of this quality... while locked up behind prison bars.
you don't get to be the man of a thousand voices and a thousand faces... without learning a few new tricks.
i can't go in there with yen or shekels, can i?
now, if i'm a high roller, i got to look like one.
but whoever figures it out wins a fortune in valuable prizes.
i mean, i could be responsible for changing somebody's whole life around.
he'll have the proper papers signed by the secretary and bearing his seal.
and a half an hour after that, you'll have a fancy little flying machine... armed with prototype rockets... that can destroy anything from a tank to an aircraft carrier.
were that to be suspended, even for a moment, the most extraordinary things would begin happen.
i, for example, would suddenly float into the air because i at the moment am flying in an aircraft on a very special cours which in effect cancels out the effect of gravity.
you can't touch air,like a solid object it's invisible and all-pervasive, so it's easy to forget that it has real substance.
but it's only by exploiting the presence of air that seeds, insects, birds and man are able to overcome gravity and float above the earth's surface.
milkweed and cotton grass, willowherb and thistles, all provide their seeds with downy floats.
these delay the fall of the seeds for so long that currents in the air, winds, can carry them for hundreds of miles from their parents.
seeds like these have crossed the widest oceans and landed on the loneliest islands.
pollen grains are so small, they don't even need fluff to keep in the air.
then, from the spinnerets at the tip, they produce a thread of finest silk.
as it lengthens and the wind catches it, the spiderling turns, grabs the thread with its forelegs and away it goes.
only the tiniest and the lightest of animals and plants can defy gravity in this way.
many seeds are far too heavy to be lifted by the breeze, no matter how downy they are.
the wing is so shaped and weighted, with the seed at one end, that as it falls through the air, it spins.
this protracted fall gives the breeze a chance to deflect the seeds sideways so that they will land some distance away from the parent tree.
the flying frog of central america has a parachute on each foot, formed by the web of skin between its toes.
so one jump from a high branch is enough to carry it from one tree to another.
in south-east asia lives a gecko that not only has a parachute on each foot, but flanges on its body and tail.
another lizard glides through the same forests by extending even bigger wings of skin from its flanks supported by elongated ribs.
its huge cloak of floppy skin sometimes serves as a simple parachute.
but in horizontal flight it does more than just trap air beneath it.
as air passes over the front edge, it's deflected slightly upwards, so creating a slight reduction in the air pressure on the upper surface, just as happens on an aircraft wing or the spinning blade of a sycamore seed,
so the squirrel creates a little lift and floats through the air.
carrying with them whole populations of seeds and spores and spiders.
but there are no such breezes down below the grass stems.
the insect has to haul itself into the air by sheer unaided muscle power.
the downward sweep of the wings produces greater pressure in the air beneath than in that above, so, in a slightly different way from the gliding cloak of the squirrel, beating wings also create lift, and the insect is sucked upwards.
for them, too, getting into the air is the most energetic and demanding part of flying.
they also use their well-muscled legs to assist their labouring wings.
damsel flies catch their food in the air, mate in the air and even fight in the air.
as males squabble over territory, they flutter their patterned wings at one another in an aggressive display.
this hawkmoth lays its eggs on flowers while it's still flying, for it's too heavy to land on them.
it feeds by hovering in front of a blossom and sucking out the nectar with a tube-like proboscis as thin as thread.
one of the smallest of all birds, the bee hummingbird, even smaller than a hawkmoth, is equally skilled, beating its wings 80 times a second to keep itself stationary in the air as it drinks from the flowers.
bird wings are more versatile than those of insects, for their flight feathers fit so closely alongside one another and slide so easily past each other that the bird can change the shape and size of its wing while maintaining its continuous air-deflecting surface,
so the wing can be spread wide on the downstroke, and then, on the upstroke, be made small to offer less resistance to the air.
this kestrel is maintaining a steady position in the sky, relative to the ground, by facing into the wind and flying with such accuracy that it exactly matches the wind speed.
the reduction of air pressure, creating lift on the upper surface of the wings, can be seen quite clearly, for it sucks up the smaller feathers.
the albatross also habitually gets lift by gliding into the wind, and again, the reduction in pressure produced as the air blows over the birds outstretched wings ruffles its feathers.
occasionally, for a minute or so, they alight on the water to collect food.
once every year or so they come down to their nesting grounds to meet their mates again, greeting one another with a charming courtship dance.
it's difficult to appreciate just how big these magnificent birds are when you see them gliding over the ocean.
it's only when you come to one of their nesting sites like this one in south georgia that you really see how big they are.
when they open these wings, they are 11 feet across, the biggest wingspan of any bird.
long, narrow wings are the most efficient shape for uninterrupted gliding, and no bird glides better than the albatross, but such wings are difficult to flap sufficiently fast to give take-off, so many species of albatross nest on the edge of cliffs,
with such techniques, an albatross will glide all day above a line of cliffs travelling effortlessly along this highway in the sky.
land birds also exploit the air currents above cliffs in just the same way.
we are in africa, floating over the great game plains of the serengeti.
i'm now about 100 feet up and kept up entirely by hot air.
but gas burners aren't the only things which produce rising currents of hot air.
the sun does the same thing, as it rises, it heats up the landscape, but all parts of the landscape don't react in the same way.
they're big birds with large wings, so large that beating them is a very laborious business, and the vultures don't do so unnecessarily.
at this time in the morning, they don't try to battle against gravity and climb high in the sky, but limit themselfs by flapping from one low tree to another.
they're waiting for the land to heat up and the thermals to form.
but we have our own thermal, created by our burner, and up we go.
and now the vultures are beginning to come up here to join me.
they will be using the thermals to provide them with an observation post in the sky from which they can scan the plains below, and i'm getting just about the same kind of view as they are, and it's
the vultures, several thousand feet up in the sky, can quickly spot a kill or deduce its presence from the behaviour of birds in a neighbouring thermal, and when they do, they swiftly glide down to it.
once one bird finds a carcass, dozens arrive within a few minutes.
but all the sustenance has not yet been extracted from the carcass.
in the african mountains, as well as in asia and europe, lives a species of vulture with a very specialised diet indeed:
first it brings bones from a carcass to a special workshop which several birds may share.
a patch of bare rock near the top edge of a cliff.
and this is why it chooses a patch of bare rock for its operations.
so that the bone will land so heavily that it crack
the ravens are starting to learn the same technique but haven't mastered it.
they tend to drop their bones on grass, where they don't break.
the lammergeier eats the splinters of bone, impossibly spiky though they appear to be.
some birds exploit the force of gravity by dropping not their food but themselves from the sky.
but the ace of dive-bombers, which can reach at least 80 miles an hour in a dive, is the peregrine falcon.
it patrols the skies, often high above the flight path of other birds.
and when it has selected its victim, it folds its wing steering almost entirely with its tail, and hurtles downwards.
close the target the talons are brought forward for the strike and to make last-second adjustments to the accuracy of its final run.
their flight feathers have special soft edges to them which serve as silencers.
their wings are particularly large and support the bird so easily that there's no need for any vigorous noisy flapping, and the owl can waft its way in silence through the trees.
although owls hunt after dark, they find their way with their large, highly sensitive eyes, and, because their flight is virtually soundless, they can listen for the squeak of unwary voles and mice.
but on the darkest nights, even an owl can't see, and it seldom ventures into the air.
instead they use sonar, squeaking ultrasonically and guiding themselves by the reflected echoes.
they do this so skilfully that they can pluck a flying moth from the air.
it's been known for a long time that bats use high peak sounds in this way, but it's less well known that just one or two birds have, also and quite independently, evolved the same technique.
this cave in venezuela is the home of one of them.
so what i'm going to do is to put on a deep-red filter.
that will disturb them much less, but it will enable us to watch them with a special electronic device called an image intensifier.
they're big birds, relations of the nightjars, and about the size of pigeons.
their nests are compiled from their droppings and bits of regurgitated food.
when their alarm calls subside, you can hear the clicks by which they navigate.
these calls are much lower in frequency than sonar the signals of bats, although they have the longer range they're much less accurate, so the oilbirds can't detect objects much smaller than a foot across.
that's quite good enough to prevent the birds crashing into the cave walls or one another.
their favourite food is the fruit of a jungle tree and the cave floor is covered by a soggy carpet of seeds.
many germinate, though in the dark they can't develop chlorophyll, and they remain pallid, leggy seedlings which soon die.
the fruits are too small for the oilbirds to locate with their clicks, but out in the moonlit forest, where the fruit trees grow there's enough light for the birds to find them by eye.
the mastery of the air and the strength to remain in flight for days has enabled birds to become the greatest of all animal travellers.
in the skies above panama every october and november, there is a great aerial traffic jam.
big birds, like hawks, can draw it from their body tissues.
but north-east of panama, across the caribbean, on the atlantic coast of the united states, smaller wading birds, sandpipers and phalaropes, are preparing for their journey.
they must put on a lot of fat before they start off, and they find the food in the quantities they need in the rich waters of the bay of fundy.
in a few days of intensive feeding, each tiny bird will increase its weight by half as much again, and they will need all that fat, for they are about to travel across the open ocean, and then they can't feed at all.
buzzards, experts at soaring and gliding, use the thermals to climb so high that they eventually cover the whole distance, in what amounts to one long, shallow glide.
red-breasted geese spend their summer considerably farther east in the tundra of western siberia
after several weeks, in travel they reach their wintering grounds south of the
caspian sea, many of them on the marshes of the danube delta.
birds are not the only creatures to make these immense transcontinental flights.
almost unbelievably, a few small, seemingly frail creatures do so as well.
insects, flying with just as steadfast a purpose, achieve journeys as long as many migrating birds.
back in south america, in a high valley in mexico, hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies roost in just a few special trees.
they hatched in the autumn woods of north america and have flown some 2,000 miles down here to hibernate.
they won't feed here, but they're spared the lethal frosts and snows farther north.
in spring they will set off back, travelling about ten miles a day, feeding, courting and laying eggs as they go.
but only a few will live long enough to reach the northern woods where they were hatched.
although the journeys made by these travellers may be thousands of miles long, the earth's wrapping of air thru which they move, is less than six miles deep.
on rare occasions the gases from which it's formed become visible.
subatomic particles from space, attracted towards the poles by the earth's magnetic field, energise the gases of the atmosphere so that they glow and form shifting veils of light the aurora borealis.
the atmosphere is not composed entirely of gas and at certain times you can see evidence of the presence of other things.
dust particles are scattered through its lower layers, and when the setting sun shines obliquely across the earth, at dawn and sunset, they scatter its white light, turning it red.
minute droplets of water, being translucent, act like infinitive tiny prisms and produce a rainbow, and at high altitudes tiny ice crystals create a similar effect.
as you climb up away from the earth, the gases become thinner and the temperature as a result, becomes colder.
the balloon which is taking us to these great heights must be much bigger than that we used in africa for, as we climb, we will require a greater volume of the rarefied air to give us the necessary lift.
a rubber bladder, sealed with a cork, on the ground will gives us a rough idea of the drop in pressure as we ascend.
we are now at 8,000 feet, and you might think that no living creature would come as high as this except perhaps some rather foolhardy men.
inside there's a fan which will suck in air through this end when i turn it on here, and i'll lower it over the side to see what we catch.
and now we're going to go higher still and it's going to get very, very cold, so i shall need all this warm clothing i've got, but, perhaps even more seriously, the oxygen is going to get thinner
and thinner, and so i shall have to put on this mask in order to breathe oxygen as we go higher and higher.
and now an indication of our height can come from this balloon.
before it had those corners to it and now it's swollen quite considerably, so the pressure here is really very considerably lower than it was when we were on the ground.
we are now getting on for four miles above the surface of the earth.
and we're getting very close to the outermost frontier of life on earth.
it's very cold and i certainly wouldn't be able to talk at all if i hadn't got this oxygen, so conditions here are really very much more severe than you might imagine when you sit in your aircraft flying comfortably
but if we examine this mesh, when we get down to earth, with a microscope, it's very likely that, at the very least, we shall have some pollen grains and spores of fungus.
but bigger creatures are found at these heights and i've some of them here, in this phial, that were caught here.
i'll pour them out on a dish to get a better look at them.
there are tiny spiders that must have sailed up hanging from their threads of gossamer.
driven by the winds, the clouds evaporate and condense, form and re-form.
the summit of mount everest is less than six miles above the surface of the sea, yet few clouds ever sail much above it.
from a satellite 22,500 miles away from the earth, the build-up and dissipation of these huge storms over 15 days can be seen with pictures taken every hour and run continuously.
away to the east of brazil in the atlantic, a hurricane is forming.
other major disturbances in the atmosphere are caused when the sun builds up gigantic thermals in a sky already loaded with moisture.
as the air is driven upwards, the tops of the towering clouds burgeon with fearsome speed.
the water molecules within the clouds condense to form bigger and bigger droplets, but the speed of the rising air is now so great that it keeps them suspended within the cloud.
eventually, the droplets become so big that they can no longer be supported, and they fall as torrential rain.
the molecules of gas and water vapour surging upwards create a build-up of electricity that eventually becomes so great, it discharges down to earth.
the water droplets may have been carried so high by the great thermals that they freeze and eventually tumble out of the cloud as hail.
if the storm is really intense, they may rise and fall several times.
in the lower parts of the cloud, the ice accumulate forms relatively slowly and is clear and black.
but when they get to the top again, it's so cold that the ice forms quickly, trapping tiny air bubbles, which makes the ice look white.
so really big hailstones may be banded, like an onion, with alternate rings of black and white ice.
really big hailstones are often a sign that a trully devastating storm is about to strike the earth.
a strong, high-altitude wind, linked with a severe storm such as this, may vacuum up lower-level air, increasing the updraught dramatically, and beginning a spiral motion in part of the storm.
if these converging winds are powerful enough, the vortex at the centre of this great whirl reaches down to the surface of the earth as a suction funnel, a tornado.
winds up to 300 miles an hour devastate the land, tearing things apart, ripping the roofs from buildings, sweeping animals and trees and sometimes even people high into the sky and throwing them down.
when it strikes the land, it's seldom more than 500 yards across, but within this area it lashes the earth with the most powerful and destructive of all atmospheric forces.
storms like that may bring death and destruction, but they also bring life, because the rain that comes from them, distilled by the sun from the surface of the ocean is fresh water, salt-free, and that is something that all life on land must have.
were that to be suspended, even for a moment, the most extraordinary things would happen.
i, for example, would suddenly float into the air because i at the moment am flying in an aircraft on a very special cours which in effect cancels out the effect of gravity.

if it wants to fly slower and prevent itself from being swept away or carried too high by a sudden gust, it uses its tail and webbed feet as air breaks, and reduces its lift by pulling in its wings, so making their surface smaller.
with such techniques, an albatross will glide all day above a line of cl travelling effortlessly along this highway in the sky.
land birds also exploit the air currents above cliffs in the same way.
we're in africa, floating over the great game plains of the serengeti.
i'm now about 100 feet up and kept up entirely by hot air.
but gas burners aren't the only things which produce rising currents of hot air.
the sun, as it rises, heats up the landscape, but all parts of the landscape don't react in the same way.
they're big birds with large wings, so large that beating them is a very laborious business, and the vultures don't do so unnecessarily.
at this time in the morning, they don't try to battle against gravity and climb high, but flap from one low tree to another.
they're waiting for the land to heat up and the thermals to form.
but we have our own thermal, created by our burner, and up we go.
and now the vultures are beginning to come up here to join me.
they will use the thermals to provide them with an observation post in the sky from which they can scan the plains below, and i'm getting the same kind of view as they are, and it's a very, very exciting one.
last night or in the early dawn, somewhere, lions or hyenas or hunting dogs will have killed.
the vultures, several thousand feet up in the sky, quickly spot a kill or deduce its presence from the behaviour of birds in a neighbouring thermal, and when they do, they swiftly glide down to it.
with a heavy load of meat, the vultures won't fly far, to a nearby tree, to perch and digest and wait for tomorrow's thermals to carry them effortlessly aloft again.
but all the sustenance has not yet been extracted from the carcass.
it feeds, though it sounds extraordinary, not only on marrow but on the bones themselves, and to do so, it has developed a special technique.
first it brings bones from a carcass to a special workshop which several birds may share.
a patch of bare rock near the top edge of a cliff.
it chooses a cliff top so that when it takes off again with a heavy bone, it has the least difficulty in getting into the ai
they tend to drop their bones on grass, where they don't break.
the lammergeier eats the splinters of bone, impossibly spiky though they appear to be.
during the nesting season, concentrated in their colonies, huge flocks set out on fishing trips, and when they find a shoal of fish near the surface, they subject it to an aerial bombardment of devastating intensity.
but the ace of dive-bombers, which can reach at least 80 miles an hour in a dive, is the peregrine falcon.
it patrols the skies, high above the flight path of other birds.
when it has selected its victim, it folds its wing steering almost entirely with its tail, and hurtles downwards.
owls, this is a barn owl, don't rely on speed like the peregrine, but on a slow, silent approach
their flight feathers have special soft edges to them which serve as silencers.
their wings are large and support the bird so easily that there's no need for any noisy flapping, and the owl can waft its way in silence through the trees.
although owls hunt after dark, they find their way with their large, sensitive eyes, and, because their flight is virtually soundless, they can listen for the squeak of voles and mice.
they do this so skilfully that they can pluck a flying moth from the air.
it's been known for a long time that bats use sounds in this way, but it's less well known that one or two birds have, independently, evolved the same technique.
that will disturb them less, but it will enable us to watch them with a special electronic device called an image intensifier.
they're big, relations of the nightjars, and about the size of pigeons.
their nests are compiled from their droppings and bits of regurgitated food.
when their alarm calls subside, you can hear the clicks by which they navigate.
these calls are lower in frequency than the signals of bats, and they're less accurate, so the oilbirds can't detect objects much smaller than a foot across.
that's quite good enough to prevent the birds crashing into the cave walls or one another.
their favourite food is the fruit of a jungle tree and the cave floor is covered by a soggy carpet of seeds.
many germinate, though in the dark they can't develop chlorophyll, and they remain pallid, leggy seedlings which soon die.
the fruits are too small for the oilbirds to locate with their clicks, but out in the moonlit forest, where the trees gro there's enough light for the birds to find them by eye.
the mastery of the air and the strength to remain in flight for days has enabled birds to become the greatest of all animal travellers.
in the skies above panama every october and november, there is a great aerial traffic jam.
hawks and turkey vultures, fleeing from the winter in north america, are on their way to spend a few months in the south.
big birds, like hawks, can draw it from their body tissues.
but north-east of panama, across the caribbean, on the atlantic coast of the united states, smaller wading birds, sandpipers and phalaropes, are preparing for theirjourney.
they must put on fat before they start off, and they find food in the quantities they need in the rich waters of the bay of fundy.
in a few days of intensive feeding, each tiny bird will increase its weight by half as much again, and they need all that fat, for they are about to travel across the ocean, and then they can't feed at all.
buzzards, experts at soaring and gliding, use the thermals to climb so high that they cover the distance in what amounts to one long, shallow glide.
red-breasted geese spend their summer much farther east in the tundra of western siberia
after several weeks, they reach their wintering grounds south of the caspian sea, many of them on the marshes of the danube delta.
birds are not the only creatures to make these immense transcontinental flights.
almost unbelievably, a few small, seemingly frail creatures do so as well.
insects, flying with just as steadfast a purpose, achieve journeys as long as many migrating birds.
in south america, in a high valley in mexico, hundreds of thousands of monarch butterflies roost in just a few special trees.
they hatched in the autumn woods of north america and have flown 2,000 miles to hibernate.
they won't feed here, but they're spared the lethal frosts and snows farther north.
in spring they will set off back, travelling ten miles a day, feeding, courting and laying eggs as they go.
but only a few will live long enough to reach the northern woods where they were hatched.
the world is criss-crossed by the flight paths of animal migrants.
on the other side of the world there's more land, and birds and insects have more routes, travelling north and south but also east and west between asia and africa.
although the journeys may be thousands of miles long, the earth's wrapping of air is less than six miles deep.
on rare occasions the gases from which it's formed become visible.
subatomic particles from space, attracted to the poles by the earth's magnetic field, energise the gases of the atmosphere so that they glow and form shifting veils of light the aurora borealis.
the atmosphere is not composed entirely of gas and at certain times you can see evidence of other things.
dust particles are scattered through its lower layers, and when the sun shines across the earth, they scatter its white light, turning it red.
minute droplets of water, being translucent, act like tiny prisms and produce a rainbow, and at high altitudes tiny ice crystals create a similar effect.
up away from the earth, the gases become thinner and the temperature becomes colder.
the balloon taking us to these heights must be bigger than that we used in africa for, as we climb, we will require a greater volume of the rarefied air to give us the necessary lift.
a rubber bladder, sealed with a cork, gives us a rough idea of the drop in pressure as we ascend.
some small creatures are swept up as high as this by the convection currents rising from the surface of the ground, and we're going to try and catch some using this rather curious machine.
inside there's a fan which will suck in air through this end when i turn it on here, and i'll lower it over the side to see what we catch.
and now we're going to go higher still and it's going to get very, very cold, so i shall need all this warm clothing i've got, but, perhaps even more seriously, the oxygen is going to get thinner and thinner,
and so i shall have to put on this mask in order to breathe oxygen as we go higher and higher.
and now an indication of our height can come from this balloon.
before it had those corners to it and now it's swollen quite considerably, so the pressure here is really considerably lower than it was when we were on the ground.
but if we examine this mesh, when we get down to earth, with a microscope, it's very likely that, at the very least, we shall have some pollen grains and spores of fungus.
but bigger creatures are found at these heights and i've some of them here, in this phial, that were caught here.
i'll pour them out on a dish to get a better look at them.
there are tiny spiders that must have sailed up hanging from their threads of gossamer.
molecules of water, evaporating in the heat of the sun from the surface of the sea and lakes, or breathed out by plants as vapour, rise up from the land and cool and condense into clouds of droplets.
driven by the winds, the clouds evaporate and condense, form and re-form.
the summit of mount everest is less than six miles above the sea, yet few clouds ever sail much above it.
the earth, as it spins, creates vast eddies within the atmosphere.
northwards it goes towards florida, while up in the north, air sweeping over north america moves across the atlantic towards europe in another immense, swirling storm.
other disturbances in the atmosphere are caused when the sun builds up gigantic thermals in a sky already loaded with moisture.
as the air is driven upwards, the tops of the towering clouds burgeon with fearsome speed.
the water molecules within the clouds condense to form bigger and bigger droplets, but the speed of the rising air is now so great that it keeps them suspended within the cloud.
eventually, the droplets become so big that they cannot be supported, and they fall as torrential rain.
the molecules of gas surging upwards create a build-up of electricity that eventually becomes so great, it discharges down to earth.
the water droplets may have been carried so high that they freeze and eventually tumble out of the cloud as hail.
if the storm is really intense, they may rise and fall several times.
in the lower parts of the cloud, the ice forms relatively slowly and is clear and black.
but when they get to the top again, the ice forms quickly, trapping air bubbles, which makes the ice look white.
so big hailstones may be banded, like an onion, with alternate rings of black and white ice.
really big hailstones are often a sign that a trul devastating storm is about to strike the earth.
a strong, high-altitude wind, linked with a severe storm such as this, may vacuum up lower-level air, increasing the updraught dramatically, and beginning a spiral motion in part of the storm.
if these converging winds are powerful enough, the vortex at the centre of this great whirl reaches down to the surface of the earth as a suction funnel, a tornado.
winds up to 300 miles an hour devastate the land, tearing things apart, ripping the roofs from buildings, sweeping animals and trees and sometimes even people high into the sky and throwing them down.
when it strikes the land, it's seldom more than 500 yards across, but it lashes the earth with the most powerful and destructive of all atmospheric forces.
storms like that may bring death and destruction, but they also bring life, because the rain that comes from them, distilled by the sun from the surface of the ocean is fresh water, salt-free, and that is something that all life on land must have.
and when that rain, that sweet fresh water, accumulates in rivers and lakes, then it supports a community of plants and animals all of its own, and it's those communities that we're going to be looking at in the next programme.
were that to be suspended, even for a moment, the most extraordinary things would begin happen.
i, for example, would suddenly float into the air because i at the moment am flying in an aircraft on a very special cours which in effect cancels out the effect of gravity.
you can't touch air,like a solid object it's invisible and all-pervasive, so it's easy to forget that it has real substance.
but it's only by exploiting the presence of air that seeds, insects, birds and man are able to overcome gravity and float above the earth's surface.
milkweed and cotton grass, willowherb and thistles, all provide their seeds with downy floats.
these delay the fall of the seeds for so long that currents in the air, winds, can carry them for hundreds of miles from their parents.
seeds like these have crossed the widest oceans and landed on the loneliest islands.
pollen grains are so small, they don't even need fluff to keep in the air.
then, from the spinnerets at the tip, they produce a thread of finest silk.
as it lengthens and the wind catches it, the spiderling turns, grabs the thread with its forelegs and away it goes.
only the tiniest and the lightest of animals and plants can defy gravity in this way.
many seeds are far too heavy to be lifted by the breeze, no matter how downy they are.
the wing is so shaped and weighted, with the seed at one end, that as it falls through the air, it spins.
this protracted fall gives the breeze a chance to deflect the seeds sideways so that they will land some distance away from the parent tree.
the flying frog of central america has a parachute on each foot, formed by the web of skin between its toes.
so one jump from a high branch is enough to carry it from one tree to another.
in south-east asia lives a gecko that not only has a parachute on each foot, but flanges on its body and tail.
another lizard glides through the same forests by extending even bigger wings of skin from its flanks supported by elongated ribs.
its huge cloak of floppy skin sometimes serves as a simple parachute.
but in horizontal flight it does more than just trap air beneath it.
as air passes over the front edge, it's deflected slightly upwards, so creating a slight reduction in the air pressure on the upper surface, just as happens on an aircraft wing or the spinning blade of a sycamore seed,
so the squirrel creates a little lift and floats through the air.
carrying with them whole populations of seeds and spores and spiders.
but there are no such breezes down below the grass stems.
the insect has to haul itself into the air by sheer unaided muscle power.
the downward sweep of the wings produces greater pressure in the air beneath than in that above, so, in a slightly different way from the gliding cloak of the squirrel, beating wings also create lift, and the insect is sucked upwards.
for them, too, getting into the air is the most energetic and demanding part of flying.
they also use their well-muscled legs to assist their labouring wings.
damsel flies catch their food in the air, mate in the air and even fight in the air.
as males squabble over territory, they flutter their patterned wings at one another in an aggressive display.
this hawkmoth lays its eggs on flowers while it's still flying, for it's too heavy to land on them.
it feeds by hovering in front of a blossom and sucking out the nectar with a tube-like proboscis as thin as thread.
one of the smallest of all birds, the bee hummingbird, even smaller than a hawkmoth, is equally skilled, beating its wings 80 times a second to keep itself stationary in the air as it drinks from the flowers.
bird wings are more versatile than those of insects, for their flight feathers fit so closely alongside one another and slide so easily past each other that the bird can change the shape and size of its wing while maintaining its continuous air-deflecting surface,
so the wing can be spread wide on the downstroke, and then, on the upstroke, be made small to offer less resistance to the air.
this kestrel is maintaining a steady position in the sky, relative to the ground, by facing into the wind and flying with such accuracy that it exactly matches the wind speed.
the reduction of air pressure, creating lift on the upper surface of the wings, can be seen quite clearly, for it sucks up the smaller feathers.
the albatross also habitually gets lift by gliding into the wind, and again, the reduction in pressure produced as the air blows over the birds outstretched wings ruffles its feathers.
occasionally, for a minute or so, they alight on the water to collect food.
once every year or so they come down to their nesting grounds to meet their mates again, greeting one another with a charming courtship dance.
it's difficult to appreciate just how big these magnificent birds are when you see them gliding over the ocean.
it's only when you come to one of their nesting sites like this one in south georgia that you really see how big they are.
when they open these wings, they are 11 feet across, the biggest wingspan of any bird.
long, narrow wings are the most efficient shape for uninterrupted gliding, and no bird glides better than the albatross, but such wings are difficult to flap sufficiently fast to give take-off, so many species of albatross nest on the edge of cliffs,
with such techniques, an albatross will glide all day above a line of cliffs travelling effortlessly along this highway in the sky.
land birds also exploit the air currents above cliffs in just the same way.
we are in africa, floating over the great game plains of the serengeti.
i'm now about 100 feet up and kept up entirely by hot air.
but gas burners aren't the only things which produce rising currents of hot air.
the sun does the same thing, as it rises, it heats up the landscape, but all parts of the landscape don't react in the same way.
they're big birds with large wings, so large that beating them is a very laborious business, and the vultures don't do so unnecessarily.
at this time in the morning, they don't try to battle against gravity and climb high in the sky, but limit themselfs by flapping from one low tree to another.
they're waiting for the land to heat up and the thermals to form.
but we have our own thermal, created by our burner, and up we go.
and now the vultures are beginning to come up here to join me.
they will be using the thermals to provide them with an observation post in the sky from which they can scan the plains below, and i'm getting just about the same kind of view as they are, and it's
the vultures, several thousand feet up in the sky, can quickly spot a kill or deduce its presence from the behaviour of birds in a neighbouring thermal, and when they do, they swiftly glide down to it.
once one bird finds a carcass, dozens arrive within a few minutes.
but all the sustenance has not yet been extracted from the carcass.
in the african mountains, as well as in asia and europe, lives a species of vulture with a very specialised diet indeed:
first it brings bones from a carcass to a special workshop which several birds may share.
a patch of bare rock near the top edge of a cliff.
and this is why it chooses a patch of bare rock for its operations.
so that the bone will land so heavily that it crack
the ravens are starting to learn the same technique but haven't mastered it.
they tend to drop their bones on grass, where they don't break.
the lammergeier eats the splinters of bone, impossibly spiky though they appear to be.
some birds exploit the force of gravity by dropping not their food but themselves from the sky.
but the ace of dive-bombers, which can reach at least 80 miles an hour in a dive, is the peregrine falcon.
it patrols the skies, often high above the flight path of other birds.
and when it has selected its victim, it folds its wing steering almost entirely with its tail, and hurtles downwards.
close the target the talons are brought forward for the strike and to make last-second adjustments to the accuracy of its final run.
their flight feathers have special soft edges to them which serve as silencers.
their wings are particularly large and support the bird so easily that there's no need for any vigorous noisy flapping, and the owl can waft its way in silence through the trees.
although owls hunt after dark, they find their way with their large, highly sensitive eyes, and, because their flight is virtually soundless, they can listen for the squeak of unwary voles and mice.
but on the darkest nights, even an owl can't see, and it seldom ventures into the air.
instead they use sonar, squeaking ultrasonically and guiding themselves by the reflected echoes.
they do this so skilfully that they can pluck a flying moth from the air.
it's been known for a long time that bats use high peak sounds in this way, but it's less well known that just one or two birds have, also and quite independently, evolved the same technique.
this cave in venezuela is the home of one of them.
so what i'm going to do is to put on a deep-red filter.
that will disturb them much less, but it will enable us to watch them with a special electronic device called an image intensifier.
they're big birds, relations of the nightjars, and about the size of pigeons.
their nests are compiled from their droppings and bits of regurgitated food.

we are now getting on for four miles above the surface of the earth.
and we're getting very close to the outermost frontier of life on earth.
it's very cold and i certainly wouldn't be able to talk at all if i hadn't got this oxygen, so conditions here are really very much more severe than you might imagine when you sit in your aircraft flying comfortably
but if we examine this mesh, when we get down to earth, with a microscope, it's very likely that, at the very least, we shall have some pollen grains and spores of fungus.

after all, the man did say that this is a romantic city.
we don't wanna make a liar out of him, do we?
mr. laird. i'll be out of your way in just a minute.
i wasn't aware the public relations department kept their files in this room.
and it didn't matter because, for me, love was something you suffered through.
you waited for it to end, leave you alone again, so why bother?
all the same, you'd think he'd have something better to do than hang around a park all day.
oh, i don't know. i think this is a lovely place to spend the day.
oh, speaking of dates, whatever happened to the start-up date for the tar sands project?
well, you should have that information on your desk by now.
when it comes to the lex-dex corporation, mother, there is no information.
not only has your silent partner failed to notify me, but i can't even find him.
you're frightened because you want me as much as i want you.
two weeks in the outback and this is what you come up with?
i've never known you to walk away from differences, let alone a baby.
now listen, i was at the airport when your father flew to korea, and i was there when they flew his body back.
andrew, i appreciate your concern and your loyalty, but it is my life.
now, are you going to handle the divorce or am i going to have to find someone else?
i'm a trained observer, and i wonder, i lust wonder, if your split with kirby doesn't have something to do with fallon, something you still feel for her that you haven't quite overcome.
andrew, what i may or may not feel toward fallon has nothing to do with kirby and my divorce.
we can safely say that it's past histoy that never happened.
you can safely say it's the end of alexis' little scheme as well.
kystle is showing mrs. gordon her room and with our security people outside, danny couldn't be safer.
well, maybe i overreacted, but when i couldn't reach steven, i-
now, there is no reason, under the circumstances, why the three of you shouldn't stay here.
i mean, after all, it's for the baby's sake and we are family.
something that might make your wish to have another baby under the roof come true.
you owe me an explanation, claudia, and i want one right now.
alexis, i did not move danny in with blake and kystle as an attack on you.
that child belongs to me just as much as he does to blake.

edward and thomas worked the main line, percy took the branch line.
thomas worried about annie and clarabel but the guard took care of them.
there are about 10,000 species in this one family, and they claim over a quarter of all the vegetated land on earth.
they are pollinated by the wind, they need far less water than most trees, and they can survive both burning and freezing.
they are able to withstand all this rough treatment because the point from which a grass leaf grows is at its base close to the ground and is permanently active.
so grass provides a continuous banquet for creatures big and small.
spiders tackle almost any creature that moves and dung beetles clear up the droppings from above.
among the most industrious of these tiny labourers are the termites.
on many tropical grasslands, they flourish in such numbers that, one way or another, they consume more of the grass than big creatures like antelope, cows or kangaroo.
in brazil's savannahs, there are more termite mounds per acre than anywhere in the world.
and termites are highly nutritious - so much so that the giant anteater can exist by feeding on them and nothing else whatever.
this creature has very poor eyesight and very poor hearing, and finds its way around mostly by smell, so, as long as i keep downwind of it, there's no reason why it should be particularly disturbed by my presence.
you might think that that would make it very vulnerable to enemies.
the fact is, out on the savannahs here, it's got very few enemies.
those huge forelegs, with enormous muscles on them and gigantic claws, are quite powerful enough to rip the stomach from a puma or a jaguar.
it was always thought that those legs are actually for ripping open termite hills, and they may be used to some extent for that purpose.
but it seems more likely now that they are primarily defensive weapons, because when they actually come to feed, this creature doesn't do so much of a sweep with its front claws as to use them very, very carefully to open the exit tunnels in the termite hills.
once it has done that, it pokes its nose into the tunnel entrance and flicks out its 20-inch-long tongue, coated with sticky mucus, and picks off the worker termites clinging to the tunnel walls.
after about half a minute, before the soldier termites - which have powerful bites - can rally to the defence of the opened tunnel, the anteater moves on.
it is a wanderer, always on the move, sleeping at night out in the open, blanketed against the cold by its huge hairy tail.
having no permanent den, the female carries her youngster with her, piggyback.
other termite hunters live on the surface of the mounds themselves.
carnivorous ants regularly raid the colonies, carrying off the helpless, pallid termite larvae.
the defenders of the colony, the soldier termites, engage the enemy ants.
other ants are vegetarians, like the termites, and use their jaws to demolish the living grass plants, scissoring up the leaves, sawing through the stems and carrying off the plant piecemeal.
grass consists largely of cellulose and that is a very difficult substance to digest.
termites do it with the help of bacteria in their gut.
the grass-cutting ants have another and quite extraordinary method of making its nutriment digestible.
laboriously, they haul the pieces of grass back to their nest, which may be as much as 100 yards away and have several hundred small entrances.
inside an entrance, a tunnel leads down into a vast labyrinth of corridors that may extend for 80 or 90 feet in a horizontal direction and lead to as many as 2,000 interlinked chambers.
such a nest may contain as many as 20 million ants.
the workers carry their cuttings deeper and deeper into the nest.
and here, 15 feet below the surface of the ground, in special chambers, they feed the grass to a fungus.
this fungus forms crumbly white lumps and grows nowhere else but in these nests.
the gardeners push the prepared morsels of grass into the mass of the fungus.
the fungus digests it, cellulose and all, and grows, and the ants then feed on the fungus, which, unlike grass, they can digest.
with unflagging energy, porter lines of ants carry the waste down the long corridors to the lowest chambers of all, 20 feet below ground, that serve as the colony's refuse tips.
these are not only rubbish dumps, but cemeteries, for here they also bring the bodies of dead workers.
the seriama, a catcher of snakes and insects, surveys the prospects from a termite hill.
the tapir has browsed throughout the night, but now, as the sun rises, it makes its way back to the forest that grows in the moist ground beside the river, for it prefers that shady obscurity to the hot conspicuousness of the daytime plains.
just what it likes, and no small bird, no matter how aggressive, is able to repel a hungry tegu.
eggs on the ground are very much at risk from creatures like this.
softly, he summons the female, who is incubating her eggs in the hole beneath.
the burrowing owls nest in holes in the ground, taking over ones that have been abandoned by armadillos or even digging them for themselves.
so it is very important that they get their flight feathers as quickly as possible, and already, only a couple of weeks after hatching, they are showing through the down.
out in the fresh air, there is space to preen and a chance to sunbathe.
their nest is probably as safe as it would be even if they remained sitting on it, for their eggs are marvellously camouflaged and very difficult to see.
the adult tinamou, on the other hand, is just as well-disguised as the plover's eggs.
and he is polygamous, with half a dozen or so females, all of whom will lay in his nest.
but with so many contributors, the compiling of a clutch can be a tricky business.
sometimes several females, each with an egg ready to be laid, will turn up at the same time and there's some confusion as to who's going to have the first turn.
he doesn't seem to want them to lay in the main clutch.
they've come from many different females and been laid over a period of eight days, but all hatch together.
the young pipe to one another while they're still inside their shells, stimulating the eggs that are a bit behind to speed up their development.
the advantage of hatching simultaneously is that the young, soon after they emerge, can go off and feed together under father's watchful eye.
the open grassland is full of dangers and there are very few places to hide from the many enemies that lie in wait for the chicks.
the maned wolf will certainly take one if it gets the chance.
it hunts alone, never forming packs, seldom even seen with its mate.
trees don't grow on the open plains of argentina and brazil because, for much of the year, there is too little rain.
during the dry season, the shallow lakes are reduced to stretches of baked mud.
capybara, giant semi-aquatic guinea pigs, crowd into the few shrinking pools that remain.
cayman are compelled to spend much of their time out of water, and turtles jostle for places along the contracting margins with the capybara.
many others, such as burrowing rodents that might otherwise crop the grass of the plains, can't do so because they can't survive being flooded like this every year.
the grass, however, grows tall and lives through even this hardship.
2,000 miles farther north still, water lies on the plains for many months on end, as snow on the prairies of north america.
here the temperature can drop to 46 degrees below zero centigrade.
their temperature falls and their breathing rate slows - they hibernate, using the absolute minimum of their body reserves accumulated during the summer.
a cousin of the ground squirrel, another rodent called the prairie dog, does remain active, and during milder spells it ventures out onto the snow to nibble what leaves it can find.
the bison manages to survive even the coldest weather out on the prairie.
big animals are not as easily chilled as small ones, and the bison is the most massive animal in north america.
the bison, being so big, have no difficulty in sweeping away the snow and reaching the frozen tufts.
bison share the prairies with pronghorn antelope which, in winter, often visit areas that the bison have just cleared of snow.
they are the swiftest animals in north america, capable of speeds of 50 mph at full stretch.
coyotes, a small relation of the wolf, have little chance of catching a young healthy pronghorn.
the bitter cold and the shortage of food kills many animals at this time.
for the coyotes, a carcass is precious, a mass of meat in an otherwise barren land.
as spring approaches, the temperature rises, even below ground, and the winter sleepers begin to awake.
rattlesnakes, forced to take shelter from the cold, frequently take over the deeper burrows made by prairie dogs and there, ten feet below ground, sit out the winter beyond the reach of the lethal frost.
sometimes as many as two or three hundred will share the same hole.
as the spring sun warms the air, so they too slowly come to life.
the prairie chickens leave the tall grass country where they spent the winter and assemble on shorter turf, for they are about to start their spring dances.
each male stays on a small patch of ground that is his dancing stage, and there erects his feathery horns, inflates his wattles and starts his stamping dance.
the bison, being such a big animal, has a long gestation period, nine months.
so, soon after the young are born, courting starts again, and for the bulls that involves battling with rivals.
these jousts, which can be very punishing and even end in death, establish a ranking among the bulls.
the victors can then seek access to the cows, which is another problem.
the bison herds have a particular liking for the grazing around the prairie dogs' towns, for the prairie dogs are good farmers.
they deliberately cut down unpalatable plants and remove dead material, and their constant cropping means that the grass leaves around their burrows are all young and succulent, and the bison like that just as much as the prairie dogs do.
the rattlesnakes also haunt the town, on the lookout for young prairie dogs.
the shortness of the cropped turf makes it easy for the town sentinels to see approaching danger.
like antelope and sheep, they are ruminants, dealing with the problem of digesting cellulose by regurgitating pellets of grass they graze and giving it all a second chew.
they also maintain a digestive broth of bacteria in their huge stomachs.
today, most of the prairie has been turned over to the raising of domesticated cattle for beef, or ploughed up to grow domesticated grass, wheat.
by the beginning of this century, less than a thousand wild bison were left.
but today, thanks to careful conservation, there are some 35,000 living in reserves.
the prairies receive comparatively little rain because they lie in the centre of a huge continent and the rocky mountains screen off the rain.
across the northern pacific, the biggest continental mass of all, eurasia, also contains a heartland where relatively little rain falls - the grass-covered steppes of russia and eastern europe.
and here another grass feeder survives that once formed vast herds, an extraordinary antelope, the saiga.
its huge nose contains, internally, a convoluted arrangement of passages lined with mucous glands that apparently serve to warm and moisten the dry air of the steppes and filter out the dust.
the steppes are not as fertile as the prairie and are ravaged by regular and disastrous droughts.
but the saiga seem to have adapted to this and have a quite extraordinary rate of reproduction that enables them to recover their numbers after such a catastrophe with great speed.
the females, when they are a mere four months old and only half-grown, mate and produce their first calf.
after it is weaned, they grow rapidly, so that by the beginning of the next breeding season, they are full-size, and then they quickly breed again - and this time three quarters of them will produce twins.
these animals, too, were hunted close to extinction, but when people realised that these natural inhabitants of the steppes could turn their grass into meat much more efficiently than any domesticated animal, indiscriminate hunting was stopped and now there are over two million in the soviet union.
travel south west from the steppes of central eurasia, the greatest of all temperate grasslands, across territory where there is so little rain that not even grass can grow, and you come to the greatest of all tropical grasslands - in africa.
here there is enough rain to create rivers and waterholes, so in the moist soils around them and on rocky outcrops, a few trees manage to grow.
but young trees are threatened not only by drought but by fire.
it sweeps rapidly over the plains, killing the tree seedlings but leaving the growing buds of the grasses, close to the ground, quite unharmed, and green shoots of grass appear within days.
so the fire, which starts so easily in withered grass stems, is one of the factors that keeps the country open, for grass.
the grasslands of africa stretch in an immense and almost continuous arc from the sahara in the north down through east africa and on to the great game plains of southern africa and the cape.
during the eight million years or so of recent history, they've varied quite a lot in their extent.
at the moment, they are not as big as they have been in the past.
but during this period of time, the grasslands have developed, and as they have done so, the animals that lived on them have evolved, the nature of one reacting on the nature of the other.
today, there's a greater variety and a bigger concentration of grass-living creatures on these african plains than anywhere else in the world.
different lengths of neck, different sets of teeth, different appetites, such variety means that almost every growing leaf, short or long, of every kind of plains plant, is eaten by something.
this vast tonnage of meat on the hoof has led, inevitably, to the appearance of an abundance of meat-eaters.
the bushes don't produce many leaves, but they are highly nutritious and there are enough in an acre or so to sustain a pair of these tiny antelope.
so the dik-dik mate for life and are permanent residents of their territory.
when the ceremony is over, the buck marks the nearby bushes with a sticky perfumed wax from a gland just below his eyes.
impala, however, live in more open country and feed not only on bushes but on grass.
here they can't hide and they find their safety in numbers.
with so many sharp eyes and acute ears, it's very difficult for a hunter to approach them undetected.
when the victors have established themselves, the does visit them, one after the other.
it is a very exhausting business for the bucks, repeatedly mating and fighting off challengers.
after about three months of this, the once dominant bucks are worn out.
they yield to other, fresher males and return to the bachelor herd to recover.
they quickly exhaust pasture on one patch of the plains and must move to an area where rain has recently fallen and the grass is springing again.
so the wildebeest are constantly on the move and their social arrangements have to be different from the dik-dik and impala.
during the short breeding season, the males set up small territories along the migration routes.
they advertise their pretensions by prancing around and snorting, seeking showy contests with rivals to demonstrate their virility to passing females.
the problem then is to keep the females in their territory and prevent them from moving on to a rival's patch.
the young calves, born only a few months before, adopt very early the jaunty, slightly crazy way of carrying on affected by their fathers.
at night they pen them in enclosures made from uprooted thorn bush, to keep out lion.
the people can't settle in permanent villages, for their cattle exhaust the meagre pasture, just as wildebeest do, so periodically they too have to move.
it is a nice question as to whether the animals are being driven by the people or whether the people are, willy-nilly, following the herds.
many people in the sudan regard not only their semi-wild cattle as their own personal property, but also the fully wild game that regularly passes through their territory.
the white-eared kob, the males black and white, the females a delicate tan, live in the southern sudan.
here, during the rainy season, the does give birth to their young.
as the rains end and the plains begin to dry out, the herds begin to move north, following the new flush of grass that springs from the receding waters.
as they go, the herds are funnelled together by two rivers that flow closer and closer to one another until eventually they join and the kob have no alternative but to attempt to cross - and here the merle people await them.
day after day, the kob that have arrived at this crossing attempt to run the gauntlet.
it takes several weeks for the whole migration to pass through.
the merle not only feast well now, they sun-dry the meat so that the families will have full stomachs for many months to come.
in spite of the merle's ambush, the vast majority of the kob reach the northern grasslands.
there they will find enough food to sustain them throughout the critical months of the dry season.
and there, too, they mate, so that next year herds will reappear to make the river crossing and provide the merle, once more, with meat.
if there is just a little less rain, then its leaves wither, its roots shrivel and can no longer hold the soil together, so that the wind can catch it and blow away the small nutritious particles.
and then it's reduced to little more than sand and the land becomes a desert.
and it's to deserts that we're going in the next programme.
these beautiful flowers belong to one of the most successful, the most widespread and the commonest of plants.
there are about 10,000 species in this one family, and they claim over a quarter of all the vegetated land on earth.
they are pollinated by the wind, they need far less water than most trees, and they can survive both burning and freezing.
they are able to withstand all this rough treatment because the point from which a grass leaf grows is at its base close to the ground and is permanently active.
so grass provides a continuous banquet for creatures big and small.

such a nest may contain as many as 20 million ants.
the workers carry their cuttings deeper and deeper into the nest.
and here, 15 feet below the surface of the ground, in special chambers, they feed the grass to a fungus.
this fungus forms crumbly white lumps and grows nowhere else but in these nests.
the gardeners push the prepared morsels of grass into the mass of the fungus.
the fungus digests it, cellulose and all, and grows, and the ants then feed on the fungus, which, unlike grass, they can digest.
with unflagging energy, porter lines of ants carry the waste down the long corridors to the lowest chambers of all, 20 feet below ground, that serve as the colony's refuse tips.
these are not only rubbish dumps, but cemeteries, for here they also bring the bodies of dead workers.
the seriama, a catcher of snakes and insects, surveys the prospects from a termite hill.
the tapir has browsed throughout the night, but now, as the sun rises, it makes its way back to the forest that grows in the moist ground beside the river, for it prefers that shady obscurity to the hot conspicuousness of the daytime plains.
just what it likes, and no small bird, no matter how aggressive, is able to repel a hungry tegu.
eggs on the ground are very much at risk from creatures like this.
softly, he summons the female, who is incubating her eggs in the hole beneath.
the burrowing owls nest in holes in the ground, taking over ones that have been abandoned by armadillos or even digging them for themselves.
so it is very important that they get their flight feathers as quickly as possible, and already, only a couple of weeks after hatching, they are showing through the down.
out in the fresh air, there is space to preen and a chance to sunbathe.
rivals display aggressively, running along the frontier between their territories and dive-bombing one another.
their nest is probably as safe as it would be even if they remained sitting on it, for their eggs are marvellously camouflaged and very difficult to see.
it's the male that makes the nest and incubates the eggs.
and he is polygamous, with half a dozen or so females, all of whom will lay in his nest.
but with so many contributors, the compiling of a clutch can be a tricky business.
sometimes several females, each with an egg ready to be laid, will turn up at the same time and there's some confusion as to who's going to have the first turn.
he doesn't seem to want them to lay in the main clutch.
perhaps he's worried about them treading on his eggs, so they'll have to sit outside.
his final clutch may be huge, up to 50 or so.
they've come from many different females and been laid over a period of eight days, but all hatch together.
the young pipe to one another while they're still inside their shells, stimulating the eggs that are a bit behind to speed up their development.
the advantage of hatching simultaneously is that the young, soon after they emerge, can go off and feed together under father's watchful eye.
the open grassland is full of dangers and there are very few places to hide from the many enemies that lie in wait for the chicks.
the maned wolf will certainly take one if it gets the chance.
it hunts alone, never forming packs, seldom even seen with its mate.
it maintains contact with others of its kind by an occasional bark and by leaving its scent on bushes and termite mounds, spraying its urine high up so that the wind will pick up the smell and broadcast it.
but it certainly takes birds if it can, and the tinamou is particularly vulnerable, for it's almost flightless.
trees don't grow on the open plains of argentina and brazil because, for much of the year, there is too little rain.
during the dry season, the shallow lakes are reduced to stretches of baked mud.
capybara, giant semi-aquatic guinea pigs, crowd into the few shrinking pools that remain.
cayman are compelled to spend much of their time out of water, and turtles jostle for places along the contracting margins with the capybara.
but during april, the clouds begin to gather and in june they burst.
many others, such as burrowing rodents that might otherwise crop the grass of the plains, can't do so because they can't survive being flooded like this every year.
the grass, however, grows tall and lives through even this hardship.
2,000 miles farther north still, water lies on the plains for many months on end, as snow on the prairies of north america.
here the temperature can drop to 46 degrees below zero centigrade.
their temperature falls and their breathing rate slows - they hibernate, using the absolute minimum of their body reserves accumulated during the summer.
a cousin of the ground squirrel, another rodent called the prairie dog, does remain active, and during milder spells it ventures out onto the snow to nibble what leaves it can find.
the bison manages to survive even the coldest weather out on the prairie.
big animals are not as easily chilled as small ones, and the bison is the most massive animal in north america.
the bison, being so big, have no difficulty in sweeping away the snow and reaching the frozen tufts.
bison share the prairies with pronghorn antelope which, in winter, often visit areas that the bison have just cleared of snow.
they are the swiftest animals in north america, capable of speeds of 50 mph at full stretch.
coyotes, a small relation of the wolf, have little chance of catching a young healthy pronghorn.
the bitter cold and the shortage of food kills many animals at this time.
for the coyotes, a carcass is precious, a mass of meat in an otherwise barren land.
as spring approaches, the temperature rises, even below ground, and the winter sleepers begin to awake.
rattlesnakes, forced to take shelter from the cold frequently take over the deeper burrows made by prairie dogs and there, ten feet below ground, sit out the winter beyond the reach of the lethal frost.
sometimes as many as two or three hundred will share the same hole.
as the spring sun warms the air, so they too slowly come to life.
the prairie chickens leave the tall grass country where they spent the winter and assemble on shorter turf, for they are about to start their spring dances.
each male stays on a small patch of ground that is his dancing stage, and there erects his feathery horns, inflates his wattles and starts his stamping dance.
the thick woollen coat that protected them through the winter is now far too hot, and the animals begin to shed it in sheets and tatters.
the bison, being such a big animal, has a long gestation period, nine months.
so, soon after the young are born, courting starts again, and for the bulls that involves battling with rivals.
these jousts, which can be very punishing and even end in death, establish a ranking among the bulls.
the victors can then seek access to the cows, which is another problem.
the bison herds have a particular liking for the grazing around the prairie dogs' towns, for the prairie dogs are good farmers.
they deliberately cut down unpalatable plants and remove dead material, and their constant cropping means that the grass leaves around their burrows are all young and succulent, and the bison like that just as much as the prairie dogs do.
the rattlesnakes also haunt the town, on the lookout for young prairie dogs.
like antelope and sheep, they are ruminants, dealing with the problem of digesting cellulose by regurgitating pellets of grass they graze and giving it all a second chew.
they also maintain a digestive broth of bacteria in their huge stomachs.
today, most of the prairie has been turned over to the raising of domesticated cattle for beef, or ploughed up to grow domesticated grass, wheat.
by the beginning of this century, less than a thousand wild bison were left.
but today, thanks to careful conservation, there are some 35,000 living in reserves.
the prairies receive comparatively little rain because they lie in the centre of a huge continent and the rocky mountains screen off the rain.
across the northern pacific, the biggest continental mass of all, eurasia, also contains a heartland where relatively little rain falls - the grass-covered steppes of russia and eastern europe.
and here another grass feeder survives that once formed vast herds, an extraordinary antelope, the saiga.
its huge nose contains, internally, a convoluted arrangement of passages lined with mucous glands that apparently serve to warm and moisten the dry air of the steppes and filter out the dust
the steppes are not as fertile as the prairie and are ravaged by regular and disastrous droughts.
but the saiga seem to have adapted to this and have a quite extraordinary rate of reproduction that enables them to recover their numbers after such a catastrophe with great speed.
the females, when they are a mere four months old and only half-grown, mate and produce their first calf.
after it is weaned, they grow rapidly, so that by the beginning of the next breeding season, they are full-size, and then they quickly breed again - and this time three quarters of them will produce twins.
these animals, too, were hunted close to extinction, but when people realised that these natural inhabitants of the steppes could turn their grass into meat much more efficiently than any domesticated animal, indiscriminate hunting was stopped and now there are over two million in the soviet union.
travel south west from the steppes of central eurasia, the greatest of all temperate grasslands, across territory where there is so little rain that not even grass can grow, and you come to the greatest of all tropical grasslands - in africa.
here there is enough rain to create rivers and waterholes, so in the moist soils around them and on rocky outcrops, a few trees manage to grow.
but young trees are threatened not only by drought but by fire.
it sweeps rapidly over the plains, killing the tree seedlings but leaving the growing buds of the grasses, close to the ground, quite unharmed, and green shoots of grass appear within days.
so the fire, which starts so easily in withered grass stems, is one of the factors that keeps the country open, for grass.
the grasslands of africa stretch in an immense and almost continuous arc from the sahara in the north down through east africa and on to the great game plains of southern africa and the cape.
during the eight million years or so of recent history, they've varied quite a lot in their exten
at the moment, they are not as big as they have been in the past.
but during this period of time, the grasslands have developed, and as they have done so, the animals that lived on them have evolved, the nature of one reacting on the nature of the other.
today, there's a greater variety and a bigger concentration of grass-living creatures on these african plains than anywhere else in the world.
different lengths of neck, different sets of teeth, different appetites, such variety means that almost every growing leaf, short or long, of every kind of plains plant, is eaten by something.
this vast tonnage of meat on the hoof has led, inevitably, to the appearance of an abundance of meat-eaters.
the bushes don't produce many leaves, but they are highly nutritious and there are enough in an acre or so to sustain a pair of these tiny antelope.
so the dik-dik mate for life and are permanent residents of their territory.
when the ceremony is over, the buck marks the nearby bushes with a sticky perfumed wax from a gland just below his eyes.
impala, however, live in more open country and feed not only on bushes but on grass.
here they can't hide and they find their safety in numbers.
with so many sharp eyes and acute ears, it's very difficult for a hunter to approach them undetected.
when the victors have established themselves, the does visit them, one after the other.
it is a very exhausting business for the bucks, repeatedly mating and fighting off challengers.
after about three months of this, the once dominant bucks are worn out.
they yield to other, fresher males and return to the bachelor herd to recover.
they quickly exhaust pasture on one patch of the plains and must move to an area where rain has recently fallen and the grass is springing again.
so the wildebeest are constantly on the move and their social arrangements have to be different from the dik-dik and impala.
during the short breeding season, the males set up small territories along the migration routes.
they advertise their pretensions by prancing around and snorting, seeking showy contests with rivals to demonstrate their virility to passing females.
the problem then is to keep the females in their territory and prevent them from moving on to a rival's patch.
the young calves, born only a few months before, adopt very early the jaunty, slightly crazy way of carrying on affected by their fathers.
at night they pen them in enclosures made from uprooted thorn bush, to keep out lion.
the people can't settle in permanent villages, for their cattle exhaust the meagre pasture, just as wildebeest do, so periodically they too have to move.
it is a nice question as to whether the animals are being driven by the people or whether the people are, willy-nilly, following the herds.
many people in the sudan regard not only their semi-wild cattle as their own personal property, but also the fully wild game that regularly passes through their territory.
the white-eared kob, the males black and white, the females a delicate tan, live in the southern sudan.
here, during the rainy season, the does give birth to their young.
as the rains end and the plains begin to dry out, the herds begin to move north, following the new flush of grass that springs from the receding waters.
as they go, the herds are funnelled together by two rivers that flow closer and closer to one another until eventually they join and the kob have no alternative but to attempt to cross - and here the merle people await them.
for the merle, this is an annual bonanza and a great celebration.
families have travelled from all over the tribal territory to take part and to claim their share in their harvest of meat.
if the herds don't appear, there will be real hunger in the tribe.
in the early morning, the hunters cross the river to set up their ambush.
day after day, the kob that have arrived at this crossing attempt to run the gauntlet.
it takes several weeks for the whole migration to pass through.
the merle not only feast well now, they sun-dry the meat so that the families will have full stomachs for many months to come.
in spite of the merle's ambush, the vast majority of the kob reach the northern grasslands.
there they will find enough food to sustain them throughout the critical months of the dry season.
and there, too, they mate, so that next year herds will reappear to make the river crossing and provide the merle, once more, with meat.
if there is just a little less rain, then its leaves wither, its roots shrivel and can no longer hold the soil together, so that the wind can catch it and blow away the small nutritious particles.
and then it's reduced to little more than sand and the land becomes a desert.
and it's to deserts that we're going in the next programme.
these beautiful flowers belong to one of the most successful, the most widespread and the commonest of plants.
there are about 10,000 species in this one family, and they claim over a quarter of all the vegetated land on earth.
they are pollinated by the wind, they need far less water than most trees, and they can survive both burning and freezing.
they are able to withstand all this rough treatment because the point from which a grass leaf grows is at its base close to the ground and is permanently active.
so grass provides a continuous banquet for creatures big and small.
spiders tackle almost any creature that moves and dung beetles clear up the droppings from above.
among the most industrious of these tiny labourers are the termites.
on many tropical grasslands, they flourish in such numbers that, one way or another, they consume more of the grass than big creatures like antelope, cows or kangaroo.
in brazil's savannahs, there are more termite mounds per acre than anywhere in the world.
and termites are highly nutritious - so much so that the giant anteater can exist by feeding on them and nothing else whatever.
this creature has very poor eyesight and very poor hearing, and finds its way around mostly by smell, so, as long as i keep downwind of it, there's no reason why it should be particularly disturbed by my presence.
you might think that that would make it very vulnerable to enemies.
the fact is, out on the savannahs here, it's got very few enemies.
those huge forelegs, with enormous muscles on them and gigantic claws, are quite powerful enough to rip the stomach from a puma or a jaguar.
it was always thought that those legs are actually for ripping open termite hills, and they may be used to some extent for that purpose.
but it seems more likely now that they are primarily defensive weapons, because when they actually come to feed, this creature doesn't do so much of a sweep with its front claws as to use them very, very carefully to open the exit tunnels in the termite hills.
once it has done that, it pokes its nose into the tunnel entrance and flicks out its 20-inch-long tongue, coated with sticky mucus, and picks off the worker termites clinging to the tunnel walls.
after about half a minute, before the soldier termites - which have powerful bites - can rally to the defence of the opened tunnel, the anteater moves on.
it is a wanderer, always on the move, sleeping at night out in the open, blanketed against the cold by its huge hairy tail.
having no permanent den, the female carries her youngster with her, piggyback.
other termite hunters live on the surface of the mounds themselves.
carnivorous ants regularly raid the colonies, carrying off the helpless, pallid termite larvae.
the defenders of the colony, the soldier termites, engage the enemy ants.
other ants are vegetarians, like the termites, and use theirjaws to demolish the living grass plants, scissoring up the leaves, sawing through the stems and carrying off the plant piecemeal.
grass consists largely of cellulose and that is a very difficult substance to digest.
termites do it with the help of bacteria in their gut.
the grass-cutting ants have another and quite extraordinary method of making its nutriment digestible.
laboriously, they haul the pieces of grass back to their nest, which may be as much as 100 yards away and have several hundred small entrances.
inside an entrance, a tunnel leads down into a vast labyrinth of corridors that may extend for 80 or 90 feet in a horizontal direction and lead to as many as 2,000 interlinked chambers.
such a nest may contain as many as 20 million ants.
the workers carry their cuttings deeper and deeper into the nest.
and here, 15 feet below the surface of the ground, in special chambers, they feed the grass to a fungus.
this fungus forms crumbly white lumps and grows nowhere else but in these nests.
the gardeners push the prepared morsels of grass into the mass of the fungus.
the fungus digests it, cellulose and all, and grows, and the ants then feed on the fungus, which, unlike grass, they can digest.
with unflagging energy, porter lines of ants carry the waste down the long corridors to the lowest chambers of all, 20 feet below ground, that serve as the colony's refuse tips.
these are not only rubbish dumps, but cemeteries, for here they also bring the bodies of dead workers.
the seriama, a catcher of snakes and insects, surveys the prospects from a termite hill.
the tapir has browsed throughout the night, but now, as the sun rises, it makes its way back to the forest that grows in the moist ground beside the river, for it prefers that shady obscurity to the hot conspicuousness of the daytime plains.

but since we moved to tokyo two years ago we only use it as a summer residence.
for some time now it's the retirement home of my in-laws, who moved from mikawa.
but he's not even cold yet, and we're discussing his funeral already.
i know you don't like it, but it can't be helped.
we're now about to lay the diseased to rest in his coffin together.
his wife and the eldest daughter as the next-of-kin should put on the tabi,
suddenly, it occurred to him that there is no photo of him wearing his medals.
so he went to mikawa got his suit and medals and went to the photographer's.
rather than going home to put on mourning, we recommend to come as you are.
this creates the impression that you came in a great hurry.
"thank you very much that you were so good to him.
and our heartfelt thanks for the many visits you paid to him at the hospital.
we want to thank you for your efforts at that night.
i would have liked to have done more for him, but as a psychiatrist, i couldn't do much.
only yesterday, i talked with setsuko, my wife here, if the central hospital was the best choice.
maybe it would have been better to send him to the public hospital.
but it doesn't matter, because by then, his heart had already stopped.
when the doctor pressed like this, there where these zigzag lines on the display.
that's why he never went back home to mikawa for the last couple of years.
so, now it's my turn to look at the old man.
before we close the coffin, please gather round for a last good-bye.
now, everyone, take a flower and put it in the coffin, please.
i would like to say a few humble words to you.
let me first thank you for honouring my brother with your presence.
the diseased was born in hokkaido, but later moved to mikawa, where we struggled together during the harsh postwar years.
finally his destiny lead him here, to kamome hot springs, where, due to all of you, he spend his last years happily and to the fullest.
sadly, despite intensive medical care, he died from a sudden illness.
and so, today, he has to say farewell to us as well as you, you, who have done so much for him, and who he had taken to his heart so dearly.
therefore, let me sincerely thank you on his behalf for the helpfulness and the friendship that all of you showed to him.
recalling all this, let me express my hope that all of us will continue to entertain our neighbourly friendship in the future.
i've just ignited the gas and suddenly the corpse sits up.
then i'm trying to turn off the gas, but i can't move.
therefore, for babies, we don't use high temperatures, because no bones would be left.
so, we use low temperatures for them, and burn them sort of gently.
now, mrs. kikue amamiya, the widow of the diseased, will speak to us.
i want to thank all of you to do us the honour of coming again today.
and i want to thank you... well... sincerely... for your kind help during the last days, despite the fact that all of you have busy schedules.
i'm sure my husband was very happy too about the beautiful funeral ceremony.
but... it would have been nice... well to be there and to share his last moments with him.
so he died all alone and most certainly he felt very lonely.
the abc's of funeral it often shows greater concern to come as you are."
the abc's of funeral "when visiting the bereaved, greet them with:".
and i like greasy food, too, but... the doctor says no.
so i put some off at in the pan with... cabbage and bean sprouts and fry'em fast.
he was born in hokkaido, but in the harsh postwar days... we moved to mikawa where we struggled together as brothers.
in the end, fate willed that he live here in izu.
in the end, fate willed that he live here in izu.
and thank s to you his last years were full and happy.
we know that. but... we're still a fraid someone might be alive.
i even dream that... i turn it on and the corpse sits up.
but now, thanks to all of you here... i don't think... he's lonely anymore. i feel... he's come back to me.
and that he's here now... and he... and i, well... even if i'm alive... we'll start... a new life... together.
when i came back ... the doctors were crowding around ... and wheeling in all those big machines.
i was trying my best to see in ... and his face was all gray.
he was born in hokkaido, but in the harsh postwar days ... we moved to mikawa where we struggled together as brothers.
in the end, fate willed that he live here in izu.
the abc's of funeral it often shows greater concern to come as you are."

i was asked to keep the jewel by a member of the royal family.
it's the blue ruby, supposedly the only one in the world.
he must be trying to swindle the kid and keep the jewel for himself.
why don't we get a good night's sleep and attack them tomorrow.
one third of the language they wrote on the stone is in greek.
i, as a greek, insist on having one third ownership of the stone!
i can 't stop laughing after i heard that the rosetta stone disappeared... from the british museum.
well, napoleon found that stone and champollion deciphered the letters... sculpted on the stone first.
they stole an illustration book that i brought from japan... that was translated into english.
and the book had a story about a thief... who used the big wind to steal things.
the rosetta stone might be hidden somewhere between london and dover.
so, mr. holmes, do you already know the place where they hid it?
it seems like it will be very difficult to get out of here.
how do you plan to get all of this treasure out of here?
some sketches and the flight plan a rival company's spy might have stolen it.
then why are the designs and the important documents still there?
but i wonder... how could you tell the difference between the ballast and gold coins.
oh, as soon as i picked those up, i could tell because of the weight.
this workmanship it must have been crafted almost five hundred years ago or even earlier.
but why have they sealed this inside of a triangle crystal?
the stuff that creates a flash when you take a picture.
why did they only take a picture and leave the sword?
if you figure out what they mean, you will know the secret of the sword.
then the legend of a treasure hidden by our ancestors is true.
an adventurer, captain raythunder, discovered napoleon 's war chest... sunken deep in the sea.
at present, he is returning to england by ship, loaded with treasure.
those spots with pins have been robbed during the last month.
lately, there's been a series of robberies of ship materials engine parts pipes and screws.
we give flowers to the soul of our worthy opponent, mr. sherlock holmes.
since there's no florist around here, i made flowers of toilet paper.
if there are any counterfeit coins mixed in, we can detect them easily.
i got a report.there are some well made counterfeit coins in circulation.
as soon as you fix my press machine, you can go home.
but if you refuse, then i'll have to find another engineer.
yes, but in return, i want to write a letter to my family.
they must be worried about me since i haven't been home for a while.
it took an average of 5 hours, 15 minutes for the balloons to fall.
in other words, the balloon that fell in mrs. hudson's garden... flew that much time from somewhere.
yes, my wife and i live here alone, there's no one else.
did anyone visit the island, or have you seen anything unusual?
a golden statue of an angel was stolen by professor moriarty.
holmes begins his investigation as seven tiny faces appear before him.
holmes and the boys start an adventure... to recover the statue from an abandoned boat.
if you ever find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
big ben is not only london's... but it is the very symbol of the british empire!
if this incident gets out to the public... not only will you get fired, but so will i!
any milk that comes through here would be in our records.
so, you're saying that no store has ever purchased through... you for just one day?
holmes, it's about time you explained... how the milk bottle relates to the theft of the bell.
a milk delivery truck is the only vehicle... that could move unnoticed during the hours when streets are empty.
the sound of big ben tolling is the pride of the british empire.
imagine someone who is bold enough to steal a jewelry shop's diamond... in broad daylight.
i checked before i left last night, the gold bullion was here!
how could they move one million pounds worth of gold bullion, so quickly?
mr. holmes, it seems like something has been bothering you recently.
it's already been a week... but the london police's investigation hasn't been progressing well at all.
unless we get involved, this case will never be solved, holmes.
if they're really having a hard time, the inspector will come to us.
so your husband, mr. perison after leaving with his painting materials has failed to return for three days?
yes, he said he was supposed to paint a portrait of the american millionaire mr. sallinger.
inspector lestrade experimented with ways to carry out the gold bullion.
it took the same amount of time from the back door as it did from the front.
if they carried it off by boat from here, there's no way to trace them.
but what if it could run on the ground, and then become a ship on the water?
if caterpillar treads were the way the gold bullion was carried off... strange, isn't it?
i remember that mr. molly died suddenly in india ten years ago.
but when they left, i checked their clothes and tools thoroughly.
why did you wake me up so early in the morning?
i'll become an instant millionaire, if i steal all of them.
i'll be able to eat train-loads of candies and ice cream, as much as i want.
i'm sure they must be carrying gold, silver or some treasure.
we will never know what might happen until we arrive in london.
i think we'll be in time for a late night dinner.
you mean, mrs. hudson will be making a late night dinner for us?
i learned that when we passed newton station and kenyon junction... the freight car was still there.
and they said the freight car was gone at burton moss station.
i'm sure holmes won't figure out this trick and he'll run away from the case.
and do you think you can figure out where the freight car is?
but holmes, if you change tracks, all the cars would go onto the side-track.
do you remember the rope marks i found between the passenger cars?
the rear passenger cars were pulled by the rope and accelerated.
when the engineer applied the brake, the cars automatically joined together.
but you're only twenty coins short out of 300,000 coins... 346,789!
since then i've done nothing but worry and i've hardly slept!
everything you can see below this mansion is all my property.
the town, the factory, the river, the road are all mine.
while that was going on, a little client paid a visit to holmes
whenever you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
i wish i were as good a diamond broker as mr. benson.
in any case, we'll never have anything to do with jewels like these.
it'll be no surprise if someone goes after it, sooner or later.
however, holmes... even moriarty wouldn't make such a bold move in broad daylight, would he?
yes, but i really need something a little more expensive... isn't that right, darling?
in that case, i have something very special to show you.
you won't find this at any other store in all of london.
i guarantee that this will enhance your natural beauty even more.
in that way... a thief would appear to be innocent even if they were to be searched.
i'm pleased with myself to have come up with such a well thought-out scheme,right holmes?
she's leaving on the 2 o'clock ferry to go home with her nursemaid, malta.
if the doll's with her, moriarty and his gang may be after her, too!
i'm sorry you had to go through all this trouble... just because of this jewel.
but no one will ever try to take my doll again, right?
to complicate matters further there's to be a showdown on the thames river between holmes and his arch rival, professor moriarty!
if you ever find yourself in a mystery, please come visit us at baker street!
but the painting was merely covered by a piece of paper.
and on the back of the paper was a note... with the entire account of this incident.
i really should take you home, but i have to say goodbye here.
if i ever have the chance, we can see each other again.
professor moriarty took advantage of the chaos... and stole the blue ruby, the only one of it's kind in the world.
if you ever find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
all of you haven't changed a bit, you still look young.
what a sweet thing to say to an old woman like me.
the case begins with the disappearance of a submarine... and involves an undersea treasure discovered by adventurer, raythunder.
if ever you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
judging from those ashes... it is certain that lord racliff was here and waiting for his daughter.
when the bride came out of the dressing room, they both... began walking along this corridor, towards the chapel.
if nobody left the room, that means they disappeared inside of it.
it is likely they were ambushed by the kidnappers from behind the door.
he kept trying to force his attentions on her against her will.
but i never dreamed he would do such a terrible thing.
miss alice, i completely sympathize with elizabeth, but... the bride still must be rescued.
the men who helped the prince are none other than moriarty... and his gang of dirty thieves.
this is the straits of dover, 4000 miles from the indian ocean.
what do you suppose the bengal pirates are doing all the way over here?
the bengal pirates have a custom of sending a shark's tooth... to announce the death mark of a traitor.
so, the pirate ship is here to take revenge on lord george?
i took this box when i betrayed and escaped from my three compatriots.
this is what they are trying to get, in addition to my life.
the shadow behind this crime is that evil genius, professor moriarty.
(the evil genius, professor moriarty) whenever you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
i suppose i'll have to go all the way back home to get it.
i'm sorry to trouble you... but would you mind holding this for me?
the bell from the famous clock tower, "big ben", has disappeared.
holmes sets a trap for professor moriarty by pretending the bell hasn't been stolen.
all i have to do is to wait until the heat is off.
we'll hide in the warehouse and stake out quietly until moriarty arrives.
around the time i first joined scotland yard... this mysterious thief managed to fluster the entire city of london.
bold and gorgeous... though he was an enemy, he was very charismatic indeed.
inspector, do you really believe that we... the royal guards, will dance to the magpies' piping?
they said they have no intention of altering shoscom prince's escort... scheduled for the day after tomorrow.
one day, when i was cleaning his study, i came upon his old diary.
in it, i saw his other face, known to all as christopher the mysterious thief.
how bitter it must have been for him, hurting h is leg... and having to retire from the business!
so, i was determined to complete the work he'd been forced to leave undone!
yes, he kidnapped three art students who were visiting from france.
he must have imprisoned them and forced them to forge paintings.
when holmes began the investigation... he found traces of them unexpectedly.
if you find yourself in a mystery, please come see us at baker street.
automobile companies are putting a great deal of effort... into the development of new cars and the number of cars is increasing.
but people may begin to lose faith in the automotive industry.
that smoke isn't the type you would expect to see if a house was on fire.
it must be from a factory... or someplace where the fire is burning quantities of oil.
he is going after the prize of 100,000 crowns, moriarty, that fiend!
trying to win the championship with a stolen engine... that's thoroughly unforgivable!
mr. mac bain was always so kind to my late husband.
i would like to do something to help him in return.
i had kept it at a friend's place, so it wasn't destroyed in the fire.
it may be not as powerful as the other one, but i'll race with it.
i wished i could have asked professor moriarty how he liked the dessert.
i bet it was the bitterest cake he had ever tasted.
moriarty's mechanical dragon attacks a speeding locomotive... and they steal a parrot that belongs to one of the passengers.
meanwhile, holmes finds out that there's a relationship... between the parrot and indian merchant who's gone missing.
from now on, your life is his, and his is yours.
let no one raise his hand against you... and may your days not end before the appointed time.

we were strong... when rajk was in our midst wearing a mask.
and did we grow weaker when we tore his mask off... and cracked down on his gang?
yes, but the poor chap has no idea of the job.
he's a sound comrade, he survived a tough ordeal under the old regime.
all right, maybe we don't agree, but believe me i'm convinced...
i'm more useful in the factory than i would be in a party post.
the young workers of csepel challenge workers to a stalin contest.
one of the csepel iron works stakhanovities turner nandor kmechtl led with a 3,052 per cent achievement.

this will be a perfect opportunity for us to come together against them
what's your relationship with yun fei yang that you always protect him?
you don't concentrate on your kung fu but consort with him, it's unseemly
brother, they are bringing a gift to teacher, we shouldn't be so rude
sister, they insist on bringing their swords how can we break the rule?
you've always taught me how to be a good person yet i've disappointed you
then you should apply yourself more diligently and stop the others from bullying you
dad, since qing song is hurt why don't we pursue and get rid of him?
i've fought him every 1 0 years and even have won thrice
yen zhong tian trained for twenty years and even though he might not have completed it he should be close enough
then that is to say as long as yen zhong tian lives we have little chance of being the top in the martial arts world?
i am bound to attain the ninth level by then yen zhong tian wouldn't be able to escape death
sirs, would you like to eat or do you need lodgings?
good, it's an opportune time as we need a man like you
i decide to exceptionally initiate fu yu xue as our student
yun fei yang, i must hand it to you you have guts
but even then sister might not like you give back the pouch
i've been lucky so far but one's luck would likely run out some day
the road to happiness isn't always paved with gold but is often strewn with setbacks
according to my investigation the four pupils of the school killed by qing song were all impersonators
there were three men and a woman beaten by someone called fu yu xue who saved qing song
what insolence, do you think you could just take away a wudang member this easily?
if you don't let him come with us we'll use force
i want to kill yen zhong tien and learn silkworm skill that's why i have to kill qing song first
young chief, but jin sek and yu sek will vie with you for succession to be the chief
according to me we should find a new chief to lead our clan
right, we are facing strong enemies we cannot afford to be disorganised
i was brought to wudang since i was a kid and everyone looked down on me
and then finallly framed me as the rebel who killed the chief
why don't you come to lnvincible clan so my dad could protect you?
no, if i went with you they'll confirm i'm a rebel
it's for your own good at least this could save your life
when the real murderer is found the allegations could be cleared
the silkworm skill was the kung fu perfected by our ancestor ku mu seventy years ago and is also our school's supreme kung fu
twenty years ago the emperor of bi luo fu posed as a cook for us to steal this secret manual
now the only strong enemy wudang faces is dugu wu di
the fate of wudang depends on if or not you can follow the essence of silkworm skill
i hated wu di then for losing his sexual prowess in training fatal skill
so i intended to make him angry and i saved anyone he wanted to kill
you have guts, i'll not spare you today so you'll always remember the shame qing song inflicted on me these years
yun fei yang take your best shot and pull no punches
it is deadly and immoral yet it's a shame to give it up
it's concealed in silkworm creed for the right person by ku mu priest
he stole into wudang to steal the silkworm creed and he was captured and killed by me he deserved to die what revenge is there to seek?
bullshit, are you going to kill yourself or shall we do it for you?
he hoped i could understand its essence and i did after these twenty years
it needs the convergence of 3 yin forces to release it's highest powers
the one practising silkworm skill must be a virgin boy and has to incapacite all his own kung fu
the 'yin' of three women flowing into the body will merge with the 'yang'
if shiau yau valley has to be great we must get rid of dugu wu di of lnvincible clan
i am not able to complete my training in silkworm skill which dugu wu di dreads and i don't even know if the shadow sword can fight against fatal skill
- dear colonel, i wonder if i might beg a kindness from you?
- my butter is running very low, if you could let me have a pat or two, just to keep me going?
they took him and his wife out into the town square and shot them in cold blood.
i shall never forget the look on his face as he stood there.
how quickly i have lost the thread of this tapestry of intrigue.
- two british airmen are in a farmhouse twenty miles from here.
- that is how you will know they are the airmen.
- you will conceal them until monsieur leclerc has prepared their papers.
- it is the only place where nobody goes unless they have to.
...but i wish to speak with you about that, it is not very convenient.
- one moment... is your wife's mother prepared to die for france?
- she's been prepared to die for thirty years, but she doesn't go!
- i think he wants your watch before he lets us in.
- you'd better give it to him, we can't stand out here forever
- well, i told you where it was, ...n return for the motorcycle, the chocolate and the fact that you were going to shoot me.
- well, i have to hide it again, the gestapo are looking for it.
- but colonel, the gestapo will take the picture back to berlin, and then "pffft" goes your pension.
- i think rene has a very good point, herr colonel.
every year, they gather in the town, ...to examine each other's onions.
they do the dance of the onions, ...and at midnight, they have the feast of the onions where they just eat and eat all the onions...
the boss is not familiar with the art to assemble walls.
but is familiar with the art of setting up other things!
i only know his name and that i am to house british airmen.
and the radio under the bed my mother and the codebook.
a bottle of 37 chateau lafitte, ... some cigars i saved for after the war, but how are you going so well, it is better to smoke them now.
a bit of cheese, cognac - "" napoleon "," of course and a bottle of perfume assistants.
well, love to stay and chat, but i gotta pay the light bill, know what i mean?
hey, annie, how would you like to go on a date tomorrow night with hopper?
before my ma died, during christmas, we used to have these family things.
and my aunt ida was always there with her goddamn mistletoe hat.
and i had this theory that it was my aunt ida's kissing that was doing it.
because they were all dropping dead in january and february, and she was doing all the kissing in december.
i almost did a horrible thing, but it's only because i don't wanna let him down.
i wonder what it would be like to be you sometimes.
but it''s only because i don''t want to let him down.
i wonder what it would be like to be you, sometimes.
and my aunt ida was always there with her goddamn mistletoe hat.
and every time i turned around, it was her cow lips, her wet, puckered cow lips on my face.
now when you get over there, i want you to write.
doesn't have to be much, just a few lines, so she can sleep easier.
he must be wrong, because i never knew any navy boy who had the skill to play for money.
it's all that time on ships, does something to their balance.
the way i been raised, these people just don't ask for things.
see that girl you saw last night nicky got her pregnant.
there is somebody who needs something from me, and he thinks i'm special, and i just wanna give it to him.
i almost did a horrible thing, but it's only because i don't wanna let him down.
i wonder what it would be like to be you sometimes.
i mean i look around here, and everything seems so much easier for you.
you think i took advantage of you because i asked you for that money.
well, caddie, we needed that money, and you're the only rich person i know.
and my aunt ida was always there with her goddamn mistletoe hat.
and every time i turned around, it was her cow lips, her wet, puckered cow lips on my face.

he's halfway to the next county by now, but he'll come home when he calms down a bit.
look, i don't want to be a pest about this, but... isn't there a test that could be made on the horse?
i went to a lot of trouble putting this little show together, so i hope you all enjoy it.
by the way, this is all legal as hell, so don't get any funny ideas.
the rest of my estate, built with my brains and my sweat, comes to about 15 million.
it takes a sound mind and goodjudgment to handle that much money.
well, it took my entire bag of tricks to get teddy released on his own recognizance.
you can pick him up at the sheriff's office anytime you want.
mmm, he seems to have done very well by the langley estate.
face it, marcus, i could drive a freight train through that loophole.
yes, well, he's making noises, but i intend to head him off.
i intend that every quick-draw attorney around here... is gonna know that this dog is no pussycat.
sheriff, i think we should all hear what your deputy had to say.
well, up in the security room there's this button that closes the gate.
reckless driving made her mercedes swing wide on the turn... and come to a sudden, screeching halt.
now, someone got out of the car and pushed the intercom buzzer.
it was only later that you interpreted... what you saw as a ghost.
now, i believe that trish was still inside the car, that she was either unconscious or-or drunk.
the murderer must have trained him to scratch on the door of the security room every night.
that same person taught him to press the button when he heard a special sound.
say, uh, you sure you don't want me to take you on up to the gate?
you got about a half a mile to go, you know.
you didn't actually think you could get away with drugging teddy and having that man fake an injury?
having the dog destroyed seemed the surest way of breaking the will.
now, this is the gate button that teddy pushed... the night that trish langley was killed.
this is abby freestone's whistle, which the sheriff found near the gate.
[teddy whimpering] this is an ultrasonic whistle, audible only to a dog.
now, please, go into the hall, will, and blow into the intercom that is connected to this one.
it would have been a quiet, perfect means ofleaving the scene, ifhe hadn't lost his bicycle clip.
without this clip, he got that characteristic greasy mark on his trouser from the chain, the mark i saw on your cuff the night of the murder.
he's halfway to the next county by now, but he'll come home when he calms down a bit.
look, i don't want to be a pest about this, but... isn't there a test that could be made on the horse?
i went to a lot of trouble putting this little show together, so i hope you all enjoy it.

yes, well, he's making noises, but i intend to head him off.
i intend that every quick-draw attorney around here... is gonna know that this dog is no pussycat.
whoever is responsible... will never get away with framing that dog.
if that's an accusation, boswell, be rather careful, because i know a thing or two about slander laws.
now, someone got out of the car and pushed the intercom buzzer.
barnes looked into his monitor... and saw someone outlined against the headlights.
now, at that time, you had no way ofknowing that your sister would die.
it was only later that you interpreted... what you saw as a ghost.
now, i believe that trish was still inside the car, that she was either unconscious or-or drunk.
i think the killer drove her home, deliberately swerving along the road... to make it look like drunk driving.
uh, ms. fletcher here... will be starting off this inquest as "amicus curiae."
for you yahoos in the back, that means "friend of the court."
this is abby freestone's whistle, which the sheriff found near the gate.
he believes that abby used it that night... to command teddy to push the button.
now, please, go into the hall, will, and blow into the intercom that is connected to this one.
[will on intercom] i blew into this end just like you said, ma'am.
morgana said she saw her sister's spirit rise with the call of a bird.
now, i believe that the call was the same one that mr. barnes heard.
fifteen million dollars worth of it... if you expected to inherit.
but suppose we look a little further, to somebody who never expected to inherit.
trish's killer hid his bicycle along the road earlier in the evening.
it would have been a quiet, perfect means ofleaving the scene, ifhe hadn't lost his bicycle clip.
michael knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
michael, it's hard to believe that millions of dollars in heavy construction equipment is stolen and illegally resold each year.
i can't finish the job without the equipment, and i can't pay you until i finish the job.
i'd like to come by and talk to you about it.
i think i'd bring a little hair of the dog if i were you.
kitt, give me all you've got on frank sanderson's company history, will you?
you see, i put a lot more money into the business when we first started and like a couple of dummies, we didn't write anything down on paper.
and after 25 years, it's real hard to remember who contributed what.
i hope you can take a rain check on the dinner.
uh, your husband says your cooking is the best in the state.
when joe was having a heart attack, those pills were halfway across the room.
kitt, that chain could have been torn from his neck and thrown out of his reach.
i've also detected a miniscule amount of horizonthalonium, better known as echinocactus which only grows in one small section of the state, the silver bell mountains, a few miles west of our present location.
yeah, if that's where the truck came from, then it's probably where the truck went.
i don't believe the trajectory guide was designed with excavation in mind.
and i wasn't designed with being buried alive in mind, either.
i'm pretty lucky to have a machine like you for a friend, let me tell you.
michael, my sensors indicate a vehicle on the road east of us moving away at a rapid rate.
i think you'd better listen, and i think you'd better listen real close.
you see, i just found a whole collection of stolen equipment hidden in the silver bell mountains.
knight, you haven't lived long enough to stand there and judge how things are between frank sanderson and me.
sure, we... we don't see eye to eye, but we have spent the best part of our lives together.
you're lucky the kid broke it up, or i'd get you...
i broke it up because, whether you two know it or not, you need each other.
you know, this thing with lucy, i just don't get it.
everything was going along fine, and then one day, out of the blue...
look, you've got a couple of years on me and a whole lot of experience.
so if i'm out of line, you just let me know.
and then stuffed $5,000 in his pocket and left him lying in the dust like a common criminal.
you said your husband was killed because he got too close.
joanna, i've never been married, but i've been in love and i know how hard it is to lose that.
look, i can only guess what you're going through right now, but i know it's probably the hardest thing you ever had to face.
we are going back to the border, pal, to see if lightning strikes twice.
kltt, can you give me a reading on what's inside those trucks?
who or what you did before that seems to be a real mystery.
probably not the kind of things you can discuss at your fancy fundraisers.
(david) eduardo o'brian's been one of the biggest independents in mexican crime for years.
the stories about what he's done to people he doesn't like would turn your stomach.
well, priscella ragsdale and i were neighbors for years in georgetown before she and john moved here to los angeles.
and, uh, he's an entertainment lawyer, so, of course, they know everybody.
but the thought of what a weapon like that might do to me is rather perplexing.
yeah, well, let's make a point of not finding out, huh?
i think you and i'd better get a few things straight.
first of all, i'm here to conduct an investigation, not play social doormat and empty-glass holder for you and your highbrow, low-minded friends.
i've got to get back in the beach house, get to that computer in the study.
it's our last chance to figure out boca before it's too late.
if i can get back in the study, i can get the computer to interface with the computer in michael's car.
i don't know how it works, but everything in their computer will be transferred to kltt.
you know, when david told me about you, i was mildly curious.
but when he mentioned the incredible past that you'd invented, well, i just knew i had to meet you.

"all petroleum and oil to be sold at a retail price of 2p a gallon.
"all oil wells to be given, tax-free, to anyone really nice you can find."
i hope you don't mind, but i needed somewhere to stay.
when i saw you'd gone away, i climbed through the window, found an empty bed, and went to sleep.
this is captain blood radio, broadcasting from 20 degrees south and 45 degrees west of dead man's island in the medium wave area.
and the fishing is good tonight, with the time coming up to...two inches.

they just have these old fireplaces and romantic old feather beds, antiques, so you have to snuggle up to your loved one.
best part for me was they had this old romantic circular driveway.
ain't gonna let that get in the way of a good friendship, huh?
if it picks you up any, i never had a better handshake.
he has six small wheels, a short funnel, a short boiler and a short dome.
he's a fussy engine, always pulling coaches for the big engines to take on journeys.
when trains come in, he pulls the coaches away, so that the big engines can go and rest.
he loves playing tricks on other engines, including gordon - the biggest engine.
but i do give a shit when you screw me around.
now, if you pay me back like a good boy, i might forget it.
i'm sorry, but i can't help it if your butterfly chooses to live in the yek yeik desert.
in the yek yeik, is there a huge crack in the ground where there are explosions that rock the earth?
two gentlemen came this morning with your packages, but you were asleep.
i told them to be quiet so as not to wake you, but don't worry, i've got the packages.
if a man came out with crap like that, i'd smack his face in.
now you go off and have a little nap until daddy calls you for supper.
the bizarre thing is that the kiops sacrifice only men to their gods.
they tie them up live to a sort of web they weave and then the kalibidu comes along and the bodies disappear.
tonight, they'll stir up their dogs and tomorrow they'll turn you out and you'll have to run.
if you can outrun the dogs, you might just see my money again.
if i were your father, looking down from heaven, i'd be so proud of you.
if we ever get out of here, i promise you we'll find your butterfly.
so if one of you little savages raises a finger to stop us leaving, he'll pay.
why can't we be left to walk through the jungle in peace?
if you try to force me to go to paris, i'll smash your face in.
i see, because we had a romantic moment last night, we have to print the wedding invites
in the 12th century, a volcano, extinct for 10,000 years, started to spew out diamonds.
the earth split open, the volcano was swallowed up and pikaho was never heard of again.
the legend also says that the volcano takes vengeance on those who rob it.
so be careful, your alchemical games might blow up in your face.
you've lost, willard, but i'm not vindictive, so i'll let you into my legend.
when the earth split open, nature went awry and few survived.
i need men like you, willard, to keep my civilisation alive.
darcy will set up a trial to find out which of my top girls will have you.
all the men were mad about her and i was a little physicist with nothing.
i wanted her so much that, to win her, i set out to find her famous pikaho.
she used my love to turn me into what i've become, to force me to do things that go against nature.
but i can harness the energy of the volcano and turn its fury against her.
gwendoline, the queen will see through your scheme and you'll die.
i can win, if you have an ounce of feeling for me.
beth, once we're out of the water and we've found my father, we might make a real effort to remember where we put them.
otherwise this poor boy might never be able to go back to yuk yen, which would be a real shame.
it makes you retch, it makes you puke, it can kill you.
the kiops are terrified of it and believe they can appease its fury with human sacrifices.
what do i care about your insects and your family problems?
i'm not risking my life in a godforsaken uncharted desert with a hysterical girl, a useless maid and a bloody butterfly net!
by sacrificing me to the kalibidu, they save one of their warriors.
when you're running away from the dogs tomorrow, if they haven't caught you after 300 yards, run in zigzags.
if we ever get out of here, i promise you we'll find your butterfly.
it will be the most beautiful butterfly in the world, and it will be named after you.
i just want to catch this stupid butterfly and go home.
so if one of you little savages raises a finger to stop us leaving, he'll pay.
if you try to force me to go to paris, i'll smash your face in.

look, if she takes him out, it blows us all out of the water.
i'm willing to take the chance that that is not going to happen.
we're in an ideal position to move to the next step.

well, uh, it's a little difficult just now for me to leave.
anyway, manny always wanted to be exciting, so he got into racing.

once, he got a load in by having his mule ladies... dress up like nuns.
he even had one of'em killed because they were holding out on him.

oh, you two girls aren't gonna have any problem passing' my class this semester.
my father was a gentle man, my mother called him jacob.
she also called him a failure and a good for nothing.
i only ask that you think of me now and again.
and when you think of me, please think of me with fondness.
oh, well, that's very nice, but i really could not possibly afford to pay--
oh, that's all right, i'll do it as a labor of love,
it is because of her that i have proven hypnosis to be effective.
she has enabled me to reach the secret parts of the human mind, the unconscious,
it's just that i do want to know where she keeps things because it's very difficult to work in a kitchen that you're not familiar with.
maybe i'll just come the night before and we'll do a sort of a dress rehearsal.
well, maybe then i'll just stay up and i'll do a dress rehearsal at my house tonight.
and i'll make the strudel, and if anything goes wrong, i can correct it.
i'm going to ask you to try a little something for me.
i want you to lie back down here, to lie back and relax.
yes, the heads of the groups of cavemen would beat out rock rhythms.

it's sad to think that it took till now to discover sex.
i mean, think how whole generations of people might have benefited from it-- my parents, your parents...
investigating his predecessor's death, corrado meets titti, the junkie daughter of the suicide noblewoman and gradually falls for her.
his marriage to else has been on the rocks for a while.
titti tells corrado that cirinna, a heroin trafficker, killed her mother and lnspector marineo.
titti, fearful of cirinna and dependent on the drugs he gives her, didn't dare report him to the police.
i want a direct investigation into the banking status of people and companies under suspicion.
i want to check all entries for the past 3 years including drafts and personal cheques.
i'm not saying this town is clean, but we run the risk of tarnishing everyone.
if i granted your request, i'm sure you'd find something, but what about the innocent people?
to me, the most important issue is the balance between two loyalties.
loyalty towards the rights of the individual and the right of society to be defended.
the lugano bahamas banking route is the best, given the situation.
as for the other military supplies we have, where's the best market?
it'll take more than that and i'm not speaking just from a personal point of view.
you'll be responsible for the social unrest that might arise from hasty actions so you must stop him in time.
but out of a love of nature, we'll call it "jasmine".
so, a sum leaves this account, which goes to finance a mysterious, illegal deal which...
chief inspector in florence or genoa... or higher still, maybe close to government.
as you know, it only takes good public relations and interviews in leading papers.
you see, lnspector, when one is as honest as you, intelligent, and one loves one's country, everything becomes simple and the path becomes obvious.
he talked for 2 hours, gave me his private number and naturally said to call him at any time, for anything.
the signatures on the jasmine account are by ravanusa, but terrasini's are on the poppy account.
forged endorsements released funds for the financiers and those that vanished in rome, naples, milan, turin... processed by bogus companies headed by reckless bankers, international traffickers, and maybe political organisations.
corrado investigates the murder and meets titti, the dead noblewoman's junkie daughter.
he soon finds a link between his predecessor's murder and the marchioness' death.
people who greet each other with a smile as they see themselves in others.
for some time now, it's as if an evil force was among us.
between the wretch who kills for money and the powerful who give the orders.
that is why hope, in this day of bloodshed and sorrow, is represented by so many young people here today.
young people like leo de maria and women, who also want an end to visible massacres
like the one we mourn today and the invisible ones, because we no longer want to shed these tears.
marineo's death seemed a mafia vendetta, but leo de maria's killing puts a new slant on things.
there are people here who are running scared and will go to any lengths.
you make up all these things... to frighten me, i guess.
i found a box of matches stained with marineo's blood close by.
i was told that servants shouldn't witness family rows... so i sent him back to his room.
when i met titti, she was already tripped out, as they say.
why don't you accept, my dear olga, what's in front of you, which isn't too bad?
the wheel turns and we might get the wind in our sails.
i know, it's rather trite, but we mustn't see our actions as a catastrophe or a point of no return.
it might just be a response to an impulse of the moment.
a man is a pianist, but loses his hands under a train.

actually, herr krausberg, you may be able to do me a great service.

it is sad to spend your life in such continual tragedies.
ah, it's not in the times, of course, but in the heart.
this ship was a thoroughgoing lie... and i was the commanding officer.
this ship - the s. s. samaritan it was called... looked from the outside like a harmless, fat old lady-

he was quite disappointed when he got back and, uh, discovered you'd flown the coop.
i do believe he's missed you full as much as i.
he lived peacefully among the indians, in, uh - somewhere in what is now massachusetts.
but the-the puritans found him... and tried to-to coax him back to a respectable life.
didn't really get through to me completely, but you sounded jolly good.
look, if you're absolutely sure that you're feeling all right, i'd better be pushing off.
the good doctor makes logic and faith lie down together like the lion and the lamb.
doctor, what would you prescribe for a chronic case... of uncontrollable, all-possessing and inescapable delirium tremens?
had a taste for vin rosé d'anjou and a dog named harpo.
you wouldn't expect a communist to have a dog named harpo
no, i thought it was - it was all legally settled.

he was quite disappointed when he got back and, uh, discovered you'd flown the coop.
i do believe he's missed you full as much as i.
surely you know by this time that i can't get drunk, however much i drink... and that i'm only drunk in the conventional, incoherent staggering sense... when i haven't had a drink.
surely you appreciate the, mmm - the fine balance i must strike... between the, uh, shakes of too little and, uh, the abyss of too much.

let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
i say unto you , what he hath done famously, he did it to that end.
though soft-conscienced men can be content to say it was for his country, he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud, which he is, even to the altitude of his virtue.
they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, which now we'll show 'em in deeds.
why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours, will you undo yourselves?
suffer us to famish, and their store-houses crammed with grain , make edicts for usury, to support usurers, repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich, and provide more piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain the poor.
if the wars eat us not up, they will, and there's all the love they bear us.
but, since it serves my purpose, i'll venture to stale't a little more.
yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale, but, an 't please you , deliver.
there was a time when all the body's members rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
that only like a gulf it did remain i' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, still cupboarding the viand, never bearing like labour with the rest, where the other instruments did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
with a kind of smile, which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus...
for, look you , i may make the belly smile as well as speak.
but, if you do remember, i send it through the rivers of your blood, even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain ,
and, through the cranks and offices of man , the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live.
but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves.
what's the matter, you dissentious rogues, that, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion , make yourselves scabs?
you are no surer, no, than is the coal of fire upon the ice, or hailstone in the sun .
your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it.
they'll sit by the fire, and presume to know what's done i' the capitol, who's like to rise, who thrives and who declines, side factions and give out conjectural marriages, making parties strong and feebling
such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes.
they said they were an -hungry, sigh'd forth proverbs, that hunger broke stone walls,
that dogs must eat, that meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only.
the rabble should have first unroof'd the city, ere so prevail'd with me.
it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection 's arguing.
they have a leader, tullus aufidius, that will put you to't.
i sin in envying his nobility, and were i anything but what i am, i would wish me only he.
such a nature, tickled with good success, disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon .
but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius.
fame, at the which he aims, in whom already he is well graced, cannot better be held nor more attain 'd than by a place below the first.
for what miscarries shall be the general's fault, though he perform to the utmost of a man , and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius, "o if he had borne the business!"
besides, if things go well, opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius.
so, your opinion is, aufidius, that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed.
"they have press'd a power, but it is not known whether for east or west.
the dearth is great, the people mutinous, and it is rumour'd, cominius,
we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us.
nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil'd till when they needs must show themselves, which in the hatching, it seem'd, appear'd to rome.
i pray thee, daughter, sing, or express yourself in a more comfortable sort.
if my son were my husband, i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love.
when yet he was but tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding,
i, considering how honour would become such a person , was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame.
to a cruel war i sent him, from whence he returned, his brows bound with oak.
i tell thee, daughter, i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a man -child than now in first seeing he proved himself a man .
methinks i see him stamp thus, and call thus, "come on , you cowards!
you were got in fear, though you were born in rome."
i saw him run after a gilded butterfly, and when he caught it, he let it go again , and after it again .
and over and over he comes, and up again , catched it again .
i do beseech you , by all the battles wherein we have fought, by the blood we have shed together, by the vows we have made to endure friends, that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates,
and that you not delay the present, but, filling the air with swords advanced and darts, we prove this very hour.
though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to you , yet dare i never deny your asking.
take your choice of those that best can aid your action .
but i'll report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles, where great patricians shall attend and shrug, i' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted, and, gladly quaked, hear more,
where the dull tribunes, that, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours, shall say against their hearts, "we thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier."
i have done as you have done, that's what i can , induced as you have been , that's for my country.
he that has but effected his good will hath overta'en mine act.
therefore, i beseech you in sign of what you are, not to reward what you have done, before our army hear me.
i have some wounds upon me, and they smart to hear themselves remember'd.
of all the treasure in this field achieved and city, we render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth, before the common distribution , at your only choice.
i thank you , general, but cannot make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword.
for that i have not wash'd my nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch, which, without note, here's many else have done...
you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical, as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies.
too modest are you , more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly.
by your patience, if 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you , like one that means his proper harm, in manacles, then reason safely with you .
so often hast thou beat me, and wouldst do so, i think, should we encounter as often as we eat.
by the elements, if e'er again i meet him beard to beard, he's mine, or...
nor sleep...nor sanctuary, being naked, sick, nor fane nor capitol, the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice, embarquements all of fury,
shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst my hate to marcius.
there will be large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall stand for his place.
he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
wouldst thou have laugh'd had i come coffin 'd home, that weep'st to see me triumph?
ay, my dear, such eyes the widows in corioli wear, and mothers that lack sons.
i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy.
only there's one thing wanting, which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee.
the commoners, for whom we stand, but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours, which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to do't.
i heard him swear, were he to stand for consul, never would he appear i' the marketplace, nor on him put the napless vesture of humility, nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds to the people, beg their stinking breaths.
he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him, and the desire of the nobles.
i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution .
so it must fall out to him or our authorities for an end.
we must suggest to the people in what hatred he still hath held them, that to's power he would have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms, holding them, in human action and capacity, of no more soul nor fitness for the world than ...
matrons flung gloves, ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchieves upon him as he pass'd.
the nobles bended, ay, as to jove's statue, and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts.
leave nothing out for length, and make us think rather our state's defective for requital than we to stretch it out.
masters o' the people, we do request your kindest ears, and after, your loving motion toward the common body, to yield what passes here.
most willingly, but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it.
he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow.
if it be, the man i speak of cannot in the world be singly counterpoised.
at sixteen years, when tarquin made a head for rome, he fought beyond the mark of others.
our then dictator, whom with all praise i point at, saw him fight, when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him.
he bestrid an o'er-press'd roman and i' the consul's view slew three opposers.
tarquin 's self he met, and struck him on his knee.
in that day's feats, when he might act the woman in the scene, he proved the best man i' the field, and for his meed was brow-bound with the oak.
and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport.
as weeds before a vessel under sail, so men obey'd and fell below his stem.
from face to foot he was a thing of blood, whose every motion was timed with dying cries.
alone he enter'd the mortal gate of the city, which he painted with shunless destiny.
when , by and by, the din of war gan pierce his ready sense, then straight his doubled spirit re-quicken 'd what in flesh was fatigate, and to the battle came he, where he did run reeking o'er the lives of men , as if 'twere a perpetual spoil.
and till we call'd both field and city ours, he never stood to ease his breast with panting.
our spoils he kick'd at, and look'd upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world.
he covets less than misery itself would give, rewards his deeds with doing them, and is content to spend the time to end it.
pray you , go fit you to the custom and take to you , as your predecessors have, your honour with your form.
it is a part that i shall blush in acting, and might well be taken from the people.
we recommend to you , tribunes of the people, our purpose to them, and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour.
once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
so, if he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them.
ingratitude is monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful, were to make a monster of the multitude, of the which we being members, should bring ourselves to be monstrous members.
and to make us no better thought of, a little help will serve, for once we stood up about the corn , he himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
we have been called so of many, not that our heads are some brown , some black, some abram, some bald, but that our wits are so diversely coloured.
- an 'twere to give again , but 'tis no matter.
pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul, i have here the...customary gown .
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love.
i will, sir, flatter my sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer estimation of them.
'tis a condition they account gentle, and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart, i will, sir, practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly.
that is, sir, i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers.
better it is to die, better to starve, than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
why in this wolvish toge should i stand here, to beg of hob and dick, that does appear, their needless vouches?
for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd, battles thrice six i have seen and heard of,
for your voices have done many things, some less, some more.
you have stood your limitation , and the tribunes endue you with the people's voice.
remains that, in the official marks invested, you anon do meet the senate.
he said he hath wounds, which he could show in private, and with his hat, thus waving it in scorn , "l would be consul," says he.
"aged custom, but by your voices, will not so permit me.
why...either were you ignorant to see't, or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness to yield your voices?
did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves, and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you , when he hath power to crush?
he had, my lord, and that it was which caused our swifter composition .
so then the volsces stand but as at first, ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road upon 's again .
the people cry you mock'd them, and of late, when corn was given them gratis, you repined.
scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
you show too much of that for which the people stir.
if you will pass to where you are bound, you must inquire your way, which you are out of, with a gentler spirit, or never be so noble as a consul, nor yoke with him for tribune.
i say again , in soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate the cockle of rebellion , insolence, sedition , which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd, and scatter'd, by mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that which they have given to beggars.
as for my country i have shed my blood, not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles, which we disdain should tetter us, yet sought the very way to catch them.
you speak o' the people, as if you were a god to punish, not a man of their infirmity.
were i as patient as the midnight sleep, by jove, 'twould be my mind!
it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is, not poison any further.
- though the people had more absolute power, i say, they nourish'd disobedience, and fed the ruin of the state.
why shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice?
this double worship, where one part does disdain with cause, the other insult without all reason , where gentry, title, wisdom, cannot conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance.
it must omit real necessities, and give way the while to unstable slightness.
let them not lick the sweet which is their poison .
your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should become't, not having the power to do the good it would, for the ill which doth control't.
or let us stand to our authority, or let us lose it.
we do here pronounce, upon the part o' the people, in whose power we were elected theirs,
do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt with modest warrant.
sir, how comes't that you have holp to make this rescue?
if, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people, i may be heard, i would crave a word or two, the which shall turn you to no further harm than loss of time.
speak briefly then , for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor, to eject him hence were but our danger, and to keep him here our certain death.
i have heard you say, honour and policy, like unsever'd friends, i' the war do grow together.
grant that, and tell me, in peace what each of them by the other lose,
if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not, which, for your best ends, you adopt your policy, how is it less or worse, that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour,
as in war, since that to both it stands in like request?
though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
now, this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words, which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood.
i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour.
i am in this, your wife, your son , these senators, the nobles, and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em, for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin .
i prithee now, my son , go to them, with thy bonnet in thy hand, and thus far having stretch'd it, here be with them.
this but done, even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours.
the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up the glasses of my sight!
i will not do't, lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body's action teach my mind a most inherent baseness.
assemble presently the people hither, and when they hear me say, "lt shall be so i' the right and strength o' the commons,"
be it either for death, for fine, or banishment, then let them if i say fine, cry "fine."
he hath been used ever to conquer, and to have his worth of contradiction .
being once chafed, he cannot be rein 'd again to temperance.
consider further, that when he speaks not like a citizen , you find him like a soldier.
do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds, but, as i say, such as become a soldier, rather than envy you .
let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death, vagabond exile, flaying, pent to linger but with a grain a day, i would not buy their mercy for the price of one fair word.
for that he has, as much as in him lies, from time to time envied against the people, seeking means to pluck away their power, as now at last given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence of dreaded justice, but on the ministers that do distribute it,
i have been consul, and can show for rome her enemies' marks upon me.
i do love my country's good with a respect more tender, more holy and profound, than mine own life, my dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase, and treasure of my loins.
your enemies, with nodding of their plumes, fan you into despair.
have the power still to banish your defenders, till at length your ignorance, which finds not till it feels, deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows.
thy tears are salter than a younger man 's, and venomous to thine eyes.
my sometime general, i have seen thee stern , and thou hast oft beheld heart-hardening spectacles.
tell these sad women 'tis fond to wail inevitable strokes, as 'tis to laugh at 'em.
to my mother, you wot well my hazards still have been your solace, and believe't not lightly... though i go alone, like to a lonely dragon , that his fen makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen ,
llll follow thee a month devise with thee where thou shalt rest, that thou shall hear of us and we of thee, so if the time thrust forth a cause for thy repeal, we shall not send o'er the vast world to seek a single man ,
and lose advantage, which doth ever cool i' the absence of the needer.
could i meet 'em but once a day, it would unclog my heart of what lies heavy to't.
you have told them home, and, by my troth, you have cause...
the main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again .
for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy coriolanus that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever.
shall within this hour, on a dissension of a doit, break out to bitterest enmity.
so, fellest foes, whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep, to take the one the other, by some chance, some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends...
not out of hope, mistake me not, to save my life, for if i had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world i would have 'voided thee.
but in mere...spite, to be full quit of those my banishers, stand i before thee here.
then , if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country, speed thee straight, and make my misery serve thy turn .
so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee, for l will fight against my canker'd country with the spleen of all the under-fiends.
but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes thou'rt tired, then , in a word, i also am longer to live most weary... ..and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice,
which not to cut would show thee but a fool, since i've ever follow'd thee with hate, drawn tuns of blood out from thy country's breast, and cannot live but to thy shame, unless it be to do thee...
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy.
if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things and say, "tis true,"
let me twine mine arms about that body... ..where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr'd the moon with splinters.
here i clip the anvil of my sword... ..and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love...
never man sigh'd truer breath, but that i see thee here, thou noble thing!
more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold.
thou hast beat me out twelve several times, and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me.
we have been down together in my sleep, unbuckling helms, fixing each other's throat, and...waked half-dead with nothing.
therefore, most absolute sir... ..if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges...
..take the one half of my commission ... ..and set down , as best thou art experienced, since thou know'st thy country's strength and weakness, thine own ways, whether to knock against the gates of rome,
here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well, who rather had, though they themselves did suffer by't, behold dissentious numbers pestering streets... (sighs)
..than see our tradesmen singing in their shops and going about their functions friendly.
worthy tribunes, there is a slave, whom we have put in prison , reports the volsces, with two several powers, are enter'd in the roman territories, and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before 'em.
'tis aufidius who, hearing of our marcius' banishment, thrusts forth his horns again into the world, which were inshell'd when marcius stood for rome, and durst not once peep out.
you have made good work, you and your apron -men , that stood so much on the voice of occupation and the breath of garlic-eaters!
all the regions do smilingly revolt, and who resist are mock'd for valiant ignorance and perish constant fools.
the tribunes cannot do't for shame, the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds.
for his best friends, if they should say, be good to rome, they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate, and therein show'd like enemies.
tullus aufidius, the second name of men , obeys his points as if he were his officer.
desperation is all the policy, strength and defence that rome can make against them.
he bears himself more proudlier, even to my person , than i thought he would when first i did embrace him.
yet his nature in that's no changeling, and i must excuse what cannot be amended.
yet i wish, sir... i mean for your particular, you had not join 'd in commission with him but either had borne the action of yourself, or else to him had left it solely.
i understand thee well, and be thou sure, when he shall come to his account, he knows not what i can urge against him.
although it seems, and so he thinks, and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly, and shows good husbandry for the volscian state, fights dragon -like, and does achieve as soon as draw his sword,
yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck.
the tribunes are no soldiers, and their people will be as rash in the repeal as hasty to expel him thence.
i think he'll be to rome as is the osprey to the fish, who takes it by sovereignty of nature.
whether 'twas pride, which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man ... ..whether defect of judgment, to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of, or whether nature..
..not to be other than one thing, not moving from the casque to the cushion , but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll'd the war, but one of these.
as he hath spices of them all, not all, for l dare so far free him... ..made him fear'd... ..so hated... ..and so banish'd.
but he has a merit to choke it in the utterance.
go, you that banish'd him, a mile before his tent fall down , and knee the way into his mercy.
nay, if he coy'd to hear cominius speak, i'll keep at home.
i minded him how royal 'twas to pardon when it was less expected.
he replied, it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish'd.
his answer to me was, he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome, musty chaff.
he said 'twas folly, for one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt, and still to nose the offence.
if you refuse your aid in this so never-needed help, yet do not upbraid's for... ..our distress.
but, sure, if you would be your country's pleader, your good tongue, more than the instant army we can make, might stop our countryman .
i was hardly moved to come to thee, but being assured that none but myself could move thee, i have been blown out of thy gates with sighs...
..and conjure thee to pardon rome... ..and thy petitionary countrymen .
is't possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man !
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly, yet your butterfly was a grub.
their latest refuge was to send him... ..for whose old love i have, though i show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd the first conditions, which they did refuse and cannot now accept.
to grace him only that thought he could do more, a very little i have yielded to.
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so.
(coriolanus thinks) like a dull actor now i have forgot my part and i am out even to a full disgrace
of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons.
o, stand up blest, whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint, i kneel before thee, and unproperly show duty, as mistaken all this while between the child and parent.
the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials.
bid me dismiss my soldiers or capitulate again with rome's mechanics.
think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither, since that thy sight, which should make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance with comforts, constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow,
making the mother, wife and child to see the son ... ..the father, the husband, tearing his country's bowels out.
alack, or we must lose the country, our dear nurse, or else thy person ... ..our comfort in the country.
we must find an evident calamity, though we had our wish which side should win .
for either thou must, as a foreign recreant, be led with manacles thorough our streets, or else triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin , and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and...children 's blood.
for myself, son , i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine.
thou know'st, great son , the end of war's uncertain ... ..but this certain , that, if thou conquer rome...
..the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name whose repetition shall be dogg'd with curses, whose chronicle thus writ,
thou hast never in thy life show'd thy dear mother any courtesy, when she, poor hen , fond of no second brood, has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home, loaden with honour.
say my request's unjust and spurn me back, but if it be not so, thou art not honest, and the gods will plague thee that thou restrain 'st from me the duty which to a mother's part belongs.
he came unto my hearth, presented to my knife his throat.
i took him, made him joint-servant with me, gave him way in all his own desires, nay, let him choose out of my ranks, his projects to accomplish, my best and freshest men , served his designments in mine own person ,
holp to reap the fame which he did end all his... ..and took some pride to do myself this wrong...
..till, at the last, i seem'd his follower, and not partner... ..and he waged me with his countenance, as if i had been mercenary.
so he did my lord the army marvell 'd at it
and in the last when he had carried rome and that we look'd for no lss spoil than glory
you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome.
our spoils we have brought home doth more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action .
we have made... with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans, and here deliver, subscribed by the consuls and patricians, together with the seal o' the senate, what we have compounded on .
read it not, noble lords... ..but tell the traitor in the high'st degree he hath abused your powers.
dost thou think i'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name coriolanus, ln corioli?
you lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously he has betray'd your business, and given up, for certain drops of salt, your city rome.
i say, your city to his wife... ..and mother, breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk, never admitting counsels o' the war, but at his nurse's tears he whined and roar'd away your victory...
..that pages blush'd at him and men of heart look'd wondering each at other.
pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever i was forced to scold.
your judgments, my grave lords, must give this cur the lie.
corrado cattani replaces the murdered lnspector and moves to sicily with wife else and daughter paola.
investigating his predecessor's death, corrado meets titti, the junkie daughter of the suicide noblewoman and gradually falls for her.
his marriage to else has been on the rocks for a while.
titti tells corrado that cirinna, a heroin trafficker, killed her mother and lnspector marineo.
titti, fearful of cirinna and dependent on the drugs he gives her, didn't dare report him to the police.
corrado won't use her testimony to avoid vendettas against her and decides to provoke cirinna who out of frustration sets an ambush for him.
i want to check all entries for the past 3 years including drafts and personal cheques.
then we'll see if this prosecutor is simply a wary man or rather, a dishonest, wary man.
let's strike the mafiosi wherever they are but let's not involve the innocent.
i'm not saying this town is clean, but we run the risk of tarnishing everyone.
if i granted your request, i'm sure you'd find something, but what about the innocent people?
honest working people who'd suddenly be maligned and in the glare of the press?
loyalty towards the rights of the individual and the right of society to be defended.
fine words, but tell me, are you refusing to authorise a bank audit of these people?
we can hit even harder if you'll help me persuade our prosecutor to audit the accounts of certain people.
a prominent banker, irreproachable professionals industrialists, and a famous lawyer are directly and indirectly the financiers and beneficiaries of an important drug ring.
you'll be responsible for the social unrest that might arise from hasty actions so you must stop him in time.
that fellow can have fun arresting petty criminals but he mustn't touch the banks.
an amount is taken out and goes to form a new so-called "lung" account because it fills and empties very quickly.
but out of a love of nature, we'll call it "jasmine".
so, once the deal is done, the amount goes into a new "lung" account, which we'll call "poppy".
part of the profit goes to the bank, but the most substantial amount goes back to replenish the accounts of the single financiers with 1 00% profit.
and i also speak french, but i'm not part of the jet set.
i'm here in this hole, defending my interests from 6am to 8pm!
oppressed by all possible privileges and mistress of a vulgar hoodlum.
you think you can free her from her habit but i'll bet everything that you'll fail.
for us, power will be the weapon against corruption, bureacracy, parasites... all that is rotten, including the mafia... whose criminal links pollute the sun of your beautiful sicily.
you see, lnspector, when one is as honest as you, intelligent, and one loves one's country, everything becomes simple and the path becomes obvious.
forged endorsements released funds for the financiers and those that vanished in rome, naples, milan, turin... processed by bogus companies headed by reckless bankers, international traffickers, and maybe political organisations.
but the largest slice stays in town and ends up in terrasini's account.
instead of guessing matches, we must guess who'll be the first in town to be shot by persons unknown!
and in our parts, when there's an upstart who stirs things up, somehow, there's always someone who'll silence him.
your blood pressure's high, and at this stage of your pregnancy, that's not good.
but we'll get it down, and the swelling along with it.
we've thought about that, but we still intend to go ahead with the divorce.
jeff, i know there must be differences between you two, but i know you both.
so you're on your way to that charity whatever, and i'm on my way down to the gym, unless you want me to stick around and take a couple more orders from that creep.
mark, i told mr. dexter that i would not tolerate any repetition of that fight.
in fact, i consider myself somebody vey special as far as you're concerned.
the fact that i gave you that necklace you're wearing, and the fact that you accepted it, should prove that.
those croissants are cying for you to take one of them.
i'd like to discuss business, if you don't mind, not food.
but i don't want him to push me around when i'm tying to do something that's special and beautiful.
we are talking about the new annex for la mirage and its cost, aren't we?
and that's fine, as long as he's dealing with his own money.
but when he begins to ty to influence you, now, that's another thing.
kirby, why did you ignore what the doctor said, to stay in bed?
ever since that night that we were together, and this baby was conceived... lt wasn't meant to be.
you see, i've gone over the plans and the cost sheets personally.
when i discovered tens of thousands of dollars being wasted on frivolities, i think that's a bit much.
but i'm also a father, and i'm putting the safety of my child first.
steven, may i remind you that it was i who suggested that you and claudia move out of your apartment and into a perfectly beautiful duplex here?
darling, this is an apartment hotel with room service whenever you need it.
no matter what you call it, this is a building, not a home with guarded grounds and a security staff.
around the clubhouse turn, ít's soused agaín ín front, wíth allegree followíng ín second.

when you're finished doing what you're doing, just clean it up.
because i only have a secretary, and she's a little annoyed right now, okay.
a person who is sick has to get well before he can be normal, right?
so, when jack finishes his... sleeping around everywhere, and he wants to assume his responsibilities, he wants to be a real father to debbie, he can see her.
do you think we should see each other again or what?
i'd like for us to be friends, if you want a friend.
here are the keys to my car, and you go down to... you go down to... out of the driveway, turn right, go down right again, then you hit ventura.
and there's a big shopping center down there and you can't miss it.
well listen, i'm the guy that got sick all over your house.
i thought i'd come over and have a drink with you and thank you.
ya know, with kids i don't think you can do the right thing.
i mean, you always think you know just what's suppose to be, and...
you really need some... living thing that you can love, robert.
it could be just a little animal that you could take care of and kiss and sleep with.
her eyes are not responding the way i'd like them to, and her neck is stiff.
now, you can do what you want, but i'd like you to get her to see somebody if it's not me.
and she comes up to you, she's infatuated with you, she always wants to tell you her secrets, she volunteers them.
and she says: "i've done some nude modeling", you know, so the delicate balance of that relationship won't break.
if you're in love with someone and the woman keeps the secret,
doesn't give it to you, doesn't offer it to you, then that part of her is always dead to you.

in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
that's just the kind of cynical resistance... to child-like wonder that's held man back for centuries.
we were looking for vehicles with lots of horsepower, big wheels.
we were lucky to get out of there without getting our heads blown off.
we have located the planet... where this garbageous material is emanating, colonel.
even as we speak, driscoll is being whisked to scenic l.a... to talk his little heart out.
the cops have enough on those guys to make them ancient history.
our interstellar predecessors... have told us that in moments such as these... we should have cooked bread.
that is their quaint way of telling us to have a toast.

i'm the long-time distributor of films by werner herzog who is sitting next to me
we are watching "where the green ants dream", a film made in 1984
similar tornados exist in australia, of course, in the north, in darwin, in derby and in other places
shortly before we started shooting here in '84, these places were completely destroyed
this place, coober pedy, is south of the geographical centre of australia
what we see here are huge fields where people used to dig for opals.
you can see that nature has always played a big role here
"fata morgana" probably had some influence on how landscape, desolate landscape is viewed
educated people started to realise that this was a question regarding their own identity, of how they were dealing with the aborigines, and of how they were dealing with their history
after this case several other cases came to court that were won, in large part, by aborigines
it's a strange situation because the film starts with such a strange calmness
usually in hollywood you'd start with a big action scene, which develops into a story
it's not very contemporary in the way it was directed and in how the story is told
i also think it's interesting that it's structured like a documentary
and as always, i cast some of my friends that happened to show up
to me it sounds funny to hear the film dubbed in german
they only spoke english and that's why the film seems to have a weird, quality to the translation when you see it in german
that's ray barrett who usually plays bad-tempered characters in australian films
we should say to the listeners that it's great to hear the english version, which is included on the dvd
i think you need the kind of cockney accent that this bad-tempered guy has
what i'm interested in is the repetition of some of the imagery
here we see all those construction machines, which i believe i have seen in some of your other films
the aborigines that you come across in the australian outback have lost their social structures
they have huge problems with alcoholism up in alice springs, which is roughly the geographical centre of australia
we discussed with them in great detail what we were doing, and to what extent i could invent my own mythology
the green ants mythology does have similarities to aboriginal mythology, but it has been partly invented by me
dreams and dream time are very complex religious and cultural aboriginal concepts that are hermeticai and almost inconceivable to us
these days there are lots of new age people hanging around who believe they can experience that, too
this is, well, the luddite theme, the contradiction between continuity and daily life, or machines and technology.
that's a theme that comes up a lot in your work
yes, but here in australia it was an open and almost daily conflict
it was nearly part of their daily lives, at least during that time
that's how we knew each other and i knew that he had class, he was...
miliritbi is the name of the case against nabalco, i think
strangely enough, this righteous tone seeps through and i can't stand it anymore today
that's the only thing i don't like about the film now
there were 60 different languages in australia when i was there, that were becoming extinct because they are only spoken by a few people now
when the last person of a tribe dies and his language dies with him we experience a huge cultural loss that's irreparable
it's worse than if a kind of grapevine snail dies because a dam is being built
and that is and always has been my criticism of the green movement that rightfully demands certain things from our civilisation today
but by doing that it's missing a big part of the picture
maybe we should get back to this aboriginal guy who appears in court and who is dumb, even though he speaks his own language
they also had good control over the younger men that you can see here
they always wanted to go to the liquor store and they demanded that we provide them with a tv on location, for the evenings, a tv and a video recorder
alexander von humboldt wouldn't have liked this at all, saying that something like this is sacrilege!
but that's how it is and what we see here is one of the...
that has become the norm today when dealing with land rights issues with aborigines
therefore, some of these communities are much better off financially now
one should say that a certain part of the population, intelligent people, university students, morally active people, have achieved many good things
how does this differ from american politics in terms of issues relating to native reservations?
for them it's important that somewhere in the arctic new sources of oil can be found and forests can be deforested
questions that concern the native people, the north american indians, are being ignored
what's being said here is a metaphor of a train that is speeding towards a collapsed bridge and in this train you can only walk backward to the last carriage
one can say that the film is full of great ironic comments about colonisation
our set designer, ulrich bergfelder, made many things for our accommodation
he was a very important member of our crew and went on to work on important projects with me later on
but the mathematician klein proved that there is an object that has an inside but no outside
then there's the question of how many points you'd need in the universe to be able to get to a stable position
another question i asked myself earlier was, what you would have done, if you have ever thought about it, if you didn't live in the 20th or 21 st century and film didn't exist?
how would you have employed your talent to explore, with what means?
i was living with a friend and colleague, paul cox whose films i had starred in a few times
there's the weird incident in the lift that i really like
i do believe there was something special about the way that this film was received by the audience
i had made "fitzcarraldo" prior to this film and before that a few very difficult films
people were expecting me to break some kind of endurance record, that this will be even more spectacular, that i'd make an even bigger movie, shot in all of australia
or that i'd, i don't know, shoot a film on k2
up one mountain on one route and then down on a different route
and up the next mountain and down again using a different route
i had a big story that was strange and difficult to make
three days after i got there and had walked past k2 i realised it was impossible, so i cancelled the project
it's this sort of prevailing tone that i don't like anymore
it would have been so easy to avoid it, but it's done and i have to live with it
that's true but none of my films represent an actual era
you wouldn't recognise that a film is from the end of the '60's, or the from the beginning of the '80's
it's a plane that they really want, for reasons that are still unknown to us at this moment
but later we find out that this is the big green ant for them, the winged ant which is flying away across the sky
there are young people sniffing glue and other things, like fumes or alcohol
unfortunately that's a problem of many primitive people who have been abruptly thrown into a civilisation that is thousands of years ahead in its technical and organisational development
i went to alaska to shoot something and you can see the same thing
or bushmen in the kalahari desert in the south of africa
there is a possibility that things will improve a bit in australia
but a lot of the aborigines have been culturally sucked into a civilisation that originated in england
i wanted to have hundreds of thousands of ants that were all facing one direction, like filings
we were doing tests for months and tried to cool the ants down so that they became practically immobile
we wouldn't have had enough money to build a new runway but...
the guy who just got up in his cowboy hat gets more important from now on
you can see him on the right, wearing the checked shirt
that's gary williams, who was a very important man during that time in the aboriginal political movement
he's a great photographer, quite apart from the fact that he's also a great director
while i was staying with paul cox, i also got to know...
i found out who the publisher was and called them, but chatwin was doing research for his book, "songlines", in the australian outback
i said that i'd like to meet him and left my phone number.
shortly afterwards i got a call and was told that if i phoned a number in port augusta i'd reach him
i called him and he said, "wow, you're the one with the films!"
he always carried a leather bag with five of six books and one of the books was "of walking in ice", which i'd written
he was on his way to sydney and then back to london and i said to him, "why don't you come to melbourne instead?"
by the way, it was quite difficult to get the australian air force to lend us this plane for us to use it for this film
we negotiated for a long time, but everything worked out in the end
i think it's interesting because the film becomes british all of a sudden
well, the australian judicial system is based on the british one
he started making a film during that time in nicaragua called, "ballad of the little soldier"
denis reichle, another great friend of mine was having some problems with the film
i like it that it's filmed like a traditional court room drama and that it actually works
this expert here, for example, is much more believable than in hollywood movies
six or seven aborigine languages, as well as english and some dutch, i think
a lot of the aborigines grow up bilingual because in traditional communities, children grow up in a moitié, the family half that is their mother's side and usually the mother belongs to a different tribe and speaks a different language
this was actually a very important legal point, the way hearsay is allowed as evidence in trials like this one
there was a famous case from the gold coast, which is ghana today
i was interested in people in australia who were the last, the only, definitely the sole speakers of their language, the last of their tribe
i had met a man in port augusta, in the south of australia, who was living in a nursing home
he was called "the mute one" by the nursing home staff
he could say three words in english, but that was all
nobody could talk to him and he couldn't talk to anybody, because nobody spoke his language anymore
i'm sure he was over 80 years old and the only thing he was looking for was some kind of contact
so he always went to the coke vending machine, throwing in one coin after another, and listened to the sound of the falling coins
when the coke cans fell out of the machine, they made a clunking noise
but he didn't pick them up, so all cans fell on top of one another
he listened to those sounds like they were some kind of dialogue
during the night the carers in the nursing home opened the vending machine, took out all the coins, put the coke cans back and put the coins back into the guy's pocket without him noticing
this was so that he could start again the next day
during the case, there were objects shown that were taboo and weren't really recordable as evidence in anglo-saxon law
that's a very similar tone to the closing words of the judge in the court case, nabalco versus miliritbi
it's probably more pleasant to watch today than at the time
the guy on the right is one of the brutes from "mad max"
and with this film it was very delicate and difficult in general, i always knew that
with all your films the original language is a very... important aspect
would you say this film brought about some change in you, which caused you to move on and do further things?
i think it's wrong to say this was only a practice run
but there were already quite a few projects that were in the pipeline
for example, in the same year i shot "the dark glow of the mountains" in the karakorum, and in nicaragua "ballad of the little soldier"
i edited them and did the sound in less than three months
i'm half finished with another film and i've just published a book of prose called, "the conquest of futility"
there was always something that i needed to get off my chest
and it's become a film on a screen or you can get the dvd and put it somewhere in your shelf
and again, it conveys the same kind of mood as when my mother died
that's part of the film, and such images and the soundtrack are for me a direct translation of, "my mother is gone"
you wouldn't expect a scene like that in such a film
it's strange how he stops, but the camera stays fixed on him
here it looks good, but it's only possible... with those faces
it's only possible with that mysterious background and the incomprehension on our part
i never actually thought about it but the atmosphere is familiar
do you sometimes think about these images and what they mean to you?
i can't really explain today, 20 years later what this image means
but it's perfectly in tune with the rest of the film
the people working in the opal mines just dug those holes and piled up the soil and the sand
you can see what has been going on there for the last 20 years
but then people would say we had reached the letter f and the tornado would have to be called "fergie", or something like that by the meteorologists
and that would have been the end, but i changed my mind
i'm the long-time distributor of films by werner herzog who is sitting next to me
we are watching "where the green ants dream", a film made in 1984
similar tornados exist in australia, of course, in the north, in darwin, in derby and in other places
shortly before we started shooting here in '84, these places were completely destroyed
this place, coober pedy, is south of the geographical centre of australia
what we see here are huge fields where people used to dig for opals.
you can see that nature has always played a big role here
"fata morgana" probably had some influence on how landscape, desolate landscape is viewed
educated people started to realise that this was a question regarding their own identity, of how they were dealing with the aborigines, and of how they were dealing with their history
after this case several other cases came to court that were won, in large part, by aborigines
it's a strange situation because the film starts with such a strange calmness
usually in hollywood you'd start with a big action scene, which develops into a story
it's not very contemporary in the way it was directed and in how the story is told
i also think it's interesting that it's structured like a documentary
and as always, i cast some of my friends that happened to show up
to me it sounds funny to hear the film dubbed in german
they only spoke english and that's why the film seems to have a weird, quality to the translation when you see it in german
that's ray barrett who usually plays bad-tempered characters in australian films
we should say to the listeners that it's great to hear the english version, which is included on the dvd
i think you need the kind of cockney accent that this bad-tempered guy has
what i'm interested in is the repetition of some of the imagery
here we see all those construction machines, which i believe i have seen in some of your other films
the aborigines that you come across in the australian outback have lost their social structures
they have huge problems with alcoholism up in alice springs, which is roughly the geographical centre of australia
we discussed with them in great detail what we were doing, and to what extent i could invent my own mythology
the green ants mythology does have similarities to aboriginal mythology, but it has been partly invented by me
dreams and dream time are very complex religious and cultural aboriginal concepts that are hermeticai and almost inconceivable to us
these days there are lots of new age people hanging around who believe they can experience that, too
this is, well, the luddite theme, the contradiction between continuity and daily life, or machines and technology.
that's a theme that comes up a lot in your work
yes, but here in australia it was an open and almost daily conflict
it was nearly part of their daily lives, at least during that time
that's how we knew each other and i knew that he had class, he was...
miliritbi is the name of the case against nabalco, i think
strangely enough, this righteous tone seeps through and i can't stand it anymore today
that's the only thing i don't like about the film now
there were 60 different languages in australia when i was there, that were becoming extinct because they are only spoken by a few people now
when the last person of a tribe dies and his language dies with him we experience a huge cultural loss that's irreparable
it's worse than if a kind of grapevine snail dies because a dam is being built
and that is and always has been my criticism of the green movement that rightfully demands certain things from our civilisation today
but by doing that it's missing a big part of the picture
maybe we should get back to this aboriginal guy who appears in court and who is dumb, even though he speaks his own language
they also had good control over the younger men that you can see here
they always wanted to go to the liquor store and they demanded that we provide them with a tv on location, for the evenings, a tv and a video recorder
alexander von humboldt wouldn't have liked this at all, saying that something like this is sacrilege!
but that's how it is and what we see here is one of the...
that has become the norm today when dealing with land rights issues with aborigines
therefore, some of these communities are much better off financially now
one should say that a certain part of the population, intelligent people, university students, morally active people, have achieved many good things
how does this differ from american politics in terms of issues relating to native reservations?
for them it's important that somewhere in the arctic new sources of oil can be found and forests can be deforested
questions that concern the native people, the north american indians, are being ignored
what's being said here is a metaphor of a train that is speeding towards a collapsed bridge and in this train you can only walk backward to the last carriage
one can say that the film is full of great ironic comments about colonisation
our set designer, ulrich bergfelder, made many things for our accommodation
he was a very important member of our crew and went on to work on important projects with me later on
but the mathematician klein proved that there is an object that has an inside but no outside
then there's the question of how many points you'd need in the universe to be able to get to a stable position
another question i asked myself earlier was, what you would have done, if you have ever thought about it, if you didn't live in the 20th or 21 st century and film didn't exist?
how would you have employed your talent to explore, with what means?
i was living with a friend and colleague, paul cox whose films i had starred in a few times
there's the weird incident in the lift that i really like
i do believe there was something special about the way that this film was received by the audience
i had made "fitzcarraldo" prior to this film and before that a few very difficult films
people were expecting me to break some kind of endurance record, that this will be even more spectacular, that i'd make an even bigger movie, shot in all of australia
or that i'd, i don't know, shoot a film on k2
up one mountain on one route and then down on a different route
and up the next mountain and down again using a different route
i had a big story that was strange and difficult to make
three days after i got there and had walked past k2 i realised it was impossible, so i cancelled the project
it's this sort of prevailing tone that i don't like anymore
it would have been so easy to avoid it, but it's done and i have to live with it
that's true but none of my films represent an actual era
you wouldn't recognise that a film is from the end of the '60's, or the from the beginning of the '80's
it's a plane that they really want, for reasons that are still unknown to us at this moment
but later we find out that this is the big green ant for them, the winged ant which is flying away across the sky
there are young people sniffing glue and other things, like fumes or alcohol
unfortunately that's a problem of many primitive people who have been abruptly thrown into a civilisation that is thousands of years ahead in its technical and organisational development
i went to alaska to shoot something and you can see the same thing
or bushmen in the kalahari desert in the south of africa
there is a possibility that things will improve a bit in australia
but a lot of the aborigines have been culturally sucked into a civilisation that originated in england
i wanted to have hundreds of thousands of ants that were all facing one direction, like filings
we were doing tests for months and tried to cool the ants down so that they became practically immobile
we wouldn't have had enough money to build a new runway but...
the guy who just got up in his cowboy hat gets more important from now on
you can see him on the right, wearing the checked shirt
that's gary williams, who was a very important man during that time in the aboriginal political movement
he's a great photographer, quite apart from the fact that he's also a great director
while i was staying with paul cox, i also got to know...
i found out who the publisher was and called them, but chatwin was doing research for his book, "songlines", in the australian outback

i called him and he said, "wow, you're the one with the films!"
he always carried a leather bag with five of six books and one of the books was "of walking in ice", which i'd written
he was on his way to sydney and then back to london and i said to him, "why don't you come to melbourne instead?"
by the way, it was quite difficult to get the australian air force to lend us this plane for us to use it for this film

a lot of the aborigines grow up bilingual because in traditional communities, children grow up in a moitié, the family half that is their mother's side and usually the mother belongs to a different tribe and speaks a different language
this was actually a very important legal point, the way hearsay is allowed as evidence in trials like this one
there was a famous case from the gold coast, which is ghana today
i was interested in people in australia who were the last, the only, definitely the sole speakers of their language, the last of their tribe

and that would have been the end, but i changed my mind
i was working on the balcony in the fresh air, when i saw, walking under the trees nearby...
when i saw, walking under the trees nearby, an elegant young man, who humbly bowed as soon as he saw me.
it's more the end of an era, because cinema accompanies everything else.
it is very difficult to make a dumb film, especially when you have a voice inside, saying that cinema is better than that.
this is why i want to play nicolas, the main character of "the possessed".
he is ice cold, he's the vice, the cynicism, the intelligence personified, and...
this is why dostoyevsky's book was banned in eastern european countries.
that's why we live in the shadows and in the continuity of what is there.
your son's good soul is holding the simple conscience of the world.
and my father, steeped in pity, even in his very posture.
tomorrow, don't forget to use some white pencil above the eyelashes.
no powder on the temples, it makes your eyes smaller, makes you look stubborn.
you would come with me if i was deformed, destitute and limping, with no legs.
the problem is that if i had no legs we could not walk together.
i don't want you to play each scene, i want you to act your part!
i've seen actors playing each scene amazingly, like the branches of a tree.
if you think that everything can be found in life, such as love, lies, and cheating, then you can't play your part.
love isn't just physical, fear isn't only being afraid of the big bad wolf!
and show me that there is a huge spider inside the wardrobe, as big as a man.
and we will spend the rest of our lives, staring at it, terrified.
nicolas was appointed by the central committee, which i also belong to.
i am leaving to visit the other group as soon as you have started.

his grace has always let known his love and understanding of french culture.
as usual, his grace schlapas refused to answer journalists' questions, and to all of those concerning his elevation to cardinal.
the camera operator was close enough to capture the exact moment of the murder.
this footage makes it possible to identify the murderer, who fled.
watch carefully, we have studied each frame and have enlarged the footage.
to the left, you can clearly see the weapon and the murderer's hand.
the police hope that these blurred images will help the investigation.
some suggested that the group who took over lithuania in 1940 are responsible.
his grace schlapas was due to return home the day after tomorrow.
if only i had guessed that you were hiding here with this genius.
how can you help her go back there, when you're a director here?
i won a prize at the karlovy vary festival in czechoslovakia.

it took firemen more than twenty minutes to extract the body of the driver, who was killed instantly.
this incident is bringing new light on the investigation into the murder of his grace schlapas, which took place a few days ago in paris.
the victim of the car accident is a czech dissident, milan mliska.
a note was found on his body, claiming that he was the archbishop's murderer.

the letter is leading them to consider that mliska had mental health issues.
it appears that he was trying to bring attention to prisoner conditions.
you were on the cover of p. match, jours de france and elle.
then he walks past the building, inside, two guys are arguing.
those two guys were producers, and he didn't even know that cinema exists...
and each time, i would curtsey back, looking at him intensely.
if the night hadn't come, i would still be standing there, refusing that he might think me less courteous than he.
i think it's more the end of an era, because cinema accompanies everything else, like a small drum.
it is very difficult to make a dumb film, especially when you have a voice inside, whispering to you that cinema is better than that.
this is why i want to play nicolas, the main character of "the possessed".
he is ice cold, he's the vice, the cynicism, the intelligence personified, and--

and no powder on the temples, it makes your eyes seem smaller. lt makes you look stubborn.
you need to project the light towards us, not the other way around.
