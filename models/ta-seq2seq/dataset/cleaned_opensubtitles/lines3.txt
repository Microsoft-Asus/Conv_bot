ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things.
congressman sam albert, how do we draw the line-- draw the line... between protection of national security... obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data... and the protection of civil liberties, particularly the sanctity of my home?
but this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.
and you and i know what the average citizen does not:
i've got three major employers in the syracuse area alone... who are gonna get just killed by this bill.
i promise to get you funds equal to... or greater than whatever those companies gave your last campaign.
now we got pintero's goons... down there tuning up my people.
well, first off, that's a hobbs act violation, probably a rico.
- but then larry cash came in and he went after 'em.
- larry cash is in the hospital with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney.
besides, these people have families that are living through this every day.
hey, julie, can we send a case of chianti over to larry cash?
brill's note said that... this is the videotape you need to convince pintero with.
and watch out for the f.b. i brill says the place is under surveillance.
it contains a motion-activated... digital video camera with a compound lens.
it was aimed directly at the boat ramp across the lake.
- thirty months in a federal penitentiary... at marion, illinois, for a g.v.h. - 1... on your gunnery sergeant... what's that about?
the guy was an asshole, sir, and he deserved it, if you'll excuse me.
you may be able to see it here, being removed in the background.
now, fire and police officials aren't saying much at this point.
you may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition.
homicide investigators have told me that they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
i was going to, but she's too busy yelling at the tv.
oh, well there goes the fourth amendment... what's left of it.
honey, i think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us, and half the people on the block.
tens of millions of foreign nationals living within our borders, and many of these people consider the united states their enemy.
eric, just call me in the morning when you want me to come pick you up.
you know, if you decide you want to stay at dylars... till the end of the weekend or the end of the century, your mom and i have discussed it.
- well, her deposits aren't the same, but let me figure this out.
oh, yes, they're exactly... exactly 15% of the amount dean withdrew.
- we're not here to talk about the accident, mr. dean.
- i'm sorry, i thought you said... we should apologize for the confusion, sir.
it's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry.
it turns out mr. zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme.
it's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing fiel
dears got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it.
we'd have the police and the f.b. i all over this in 24 hours.
put taps on his 20 most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life.
i want to know about his wife, i want to know about his parents,
i want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals.
i want to use every means possible to get what we need.
because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life.
i just got off the phone with a source that i trust.
a grand jury is being convened to look into your labor practice... as far back as the electrical workers' strike.
ilove my wife, and i love my son... absolutely, with no equivocations, and that's none of your fuckir business either.
uh, we think that you should take a leave of absence... until we're able to, uh, sort all this out.
actually, i believe the slur "shyster" is generally reserved... for jewish attorneys.
i believe the proper slur for someone like myself... would be, uh, "eggplant. "
but this is not the time for the "i told you so" speech.
that day when daniel zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running.
these are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition.
can we take a look at this guy who's helping him?
any of a hundred key words, the computer recognizes it, automatically records it, red flags it for analysis; that was 20 years ago.
you know the hubble telescope that looks up to the stars?
in the old days, we actually had to tap a wire into your phone line.
now calls bouncir around on satellite, they snatch right out of the air.
you think i wanted that idiot to put that goddamn disk... who gives a fuck what you wanted?
since you've shown up, rachel's dead and the n.s.a.'s onto me.
the president has not committed himself, but he does recognize that we do need something in this area.
and i think he will come to see that this bill will, in the end, provide the kind of security that this...
i want to know who authorized its use, who checked it out from inventory, and for what purpose.
most important, how on god's green earth... it got into congressman albert's hotel room.
if this was a legit op, and i can't possibly see how it coul be, then so be it.
but if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream, then that somebody is going to prison.
to be safe, they'll try to scan all the frequencies... to try to track you down.
if these guys are good, and they're probably very good, in a location like this, they'll have you in five, six minutes.
ten-year-ols go on the net, downloading encryption we can barely break, not to mention instructions on how to make a low-yiel nuclear device.
privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it.
they let brill go, you take the tape home, everyone has a merry christmas.
what assurances do i have that you haven't copied that tape?
i don't care who bangs who... what cabinet officers get stoned.
but this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.
and now, uh... now we got pintero's goons down there tuning up my people.
well, first off, that's a hobbs act violation, probably a rico.
um, no, it would take years to see that thing through.
besides, these people have families that are living through this every day.
this accident comes at a very untimely juncture... since the congressman was working on a controversial piece of legislation, dale... opposing the telecommunications security and privacy act.
fire officials do tell me that it appears the congressman... was by himself in the car.
in fact, the congressman endured open-heart surgery just a couple of years ago.
homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
i'm standing by live at the lockraven reservoir... right now, where police and fire officials are in the process of removing... a classic mercedes owned by republican congressman phillip hamersly.
you may be able to see it here, being removed in the background.
i have been told that the congressman... was alone in the vehicle when this accident happened just under an hour ago.
you may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition.
and i speculate here... may have suffered a heart attack before going into the lockraven reservoir.
i am also told that there was no one in the car with him at the time of the...
- you know, bobby, i think you should take this more seriously.
honey, i think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us... and half the people on the block.
eric, just call me in the morning when you want me to come pick you up.
you know, if you decide you want to stay at dylan's till the end of the weekend... or the end of the century, your mom and i have discussed it.
- well, her deposits aren't the same, but let me figure this out.
ah, yes, they're exactly... exactly 15 percent of the amount dean withdrew.
i've seen killers walk free because the eyewitness was an alcoholic.
i've seen sex offenders that couldn't be touched because the victim was a call girl.
dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it; and when he does, i want his credibility.
i want people to know he's lying before they hear what he says.
we'd have the police and the fbi all over this in 24 hours.
put taps on his 20 most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life.
i want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals.
i want to use every means possible to get what we need... because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life.
i just got off the phone with a source that i trust.
a grand jury is being convened to look into your labour practise... as far back as the electrical workers' strike.
all right, we're moving into phase two of the training op.
selb's gonna brief you on it, so listen up, all right?
actually, i believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved for jewish attorneys.
i believe the proper slur for someone like myself... would be, uh, "eggplant."
but this is not the time for the "i told you so" speech.
that day when daniel zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running.
in the old days, we actually had to tap a wire into your phone line.
now calls bouncing off satellites, they snatch 'em right out of the air.
so, we were helping the secret police supply weapons... to the afghani rebels fighting the soviets.
my partner and i were on the eastern border monitoring soviet military transmissions.
the idea always was that if one of us got out, he'd take care of the other's family.
rachel was all he had, so she became my promise to him.
now, to be safe, they'll also try... to scan all the frequencies to try to track you down.
now, if these guys are good, and they're probably very good, in a location like this... they'll have you in five, six minutes.
does everybody here know that you killed phil hamersly and rachel banks?
this guy is going down, and he's going to take all of you with him.
ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things.
congressman sam albert, how do we draw the line... draw the line... between protection of national security... obviously the government's need to obtain intelligence data... and the protection of civil liberties, particularly the sanctity of my home?
but this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.
and you and i know what the average citizen does not:
i've got three major employers... in the syracuse area alone who are gonna get just killed by this bill.
i promise to get you funds equal to or greater than... whatever those companies gave your last campaign.
look, everybody knows... that, that the mob has been controlling these guys since, since as long as i can remember.
and now, uh... now we got pintero's goons down there tuning up my people.
- but then larry cash came in and he went after 'em.
- uh, larry cash is in the hospital... with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney.
besides, these people have families that are living through this every day.
hey, julie, can we send a case of chianti over to larry cash?
i would like my clients to be able to exercise their constitutional rights.
and if that happens, that tape will disappear forever into my private collection... along with the zapruder film and the porno from hitler's bunker.
it contains a motion-activated... digital video camera with a compound lens.
it was aimed directly at the boat ramp across the lake.
you may be able to see it here, being removed in the background.
now, fire and police officials aren't saying much at this point.
you may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition.
homicide investigators have told me that they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
zavitz is speaking to a lenny bloom... a former anti-war activist.
he publishes a variety of left-wing newsletters on various political subjects.
i was going to, but she's too busy yelling at the tv.
oh, well, there goes the fourth amendment... what's left of it.
honey, i think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us... and half the people on the block.
tens of millions of foreign nationals living within our borders... and many of these people consider the united states their enemy.
you know, if you decide you want to stay at dylan's till the end of the weekend... or the end of the century, your mom and i have discussed it.
it'll be difficult initially, but we think we can live with it.
it's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry.
um, it turns out mr zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme.
it's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field.
dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it; and when he does, i want his credibility.
i want to know about his wife, i want to know about his parents...
i want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals.
i love my wife, and i love my son absolutely... with no equivocations, and that's none of your fuckin' business either!
uh, we think that you should take a leave of absence... until we're able to, uh, sort all this out.
well, because first, you haven't told him who made the tape... and second, we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars... on shyster lawyers just like you... because of shyster lawyers just like you.
actually, i believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved for jewish attorneys.
rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess?
from the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart.
the national security agency conducts worldwide surveillance... fax, phones, satellite communication.
they're the only ones in the country, including the military, who could possibly have anything like this.
you stay away from rachel and you stay away from me.
you come near either one of us, i'm gonna kill you.
- how you just gonna go through my stuff like that?
baby, until i actually give it to you, that's still mine.
- look, i-i have a question i need to ask you... and it is absolutely imperative that you tell me the truth.
now, no matter what you say, i swear to you, you are not going to get in trouble.
these are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition.
can we take a look at this guy who's helping him?
you know the hubble telescope that looks up at the stars?
they've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us.
the, uh, president has not committed himself... but he does recognize that we do need something in this area.
and i think he will come to see that this bill will, in the end... provide the kind of security that this...
- might be able to piggyback it on top of this.
- how the hell am i supposed to know what it is?
i want to know who authorized its use... who checked it out from inventory... and for what purpose.
most important, how on god's green earth... it got into congressman albert's hotel room.
if this was a legit op... and i can't possibly see how it could be, then so be it.
but if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream... then that somebody is going to prison.
now, if these guys are good, and they're probably very good, in a location like this... they'll have you in five, six minutes.
so let's say in four minutes time, after you turn that tape on... regardless of what's happening, you get out that door.
now we've got ten million crackpots out there with sniper scopes, sarin gas and c-4.
ten-year-olds go on the net, downloading encryption we can barely break, not to mention...
privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it.
the only privacy that's left is the inside of your head, and maybe that's enough.

i want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals.
i just got off the phone with a source that i trust.
a grand jury is being convened to look into your labour practise... as far back as the electrical workers' strike.
i love my wife, and i love my son absolutely... with no equivocations, and that's none of your fuckin' business either-
uh, we think that you should take a leave of absence... until we're able to, uh, sort all this out.
all right, we're moving into phase two of the training op.
selb's gonna brief you on it, so listen up, all right?
actually, i believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved for jewish attorneys.
i believe the proper slur for someone like myself... would be, uh, "eggplant."
but this is not the time for the "l told you so" speech.
that day when daniel zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running.
- look, l-l have a question i need to ask you... and it is absolutely imperative that you tell me the truth.
now, no matter what you say, i swear to you, you are not going to get in trouble.
these are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition.
can we take a look at this guy who's helping him?
you know the hubble telescope that looks up at the stars?
they've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us.
the, uh, president has not committed himself... but he does recognize that we do need something in this area.
and i think he will come to see that this bill will, in the end... provide the kind of security that this--
- might be able to piggyback it on top of this.
- how the hell am i supposed to know what it is?
i want to know who authorized its use... who checked it out from inventory... and for what purpose.
most important, how on god's green earth... it got into congressman albert's hotel room.
if this was a legit op... and i can't possibly see how it could be, then so be it.
but if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream... then that somebody is going to prison.
now, if these guys are good, and they're probably very good, in a location like this... they'll have you in five, six minutes.
so let's say in four minutes time, after you turn that tape on... regardless of what's happening, you get out that door.
does everybody here know that you killed phil hamersly and rachel banks?
this guy is going down, and he's going to take all of you with him.
now, we can go get a warrant and come back with the fbi, take anything we want... arrest anybody that we want-- just give the man the videotape.
hey, only one gonna get arrested here is you, for felonious cocksucking... with an attempt to swallow the evidence, so shut your mouth.
but this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.
and you and i know what the average citizen does not:
i've got three major employers... in the syracuse area alone who are gonna get just killed by this bill.
i promise to get you funds equal to or greater than... whatever those companies gave your last campaign.
- look, everybody knows... that, that the mob has been controlling these guys since, since as long as i can remember.
and now, uh-- now we got pintero's goons down there tuning up my people.
- but then larry cash came in and he went after 'em.
- uh, larry cash is in the hospital... with a broken jaw and a ruptured kidney.
besides, these people have families that are living through this every day.
hey, julie, can we send a case of chianti over to larry cash?
i would like my clients to be able to exercise their constitutional rights.
and if that happens, that tape will disappear forever into my private collection... along with the zapruder film and the porno from hitler's bunker.
homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
that might mean that the congressman-- and i speculate here-- may have suffered a heart attack before going into the lockraven reservoir.
i'm standing by live at the lockraven reservoir... right now, where police and fire officials are in the process of removing... a classic mercedes owned by republican congressman phillip hamersly.
you may be able to see it here, being removed in the background.
i have been told that the congressman... was alone in the vehicle when this accident happened just under an hour ago.
you may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition.
homicide investigators have told me that they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
that might mean that the congressman-- and i speculate here-- may have suffered a heart attack before going into the lockraven reservoir.
- you know, bobby, i think you should take this more seriously.
honey, i think you're taking it seriously enough for both of us... and half the people on the block.
you know, if you decide you want to stay at dylan's till the end of the weekend... or the end of the century, your mom and i have discussed it.
it'll be difficult initially, but we think we can live with it.
it's just that we're handling a different aspect of the inquiry.
um, it turns out mr zavitz was involved in an extortion scheme.
- it's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field.
dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it; and when he does, i want his credibility.
i want to know about his gambling problems, his urine samples, his porno rentals.
i want to use every means possible to get what we need... because this little son of a bitch is not going to be the final chapter of my life.
- none of my fucking business- you're damn right it's not-
i love my wife, and i love my son absolutely... with no equivocations, and that's none of your fuckin' business either-
well, because first, you haven't told him who made the tape... and second, we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars... on shyster lawyers just like you... because of shyster lawyers just like you.
actually, i believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved for jewish attorneys.
rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess?
from the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart.
the national security agency conducts worldwide surveillance-- fax, phones, satellite communication.
they're the only ones in the country, including the military, who could possibly have anything like this.
you stay away from rachel and you stay away from me.
you come near either one of us, i'm gonna kill you.
- how you just gonna go through my stuff like that?
baby, until i actually give it to you, that's still mine.
these are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition.
can we take a look at this guy who's helping him?
you know the hubble telescope that looks up at the stars?
they've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us.

but this is our own goddamned union leadership... tryin' to railroad us into signing some sweetheart contract.
look, everybody knows that the mob has been controlling these guys since as long as i can remember.
and now, uh, now we got pintero's goons down there tuning up my people.
well, first off, that's a hobbs act violation, probably a rlco.
i would like my clients to be able to exercise their constitutional rights.
and if that happens, that tape will disappear into my private collection, along with the zapruder film and the porno from hitler's bunker.
the congressman endured open-heart surgery just a couple of years ago.
homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle of pills in his lap.
it contains a motion-activated digital video camera with a compound lens.
it was aimed directly at the boat ramp across the lake.
that might mean that the congressman - and i speculate here - may have suffered a heart attack before going into the reservoir.
i am also told that there was no one in the car...
zavitz is speaking to a lenny bloom, a former anti-war activist.
he publishes a variety of left-wing newsletters on various political subjects.
i was going to, but she's too busy yelling at the tv.
oh, well there goes the fourth amendment - what's left of it.
eric, just call me in the morning when you want me to come pick you up.
if you decide you want to stay at dylan's till the end of the weekend or... the end of the century, we have discussed it.
i've seen sex offenders untouched because the victim was a call girl.
credibility - it's the only currency that means anything on this kind of playing field.
i just got off the phone with a source that i trust.

these are the parametrics for the space vehicle during data acquisition.
can we take a look at this guy who's helping him?
you're talking on the phone and you use the word, "bomb," "president," "allah,"
any of a hundred key words, the computer recognizes it, automatically records it, red flags it for analysis; that was 20 years ago.
had a partner he thought was stealing from him, so i figured out a way to tap the phone.
i loved listening to this guy and him not knowing i was there,
to be safe, they'll try to scan all the frequencies to try to track you down.
if these guys are good, and they're very good, in a location like this, they'll have you in five, six minutes.
ten-year-olds go on the net, downloading encryption we can barely break, not to mention instructions on how to make a low-yield nuclear device.
privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it.
they let brill go, you take the tape home, everyone has a merry christmas.
what assurances do i have that you haven't copied that tape?
now, we can go get a warrant and come back with the fbi, take anything we want, arrest anybody that we want - just give the man the videotape.
only one who'll get arrested is you, for felonious cocksucking with an attempt to swallow the evidence.

ah, yes, they're exactly... exactly 15% of the amount dean withdrew.
i've seen killers walk free because the eyewitness was an alcoholic.
i've seen sex offenders untouched because the victim was a call girl.
we'd have the police and the fbi all over this in 24 hours.
put taps on his most frequently called numbers, and let's get into his life.
i just got off the phone with a source that i trust.
a grand jury is being convened to look into your labor practice as far back as the electrical workers' strike.
we must decide which of them best serves the long-term interests of this great democracy in which we live.
i truly believe that this act is. in the end. our very best means of preserving it.
well, first, you haven't told him who made the tape, and second, we've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on shyster lawyers just like you because of shyster lawyers just like you.
actually, i believe the slur "shyster" is generally reserved for jewish attorneys.
rachel, don't you see that he is the key to this whole mess?
from the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart.
that day when daniel zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running.
the people that were chasing him, that's the people that are chasing me.
in the old days, we actually had to tap a wire into your phone line.
now calls bouncing' off satellites - they snatch 'em out of the air.
so, we were helping the secret police supply weapons to the afghani rebels fighting the soviets.
my partner and i were on the eastern border monitoring soviet military transmissions.
but he does recognize that we do need something in this area.
and i think he will come to see that this bill will. in the end.
i want to know who authorized its use, who checked it out from inventory, and for what purpose.
most important, how on god's green earth it got into congressman albert's hotel room.
if this was a legit op, and i can't possibly see how it could be, then so be it.
but if this was somebody's unilateral wet dream, then that somebody is going to prison.
if these guys are good, and they're very good, in a location like this, they'll have you in five, six minutes.
so in four minutes time, after you turn that tape on, regardless of what's happening, you get out that door.
now we've got ten million crackpots out there with sniper scopes, saran gas and c-4.
ten-year-olds go on the net, downloading encryption we can barely break, not to mention instructions on how to make a low-yield nuclear device.
does everybody here know that you killed phil hamersly and rachel banks?
this guy is going down, and he's gonna take all of you with him.
ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things.
congressman albert. how do we draw the line... between protection of national security.
but this is the richest, most powerful nation on earth, and therefore the most hated.
and you and i know what the average citizen does not:
i've got three major employers... in the syracuse area alone who are gonna getjust killed by this bill.
i promise to getyou funds equal to or greater than... whatever those companies gaveyour last campaign.
- look, eveybody knows... that, that the mob has been controlling these guys since, since as long as i can remember.
and now, uh-- now we got pintero's goons down there tuning up my people.
- but then lary cash came in and he went after 'em.
- uh, lary cash is in the hospital... with a brokenjaw and a ruptured kidney.
besides, these people have families that are living through this evey day.
hey,julie, can we send a case ofchianti over to lary cash?
this accident comes at a very untimetyjuncture... since the congressman was working on a very controversial piece oftegistation, date... opposing the telecommunications security and privacyact.
fire omcials do tell me that it appears the congressman... was by himselfin the car.
in fact, the congressman endured open-heart surgey just a couple ofyears ago.
homicide investigators have told me they did find a bottle ofpills in his lap.
- thirty months in a federal penitentiay... at marion, illinois, for a gvh-1 -- on your gunney sergeant-- what's that about?
the guywas an asshole, sir, and he deserved it, ifyou'll excuse me.
you may be able to see it here, being removed in the background.
now, fire and potice omciats aren't saying much at this point.
you may know that the congressman suffers from a heart condition.
homicide investigators have told me that they did _nd a bottte of pitts in his tap.
that might mean that the congressman-- and i specutate here-- may have suffered a heart attack before going into the lockraven reservoir.
i am also told that there was no one in the car with him at the time ofthe--
honey, i thinkyou're taking it seriously enough for both ofus... and halfthe people on the block.
tens ofmillions offoreign nationals tiving within our borders... and many ofthese people consider the united states their enemy.
you know, ifyou decide you want to stay at dylan's till the end ofthe weekend... or the end ofthe centuy, your mom and i have discussed it.
it'll be difficult initially, but we thinkwe can live with it.
- it's the only currency that means anything on this kind ofplaying field.
dean's got the tape, and he's gonna come out with it; and when he does, i want his credibility.
i just got offthe phone with a source that i trust.
a grandjuy is being convened to look intoyour labor practice... as far back as the electrical workers' strike.

actually, i believe the slur "shyster"... is generally reserved forjewish attorneys.
rachel, don'tyou see that he is the key to this whole mess?
from the second you gave me that tape, my life has been falling apart.
- ever since the problem, i've never touched rachel like that.
i never-- l never even looked at her like that, honey. i loveyou.
but this is not the time for the "l told you so" speech.
that daywhen daniel zavitz got hit by the fire truck, he was running.
you know the hubble telescope that looks up at the stars?
they've got over a hundred spy satellites looking down at us.
so, we were helping the secret police supplyweapons... to the afghani rebels fighting the soviets.
my partner and i were on the eastern border monitoring soviet militay transmissions.
but back in tehran, the hard-liners seized the embassy... and overnight, the whole county changed.
people we'd been working with, they turned on us. i got out.
now, to be safe, they'll also ty... to scan all the frequencies to ty to trackyou down.
now, ifthese guys are good, and they're probablyvey good, in a location like this... they'll haveyou in five, six minutes.
now we've got ten million crackpots out there with sniper scopes, sarin gas and c-4.
ten-year-olds go on the net, downloading encyption we can barely break, not to mention...
privacy's been dead for 30 years because we can't risk it.
the only privacy that's left is the inside ofyour head, and maybe that's enough.
ooh, you're gonna need to get a tan on those things.
congressman sam albert, how do we draw the tine-- draw the tine... between protection of nationat security... obviously the government's need to obtain intettigence data... and the protection ofcivil liberties, particutarty the sanctity of my home?
da'an told me that the taelons are born with full genetic knowledge of their parents.
so if liam's race is like the taelons, that means he knows everything that beckett and sandoval knew.
i've got the combined knowledge of mankind and the entire taelon mainframe on this baby.
now yes, you may be good at your little taelon cubes, but this setup is way out of your league, okay?
"it is a rare occasion to be born a human being".
if this is so, then william boone is one of the rarest of the rare,
for he died true to the spirit with which he lived.
a sword in one hand and an olive branch in the other.
and the world has reacted with shock and horror today at the assassination of the leader of the taelon synod.
the synod have refused to comment on the identity of the alien attacker.
no, see, my worst nightmare, mr. sandoval, began the day the taelons arrived on our planet.
to borrow a phrase from your book, mr. doors, "it's only the beginning".
why don't the taelons leave earth and take the alleged jaridians with you.
the jaridians are aware of us through the probe they sent.
the fate of mankind and the taelon commonality are intrinsically linked, but of course, you know that.
you served as boone's lieutenant for three years during the si war.
my point is that you want to be a companion protector, yet you and boone couldn't even protect the lives of your men.
i will not allow you to insult the memory of capt. boone or any of our men.
and as soon as the jaridians achieve interdimensional flight, they will come to earth to destroy us.
we require a leader, who will do whatever is necessary to prepare this human species to oppose the jaridians.
like you would use for a canoe if it were normal length but he had sawed it into a weapon and he hit me.
right before you got hit, did you and your date kiss?
our witness has a piece of spinach caught in an incisor.
when oral decay starts between the tooth and the gum bacteria builds colonies.
not long ago, a man entered a woman's house at night and accosted her foot.
it was an easy conviction for you to get but you didn't get it, why?
it's not really a closing, but it's one last chance to address the judge.
when mr. michaelson said that you really want this what did he mean?
and she said, "idiot even if you found her, she might be holding out for the perfect man."
she also said i wouldn't recognize love unless it bonked me on the head.
and i retorted, "well, why don't you come along with me and if you see love, you hit me on the head so i'll know."
it was difficult as a young man taking my mother on dates.
it was her request to have her last words put on her tombstone.
and i see people at the cemetery snickering when they read:
so when i die they won't judge me by my will or my job title.
they'll say, "look at the friend he had in bernie gilson.

but there's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that, is there?
i told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.
i know, it impresses the people at the parties you go to that we're classy.
sorry, i just don't give a rat's ass about a war in some country whose name i can't even pronounce.
ladies and gentlemen, we new υorkers like to think we've seen it all but what you're going to see now will shock you beyond belief.
this is footage we have that indicates that there is a dinosaur loose in manhattan.
among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores along pricey 5th and madison ave.
the warner bros. and disney stores have been cleared out by looters.
the military has clamped a media blackout on whatever is going on.
officials are not saying anything about their attempts to contain or control this creature, and now i see...
how does a guy go from anti-nuke activist to working for the nuclear regulatory commission?
when you and i went to rallies together in college we helped to create awareness.
the blood i collected revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
are you trying to tell us that there's another of those things out there?
you want to divide our efferts based solely on some wild theory?
sir, nick's come through for us before, and if he feels...
a direct path can be traced from manhattan to french polynesia where nuclear tests have been going on for two decades.
researcher dr. tapadopoulos believes the creature may be nesting using manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.
it's a vent that leads down to the subway tunnels underneath.
it should take us right to the 23rd street station in manhattan.
i'm standing just outside the jersey entrance to the lincoln tunnel.
thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.
your station won't have any easier time reaching the military than i did.
when you worked with them, did they monitor all news broadcasts?
let's not forget in our rush to return to the city that many people have had their lives changed forever.
no one in the city has been untouched by the frenzy...
the creatures, though just hatched, are over 9 feet tall and they've begun feeding.
when their food supply runs out here they will attempt to hunt down food of their own outside of this nest.
adaptive and cunning, these 200 could become 40,000 within this year.
if the military is listening to this broadcast they have to destroy this building immediately before these creatures can escape.
so i guess your theory of the creature nesting turned out to be correct after all.
regardless of what happens to us, the most important thing is that this building be destroyed immediately before they can escape into the city.
i told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.
nick, this is elsie chapman of the national institute of paleontology.
this animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur.
don't tell me what it isn't, tell me what it is.
and many people, many, many people are not happy about it.
among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores... along pricey fifth and madison avenue.
if i'm wrong on this evacuation, they'll string me up from the liberty torch.
didn't we agree that we weren't to have any sweets until after the election?
you're saying that in an election month i've evacuated this city for nothing?
do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city?
we were checking the office building above when we found the floor was gone.
when we discovered he could burrow through the tunnels, we realized... he could be outside the quarantine zone.
when i had to catch earthworms... the best way to get them was not to dig them out, but to draw them out.
all we need to do is to find out what he needs... and he'll come to you.
the blood that i collected... revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
are you trying to tell us that there's another one of those things out there?
if dr. tatopoulos is right, we must act quickly before this problem escalates.
so you want to divide our efforts based solely on some wild theory?

we were checking the building above and we discovered the floor was gone.
when we discovered that he coυld bυrrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be oυtside the qυarantine zone.
well' when i had to catch earthworms i knew the best way to get them was not to dig them out but to draw them oυt.
all we need to do is to find out what he needs, and he'll come to you.
ηere at the command center in νew jersey there is no new information to report.
the military has clamped a media blackoυt on whatever is going on.
when you and i went to rallies together in college we helped to create awareness.
but now, from the inside, i'm able to eftect real change.
that's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible.
otherwise up to a dozen will be born each one capable of laying eggs on its own.
if dr. tatopoulos is right, we have to act qυickly, before this problem escalates.
yoυ want to divide oυr efferts based solely on some wild theory?
researcher dr. tapadopoulos believes the creature may be nesting using manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.
this, despite the fact that the combined might of the u.s. military has been unable to subdue...
yeah, well i just totally screwed υp with the only man who will ever care about me.
if i told yoυ you could make it all up to him, would you?
thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.
all major arteries into the city are clogged with manhattanites who are jubilant that godzilla...
what if νick is right, and we blow this whole thing?
this could be the only chance we have to do something about it.
if they get out, they'll multiply, and very soon a new species will emerge.
one that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet.
if the military is listening to this broadcast they have to destroy this building immediately before these creatures can escape.
so far' they're all trapped inside this bυilding but i don't think we can contain them for long.
regardless of what happens to υs, the most important thing is that this building be destroyed immediately before they can escape into the city.

this is footage we have that indicates... that there is a dinosaur loose in manhattan.
in what city officials are describing as the worst act of destruction... since the world trade center bombing... hundreds of thousands of people have jammed the streets... in the largest evacuation in this city's history.
and many people, many, many people are not happy about it.
among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores... along pricey fifth and madison avenue.
the warner bros. and disney stores have been cleared out by looters.
emergency vehicles cannot have access to any emergency that may develop.
and there is a slow but steady stream out of the city... as if long island or new jersey were any refuge in this time of crisis.

but there's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that, is there?
i told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.
civil defense stations are being set up throughout the island of manhattan.
but in addition, city, military... and health officials are setting up a command post... on the jersey shore in anticipation of an evacuation.
and many people, many, many people are not happy about it.
among those unhappy citizens are the managers of the stores... along pricey fifth and madison avenue.
if i'm wrong on this evacuation, they'll string me up from the liberty torch.
didn't we agree that we weren't to have any sweets until after the election?
you're telling me that in an election month i've evacuated this entire city for nothing?
do you realize what this evacuation is gonna cost the people of this city?
we were checking the office building above when we discovered the floor was gone.
when we discovered he could burrow through the tunnels, we realized that... we realized he could be outside the quarantine zone.
here at command center in new jersey there is no new information to report... because the military has clamped a total media blackout... on whatever is going on out here.
officials are not saying anything about their attempts to contain or control this creature.
that's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible.
otherwise up to a dozen are going to be born... each one capable of laying eggs on its own.
if dr. tatopoulos is right, we have to act quickly before this problem escalates.
so you want to divide our efforts based solely on some wild theory?
a direct path can be traced from manhattan to french polynesia... where nuclear tests have been going on for more than two decades.
research team member dr. nick papadopoulus believes.... the creature may be nesting... using manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.
well, i just totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me.
if i told you you could make it all up from, would you?
next thing i know, he pulls into this warehouse... with all these french wackos in military outfits.
they want to try to sneak back into the city tonight.
it's a vent that leads down to the subway tunnels underneath here.
it should take us right to the 23rd street station in manhattan.
i'm standing here now just outside the jersey entrance to the lincoln tunnel... where thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.
all major arteries into the city are clogged with manhattanites who are both jubilant that godzilla is dead--
well, people are screaming to be let back into the city.
we're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
your station isn't gonna have any easier time reaching the military than i did.
when you worked with them, did they monitor all the news broadcasts?
let's not forget in our rush to return to the city... that many people have had their lives changed forever.
no one in the city has been untouched by the tragedy.
if they get out, they'll multiply and very soon a new species will emerge.
one that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet.
if the military is listening to this broadcast... they have to destroy this building immediately... before these creatures can escape.
so far they're all trapped inside this building... but i don't think we can contain them for long.
regardless of what happens to us, the most important thing... is that this building be destroyed immediately before they can escape out into the city.
reporting live from madison square garden... this is audrey timmonds for widf news.
tuvok, vorik and jurot died in a shuttle crash about two months ago.
suder was killed in a conflict with a species called the kazon.
well, i'll have someone scan the room if it'll make you feel better.
kir, we just received an encoded message from the transport vessel.
two days-- that increases the chances that we'll run into another inspection.
given the frequency of patrols in that area, it's likely we'll be stopped at least once.
we'll avoid their colonies, space stations, tourist attractions-- if they have any.
the ogre of fire's castle hovered over the forest like a great, black spaceship, turning day into night.
i could have exposed them at any time, but i wanted them to escape as much as you do.
i can still protect them, but only if you take me with you.
we'll have to get your passengers to the wormhole on our own.
these are the schedules and routes of our patrols, along with tactical data on our shield and weapons configurations-- enough to ensure that you avoid another inspection.
i know all about starfleet philosophy, unless you left those ideals behind in the alpha quadrant.
i certainly don't grant asylum to every person i meet, especially ones who ransack my ship and terrorize my crew.
i'm going to give you safe passage to the wormhole... in return for your help in getting us there, but i'm also imposing some restrictions.
you'll have your own quarters, but limited access to voyager's systems, and your whereabouts will be monitored at all times.
why do you people feel such a need to align yourselves with monolithic organizations, hmm?
i'd be glad to discuss that and any other philosophical issue you care to raise, if you would just slow down and talk.
he said wormhole-- a layman's term that... that covers any number of phenomena.
i am familiar with a certain anomaly that could be categorized as an "interspatial flexure."
the aperture of the phenomenon-- which i prefer to call an intermittent cyclical vortex-- is unfixed.
it manifests infrequently, for only brief periods of time and in varying locations.
we've been looking at the obvious-- frequency, location, timing-- but each of those parameters could have a counterpoint in subspace.
if we could run an algorithm based on subspace harmonics, it might reveal our pattern.
well, let's just say i usually go with my instincts... and sort it out later at the board of inquiry.
those admirals and i were on a first-name basis, you know.
when i lifted her out and set her down on the deck... she thanked me.
i sent her to a relocation center with the others, knowing full well what would happen to her.
you asked for safe passage and i agreed, under the condition that you follow my orders.
you may stand a chance against one of our warships, but not against two.
i was planning on asking you to stay with us, once we got through the wormhole.
i wouldn't mind having someone around who appreciates a bit of tchaikovsky now and then.
generous, but... something tells me i wouldn't fit in any better on voyager.
well... you wouldn't be the first wayward soul we've folded into our ranks.
i'm afraid i'll have to ask you to leave our space immediately.
prax, why don't you check on our teams, while i reiterate our protocols for captain janeway.

we would never let someone of your stature go without assistance for long.
we're prepared to send along as many potential replacements as you like... knowing that you've always been so wonderfully egalitarian.
it must be kept at a constant temperature at all times.
if you were to impound it and stick it in a hot little room... in a matter of hours, the flavor would bleed away and vanish...
and, you know, he is about to become the emperor, so...
i don't care if he's been declared... high eminent favah of the imperial galaxy... the brivari stays here.
his arterial system has basically shut down... from all the stress and anxiety and pressure he's been under.
the veins carrying blood through his left heart have contracted to half their normal size.
it may help, but it takes three days to get here.
at best, i can keep him going for the next 24 hours on life support.
he's always so alive, so full of energy... even when he's being annoying.
you know, i don't think i've ever seen him for two minutes... when he wasn't talking or yelling at someone.
and that if i did not divorce her, that i would be dead to them... to the family title, position, money.
i remember the look in her eyes when i told her.
perhaps i am the piece of myself... that telepathically joined with you... once long ago and decided to stay.
perhaps i am your conscience... which can only get your attention... by taking on a face other than your own... and striking you down in the one place where you are still vulnerable.
i was doing some reading, and i wondered if you had ever heard about this.
apparently, according to some of our folktales... if the spirit of a centauri ends up in a body... that is not worthy of its presence... it can choose to separate... to cause the death of the body... so that it can then move on to a worthier host.
we would never let someone of your stature go without assistance for long.

mr. allan i hope you understand, but the ambassador has been under a great deal of strain lately.
and, you know, he is about to become the emperor, so...
his arterial system has basically shut down from all the stress and anxiety and pressure he's been under.
the veins carrying blood through his left heart have contracted to half their normal size.
it may help, but it takes three days to get here.
at best, i can keep him going for the next 24 hours on life support.
he's always so alive, so full of energy even when he's being annoying.
you know, i don't think i've ever seen him for two minutes when he wasn't talking or yelling at someone.
and that if i did not divorce her, that i would be dead to them to the family title, position, money.
i remember the look in her eyes when i told her.
i don't think i have any choice in the matter, vir.
you do have a choice, londo but you have to make it now.
perhaps i am a delusion caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain.
perhaps i am the piece of myself that telepathically joined with you once long ago and decided to stay.
it's a very big struggle and the person involved is either permanently changed by the experience or he dies.
this is only supposed to happen when the higher spirit is a real, real high one.
we're prepared to send along as many potential replacements as you like knowing that you've always been so wonderfully egalitarian.
we can fill the position with three assistants, one from each caste...
it is a delicate drink, and the flavor is extremely fragile.
it must be kept at a constant temperature at all times.
you give someone a little authority and a badge and he thinks he runs the universe.
five years i have been on this station and never once has my shipment of brivari been quarantined for health inspection.
and, you know, he is about to become the emperor, so...
i don't care if he's been declared high eminent favah of the lmperial galaxy the brivari stays here.
with marcus gone i felt the loss of a part of myself.
perhaps i will find it again by replacing him in the anla'shok.
a system of very fine veins, thousands of them all in one large, knotted structure.
you can't get to the inner ones without cutting through the outer ones, am i right?
at best, i can keep him going for the next 24 hours on life support.
so unless something happens on its own he's gonna be dead by the time it gets here.
in the five years since i arrived, i have felt pity for him, anger he has made me laugh.
i have even liked him from time to time as much as i haven't wanted to.
it is strange, isn't it that you and i both know that we are dying?
lorien gave you back your life, but you still have less than 20 years left.
perhaps i am the piece of myself that telepathically joined with you once long ago and decided to stay.
perhaps i am your conscience which can only get your attention by taking on a face other than your own and striking you down in the one place where you are still vulnerable.
you are going to have to change your diet and you have to cut back on the stress.
yes, well, that doesn't seem very likely as long as i am still here, yes?
oh, vir, before you go i was doing some reading, and i wondered if you had ever heard about this.

dr crane, i've been meaning to ask you, what do you think about two people who work together dating?
well, sharon, i'm asked that question a lot, and the stark reality is that that situation is fraught with delightful possibilities.
she is mrs gilbert leslie chesterton, a sarah lawrence graduate and the owner of a very successful auto body repair shop.
honestly, the conclusions people make just because a man dresses well and knows how to use a pastry bag.
i understand the importance of time off before beginning medical school.
i spent that summer in milan studying the history of opera.
once we arrived at le relais, the chef had just cut himself.
clint not only treated the wound, but made us a flawless egg white and truffle omelette.
i put myself through med school as a sous-chef at le cirque.
i just want to pinch you to make sure you're real.
all my listeners are familiar with my now trademark echoing cough.
well, let's go to the lines, take our first call and show dr webber the ropes.
some unconscious fear is driving you to a place of safety.
you'll have to examine your life and discover what it is you're retreating from.
i'm afraid i have a bit of the old ham in me.
would it be presumptuous to sing in front of your guests?
excuse me, i just want to thank you all for this warm welcome to kacl.
and, as a token of my gratitude, i'd like to share this song with you.

mr. mars intends to bring his own personal touch to heartland play systems.
once i did the marketing, it was the most successful product in company history.
that's why i bought the place and why you two are still onboard.
if we pull this off, mars will be eating out of our hands.
by the way, gentlemen, mr. mars expects the product ready for shipment in three months.
i'll check the zoning laws, but i think they'll prove me right.
hasn't he heard of the dishes that go on top of your house?
you are the best of the best of the few and the proud!
so, ask not what your country can do for you, only regret that you have but one life to live.
i think it's very honest of you to tell the truth.
so, you pawned my woodworking tools so you could pay joe?
imagine a microchip... sophisticated enough to control the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.
imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade any system it's plugged into.
but he's kind of a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.
/'m sure he'a' be wi//ing to give it a// up for you.
i mean, power has to be going through the transformers for them to overload.
the power's on at my house and we've tons of crap to turn on.
move your truck with the giant globotech logo before the news crews get here.
i don't know, mr. mars, i may have trouble handling the gears.
add a few zeros to the end of that number... and contact our military division.
i know some south american rebels who will find these toys very entertaining.
globotech industries, long recognized as the worldwide leader in high-tech weaponry, is now reaching even higher.

we can make missiles that can hunt down one unlucky bastard... 7,000 miles away and stick a nuclear warhead right up his ass.
i don't think we're going to have a problem with this.
that dish is just one more piece of techno- crap... to go along with the rest of your stockpile of techno- crap.

your damn commando elite wrecked my dad's store, destroyed the stupid gorgonites and ran off.
and for once, i would've made the store a little money.
i know it was the wrong thing to do, and i'm sorry.
hey, what are you, a kid or an oil painting ?
no, seriously, folks, they got me sharing a dressing room with rotting fruit.
imagine a microchip sophisticated enough to control... the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.
imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade any system that it's plugged into, like a smart drug for machines.
well, there is this one guy, but he's kind of a smart aleck... and a bit of a troublemaker.
well, i'm sure he'd be willing to give it all up for you.
the gorgonites are alive and bivouacked at the enemy stronghold, and the enemy has revealed an age- old weakness.
i'm sure he'd be willing to give it all up for you.

mr. mars intends to bring his own personal touch to heartland play systems.
well, they're-- these are monsters... who come from the land of gorgon, and they've come to our world.
they're lost, and now in order to get back to gorgon, they have to, uh, find out as much stuff about our world as possible.
i'm talkin' about toys that are so smart, when kids play with 'em, they play back.
toys in short, gentlemen, that actually do what they do in the commercials.
that dish is just one more piece of techno-crap... to go along with the rest of your stockpile of techno-crap.

let me be the first to welcome you to the globotech family.
just as he's done with his computer, telecommunications and food divisions mr. mars intends to bring his own personal touch to heartland play systems.
commercials showing trucks popping up on mount rushmore and parking on abraham lincoln's head.
and shampoo commercials that say women can look like claudia schiffer after one cycle of rinse and repeat.
if we pull this off, mars will be eating out of our hands.
by the way, gentlemen mr. mars expects the product ready for shipment in three months.
that dish is just one more piece of techno-crap to go along with the rest of your stockpile of techno-crap!
you're already pulling so much juice, you got us living in a cancer node.
i'll check the zoning laws, but i think they'll prove me right.
hasn't he heard of the dishes that go on top of your house?
so, remember you are the best of the best of the few and the proud!
so, ask not what your country can do for you only regret that you have but one life to live.
i think it's very honest of you to tell the truth.
so, you pawned my woodworking tools so you could pay joe?
imagine a microchip sophisticated enough to control the guidance systems of ballistic missiles.
imagine it can be used to instantly upgrade any system it's plugged into.
but he"s kind of a smart aleck and a bit of a troublemaker.
i"m sure he"d be willing to give it all up foryou.
the power's on at my house and we've tons of crap to turn on.
we have to wedge the breakers open in your fuse box.
i don't know, mr. mars, i may have trouble handling the gears.
what with the critical head injury and emotional distress i've suffered lately.
i gave a lot of chances to my son to improve himself.
but his ego is sky high, and, he is nothing but a vagabond
if, by 21 years of age, he, like his forefathers before him doesn't join a military academy, all his luxuries are to be stopped.
he can claim the estate fully, only when he joins the academy.
it's the huts around that house that get burnt to ashes.
now how will i keep the hearth burning in my house?
there's not a single college here, which hasn't kicked me out!
that's why i'll join the academy, and break so many rules that they'll kick me out within 2 days!
or did some cadet make a dent in your ego, yet again?
what you term as ego is actually my ideals and principles.
this small .... you were, when mother left you in my care.
and she said from today, son, nisha's your daughter, not sister.
and raja thakur will claim at least 50 million from it.
and you know how much ammunition that 50 million can buy, don't you?
- if you say so, shall i get rid of the thakur?
- listen, son the power lies not in thakur's arms, but in shankar's head!
i know, sir, but i want to know which law in the world states that a hat has to be worn in the way i'm wearing it now.
actually, when i left home, i hadn't worn my hat like this.
you rule over 1 /2 of india and i rule over the rest!
your advice is not bad but i may trust a cobra.
one signal from you, and my men will get rid of this hurdle!
and you'll take a leap, from a slave, to the king!
it's not a festival, then why is this house decorated like a bride?
this is like having the sight but, being blind to the obvious.
- this gun was retrieved from a gangster who was killed in the last gang war.
this means one of your men was hand in glove with the gangster.
all the army rules fall short, compared to the height of your ego!
you've over-stepped the law's line of limit, many a times which deserved just one penalty that you be stripped of your uniform.
every time i stood by you, cos, you're one such officer who knows how to make a gem out of a piece of glass!
those officers whom you've trained are living examples to the nation.
and only an officer like you, can, in the hearts of young officers, ...kindle a patriotic feeling for their country.
that doesn't mean you can whip the backsides of those soldiers.
...will now teach you such a lesson, that never again will an army man dare to sell his uniform like this!
i kept skinning you alive, and you bore it without a whimper?
as long as blood runs in his veins he'll stand on the battlefield with his chest puffed out!
if he's itching to fight then take him to the border!
i'll also not have any civilian raise his hand on my cadets.
till you police come up with some valid proof don't touch any army personnel.
you're worse off than that beggar, who didn't even get his sister's hate, let alone love, as alms!
isn't this the same hand, on which nisha tied rakhi for years?
she sacrificed her love, for her brother's happiness, only because she wanted you to give her away on your arm.
but you... you only wanted to give shoulder to her bier!
we've come here on our own feet and will return in the same way.
if anything, we'll leave behind this sinful kingdom of yours... on whose every wall will be written in your blood.
i gave a lot of chances to my son to improve himself.
but his ego is sky high, and, he is nothing but a vagabond
if, by 21 years of age, he, like his forefathers before him doesn't join a military academy, all his luxuries are to be stopped.
he can claim the estate fully, only when he joins the academy.

what you term as ego is actually my ideals and principles.
this small .... you were, when mother left you in my care.
and she said from today, son, nisha's your daughter, not sister.
else, you'll have to leave mumbai and go back to bihar!
- if you say so, shall i get rid of the thakur?
i warn you, that to change one's statement in the court or to lie, is the world's greatest crime.
i know, sir, but i want to know which law in the world states that a hat has to be worn in the way i'm wearing it now.
he swore in court that he didn't see me at all.
honestly, uncle, within 24 hours from now if i don't put his corpse at your feet, i'll change my name!
you marred the reputation of the whole of bihar, old chap.
you missed your target from a distance of just 10 feet?
that invalid made you his slave and a target for my gun.
but it could also be that i become a target of your gun.
that's why, throw away that harness of slavery and wear the crown of the king of india!
you rule over 1 /2 of india and i rule over the rest!
this is like having the sight but, being blind to the obvious.
i've told you so many times, i don't get your northern proverbs!
else, i'll present you not with that boy, but his severed head!
and you know very well, that, whatever your brother says he does it!
this bread is given to us, by the people of india.
who knead it with their sweat, so that we can protect them and spill our blood for it.
those officers whom you've trained are living examples to the nation.
and only an officer like you, can, in the hearts of young officers, ...kindle a patriotic feeling for their country.
these hands, which belted that innocent like an animal which rained blows on his body instead of yours, you bastard...!
...will now teach you such a lesson, that never again will an army man dare to sell his uniform like this!
you're one of those young men, who can touch the sky.
you can be that soldier, on whom every mother will dote on and say...
he made the mistake of walking into my house with these feet.
i've broken his legs so badly that he'll never walk again.
and he'll walk on these very feet and gate crash into your house.
he'll carry your sister till here, and you'll just stand and watch.
a war which a man can't win with an arrow or a sword a woman wins it, with tears!
before i get drowned in my sister's tears i wish that she marries vicky as soon as possible.
i don't know about that, but i've told her my decision.
if she refuses to wed vicky i'll severe that boy's head, and put it in her lap!
if i go after my love, i'll lose my brother's love.
she sacrificed her love, for her brother's happiness, only because she wanted you to give her away on your arm.
we flicked your daughter-in-law to-be, and you couldn't do a thing.
i've heard that a soldier may break, but he never bends!
according to the law of the indian army, the major had to face a legal action.
he admitted it was a wrong step, to take the cadets out of the academy for illegal transactions.
of course, it's not like having real kids play with it.
it's the last toy we have to test at this lab.
i guess i mostly figured out how to make things explode.
which secret weapon should we take with us on our mission, brain?
you were the first doctor to establish a dialogue with them.
the fact that i'm genetically enhanced made them more open to accepting me.
you're saying i'm a dominion spy and don't even know it.
you won't get caught because you don't even know you're working for them.
doctor, i am trying to help you, but i need your co-operation.
tear down the walls inside your mind, dredge up a fragment of a memory, anything about your mission.
but doesn't your son's death indicate a conflict of interest in your investigation?
i think it gives me an added incentive to go after the truth.
as long as i remain in command, i will see dr bashir whenever i please.
i will sit in on all interrogation sessions to make sure his rights are observed.
i thought i might find a way to help them assimilate into society.
a laudable goal, but it's puzzling the way you went about it.
so you convinced starfleet to give them access to classified battle plans?
starfleet wanted to hear our ideas on how to win the war.
but the sheer number of incidents form a pattern of behaviour that can't be ignored.
you want to be loyal to a man who's served under you for so long.
starfleet special order 66715 gives me the authority to neutralise security threats to deep space 9 by whatever means necessary.
you're about to spend the rest of this war in a maximum security cell.
because you didn't want billions of citizens to lose their lives, you agreed to give us information that would end this war quickly.
you rose above the petty question of whose side you were on and made a moral decision.
why do i still detect a hint of doubt in your voice?
i would have preferred to keep you under observation a little longer.
we deal with threats to the federation that jeopardise its very survival.
if you knew how many lives we've saved, you'd agree that the ends do justify the means.
he doesn't strike me as a man who takes no for an answer.
the next time he asks you to join his little group, you will say "yes".
i really do but until we determine the source we have to follow standard containment procedures and isolate all members of the senior staff.
as of now you're all relieved of duty and confined to quarters.
and you were the first doctor who managed to establish a dialogue with them.
well, actually, i think the fact that i'm genetically enhanced myself made them a little more open to accepting me.
i think they broke you and turned you to their cause and then had you suppress the memory of what happened.
you're saying i'm a dominion spy and don't even know it.
doctor, i am trying to help you but i need your cooperation.
i need you to tear down the walls inside your mind to dredge up a fragment of a memory-- anything about your mission, about your contacts.
you think you're smarter than the rest of us, don't you?
you think you're smarter than the millions of brave men and women who put their lives on the line for the federation.
i was with the seventh fleet when the dominion attacked the tyra system.
98 of our ships were destroyed in a matter of hours.
but don't you think that your son's death indicates a conflict of interest in your investigation?
no, i think it gives me an added incentive to go after the truth.
these misfits had been sheltered from the outside world for as long as they could remember.
yet you chose to bombard them with information about the war with the dominion.
now, so far, your case is based on circumstantial evidence and speculation.
what other kind of case can i make against a man who covers his tracks so well?
i could understand how you might be able to dismiss it but the sheer number of incidents form a pattern of behavior that can't be ignored.
i understand that you want to be loyal to a man who's served under you for so long.
starfleet special order 667 15 gives me the authority to neutralize security threats to deep space 9 by whatever means necessary.
doctor, you're about to spend the rest of this war in a maximum-security cell... unless... you would care to put your thumbprint on this confession.
we can reword it if it doesn't meet your exacting standards.
you can take that confession and throw it out of the nearest airlock.
we simply helped you to see that there's no way starfleet can defeat the dominion and because you didn't want billions of federation citizens to lose their lives needlessly you agreed to provide us with information that would help us end this war quickly.
you rose above the petty question of whose side you were on and made... a moral decision.
well, frankly, i would have preferred to have kept you under observation a little longer.
unfortunately, we didn't know about chief o'brien's injury or we would have incorporated that into the program.
because if what you say to me is true you function as judge, jury and executioner, and i think that's too much power for anyone.
i admit it takes exceptional people to do what we do-- people who can sublimate their ambitions to the best interests of the federation.
we believe in the same principles that every other federation citizen holds dear.
and yet you violate those principles as a matter of course.
so either they got him off the station another way or they have transporter technology that we can't detect.
captain, is there any word from starfleet about sloan or section 31?
starfleet command doesn't acknowledge its existence but they don't deny it either.
they simply said they'd look into it and get back to me.
he doesn't strike me as a man who takes "no" for an answer.
the next time he asks you to join his little group you will say "yes."
starfleet intelligence has reason to believe that there's been a security breach aboard deep space 9.
it appears that someone has been passing information to the dominion.
it made me ask myself how i would have held up under those conditions.
i guess you never really know until you go through it.
i think they broke you and turned you to their cause and then had you suppress the memory of what happened.
you're saying i'm a dominion spy and don't even know it.

we went over julian's quarters, but we couldn't find any residual transporter signatures.

there's no record of a deputy director sloan anywhere in starfleet.

this is a massive project, but you want me to go back to the drawing boards because you did a little... spelunking this morning?
i mean, well, i was underneath your site and i heard the bells of st. martin's.
the bells of st. martin's, that's only a few blocks away, so obviously, i was under your site, wasn't i, now?
well, thank you very much for the tip, and i'll look into it.

"emitted a bright light followed by a blaze, and in moments, the building was hopelessly on fire. "
like i said, somebody sees him getting ready to cash in his chips, takes the opportunity for a little moving target practice, human skeet shooting.
other eyewitnesses heard nothing, transfixed by the sight of this shooting star plummeting to the earth.
that makes him one more unknown soldier of the drug wars.
instead of investigating his murder, we ought to build him a tomb.
you can get sick snorting or shooting up behind jake's products.

i tried to factor in the torque of the shotgun blast.
it was impossible to determine to a certainty whether john doe would've survived his suicide attempt.
i thought that the odds in his favour were pretty good.
i'll bet our guys are hiding out with jed and jethro until the coast is clear.

if the cochrans are telling the truth, it was an accident not murder.

'so munch brought junior's parents in for a little chat in the box.'

my camera guy needed to r eload, so i told everybody to take a 10-minute br eak.
ther e was a str eam nearby, and i walked over with this car e package natalie made me, sat down.
when i looked up, i saw thr ee of them -- small, bigger, biggest -- recognizable to any species on the f ace of the planet as a child, a mother, and a f ather.
now, the trick in shooting deer is you got to get them out in the open, and it's tough with deer 'cause these ar e clever, cagey animals with an intuitive sense of danger.
that animal clopped up to me like we wer e at a party.
she seemed to be pr etty inter ested in the twinkie, so i gave it to her.
looking back, she'd have been better off if i'd given her the damn vest.
and bob kind of screamed at me and whispered, "move away!"
the camera had been reloaded, and it looked like the day wasn't gonna be a washout after all.
so i backed away... a couple of steps at a time... and i closed my eyes when i heard the shot.
they sang and danced and off er ed prayers to the gods f or a successf ul hunt so that they could survive just one mor e unimaginably brutal winter.
the things they had to kill held the highest place of r espect f or them, and to kill f or f un was a sin.
and they knew the gods wouldn't be so generous next time.
what we did wasn't f ood, and it wasn't shelter, and it sur e wasn't sports!
yes, they all said that jer emy goodwin was a bright guy with a world-class understanding of popular sports, but that he didn't quite fit in, and ther e was little chance that he'd advance in their organization.
all due r espect, mr. jaff ee, but i have $80,000 in college loans to pay back.
now, you had an obligation to tell us how you f elt, partly because i don't like getting a phone call saying i put one of my people in the hospital but mostly because if you f eel that strongly about something,
you have a r esponsibility to try and change my mind!
did you think i would fire you simply because you made a convincing argument?
it's taken me a lot of years, but i've come around to this -- if you'r e dumb, surround yourself with smart people, and if you'r e smart, surround yourself with smart people who disagr ee with you.
so at the end if you saw the yellow helmet, you knew you were in trouble.
i always thought that he was just too intense about winning.
as soon as you touch this limit... something happens and suddenly you can go a little bit further.
with the power of your mind, your determination, instinct and experience... you can fly very high.
ayrton senna's talent, commitment and determination... carried him beyond normal boundaries.
he displayed a supreme ability behind the wheel of a car... but he also demonstrated an immense depth of character... of thought and of emotion.
his enormous rivalry with alain prost in the late 80's and early 90's... extracted every element of his genius.
but if there was one area where senna truly flew high... it was racing in the rain.
looking out of my commentary box, i saw the worst weather i'd ever seen... at any race anywhere in the world.
it was embarrassing to me as an englishman... that everybody who thinks it rains all the time in england... were being proved right.
he was pissed off all year about having this ford engine in his mclaren... because he wanted the championship, but he knew he wouldn't make it.
all he could do was to wait for special circumstances... and then show everybody what he could do.
i had to go to the pits to give the trophy away... and i should've still been in hospital because of a heart problem i had.
but when i got on to the podium, i forgot about being ill, i felt 18 again.
because he would go to the limit to get what he wanted.
as a child, i remember he was always training in his go-cart.
as far as i remember he was always involved in carting.
before long, cart races in brazil and all around the world... became all too aware of the driver in the yellow helmet.
i met ayrton when he was kid driving in the carting races.
i was already painting helmets for fittipaldi, the formula-1 champion... and for nelson piquet.
i decided to use the colors of our country: green, yellow, blue and white.
ayrton loved the design and it became his trademark throughout his career.
i'd known him for a long time... because we did two world carting championships. ln le mans and estoril.
in '78 and '79, so this goes back to the very old days.
so when ayrton went to live in england, we missed each other a lot.
we traveled over there often and he came here when he could... so we could be close together.
when ayrton hired me back in 1984... he was very worried about his physical condition.
and about his health, because he was a very skinny man.
he was a very persistent person... because he went all out.
what made ayrton different from the rest was that he actually did it.
once i realized there was something special in that... i really focused and tried to learn about myself.
you learn about your own limitations, about your strengths, your qualities... and, as a whole, trying to make yourself... a smoother person.
to have his first drive in a grand prix formula-1 car.
that first drive came at donington park in england... at the wheel of the williams fw-08c.
the model that took keke rosberg to victory in monaco earlier that year.
ayrton turned up, made himself comfortable in the cockpit... remembered all the instructions about what everything was for.
he did an out-and-straight-back-in lap to check over the car mechanically.
then he just went off a second quicker than the car'd ever been around there.
on that particular day, it was that his brain was in control of everything else.
he was ahead of the game, clearly belonged in gp car.
and then he went off to lotus and then to mclaren.
so it was quite a long while before we were able to offer him a seat in '94.
he went to toleman, it was fantastic to see another brazilian driving.
by instinct i was always more of a fan of ayrton... than i was of any other brazilian formula-1 driver.
i never saw emerson, but i had the chance to see nelson.
with ayrton it was different. i felt like he was driving tremendously... and that he was going to be a champ.
having a teammate like ayrton was very different from the old team i had.
also for formula 1 it was really exceptional... to have two drivers of this kind of caliber.
and he actually believed that he had a god-given right to win.
the main thing is to be yourself and not allow people to disturb you.
many times it's through a mistake due to your personality or character... or from interference that you get along the way... that you learn, and the main things is to learn from your mistakes and get better.
i believe in the ability of focusing strongly on something... then you are able to extract even more out of it.
his whole life was concentrated on winning the race, the championship.
he had no family, no children, nothing... so it looks like he was living only for that.
the hardest thing to do during a race is to maintain your concentration.
you have to concentrate at all times... and make sure you don't have problems that can distract you from the race.
in the time when we have these sophisticated racing cars... with skirts and electronic suspension... to raise the car for the straights and lower it before the corners... you have to do many thing on the car.
obviously, any driver to take part in a car race... whether formula 1 or another category is exposed to risks.
this profession requires that you be fast... that you perform, that you're consistent and intelligent.
as a racing driver one has to be in tune with your emotions, your body... your mind, your psychology, all these things.
everyone following f-1 ... recognized that senna was the master of qualifying.
if you go for a corner on qualifying tires... with extra horsepower and you've never had that all weekend... how do you anticipate how fast you can go?
now that's an act of trust or faith or whatever you want to call it.
he explored his ultimate capabilities more than any driver seemed to have.
i don't think he was the best driver in setting up a car... but when it came to driving, mentally... getting the pole and being quick in one lap, he really was the best.
so i don't think i learned very much, because... it's a bit easier to learn about the car and how you can improve the car... than about the mental aspect, because you can't change it just like that.
it helped him to improve the lap times... it helped him break records and brought him many victories.
because his concentration level was at a maximum... through meditation and by controlling his breathing.
he'd go on to take victory in the principality a record 6 times.
but in his first mclaren outing, prost thought he had him.
i couldn't imagine he'd come back like that, since he wasn't doing that well.
later he said in the press conference... that he went outside the car.
and he looked at the car and saw how it was behaving on the track.
he then realized what he was doing wrong and what was wrong.
because it requires more if you want to be ahead and win.
the uncanny will to win that he had i've never seen in another sportsman.
ayrton is willing to risk that little bit more than anyone else.
for him coming in second, was like the first place for losers.
he knew that to be world champion he had to beat alain, who was number 1 .
i remember one race, ayrton always used to try so hard in qualifying... that before he took off his overalls, he'd sit in a corner of the truck... to get his adrenaline levels back down.
it was cerebral, meaning he used his head at all times.
but he did so with more dash and determination than you saw in alain.
very, very smooth, very experienced... up against senna from south america with a very different temperament.
so it couldn't have been better from a commentator's point of view.
the fight that we were fighting so hard... was putting the performance of the car and the team on a very high level.
if you talk about the briefings, we were spending 3, 4, 5 hours in the briefing.
more than anything you need a very clear mind... to understand when to be aggressive and when to be calculating.
to win a championship, you need the combination of those elements... in the right dose at given moments.
his love for brazil and its people was reflected in how they felt about him.
he was idolized by the ordinary people in the street and he still is today.
it's an honor for any brazilian to have a picture in memory of him.
i think he was one of the best brazilians in the world... and everyone should honor him because he's the best.
the best remembrance i had... was when i stayed with him that weekend in his farmhouse.
we had a storm and the lights and the telephone went out of order.
to plant the seed he left behind and create the ayrton senna institute.
he was given the opportunity and he wanted to share that.
what made ayrton stand out amongst grand prix drivers... was that he knew there was something else outside formula 1 .
and i think he made that his mission in formula 1 ... to build a platform so that he could express how he felt about humanity... and things to do with people.
maybe his approach within formula 1 was ruthless sometimes... maybe not humanitarian even.
but there's no question that he felt a deep empathy with mankind... and with the problems in the world.
we'd land in england at about eight in the morning... and he'd be as fresh as a daisy and we were totally shattered.
my compliment to him... is to say that he was big enough to be little, if you understand what i mean.
in april 1994, owen flew senna to imola for the san marino grand prix.
ayrton always considered the circuit at imola as his home ground.
starting in '84, senna captured the pole position eight times in ten years.
first with lotus... then during the incredible series with mclaren... and finally with williams.
first there was the accident of rubens barrichello... and the day after roland ratzenberger.
ayrton had only met him the day before, because this was his first grand prix.
why don't you quit and i'll quit and we just go fishing?
if you asked him a difficult question, he wouldn't answer immediately.
so this odd sort of friendship we had... was a little bit hidden by all the fights we had.
in the last two weeks, we were good but in a strange way also.
when they announced my name, the italians were jumping and shouting.
i was just in front of his car, and he was looking at me and laughing.
none of them were respected and idolized worldwide like senna was.
and the impact of senna's death on formula 1 in particular... motor racing in general and the world at large... was something that had never happened before.
it has never happened since and i pray it never happens again.
the imola circuit witnessed the loss of one the greats in formula 1 .
it happened ten years ago now... but the feeling is deeper and more intense.
things come up in our collective consciousness... that we were in danger of forgetting, like his tenderness.
like, what you're doing here and what all this stuff is.
why would i tell you, even if you could understand ?
then donald warned us the system started to display more than consciousness.
it started to display intention, but before we could stop it, it was gone.
one day david was on the system, and it wouldn't come when we called it.
we knew it was out there somewhere on the global net, but it wouldn't answer.
when you said it was targeting us back there, you meant an artificial intelligence.
donald gelman was tryin' to create a sentient ai, a program with its own consciousness.
one day, david was on the system and it wouldn't come when we called.
we knew it was out there on the global net, but it wouldn't answer.
the transfer of memory, of consciousness to the distributed system maintained by the ai.
imagine being mingled so completely with another, you no longer need your physical self.
mulder said that he found the system in an abandoned chicken farm in fairfax county.
then we can cut off the t3 and kill its communication capabilities.
the doctor asked and he was very cross when you refused to answer.
but he'll be here in a few minutes and you can tell him then.
he didn't quite invent it, but he's a silicon valley folk hero.
he was writing internet software even before there was an internet.
why would i tell you, even if you could understand ?
you just committed felony assault on a federal agent, followed by resisting arrest.
donald probably tried to feed this sector in over the net,
but it took too long, so the system was able to take countermeasures.
the doctor asked, and he was very cross when you refused to answer.
but he'll be here in just a few minutes, and you can tell him then.
dd deep in the dark your kiss will thrill me dd
[ beeping ] dd like days of old dd dd lighting the spark of love that fills me dd
what if she managed to establish an uplink, scully, a satellite transmission ?
mulder, are you telling me that you believe esther may have-- that she may not be dead ?
he didn't quite invent it, but he's a silicon valley folk hero.
he was writing internet software even before there was an internet.
then donald warned us the system started to display more than consciousness.
it started to display intention, but before we could stop it, it was gone.

what if she managed to establish an uplink, scully, a satellite transmission?
mulder, are you telling me that you believe esther may have-
but it 's the ones who face their fears who win in the end.
and the winners write the history books, and... in yours they'll just say, it was part of the scientific process.
claxton in bed with the energy companies that he used to regulate?
you know, when claxton was in office, he waged a virtual war... against the oil corporations, accusing them of fixing gas prices.
you guys have to tell me the next time you run off like that.
how does she expect me to feed the cat, if you don't tell anyone?
i'd offer you a drink, but my glasses are all broken.
russ mccullough is dead, they blew up a bar and he was in it.
i'll deal with mr. beltway, you get in there and stop the test.
the control room is this way, dc's office is up there.
i saw it with my own eyes, there was blood all over the place.
that 's terrible, but go to the police with that, tell them. 90%.
but i've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
i don't know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there.
but i've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
i don't know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there.
remember when they fought and broke up and we were stuck here all night with no food?
when ross said "rachel" at the wedding, i figured it'd happen again.
"the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe."
"if you win, slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, 'hi, phoebe'!"
remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in here all night with no food?
well, when ross said "rachel" at the wedding, i figured it was gonna happen again.
the nice bellman who had to drag our luggage to 10 rooms?
or the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas?
but i've been obsessing about it all day and would love not to talk about it.
uh, i don't know if this falls under that category but, uh, ross is right back there.
you know, i don't even feel like i know you anymore, man.
all right, uh, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time, all right?
but i've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
i don't know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there.
yeah, i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing.
ohh, i've always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey!
i mean, if they didn't change the glasses, who knows what else they didn't change.
come on sweetie, i just want this weekend to be perfect, i mean we can change rooms, can't we?
okay, but let's do it now though, because chopper 5 just lost it's feed!
hey, so uh, y'know how there's something i wanted to talk to you about?
do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this?
oh, i'm sorry, am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun?
the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms?
i don't know, how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas!
look, i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know,
i've been obsessing about it all day and i'd just love not to talk about it.
ugh, it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group.
i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go.
y'know, i-i don't even feel like i know you anymore man!
all right, look, i'm just gonna ask you this one time.
i talked to monica, look, i'm the one who made the choice.
i'm the one who's making things change, so i should be the one to y'know, step back.
the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe.
and if you win, you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say, "hi, phoebe!"
remember when they fought and broke up and we were stuck here all night with no food?
when ross said "rachel" at the wedding, i figured it'd happen again.
well, davey's still pining after lapooh but, you know, he's a tough little turtle.
you know how you said to do whatever it takes to fix my marriage?
no, i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator.
you know, at the taj mahal he has his own private glass elevator.
"the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe.

but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work.
and i do. i have to make this marriage work. i have to.
but i've been obsessing about it and would love not to talk about it.
i don't know if this falls under that category but ross is right back there.

da'an, the record shows that rho'ha accessed all the files on captain johnson before he vanished.
then, perhaps, rho'ha does not walk alone on his dark journey.
we had taken his life long before this... and of now, given him back his death.
the us leader, president thompson, has been under intense pressure to seek an inquest into the death of the victim of rho'ha.
well, i didn't figure mr. holbarth would stick you with that, ma'am.
i mean, he usually reserves midnight to 4 for sailors needing motivating.
i don't know why you wanna pay for them in a diner.
mr. roberts, if you have to ask that after six months at sea,
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
dear harm, two weeks out in heavy seas and i'm not the least bit seasick, but my bunkmate, lieutenant sarah williams, is begging me to put her out of her misery.
i guess all those sailors in my gene pool is the difference.
look, i'll grab my jacket, i'll walk you to your car.
an old shipmate of mine's in town just for the evening.
two years ago, she was coming back after six months of sea duty.
we were gonna get together, for a week up in her parents' cabin in maine.
he's demanding that lieutenant commander rabb be removed from the investigation, sir.
nobody pulls a jag officer off an investigation except me or god, and he hasn't asked.
he's one of those officers who doesn't get the word no matter how many times the navy puts it out.
you have no idea how difficult it is escorting a civilian on a tour of the flight deck during flight ops.
but lieutenant schonke emphasised that lieutenant lamm hadn't overtly harassed her.
she said that it was borderline and she wanted me to talk to him before she had to make it official.
i didn't think she'd leave the ship so soon after going off mid-watch.
we'd had a date for saturday night, and i didn't have her shore phone number.
he harassed her, he stalked her, and he chased after her the night she was murdered.
the victim told commander holbarth that she thought lieutenant lamm might harass her.
if i don't report you, agent turkey will make sure that the seahawk's skipper does when he returns on monday.
that will give me 36 hours to find who killed diane.
well, commander holbarth's career would be over if it got out that he ignored lieutenant schonke's sexual harassment complaints.
in fact, i heard he and commander krennick talking about it right after lieutenant lamm's suicide.
your failure to address my sexual harassment complaints leaves me no choice but to seek redress through official channels.
i deeply regret having to take such action, but unless you can convince me otherwise,
i will be filing a complaint when we dock at norfolk.
i do this not for myself, for this cruise is nearly over, but for those female officers who will serve under your command in the future.
it also set him up as the fall guy for her murder.
then you killed him and you made it look like suicide.
you act like you are above it all, but i think you are so immature
you know nothing about me, so why act as if you do?
that's what i'm saying, you met me on your first trip alone
what i'm saying is that i met you before, and you're drunk now
he bears such grudge for not getting tenured at a university
he earns next to nothing and yet he has to have sashimi
we even had a secret wedding ceremony here like young lovers
come to think of it, we did all sorts of things
when he woke up at the hospital, they asked his name and number, to see if he was conscious
the first words out of his mouth were my name and my number
you act like you are above it all, but i think you are so immature
you know nothing about me, so why act as if you do?
by the flower bed, looking at the flowers where did the mysterious light come from
now is the time to wash away everything that is tainted in our hearts in this clear stream
the things you say, as if worried about me, disgust me
you act like you are above it all, but i think you are so immature
that's what i'm saying, you met me on your first trip alone
what i'm saying is that i met you before, and you're drunk now
he bears such grudge for not getting tenured at a university
he earns next to nothing and yet he has to have sashimi
i don't want to hurt your feelings for him but he's deep in debt.
he owes money to the bar, the owner, me... and some real tough cookies.
i'll spare you the sob story, but... it's a delicate matter.
i don't want to hurt your feelings for him but he's deep in debt.
he sets time aside for his mother and brother... i'm not worthy to meet them.
he disappeared last weekend and brought me back a rather ugly ashtray.
well, i was pretty much banking on you finding it cute.
well, traditionally, you know, repeating a grade isn't exactly a turn-on.
the thing that drains the life out of them is despair.
i mean, kids come here, and they got nothing to go home to, and... this ends up being the last stop for a lot of them.
i just wanna be alone and quiet in a room with a... chair and a fireplace and a tea cosy.
i don't even know what a tea cosy is, but i want one.

i appreciate your efforts to keep the vampire population down until buffy returns, but...
well, if anything should happen to you and... you should be killed, i'd take it somewhat amiss.
they order you around and make you have organised "fun", and i use sarcastic quote marks.
plus the fact there are cockroaches in mexico big enough to own property.
i don't even know what a tea cosy is, but i want one.
instead, i keep getting trouble, which i am more than willing to share.
the slayer always says a pun or a witty play on words.
and i think it throws the vampires off and it makes them frightened because i'm wisecracking.

neither one of us could afford it, but we do have the same taste.
we sort of talked a bit and kind of hit it off.
get to it or i may teach you even more about torture.
one of the shadow priests made a servant woman confess... that something called the essence was taken to earth realm.
on your knees, kung lao, or the next one will be in your heart.
if i were an assassin, the first fan would've taken off your head.
he gave me a pouch containing the remaining essence of our once beautiful realm.
he told me i must take the essence away for it would wither and die... as nothing of beauty could survive in the outworld.
when shang hands the essence to shao kahn, we are both dead.
go back to outworld and tell the emperor that the essence no longer exists.
it seems like every week a whole new set of problems would just crop up out of nowhere.
except for summer where nothing seemed to happen for months at a time.
the only thing between him and us is a thin layer of gabardine.
i'm out there, jerry, and i'm loving every minute of it.
allison spoke to me and she wanted me to speak to you.
so allison and i think that the best thing to do is just make a clean break.
we bring her to the party and she tells me what gwen is saying about me.
she's not a novelty act, george that you hire out for weddings and bar mitzvahs.
what do you think, i've never ridden in a cadillac before?
believe me, i have ridden in a cadillac hundreds of times.
over the last nine years, we've had a lot of experiences.
and i'll tell you, when you stop and add them all up that's what you realize.

he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
there was, uh, a gnarled old tree... and a carved rock and--
you know, hercules, i've never felt... such a feeling of peace and tranquillity.
you don't happen to have any idea how far north we're going, do you?
this is really funny, because usually on our journeys i'm the one that does the babbling.
maybe we should go with you, in case you run into more soldiers.
herc-- iolaus, i know your dream is important to you, but we're talking children, babies at risk here.
look, there's no reason for all of us to escort uris's family.
why don't you go on ahead and see what you can find out?
but the rest-- if i were the captain of the guards, and my king made a request of me,
i should think that i'd do all in my power... to keep my king happy.
i would make it my life's task... to take my well-paid soldiers and seal the borders.
i might even send my elite cavalry unit into the next province... to seek out any families who might have gotten away.
polonius, we waited so long for this-- an heir to pass on our kingdom to.
we can't let this slip away from us now, can we?
maybe i should be an oracle, because i foresee a good year for us, polonius.
you'll have an heir to your throne... and your revenge on hercules.
all we have to do is to make sure... he knows we're holding the infants in our castle.
a clever trap by your soldiers, and hera's men will roast hercules... like venison.
you don't even know if there is a bus, or when.
what if it doesn't leave for hours and we have to wait?

they didn't take a thing with them, and didn't say a word.
a voice? it said, "this is what you get... ...for taking so long." it's him.

squeezing the trigger and hoping it doesn't splash any blood onto the suit.

a half-remembered story from your childhood that surfaced because of this case.
in ancient times the greeks always had to help vagabonds because they never knew if the beggar might be one of their gods in disguise.
nowadays, itjust seems safer to assume that every stranger is a devil.
you know, it's kinda neat to be able to talk to someone about this stuff and not feel like a sicko.
perry, why do you think you possess this morbid fascination with serial killers?
an inability to hold a steady job or relationship with women.
dreaming about turning your masochistic mutilation sex fantasies into reality, to say nothing of the fact you drive a van and keep duct tape in your glove compartment.
his first victim was a prostitute, as was to be expected.
i was concerned that his initial reaction was a tad over-sensitive.
you get used to it and eventually life doesn't seem as good without it.
i wanna become the most prolific serial killer in the history of this country.
unfortunately, that very next night he was right back to prostitutes.
so clichéd was this guy that he often returned to the scene of the crime because, you know, that's what killers supposedly do.
well, it's my attitude that sometimes you have to sacrifice self-satisfaction for a sense of poetic justice.
and that, my friend, is why johnnie mack potter remains the reigning, and still undisputed, serial killing champion.
i mean, i ask you, what evil genius invented the alarm clock?
no other creature but man could concoct a device that interrupts, daily, their only natural state of happiness.
their efforts to distance themselves from their animal natures only show what dumb beasts they truly are.
required to cover their god-given bodies, they also tie a superfluous constricting piece of cloth around their necks for no reason whatsoever.
i fail to see how any of this leads them to eternal damnation.
they fail to see it too because they think they're livin' a so-called normal life.
you have no idea the torments they'll put themselves through for the sake of such a life.
they'll spend a third of every day at a place they can't stand doin'stuff they don't want to do, all in the name of earning a living.
they sin so often, it's just become another part of their routine.
whatever passion compelled them to commit such acts has long since passed away.
having him fall asleep is not the same as having him fall into the fiery pits of hell.
how can you ruin them if you don't interact with them?
i read an article about people using st john's wort to cure depression.
in the middle ages, humans used it and claimed to see devils.
why be a devil if you can't have a little fun?
i'm familiar with your methods, and i find them crass and unpoetic.
on page seven, your use of the word "crap" is unacceptable to broadcast standards.
no, it is acceptable to use "crap" only when not referring to defecation.
it was obviously his first time in such a place, and i always get a kick out of seeing someone's first taste of forbidden fruit.
but this yokel doesn't sound anything like the man we saw.
now here i am scaring wide-eyed innocents back to the other side.
in any case, i was feeling very vulnerable at that particular moment.
i know, but there are some places where women don't belong.
we sat at this very table and i said to her
i'm just brewing up a fresh pot, sir, and the apple fritters need to cool down.
kid, if i wanted your life story, i would have bought the book.
in ancient times the greeks always had to help vagabonds because they never knew if the beggar might be one of their gods in disguise.
nowadays, itjust seems safer to assume that every stranger is a devil.
as it turned out, the kid not only had an interest in serial killers, he once made contact with one.
this was made in prison by johnnie mack potter, the most prolific murderer in america.
well, he used to be the janitor and mascot at my school, roosevelt high red devils.
he was caught the year before i attended, so i never met him, but every day i'd walk down those hallways,
you know, we were so envious when man was given free will, but what has it brought them?
the belief that life's determined by everything other than their own will.
his first victim was a prostitute, as was to be expected.
i was concerned that his initial reaction was a tad over-sensitive.
you get used to it and eventually life doesn't seem as good without it.

and that, my friend, is why johnnie mack potter remains the reigning, and still undisputed, serial killing champion.
no other creature but man could concoct a device that interrupts, daily, their only natural state of happiness.
and no doubt the evil genius's evil twin contributed the snooze button.
used in a regiment of self-inflicted suffering, all in the name of vanity and rock-hard abs.
their efforts to distance themselves from their animal natures only show what dumb beasts they truly are.
required to cover their god-given bodies, they also tie a superfluous constricting piece of cloth around their necks for no reason whatsoever.
i fail to see how any of this leads them to eternal damnation.
they fail to see it too because they think they're livin' a so-called normal life.
you have no idea the torments they'll put themselves through for the sake of such a life.
how can you ruin them if you don't interact with them?
every once in a while i interact with them, but nothing too evil.
i just find your laissez-faire style as lame as the souls you're destroying.
why be a devil if you can't have a little fun?
in the old days, if you materialized before them they all knew what they were seeing - the external evidence of a demon trying to tempt their soul.
but nowadays they all assume it's internal - a psychological breakdown manifesting itself in the form of a visual hallucination.
it was a quiet night and i was biding my time, on the lookout for my next damnable soul.
it was obviously his first time in such a place, and i always get a kick out of seeing someone's first taste of forbidden fruit.
i know, but there are some places where women don't belong.
we sat at this very table and i said to her
i don't know why you didn't let me bring my golf clubs.
jake, we're here to see my family, not to have fun.
and as we share the joy of this lovely young couple, brian and erin, we are compelled to ask, what is love?
yes, love, like a tiny rivulet which begins in a high mountain, and only after twisting and turning for thousands of miles, overcoming uncountable obstacles, must eventually meet, and merge, with that great ocean of love which is its birthright and its destiny.
when i was a kid, with helen and rita going at it all the time, all they left for me to do was to supply the color commentary.
then, one day, i found myself all grown up with my own point of view, and feeling no particular obligation to listen to anyone else's b.s. ever.

"servicing" his older brother... and promptly shipped off for 18 months of schock treatment.
earlier tonight, on the popular chart show 'top of the pops', newcomer brian slade... performed his hit single 'the whole shebang'... dressed in platform boots and wearing glitter eye make-up.
a spokesman for the show, known for showcasing pop's brightest stars... says they've been deluged with calls all evening.
see, jack fairy had also come to london in the swinging sixties.
and in crowded clubs or hotel bars, this shipwreck of the streets... rehearsed his future glory.
it was the most stimulating and reflective period of our marriage.
"thank you and welcome, pop pickers, to 'pick of the pops'."
i just happen to like boys as much as i like girls.
and seeing as my wife feels pretty much the same about such things...
that man, sitting over there in the white suit... is the biggest thing to come out of this country since sliced beatles.
outside this country, no one knows who the hell he is.
and so if, in that probability, an interest arose... in which brian would serve on some projects, possibly, though not exclusively... as...we're taking our lead from you here, curt... possibly as producer on that project.
how might that scenario, purely hypothetically... how might that scenario appeal to you at this juncture?
i am not really myself except in the midst of elegant crowds... at the heart of rich districts... or amid the sumptuous ornamentation of palace hotels... an army of servants and a plush carpet underfoot...
what is true about music is true about life: that beauty reveals everything... because it expresses nothing.
brian is a grown man and... fully capable of shagging whatever he fancies and... exceedingly partial to the practice.
now, just because someone sees, you know two naked people asleep in bed together it doesn't necessarily prove sex was involved.
"...and due to the overwhelming demand, there will be additional shows added whenever and wherever possible."
"regrettably, mr stone only has time for a few brief questions this morning as he has a plane catch to zurich."
where did you get the idea for such a spectacular stadium show?
to tell you the truth – it's a bloody pain in the ass!
"and 'lipstick traces', his last album was just... it was just something special."
"it's an album that's like, appealing to so many people like that."
"a palpable whirl of anticipation can be felt outside london's lyceum theatre..."
"...as fans await the final show on slade's smash world tour."
"security around the performer is tightened following a recent bbc interview..."
"...in which he admitted to premonitions of being assassinated on stage."
"and heading up this flash stampede is none other that pop-giant brian slade..."
"whose stylish escapades have paved the way for a whole new breed of performing artists..."
"...from curt wild and the flaming creatures to jack fairy and polly small."
"thanks to slade, today's youngsters are singing a whole new tune."
"...a long grey coat with a led zeppelin record under your arm."
"everyone is into this scene, because it is supposedly the thing to do right now."
"and made sin so marvelous and evil, so full of subtlety."
"it seemed that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own."
a figure of some ill repute in the slade family, after she married a cockney... in the entertainment field and followed him off to deptford.
brian's tender introduction to the theatrical underworld... would leave a dramatic impression.
he despised the hypocrisy of the "peace and love" generation... and felt his music spoke far more to its orphans and its outcasts.
his revolution, he used to say, will be a sexual one.
curt wild, founder of the influential garage band the rats... came from the aluminium trailer parks of michigan... where rock folklore claims far more primitive origins.
according to legend, when curt was 13, he was discovered by his mother in the family loo...
"servicing" his older brother... and promptly shipped off for 18 months of schock treatment.
the doctors guaranteed the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him.
a spokesman for the show, known for showcasing pop's brightest stars... says they've been deluged with calls all evening.
the next day every schoolgirl in london was wearing glitter eye make-up.
it was new year's eve 1969, the start of a new decade... and everywhere you went there was this sense of the future, the feeling in the air that anything was possible.
see, jack fairy had also come to london in the swinging sixties.
so to cope with this evolutionary paranoia... strange people are chosen... who, through their art, can move progress more quickly.
it was the most stimulating and reflective period of our marriage.
"thank you and welcome, pop pickers, to 'pick of the pops'."
"i'm davy rocket and we have a very special show for you today..."
well thank you, sir, and no, it doesn't concern me in the least.
i should think that if people were to get that impression of me... the one to which you so eloquently refer... it would not be a wrong impression in the slightest.
and seeing as my wife feels pretty much the same about such things...
i should think we've been able to make a fairly decent go of it so far.
how might that scenario, purely hypothetically... how might that scenario appeal to you at this juncture?
what jerry's trying to say is do you want to come to london to cut a record?
but now i'm on the methadone and i'm getting my act together.
you come here and say you wanna help and i say, hey, far out.
every great century that produces art is, so far, an artificial century... and the work that seems the most natural and simple of its time... is always the result of the most self-conscious effort.
i am not really myself except in the midst of elegant crowds... at the heart of rich districts... or amid the sumptuous ornamentation of palace hotels... an army of servants and a plush carpet underfoot...
you are contractually bound to finish the maxwell demon tour as maxwell demon.
jerry, i'm telling you, it's just getting far too out of hand...
to tell you the truth – it's a bloody pain in the ass!
the whole thing takes six full size rigs or three chartered planes to transport.
but as long as he could remember, jack fairy knew better.

i'm gonna try and get you some water or something, okay?
eddie was screaming about that pick-up this morning, and joe borrowed it and we already had sold it.
but you know, it still had a dent that we had to fix.
anyway... if you find out what happened, would you let me know?
so i can pass it on to shirley, that's terry heller's wife.
the lord make his face to shine upon him and be gracious to him.
the lord lift up his countenance upon him and bring him peace.
well, that's not possible because my husband always paid the premiums on time.
that much i know for a fact so there must be some mistake.
look around, shirley, 'cause this is what he left you with.
that's always been your trouble, not a brain between your ears.
you're gonna have to think about what your next move is.
mom, i can't think, 'cause i'm stupid... or so you keep telling me.
on paper we got two rival gangs nobody gives a darn about, maybe trying to knock off the same bank.
but i know it's about stein's gallery, which happens to be across the street.
i need you to understand what's driven me... what is driving me to find out who killed my husband and who killed your husbands, too.
i think they were going to break into arnold stein's art gallery.
i gotta refund that guy's deposit on his truck thanks to you.
don't even think about asking for severance, 'cause you owe me money.
and since i lost my husband, i've been a bit stranded here.
when i close up shop, every dealer in the neighborhood knows i'm going to an auction.
as i explained before, and it really is very clear in the instruction manual, page 142.
yeah, well, i'm on page 142, mr. samson, and it doesn't make any sense to me.
what gives you the right to slap me around like that?
i am older, i am smarter, and i am paying you 1,000 bucks a week.
i don't think he was ever gonna come back to me.
i don't know what i did or didn't do to make him hate me this much.
i can understand dolly having cold feet after all she's been through with harry.
but that does not mean that we can't try it, even if dolly's not up for it.

and was being considered by the picasso museum in barcelona and even here, the boston museum of fine arts was considering it.
as you can see, i have a system of lasers crossing the vault.
any object or body crossing the laser will set off the alarm.
if the doors are open, the security company will call within two minutes.
i must give them an "all-clear" code which is changed daily.
one of us will be lowered down through the air-shaft into the vault.
the other two will have to get into the gallery, open the vault and turn off the lasers.
one of them walks around all night and the other one stays inside.
how are we going to get by them to get to the vault doors?
i knew exactly what they were, of course, and i knew how valuable they were.
so, i called up lieutenant maynard immediately and we handed them over to you people.
i can't say i didn't know about it, but i don't remember taking part in it.
i get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly, but i don't remember selling my soul cheaply.
which i need because everything i made when i was young,
i either drank away, snorted up my nose, or drove in the pool.
and the more of it you have, the more of your personal potential you're gonna tap into.
but see, energy's like the gas that drives the car in traffic.
to ask a couple of quick questions about your shopping practices.
do you visit the supermarket more than once a week or less?
jerry stahl was a successful television writer making $5,000 a week.
at the same time, he also had a $6,000 a week heroin and cocaine habit.
well, tom, the beauty of hollywood is that everybody's so self-obsessed, they don't really notice what anybody else is doing.
so basically, they come filing in in the morning with their cappuccinos and croissants, and i'd come bouncing in with my heroin and syringes, and pretty much lock myself in the office and get really pleasant for about an hour and a half.
♪ oh, i don't want to be your punching bag ♪
♪ your complacent little friends are so tragic and sad ♪
just in the middle of a show, for no reason whatsoever.
we're talking it's you and bert, you and bert, boom, boom, boom.
but see, energy's like the gas that drives the car in traffic.
you don't want to run out of emotional gas when you're climbing the hill of success.

if sandra is o. k, you can see nina come when you want.
i have a kid in marin, i know what it is.
its funny, dark book, permanent midnight bluntly tells its exit from the abyss of drugs.
when in hollywood and that works on the successful series, how do you get taking drugs and writing?
in hollywood you are so narcissistic we do not notice the others.
they arrive with their cappuccino in the morning and i tumbles with syringes and my hero.
her late husband was a croat, she's our. -ours, my arse, with such behaviour!
you'd be better off getting your gun and defending those people there.
but unjust and unprovoked sanctions won't brake serbia, whose people are fond of saying:
no one can harm us, we are stronger than destiny, let them hate us, those who don't like us...
grassing people up took first, second and third place with you, mate!
-you know, in the west, a serb was treated like a gentleman.
it took my stupid dad ten years to make it from a first sergeant to a sergeant mayor.
and look at me, folks, then judge who got it right!
like many of us, he decided to help our people to defend hearth and home, along with our ancestor's graves.
ljubisa kurcubic kure, in a word, a knight in a shining armour, a true patriot!
for two months, leper face talked bollocks about some fella who did some granny in.
and then he apparently wondered if he should've done it in the first place.
there was no should i, shouldn't i, i just went for it.
but i didn't feel the need to write a book about it.
you don't give a toss about the sacred land of kraina!
half a million people have left their homes and are on their way to serbia...
i suppose they want to say that life's a wonderful thing.
it was a shitty day outside, but at least there's a couple of doves.
just don't pretend to be a geezer 'cos you're a cunt!
why don't you pretend to be your mum so we can shag you!
you, mice, if you wanna be cool, then i'm definitely your idol.
i'm only sorry that i haven't been abroad, but you can't do everything in life, can you?
my dad was angry with the army for forcing him into early retirement.
thirty fucking years waiting for war and he didn't even get a look in.
when we get rid of the ustasha's, we'ii build a nicer one, iike paris.
the liberation of serbian vukovar from the jaws of the ustashan monster is becoming an inevitable reality.
no one can harm us, we are stronger than destiny, let them hate us, those who don't like us...
the wisdom fo the people is much more powerful than american forces.
have you ever wondered why there's no shagging in old american films?
that's because kagny and bogy didn't want to give away their trade secrets.
of course uncle kure was a maniac, someone who lives at a hundred miles an hour, who doesn't give a fuck about anything.
mother, buy me a gun, to kill my man, who cheats on me every night.
it is a good way of checking if you're a man or a pussy.
the problem is that most people find out they're a pussy.
planing a budget is the art of survival in the difficult circumstances our country is facing.
pension, five hundred and sixty four billion, eight hundred and thirty two million, four hundred and thirty five thousand, four hundred and seventy five and a half dinars.

i am pleased to kick off the 14th annual south park cow days.
cow days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble, gentle cow.
let me remind you those who decide to run against the cows do so at their own risk.
i remind you that three people died at last year's running of the cows.
whoever took the sacred cow just please return him, no questions asked.
you folks from out of town you're the only ones with a reason to take our cow.
ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to kick off the 14th annual south park cow days!
as most of you know, cow days is when we all get together to celebrate and thank the noble gentle cow.
i need 17 dollars so we can win terrance and phillip dolls.
kyle get back into the carnival this instant, you can't be out on the streets.
i know you're all anxious to get to the running of the cows, but let me remind you, those brave sould who have decided to run against the cows do so at their own risk.
i don't think i have to remind you that 3 people died in last year's running of the cows.
you get to pick between the barbie pocket mirror and the bon jovi toothpick.
no dude, i want the terrance and phillip dolls up there.
because you spent all of our money on those stupid rides fatass!
and either you're getting on a bull or i'm gonna break your fucking head open!
and then leonardo decarprio gave me a spankin for several hours.
- heey, how did you guys win all those terrance and phillip dolls?
beckett and sandoval were among the first group of human beings to be implanted with cvi.
they're our first opportunities to study the cvi's long term effect on brain.
the human spirit won't tolerate having its freedom of choice taken away.
so companion protectors like beckett and sandoval are now only serving the taelons because they want, and not because they are being programmed.
if you are found guilty as charged you will be sentenced to die alone, you family line dying with you.
if you are found innocent, you will be given a second chance.
it is our contention that siobhan beckett is guilty of the crimes as charged.
through this trial we will prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that lieut.
upon our arriving on earth, we have felt the pain of those among your species who were without basic sustenance.
your farmers have applied taelon science to ensure that every child on this planet will go to bed with a full stomach.
taelon benevolence, the accused never once wavered in her blind support to taelons.
and, when she was presented with the opportunity to be implanted with the cyber-viral implant,
beckett aggressively tried to persuade me to become a companion protector.
if you need a recommendation to further your companion career, it would be my pleasure to assist you.
and, in spite of this knowledge, was there an incident in which lieut.
beckett attempted to kill da'an when such an excessive force was not necessary?
well, lili told me that sandoval assumed she'd be climbing in a cave close to her home.
so he'll use belfast as ground zero and searching out from there.
having children was always the most important thing in siobhan's life.
it was the driving force behind her involvement in the anti-terrorist unit in ireland.
in spite of all the positive reinforcement, did you ever questioned the morality of your actions?
as a soldier i was trained to fight my instincts to question authority.
when the companions came and brought peace to ireland, out of gratitude i committed myself to them and to furtherance of peace.
but as time went on, and i became more involved in companion operations,
and i will not tolerate defense counsel using "what ifs" to prejudice this case.
i, and i alone, will decide what is prejudicial to this case.
yes, the landscape artist who sowed the killing fields of cambodia.
pol pot ordered his obedient soldiers to kill every man, woman and child who wore a watch or glasses, telltale signs of perceived intelligence, the dreaded enemy of progress, the seed from which all insurrection grows and every despots greatest fear!
what defense counsel would prefer is for prosecution to shed some light on this line of questioning or to move on, due hasty.
it a little late for that, it's indeed over 60 years too late.
the allies beat me to it at a place called nuremberg.
where it was ruled that crimes against humanity could not be disavowed under the guise of
that intangible force that allowed a mere foot soldier in vietnam stop the killings of mai lai;
that allowed king christian of denmark to defy the nazis and wear a jewish star;
a two-edged sword, leaving the pure of heart without guilt, and the heavy of heart without excuse.
for without free will there can be no conscious, and without conscious - no law, no order, and, certainly, no justice.
i'd like to add a final point to my submission, your honor.
watches are to eye glasses as fertilizer is to killing fields.
i'm afraid you leave this court with no option, but to find you guilty as charged and, as such, sentence you to death.
what you did we recognize you did with an open heart, giving up your free will for what you believed to be the betterment of mankind.
but you were brought to when i needed you the most.
if you ever loose your way, my son, look to the heavens,
the brains of the people who were implants are now starting to reject the particular functions of the cvi that runs counter to that persons' nature.
so now they are becoming more intelligent but resisting control by the taelons.
now that her cvi isn't telling her how to think, she must be questioning everything.
i checked at her apartment and didn't find anything, but i talked to one of her neighbors who said that they saw her leaving with the climbing equipment.
you have been charged by the people with having committed crimes against humanity, not limited to, but including, kidnapping, treason and murder.
if you are found guilty as charged you will be sentenced to die alone, you family line dying with you.
and we will prove that even in the face of mounting evidence against
taelon benevolence, the accused never once wavered in her blind support to taelons.
after the companions came and helped us form the united republic of ireland, there was no ira to fight.
can't very well fight for nationalism when you see the earth and its true perspective.
beckett attempted to kill da'an when such an excessive force was not necessary?
when da'an was cut off of commonality and regressed into the atavus,
i found him first and was reasoning with him when lieut.
beckett burst in and immediately began firing at da'an, even though, clearly, he posed to threat at the time.
beckett offered to help you to become a companion protector, did she say that she was helping you because she supported the taelon agenda?
her support of the taelons was implicit in her offer to help me.
this cave in the austrian alps has an unusually high concentration of ferrous oxide in the bedrocks supporting the cave.
now, it's significantly higher than any one of these other caves that she mentions here in the journal.
so, if she wanted to go to a place where it was hard to find her, this might be the one.
why don't you plot the cave she got listed and see what it looks like?
which means that sandoval may have not gotten to her yet.
was there any doubt in your mind about the commitment of the accused to the taelons?
i'm using these to understand your negative response to my physical overtures.
as i said in ireland, my duty is to the companions.
we desperately wanted to have a large family but weren't able to have any more children.
siobhan always said that she would make up for her dad and me by having 10 children.
it was the driving force behind her involvement in the anti-terrorist unit in ireland.
she wanted to bring her children up in the united ireland?
our scientists believe that the motivational imperative function of the cvis may be breaking down in some of our implants.
those implants would no longer be programmed to be loyal to the taelons.
to use all means available to prevent terrorist attacks on the citizens of ireland.
did you ever killed anyone in the course of your service with the unit?
i was fighting to protect the taelons, the beings that have brought peace not only to ireland, but to most of the world.
so, everything in your experience told you that you were acting in the world's best interest by joining with the taelons and ensuring their safety at all cost?
when the companions came and brought peace to ireland, out of gratitude i committed myself to them and to furtherance of peace.
but as time went on, and i became more involved in companion operations,
and i will not tolerate defense counsel using "what ifs" to prejudice this case.
i, and i alone, will decide what is prejudicial to this case.

for without free will there can be no conscious, and without conscious - no law, no order,
watches are to eye glasses as fertilizer is to killing fields.
your honor, i have only three words in defense of lieut.
what you did we recognize you did with an open heart, giving up your free will for what you believed to be the betterment of mankind.
and though we cannot condone you crimes against humanity, we can draw on one of your species most splendid qualities in altering this verdict,
i can live forever as an anonymous entity in the wired, and will be able to rule it with information.
what do you think a being like that should be called?
masami eiri's residual thought program will eventually be disinfected from the wired.
our client is working on a total rewrite of the protocol seven code.
i'd forgotten that the script writer also wrote all those letters.
you're not here so i can seduce a girl in love.
a fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth, the perils of choices we face in our youth.
but our story today is different in theme, for our hero had no choice, or so it would seem.
in spite of the spell, ella grew up strong of mind.
her gift made her obedient, but her heart made her kind.
elves, giants, ogres and humans used to exist in harmony, but when king florian was killed, allegedly by an ogre,
sir edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile all nonhuman creatures to the forest, keeping their land for himself.
what my unworthy opponent fails to realize is sir edgar has done a fantastic job.
he has driven the ogres out, and he has put giants and elves to work as laborers and entertainers.
therefore, if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have today's thriving free-enterprise system.
it's only free because we've enslaved the poor creatures and they work for nothing.
no, actually, i've never been comfortable with the whole adoring fan club thing.
perhaps that's why i find your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.
answer the door and tell her that you never want to see her again.
and tell her you could never be friends with an ayorthian.
girls, go and dust off your ball gowns and pack your bags.
i think i may have found you another chance at your future husband.
that's just a myth created by that stupid "elves and the shoemaker" story.
- do i look small enough to fit in a shoe?
it's not gonna boil if you stand there looking at it.
you couldn't show a picture of a big ogre heading our way?
i could see that, as you were dangling over the boiling cauldron, no doubt lulling the ogres into a false sense of security.
who's to say it wouldn't have worked if you hadn't come barging in?
it just so happens i was on my way to meet a certain royal someone in order to discuss some career options currently unavailable to...
slannen wants to petition the kingdom for the right to become a lawyer.
my advice to you would be to talk to my uncle.
i'm sure if you make a good argument, he'll come round.
well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot of people who have no say in the matter.
nobody should be forced to do things they don't wanna do.
it's not open to everyone, but i could probably pull a few strings.
char, i can't tell you what that would mean to me.
you know, she used to sing me to sleep every night.
my father used to sing to me, loudly and very off-key, but...
luckily, i've talked to them and they're definitely open for negotiation.
the only negotiations between me and the giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.
why not call them in now and take over the whole kingdom like we planned?
first we must find a way to get rid of the prince.
then edgar found out about the curse and he ordered me to kill you.
so i had to break up with you, even though i'm pretty sure that you're the best thing that's ever happened to me.
i wanted something, he was in my way, i got rid of him.
he wasn't fit to wear this crown, and you're not fit to wear this crown.
now it's back to the real world, all of you i must send, for i've only two words left, and they are: the end.
i would like to ask miss lee wei wei, upon completion oaths film, what's your feeling?
i saw you squatting and staring at the monitor, extremely tensed.
while the actors were acting, your face seemed to act with them.
it is about a japanese boy who met an orthopedic doctor in hong kong.
the orthopedic doctor took his air-ticket which he won in a carnival of a japanese company.
in his critical condition, he bumps into a "garbage man" played by kaneshiro takeshi.
at night, while he is sweeping the garbage, he finds this "thing".
but, to the garbage man, he's just picked up another piece of garbage.
while he is recuperating inside the closet, the two guys develop friendship.
i was transferred by my company from wanchai to causeway bay.
in these three months, every night i would see a sleepwalking girl.
but recently i have been shooting the same young man repeatedly.
he is with me every night... and goes to many places with me.
one sheep, two sheep, three sheep, four sheep, five sheep, six sheep, seven sheep
i feel that may be there is something wrong with me.
actually what creates this problem... is a photo of lee yat ping.
and what worsen the problem are the photos of lee yat ping with his family.
in these ten years, every night i have the same dream.
i see my wife fung's finger being cut off by someone.
she liked to see me wear the yellow wool vest knitted by her.
although i don't think... this yellow color will look good on men.
but when you want to die, and the god of death fails to arrive, it is exactly the situation now.
the shot is changed, tony leung still wants to continue talking.
when i was small, old people told me that, one's soul will be taken away by the camera when one takes pictures.
i don't know if it's true or not, but i really want to know.
during these two years of shooting, from the moment eric kot got in touch with wong kar wai till today.
after the release, everything, everything, the process is horrible to me.
i can see it now-- the lonely little girl befriended by empathetic aliens who teach her how to smile.
it's enough to make you go out and buy a television set.
they want to know why the giants are in fifth place.
would you please tell this fool to take his business someplace else?
besides, around here, when people look at me it's 'cause they admire me.
there, i'm just another colored boy that can hit a curveball.
i like the way you described them especially the neck ridges.
i'm going to do some sketches for you to take a look at.
i'm not going to stand here and let some craven fascist call me a pinko and get away with it.
douglas, um... what did you think of, uh... of my story?
well, then maybe you can explain what he was doing trying to break into this car here.
is that why you shot him, because he was breaking into a car?
i don't know how much more i can take, how many more friends i can lose.
every time i achieve victory, something happens and everything turns to ashes.
so i had too much sauerkraut on my franks that night.
that is the worst piece of garbage i've ever seen. i'll take it.
sure, they want to know why the giants are in fifth place.
would you tell this fool to take his business someplace else?
besides, around here, when people look at me it's 'cause they admire me.
there, i'm just a coloured boy that can hit a curveball.
accela, a type of smart supplement, uses nano-mechanisms to oscillate at a specific frequency within the body, triggering the secretion of a specific hormone.
it is said that when secreted, this hormone affects the time-sense... of the human mind, making it seem as if one's awareness is accelerated.
not only the consciousness, but the workings of the brain itself are altered, multiplying the brain's operational capacity by 2 to 12 times.
the nano-mechanism itself is destroyed by digestive juices within 24 hours, but it is unknown how long its effectiveness...
i can't say i didn't know about it, but i don't remember taking part in it.
i get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly, but i don't remember selling my soul cheaply.

brother sui and i are the best buddies in the coffee shop.
we've talked for such a long time and you still talk about him?

right, when i arrived her home with her... her daughter-in-law was giving birth to a baby.
that old lady couldn't help, so i carried her daughter-in-law downstairs.

if only we work hard together we can win this battle!
my father has lots of money i lend some to you
your father owes loan shark money he's being forced to death
it's like this an old lady was carrying lots of things
she didn't know how to take a bus so i led her to the bus stop
you know i didn't have education i don't know many words
now he asked me to give a name to the baby
nothing serious just take this as a lesson in your life
you must open your eyes when you meet a guy next time
i think you should understand though a girl dines with you that doesn't mean she will sleeps with you
sure, a girl must only sleep with a man after marrying him
why are girls always so happy when they meet bad guys?
look, she doesn't get mad when he peeps at her this way
but i have never thrown away the letter i wrote her... until that day, candy burnt it
forgot to bring the purse no problem, pay the bill tomorrow
we're used to getting up early we want to treat you to lunch
nibble fai says he's cooking today we must cook us a good lunch
after you're gone, i only know... you're so important to me
brother sui said he did that last night to encourage you
whether you're riding the surf at waikiki or dodging smaller deluges at poolside you'll be doing it in l.l.'s new swimwear this summer.
boldly cut and physique-friendly, l.l. lets you step out of your boring business clothes and become the person that you really are.
after a search that took in the entire bay police have found no sign of supermodel darci mason or her captor, the toyman.
the coast guard has expanded the search to include the open sea.
this locket belonged to my sister, sophia, and has been sealed for almost 400 years.
in two weeks, its magic will be lost forever unless someone can open it and release the power trapped within.
my parents are traveling for the summer and they just sort of left me here.
but it's totally fine with me because actually i can spend more time...
stoney, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
and you really have only two weeks to try and open it?
and surely you have been told what will happen if you freely tell a mortal that you are a witch and he betrays you.
no spell can take back the truth, so if he betrays you, you're stripped of your powers and cast out.
well, i go home in a few days and i'm afraid i'm gonna disappoint a lot of people.
well, maybe if you weren't so secretive, i could help you out.
we'll not make a dime if we don't hurry and figure out a way to get some proof.
we got to come up with something big, something to force her to use magic.
i think maybe he could be my grandfather or this woman could be my sister.
i don't know, i guess i'm just searching for a past.
thank you for showing me around today, i really appreciate it.
i don't know, i think i've been more distracting than helpful.
my family is so worried about me marrying a mortal but now you can tell them how happy roberto and i are gonna be.
i can't believe i'm gonna say this but sometimes parents aren't always wrong.
i mean, even if she was banished, she still could've seen roberto again.
do you think he's still out there waiting for her somewhere?
they would pass out if i ever went on a date.
my mother has got her heart set on me marrying a witch doctor.
"oh, by the way, sabrina, my friend and i know that you are a witch.
could we possibly get a couple of shots to prove it to the rest of the world?
paul and travis, they trying to prove that she's a witch.
they want to sell the story for a lot of money.
i probably shouldn't have eaten those aluminum cans and that dish towel.
well, i tried to stop you but you were fairly pig-headed for a goat.
my family will probably be upset with my decision but i know you understand.
if i learned anything from you, it's if there's a choice between love and magic, the answer is always love.
no, but i'd like to roll her friend in bread crumbs and dip him in marinara.
i can't share a room for two weeks with the jellybean queen.
my parents are traveling for the summer and they just sort of left me here.
but it's totally fine with me because actually i can spend more time...
no spell can take back the truth, so if he betrays you, you're stripped of your powers and cast out.
i always thought you had 12 hours to turn him into a pile stone.
most teenagers, when they screw up, they just get grounded, we get banished.
the part i hate is trying to remember all the spells.
all the places i need to go, the libraries, the archives.
they wouldn't have sent me to rome if it wasn't out there somewhere.
you know, i don't know if you know what i'm saying.
sure, it's like for every 12 insipid stories the school paper publishes about cheerleaders and pom-poms,
well, maybe if you weren't so secretive, i could help you out.
if i told you, i'd have to kill you, like it's so messy.
because i think your chance of romance is gonna go out the window when she finds out you're scamming her to make a bundle.
we'll not make a dime if we don't hurry and figure out a way to get some proof.
i can't believe i'm gonna say this but sometimes parents aren't always wrong.
you wouldn't believe who they think is a good match for me.
you haven't yet told roberto that you're a witch, have you?
of course i have, why do you think they're so worried about me?
as in the custom, you will be stripped of your powers and cast out.
or you have 12 hours to turn this traitorous mortal into a pile of stone.
i mean, even if she was banished, she still could've seen roberto again.
do you think he's still out there waiting for her somewhere?
they would pass out if i ever went on a date.
my mother has got her heart set on me marrying a witch doctor.
"oh, by the way, sabrina, my friend and i know that you are a witch.
could we possibly get a couple of shots to prove it to the rest of the world?
paul and travis, they trying to prove that she's a witch.
they want to sell the story for a lot of money.
i mean, we mean well, but the truth is, we have no idea what we're talking about.
listen, if i know one thing about women, and that's it, you can't make 'em like you.
mick schtoppel was brought in last year when we took down ilya benko.
we forged a relationship with him and sent him back out.
and until someone can convince me that that baby's going to be safe...
i'll tell as many lies as i have to to protect it.
i'll tell as many lies as i have to|to protect it.
it's not doing anybody any good|for you to do terry's bidding.
do you think i'll be on my best behavior... so you can give operations|a glowing report?
you're a little off|on how much i value my own life... especially if i have to live it here.
we've got two hostages on the third floor, above a nightclub.
birkoff has a full a e of the building and the surrounding area.
anyway, as i was saying, you know, the bloke said to me the same thing.
i said, "you say that once more, i'm going to kick your head in. "
i'll tell as many lies as i have to to protect it.
it's not doing anybody any good for you to do terry's bidding.
do you think i'll be on my best behavior... so you can give operations a glowing report?
you're a little off on how much i value my own life... especially if i have to live it here.
what we didn't know is what specifically red cell wanted from the nsa agents.
the data we retrieved from the party gave us the answer.
i'd like you to meet a remarkable young lady, mr. bates.
not only does she have level 4 clearance at the agency... but she's worked directly on the plimpton project.
there is a priest on the radio and that's all he ever talks about.
he says that the planets and the stars are all lined up the right way now.
we must be subjected to a judgment so severe that it will make a clean break with our guilty past.
the day of wrath has come, when the sun, and the moon and the stars will be darkened.
when the heavens are rolled up together and the earth is shaken.
the day has come when the unbelievers are to be cast out and utterly destroyed.
let's say that if you win the lottery with my money, you keep all the cash.
but tonight, when god destroys the world as we know it...
my precincts are the minutes and hours of the every day.
and as long as people have hopes and dreams, ...well, then i'll have my work to do.
"then i saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a book with seven seals.
and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice:
the names of the 144 000 good souls who will be saved from eternal damnation.
"then one of the elderls said to me 'do not weep.
...see, the lion of the tribe of judah, the root of david, ...has conquered, so that he can open the book, ...and its seven seals.' "
and every time he opens one of those seals, he brings the apocalypse one step closer.
they think i hold a grudge against humanity, but that's not it at all.
i just happen to think that this is a good system.
when i had opened the fifth seal, i saw the souls of those who had been slaughtered for the word of god.
savior lord, holy and true, how long would it be before you judge and avenge our blood on the inhabitants of the earth?
he can't just take things in his own hands and call off the apocalypse.
we can't afford not to go all the way on this thing.
i imagined the truth of the gospel to be self evident.
but i had no idea it would be perverted by the very people who claim to preach it in my name.
seems to me it is the last thing these people need.
what they need and what they want, are two entirely different things.
they want divine retribution and they're willing to pay for it.
i've been in the advertising business, so to speak, since the beginning, my idealistic young nazarene.
some claim to believe in a better and more effective way than the others...
and a new era of prideful self-assertion will be assured then.
and the innocent will be persecuted by the alongside of the guilty.
and nobody's gonna know what's right from wrong any more, even the—
the apocalypse will be a holiday compared to what's gonna happen now that you've become a traitor.
- i'm not a traitor but i'm not a judge, either.
- that depends on whether what you see out there is or is not an improvement on imperial rome.
though, personally, i couldn't stomach a saturday afternoon at the colloseum watching human beings being eaten alive by wild animals.
i'm falling now to exile, further from god than you yourself.
that doesn't make it any easier for the rest of us.
[man narrating] apart of me still believes eddie and i could have been... one of the more popular recording acts of the mid-to-late '90s.
but it's clear to me now that things happened the way they did for a reason.
you know, i'm dousing those fuckers with the cocktail sauce too.
now, i go to a restaurant, some monkey suit's bringing me five shrimp.
and for every shrimp cocktail rip off, there are 150 swindles... just like it.
the system is trying to fuck you any chance you get.
see, a couple of months ago a buddy of mine, a male nurse, he starts to work for this old, eccentric type of guy.
now, one day, my guy is doing some light dusting around the basement, and he finds that this old coot has a safe.
now, my buddy, he knows that i am up for anything.
so he says to me, "hey, chop, why don't you break into pappy's?" all right?
i crack that safe, which is as easy as opening a can of fresca, and gentlemen, it is raining cash in there.
man, i'm talkin'— l-i could make, like, a six-foot hoagie sandwich outta all the dough that is sittin' in that safe.
oh, gentlemen, i would be a whole heck of a lot richer than i am right now.
by the time i get home, i flip on dr. quinn, medicine woman, and i'm holdin' $36,000 dollars and methuselah doesn't even know he's missin' the dough.
asks me if i'll look after pappy while he's gone, you know, it's just a temporary kind of thing.
you know, i figure, look, i've done my share of male nursing in the past, and it's the least i can do for the old guy, you know.
considering i just stole 40 grand of his hard-earned female deer.
[laughs] and i'm gonna take more... the next chance i get.!
you know, his wife died a couple of years ago, you know, so he's real lonely and whatnot.
well, a lot of times, he'll just be lying there in a-a— in a puddle of his own make.
to repay your debt to me, i'm gonna give the two of you one week... to crack three safes of my own personal choosing.
and if you don't do this, then we are going to find ourselves... in a very uncomfortable situation.
i'm gonna go take a shit, then i'm gonna have a shvitz.
chop, is it too much to ask you to tell these guys where the first safe is?
i'm gonna come over to where you live, i'm gonna saw both your legs off, then i'm gonna beat you over the head with the stumps.
[samuel narrating] at this point, i was frightened like a little infant.
but that's not what i'm thinking about at this particular moment in time.
well, i am thinking about the thigh-high chicken parmesan sandwich between my legs.
the point is, she's got a sixth sense when thieves are around.
without some kind of telekinesis, there is no way that she could've known that we were in that house.
i'm gonna let you go with a stern warning this time.
but if you screw up on the next two safes, then i'm gonna kill ya.
i'm going to kill the both of you right fuckin' now.
do you think that i care that my kid is standing next to me?
'cause usually what that means is that, uh, it didn't pass some government regulation, something like that.
but you're not really gonna have a problem with the pants.
she fires up the grill, she turns to me, she points to the pants, she gives me— so help me to god—a thumbs up in appreciation of the pants, when all of a sudden, samuel, i don't know—
there must have been a little spark or something, because that's it.
the woman goes up... in a ball of flames, and i swear to god i think to myself,
i don't know, at that moment, it's got to be nothing but... the pants.
chop, what'd i say when they wouldn't pay me after the second safe?
"veal chop, those two guys have nuts the size of casaba melons.
he looks up to you guys, with you guys being safe men and all.
so, maybe ifhe knew you were gonna perform at his bar mitzvah party— make him feel a little more secure.
yeah, but that was only a test of you abilities, this one is the kahuna.
we'll get you one more safe, but then we're gonna really have to break the cord.
[samuel narrating] thanks to a strange and fairly awful twist of fate,
i now found myself caught between the twojewish gangsters in providence.
though i can't say i looked forward to telling hannah... that someone was gonna kill us if we didn't rob her dad's safe,
i hoped, naively perhaps, that she would understand that... my return to crime was a situation beyond my control.
hey, maybe we should, you know, leave... and let these guys have their time, 'cause— wait a second, wait a second.
[samuel narrating] it was at that moment that i thought of a plan.
- can i ask you to hang out for a minute?
- i had a clear vision... of the right thing to do.
so, he's at the palladium dancing away, passing the cup around like crazy.
he goes to take a shit, puts the stanley cup right in front of him in the stall.
some shine, one of leo's guys, happens to be in the city that night, steals the stanley cup from right between richter's legs.
[samuel chuckling] so you've set this entire thing up for us to steal from leo, and give the cup to berniejr?
i was actually thinking about not going out there tonight, sam.
chill out 'cause it's about that time... for the gayle family all-stars.
kicking things off is the man behind the man... spreading the ten commandments of love from above.
nobody laugh on the baby calf, show your love for ve-e-eal cho-o-op!
#i know you were right # and veal chop, even though he might suffer...
#believing for so long # a minor explosion in the next few weeks,
#i'm all out oflove # seemed so touched by his role...
#i'm so lost without you # in this gayle family celebration.
#i know you were right # and bernie the fat man who had gotten us...
#believing for so long # into this situation to steal the cup...
#i'm all out oflove ## that has since been returned to its rightful owner.
and though i could no longer speak for eddie, who had gone off to fulfill his destiny, of all things, i think that right then and there... for the first time in a long time,
a part of me still believes eddie and i could have been... one of the more popular recording acts of the mid-to-late '90s.
but it's clear to me now that things happened the way they did for a reason.

so he says to me, "hey, chop, why don't you break into pappy's?" all right?
i crack that safe, which is as easy as opening a can of fresca, and gentlemen, it is raining cash in there.
man, i'm talkin'- l-i could make, like, a six-foot hoagie sandwich outta all the dough that is sittin' in that safe.
i mean, this guy- this guy, he's like one of these guys- he saved up, like, 90 years worth of paychecks and they're just sittin' in that little unit, waitin'to be taken.
now, ya see, the only problem is... all i brought for transportation is... like, a little backpack-type of thing.
all of the sudden my buddy has to go out of town for a family-type situation.
asks me if i'll look after pappy while he's gone,you know, it's just a temporary kind of thing.
you know, i figure, look, i've done my share of male nursing in the past, and it's the least i can do for the old guy, you know.

you know, his wife died a couple of years ago, you know, so he's real lonely and whatnot.
well, a lot of times, he'll just be lying there in a-a- in a puddle of his own make.
i mean, do you have any idea what your parents would think if they knew you stooped to this?
my fucking parents haven't called me since we did our act at my dad's 60th birthday party.
you cannot take from the home... where my late wife and i raised the child that i love.
- you cannot upset the natural order... of the way things work...
i'm gonna go take a shit, then i'm gonna have a shvitz.
chop, is it too much to ask you to tell these guys where the first safe is?
we don't have a chance of cracking one safe, let alone three.
which is why- but you know who can do stuff like that?
you're gonna have to call him and tell him that we can't do it.
why can't you just call your fucking father and ask him for some help?
eddie and i talked it over... and we really think that because of the pappy technicality... and the... scheduling and everything... we're gonna kind of pass on doin' the safe thing.
samuel, i'm gonna put you on hold for a minute here.
the point is, she's got a sixth sense when thieves are around.
without some kind of telekinesis, there is no way that she could've known that we were in that house.
i'm gonna let you go with a stern warning this time.
but if you screw up on the next two safes, then i'm gonna kill ya.
you understand, i am in a kind of a business where...
i'm constantly getting shipments of merchandise- merchandise that i'm not, uh, in control of, per se, but merchandise that i'm gonna try and move off of my shelves nevertheless.
it's one of those grills, the gas grills like everybody got now, uh, with a butane tank underneath.
she fires up the grill, she turns to me, she points to the pants, she gives me- so help me to god-a thumbs up in appreciation of the pants, when all of a sudden, samuel, i don't know-
but to some people... it's as bad as if i pulled the trigger.
hannah, sweetheart, when you get a chance... you'll talk to your cousin ira.
chop, what'd i say when they wouldn't pay me after the second safe?
"veal chop, those two guys have nuts the size of casaba melons.

now, one day, my guy is doing some light dusting around the basement, and he finds that this old coot has a safe.
now, my buddy, he knows that i am up for anything.
about 6:00 in the p.m., 'cause pappy goes to bed at, like, i don't know, 4:00 in the afternoon.
i crack that safe, which is as easy as opening a can of fresca, and gentlemen, it is raining cash in there.
i mean, this guy— this guy, he's like one of these guys— he saved up, like, 90 years worth of paychecks and they'rejust sittin' in that little unit, waitin'to be taken.

do you think that i care that my kid is standing next to me?
i'm giving you guys two days to break into the next safe.
and if you don't do that, then i'm going to shoot you so hard through the skull... that your cock is gonna go spinning around like a fuckin' skil saw.
you understand, i am in a kind of a business where...
i'm constantly getting shipments of merchandise— merchandise that i'm not, uh, in control of, per se, but merchandise that i'm gonna try and move off of my shelves nevertheless.
it's one of those grills, the gas grills like everybody got now, uh, with a butane tank underneath.
she fires up the grill, she turns to me, she points to the pants, she gives me— so help me to god—a thumbs up in appreciation of the pants, when all of a sudden, samuel, i don't know—
but to some people... it's as bad as if i pulled the trigger.
hannah, sweetheart, when you get a chance... you'll talk to your cousin ira.
he looks up to you guys, with you guys being safe men and all.
so, maybe ifhe knew you were gonna perform at his bar mitzvah party— make him feel a little more secure.
yeah, but that was only a test of you abilities, this one is the kahuna.
we'll get you one more safe, but then we're gonna really have to break the cord.
though i can't say i looked forward to telling hannah... that someone was gonna kill us if we didn't rob her dad's safe,
i hoped, naively perhaps, that she would understand that... my return to crime was a situation beyond my control.
hey, maybe we should, you know, leave... and let these guys have their time, 'cause— wait a second, wait a second.
it was at that moment that i thought of a plan.
- can i ask you to hang out for a minute?
- i had a clear vision... of the right thing to do.
so, he's at the palladium dancing away, passing the cup around like crazy.
he goes to take a shit, puts the stanley cup right in front of him in the stall.
some shine, one of leo's guys, happens to be in the city that night, steals the stanley cup from right between richter's legs.
so you've set this entire thing up for us to steal from leo, and give the cup to berniejr?
i was actually thinking about not going out there tonight, sam.
chill out 'cause it's about that time... for the gayle family all-stars.
kicking things off is the man behind the man... spreading the ten commandments of love from above.
nobody laugh on the baby calf, show your love for ve-e-eal cho-o-op!
#i know you were right # and veal chop, even though he might suffer...
#believing for so long # a minor explosion in the next few weeks,
#i'm all out oflove # seemed so touched by his role...
#i'm so lost without you # in this gayle family celebration.
#i know you were right # and bernie the fat man who had gotten us...
#believing for so long # into this situation to steal the cup...
#i'm all out oflove ## that has since been returned to its rightful owner.
and though i could no longer speak for eddie, who had gone off to fulfill his destiny, of all things, i think that right then and there... for the first time in a long time,
well, my hormones went out of balance, and this is what happened.
since i came here, there has been one other person who knew about vicious.
for you who pass the ball are the one who catches it.
but it was not that he thought that there had caught the ball.
#on an average day above the united states, over 200,000 aircraft carry more#
#than 2,000,000 people guided by less than 3000 air traffic controllers#
i still find it hard to believe that you'd rather work on an air traffic control computer game than call real traffic.
- it pays real good and people seem to like it, and the kids think i'm really cool.
i'm glad your here there's something here, want to show you.
i've asked washington for permission to create an incentive, a reward system for the troops.
we're responsible for the airspace from gentral texas to the california border all the way to within five miles of the airport.
this is sector 14 high you will be handling all ifr traffic above eighteen thousand feet.
they're among the most highly trained people working for the federal government.
i got wind at eighty knots below three thousand feet and zero visibility headed straight for us.
did you know, that in the entire history of the f.a.
you're only one of three controllers ever to volunteer for that job?
twin east west, both seven thousand feet, rated level one, all weather.
standard localizer and glide slope secondary north and south at sixty two hundred feet.
navy seven twenty four, contact los angeles at one three three point two.
you, you want me to, keep an eye on his sector?
southwest three two eight, deviations left of course approved, when able fly heading two five zero and advise.
traffic at your three o'clock, eight miles, same direction, flight level two two zero.
cessna thirty one victor, traffic alert two o'clock, seven miles southbound, mode c, indicates seven thousand one hundred, appears to be descending.
american fifteen, negative, maintain heading, traffic two miles at your one o'clock.
united fifteen, traffic alert, turn left immediately at two seven zero descend to flight level two two zero, break.
alaskan two seven one, traffic alert, turn right immediately at zero niner zero and descend to flight level two eigrit zero.
air peru thirty five, i can not understand you, please repeat.
hello, control central, we're on our way to the airport, requesting permission and clearance to descend to one two one five zero.
i'm wired, i'm sorry, i'm talking a mile a minute, and...
is, is it still exciting for you, is, is it still a challenge?
you flights on the northeast ring, pass out more peanuts, you're the cabooses.
center, silver air four nine four, you're gonna ruin our on-time record.
- see if you can get a hold of the duty officer at the air force base, see if their tower can be of any help.
yes, i need central air operations for all the major airlines.
- well, the longest runway of the three of them is sbc thousand feet, sonoma doesnt even have emergency crews.
well if quinn doesnt get us back on line, we don't have a choice.
i'm going to direct dialog the senator and bylink conference you in two.
sir, i just learned that duiles and national are open, but the
- heading zero five zero, vectors to the approach course, descend to six thousand, you are two out of five, break.
united three twenty five, turn right heading two seven zero, you will be following traffic three miles at your nine o'clock.
to whoever can hear my voice, this is doctor shamaal mukurgee, m. d., licensed pilot.
i believe it would be prudent for me to land the plane now.
ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.
if you would please make sure your seatbacks and tray tables are in the full upright and locked positions for our descent into phoenix.
tell him we can get him to turn by reducing power in one engine.
you and i, we time the turn, lets say thirty seconds, one degree per second, then we can calculate.
what does he need to do to head two seven zero.
in this plane, at his current speed, i'd have to do a couple of test turns, but i'm sure i can get him going in the right direction.
a series of left hand turns at a controlled rate of descent...
he burns his fuel, drops under the ceiling, and heads right to the city...
your last turn is going to be approximately twenty seconds, on my mark.
correction, your last turn will be exactly-twenty two seconds, on my mark.
ah, it's just a bunch of ones and zeros and zeros and ones.
i still find it hard to believe you'd rather work on an air traffic control computer game than call real traffic.
they're among the most highly trained people working for the federal government.
i got wind at 80 knots below 3,000 feet and zero visibility headed straight for us.
but if they hear fear in your voice, they're gonna start to take things into their own hands.
so no matter how crazy it gets on there, you keep your voice strong.
listen, i may have been a little too ambitious in our capabilities to accept the final 50 aircraft.
the, uh, weather conditions have severely deteriorated, and i don't think... right.
it means that we don't have enough juice, so it's either your computers or the cooling system.
you can't have a cool center and have your computers work at the same time.
to all flights holding for phoenix arrival, listen up, and pay attention, ladies and gentlemen, or something's going to happen none of us wants to see.
we're sending you into twin lanes for slam dunks as fast as we can.
there's mcclain municipal, there's the national guard strip near sonoma, and the air force base.
no, the longest runway of the 3 of them is 6,000 feet.
ok, this is our runway, here are our thunderstorm cells right here.
ok, now, all the gum pieces are our aircraft above 15,000 feet, and the batteries represent aircraft on inbound marker under 10,000.
i'm going to direct-dialogue the senator and bi-link conference you in two.
sir, i've just learned that dulles and national are open, but the white house wants to replace you with the speaker of the house.
christina, here is another reason why you should have attended west point.
you've obviously failed to master command and control in a crisis situation.
i've been sitting on a hard plastic seat drinking bad coffee for three hours.
i was promised that my flight would leave here by 5:30.
now, stratton, i know for a fact the washington airports are open.
so what am i gonna tell the president about what happened here tonight?
ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the fasten seat belt sign.
if you would, please make sure that your seat backs and tray tables are in their full, upright, and locked position for our descent into phoenix.
when i was in the navy controlling, we had a tomcat lose all hydraulics.
we regained directional control by alternating the thrusts on the left and right sides.
we brought the tomcat back to the kitty hawk in 30-foot swells, and i gotta tell ya, our runway's a hell of a lot bigger than an aircraft carrier.
look, this might not be exactly how it happens, but we can talk him down.
poor man was so shaken by the parson's news that he went up to rolliver's to get his strength up for the journey.
he went to rolliver's to get his strength up for the journey?
tess ought to go to see this other member of our family.
likely enough there can be some noble gentleman wanting' to marry the maid.
but our mother said we ought to make ourselves known to you.
as we've lost our horse by a bad accident and are the oldest branch of the family.
supposing we walk around the grounds awhile to pass the time.
i really must think that i can't do something to help.
but it's more effective if you shape your mouth like this.
i taught you whistling, cousin, and one day i'll teach you kissing.
every saturday night the maids of the slopes repaired to the local market town for a night of drinking and merrymaking.
for a long time tess did not join the weekly pilgrimage.
maids don't think it's a spectacle to dance in the village.
they don't like see everybody see with their fancy men are.
jack was a milker here, and he deceived the girl like he deceived many another.
but he didn't reckon on having her mother to deal with.
well, he's gettin' on toward the end of his time, isn't he?
he's learnt near all he needs about the dairy inside of things.
tess, you understand i wish to marry you for entirely selfish reasons.
- angel, i want to tell you of my life before i...
well, we thought that we, at least, could do it up.
since you didn't want us to invite everyone and have a big party with fiddles and viols.
he was so good, and it seemed so wicked to try not to tell him what had happened.
if it were to be done again i should have to do the same.
can you forgive my sin against you, now i have killed him?
i thought you would be sure to forgive me, now i have done it.
his mind in turmoil, angel could think only of the need to protect tess.
to remove her from the vicinity of the guest house before the alarm was sounded.
and so they hastened away from the promenade, away from the town, avoiding high roads and following obscure paths with the vague notion that they might find some way to hide until they had been forgotten.
until they raise the alarm, so...we walk a few more miles.
you were sleeping so deeply, i didn't want to wake you.
i've been to a farm a couple of miles from here to get some food.
i formerly couldn't bear to hurt a fly, or a worm.
the sight of a bird in a cage often used to make me cry.
if they do look for us at all, it'll be at the southern ports.
when we get to the north, we'll head straight for a port, and away.
such happiness, but now... it's so solemn and lonely with nothing but the sky above our heads.
it seems there were no people in the world but we two.
- if it isn't your father riding' home in a carriage.
- he had to get a lift home because his horse has to rest today.
tess ought to go to see this other member of our family.
likely enough there can be some noble gentleman wanting' to marry the maid.
i heard mother talking about it when they came back tonight.
there's a rich lady of ours over at tantridge, and mother said you claim kin of her she'd put you in the way of marrying a gentleman.
supposing we walk around the grounds awhile to pass the time.
i really must think that i can't do something to help.
[ every saturday night the maids of the slopes ] [ repaired to the local market town ] [ for a night of drinking and merrymaking. ]
[ for a long time tess did not join the weekly pilgrimage. ]
they don't like see everybody see with their fancy men are.
- so it's, as you say as long as they didn't ask for it.
if you don't, will it be just the same for him?
for god's sake don't speak to me as saint to sinner, but as you yourself.
[ tess buried "sorrow" in that corner of the churchyard reserved for "weeds, ] [ unbaptized infants, notorious drunkards, suicides and others conjecturally damned." ]
[ some two years later on a thyme- scented, bird-hatching morning in may ]
[ she wanted to walk uprightly to make her life anew. ]
[ and so she made the long journey to the valley of the great dairies. ]
[ she had never before visited this part of the country. ]
[ and yet, she had this strange feeling of returning home. ]
if you did want to study something, history, any line of reading...
what's the point of reading some old book only to discover that there were thousands of people like you in the past.
the shade of his face fell on the wall behind her.
and she turned around and kissed the shade of his mouth on the wall!
jack was a milker here, and he deceived the girl like he deceived many another.
but he didn't reckon on having her mother to deal with.
well, he's gettin' on toward the end of his time, isn't he?
he's learnt near all he needs about the dairy inside of things.
at the dance on the green, but you wouldn't dance with me.
why didn't you stay and love me when i was sixteen and you danced on the green?
so you can imagine how i felt when... with all my fine sentiments, i, myself...fell.
briefly, i was alone in london studying, and i met a woman.
i sometimes used to feel that you regarded me more as an intelligence, than as a man.
- and i believe that i, in turn, regarded you more as an ideal, than a woman.
[ loudly ] oh, come, come, a man knows when a woman finds him attractive, as a woman does in reverse.
he may have known, but he knew i didn't love him.
if you could only half know how much i loved him, how desperate i was to have him, and how torn i was between my love, and how i wished to be fair to him.
[ mother sighs deeply ] well, what's done can't be undone.
more sorry than i imagined, because, you know, i couldn't stand the old...woman.
after her death, i went up north for a couple of years.
can you forgive my sin against you, now i have killed him?
i thought you would be sure to forgive me, now i have done it.

[ angel ] it's all shut up with the grass growing on the drive.
you were sleeping so deeply, i didn't want to wake you.
i've been to a farm a couple of miles from here to get some food.
i formerly couldn't bear to hurt a fly, or a worm.
the sight of a bird in a cage often used to make me cry.
on account of a discovery i made not some little time ago.
- i thought you might perhaps know, durbeyfield, that you are the lineal descendent of the ancient and knightly family of the d'urbervilles?
look, i won't walk another inch with you if you say jokes about my father.
- my dear brother, i know you think yourself agnostic, but surely you must agree that christianity has been and continues to be the dominant influence

but our mother said we ought to make ourselves known to you.
as we've lost our horse by a bad accident and are the oldest branch of the family.

every saturday night the maids of the slopes repaired to the local market town for a night of drinking and merrymaking.
for a long time tess did not join the weekly pilgrimage.
but under pressure from the others, she went along with them.
maids don't think it's a spectacle to dance in the village.
they don't like see everybody see with their fancy men are.
if i'd gone for love of you i wouldn't hate myself for my weakness as i do now.
my eyes were blinded by you for a little, that was all.
[ mr. kail ] that said jack dollop and the maid's mother.
jack was a milker here, and he deceived the girl like he deceived many another.
but he didn't reckon on having her mother to deal with.
- she marched up here with a great brass umbrella (
who don't know anything about us, or where we come from or how we two drive miles just so we'd reach 'em in time.
we didn't drive together entirely on account of these [ thunder ] precious londoners, tess.
tess, you understand i wish to marry you for entirely selfish reasons.

if it were to be done again i should have to do the same.
[ mother sighs deeply ] well, what's done can't be undone.
you should have known better than to elaborate such a thing when he couldn't have found out until it was too late.
- who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth,
- before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth,
can you forgive my sin against you, now i have killed him?

in the middle of the 19th century two brothers, orson and lorenzo fowler made and sold busts like this one.
supposedly by reading this map of the head and face you could evaluate someone's character and personality even predict his behavior.
this one, of course, is for intuitive reasoning and reflective faculties moral and religious sentiments self-esteem, power of will.
the system is called phrenology and it was one of the more popular theories about human behavior at the time.
they tried to sort out what in human behavior is fixed at birth and what is learned through experience.
it is a journey that twists and turns throughout the century as they and we go "in search of ourselves."
built as an arsenal in the 16th century salpetriere is anything but an ordinary hospital.
by the late 19th century it has been transformed into the leading center for the study of a strange and perplexing malady-- hysteria.
a malady which becomes the passion of its iron-willed director, jean martin charcot.
charcot, by all accounts of contemporaries was a coldauthoritarian fig ure and this is what caused him to be called the napoleon of the neuroses.
every physical and behavioral abnormality imaginable all without a traceable cause.
at the height of his career charcot turns his full attention to hysteria certain he can find its cause.
so that monday it might be in your neck and tuesday it might be in your wrist and wednesday it might be in your stomach.
and wherever this uterus happened to end up it created symptoms--
many doctors of the time, in fact believed that hysteria wasn't a real disease at all.
hysteria they dismissed as artificial or simulating behavior or perhaps, whent appeared in female patients as a form of sexual promiscuity that was therefore contemptible on moral grounds.
with the hindsight of a hundred years, of course this seems absolutely ridiculous.
these are totally separate pathological categories with different causes and different courses and different therapeutics.
a hundred years ago, however they were very indiscriminately lumped together.
charcot was going to take this vast amorphous wastebasket category of symptoms that was called hysteria ation of every clinician ustr in every major hospital for centuries, effectively and he was going to replace it with an elegant neurophysiologically based model
curiously, these symptoms seem to reflect the culture of the time.
he was producing photographs of beautiful, sometimes, women in very odd, but also in some ways very familiar positions.
he becomes a celebrity himself on the streets of paris and beyond.
renowned for his theatrical flair he attracts a wide audience every tuesday when he offers a lecture demonstration for doctors who come from around the world to see the proclaimed "prince of science."
sometimes patients he had never seen before and he would diagnose them.
and sometimes patients came in hehadtreated before and they would be hypnotized and charcot would instruct them to have hysterical seizures.
he did all the traditional things that people who are going to go into biological science would do at that time and he was trying to apply the thinking that he was doing to issues of behavioral abnormalities-- disturbances that he saw
in people that he was working with-- and he was very frustrated that although he could study the brain and try to look at its anatomy, he just ny way that that work could be directly applicable to the clinical problems that he was concerned with.
but perhaps what is most troubling to freud is something much closer to home.
many europeans-- from the man on the street to the medical elite-- share charcot's belief that certain types of people are more prone to degenerate into madness...
he senses an anti-semitic content in it and i'm almost certain that this is a personal factor that allows him osgood:
with this, freud concludes his colleagues have failed to explain mental disorders.
they have focused only on the physical body ignoring the complexity of the mind.
finding hysteria's true cause, he believes requires a radically new approach which freud will undertake in his private practice in vienna.
in the process, he will seek not only to explain hysteria but also present this century's first distinctly psychological theory of human behavior.
his first clue comes from fellow neurologist josef breuer and breuer's patient, bertha pappenheim referred to as "anna o."
to freud, the symptoms of hysteria reveal not what's wrong with a patient's brain but, in a sense, what had gone wrong in the patient's life.
they become symptoms of traumatic events emotionally intolerable events that a patient had repressed and therefore, that rather than finding expression in appropriateemotional aff... uh, expression found expression in bodily symptoms.
freud believes that symptoms are invariably born out of psychological trauma.
theeaningful in and of themselves but act as a road map to a submerged inner life that is troubled.
freud is attacked in his own time on a great many different grounds.
certainly the most immediate and the best known of the grounds was that his ideas were pornographic.
freud was able to create a kind of religious zeal in intellectuals many of whom were jewish or felt, in the context of viennese society somewhat marginalized.
here they could be at the center of something very exciting that was potentially going to transform the way in which we think the mind works.
"it was simply a case of looking death in the face and waiting to be hit."
early in the war an english psychologist named charles meyers-- based at the front-- reports seeing soldiers come out of their trenches with mysterious symptoms.
meyers speculates that these behaviors are somehow related to exploding shells on the front so he calls it "shell shock."
but then, soldiers who have yet to see combat appear with similar symptoms.
they absolutely couldn't believe that men could be hysterical and when they began to see the symptoms in men all the doctors said, "this looks like hysteria."
but at some level they would not allow themselves to believe it.
some 80,000 soldiers would succumb during the course of the war.
military doctors look long and hard for a physical explanation for the symptoms;
and suddenly here you have the war-- 80,000 shell-shock cases in the european armies.
so they provided an extraordinary wealth of experimental material, so to speak and doctors, at the same time that they were appalled were fascinated.
doctors try any method-- from crude forms of electric shock to talking therapy-- to restore the soldier to fighting shape and back to the front.
for thousands of soldiers like these it is the talking cure that works when nothing else does.
i think it showed up to people on a massive scale that emotional and environmental factors were extremely important in determining our mental lives.
it's as an experience of the war that psychology and psychiatry now cease being simply medical specialties applied to a very tiny number of people but a way to understand, in general ourselves, our minds and our world.
when world war i comes to a close a battle of a different sort begins only this time the weapons are words and the soldiers are scientists.
this new battle will rage between two diametrically opposed views of human behavior.
on one side are the scientists who see our personalities as unchanging, fixed at birth, biologically determined.
and on the other side are those who believe we can change that we are influenced by our experiences and what we learn along the way.
american soldiers return to a country eager to take its place as a leader in a rapidly changing world.
but america's optimistic hopes for the future are soon undercut by some unexpected and disturbing news.
assessing the mental capacity of its recruits.ng concl nearly half of all american soldiers are feebleminded.
army psychologists have fired the first shot entific war that army psychologists will le.ired the first shot sci when the army tests results were published, and it was stated that a goodly portion of inductees into the u.s. army had a mental age of under 12--
ergo, moron by popular definition of psychologists-- there was a sense of shock.
how could it be that so many american boys had such low intelligence?
the fears mu the fear that america's gene pool is being weakened by an unending influx of immigrants;
the hat americans will lack the mental faculties to perform the complex tasks of modern life.
when the army commissioned the tests during the war the generals faced a staggering logistical task.
deluged with some two million recruits they tried to match each man to the job choosing potential officers and weeding out potential misfits.
they had one clear, practical goal for their science-- to sort the entire army, quickly, in an hour.
they had to find a test that could be done fast and that could immediately distinguish different levels of mental skill.
the scale for intelligence is developed by henry goddard at the training school for feebleminded boys and girls in vineland, new jersey.
through his observations, he comes to believe that intelligence-- and its opposite, feeblemindedness-- is inherited.
charles davenport is a pioneer field charles dof genetics.a pioneerg he, too, belike intelligenc e can be passed down from one generation to the next.
if, as the experiments of gregor mendel have shown e gene for wrinkled if, as the experiments peas and another for smooth on one gene for blue eyes and another for brown then perhaps there are also genes for other traits
they tried to find biological bases of things that they called nomadism-- the tendency of people to move from place to place.
and at least one geneticist found a genetic basis for what he called thalassophilia, love of the sea that was expressed in naval officers and which he contended must be a sex-linked trait-- that is, to males--
davenport's ideas catch fire among those looking for scientific ways to improve society.
he recruits graduates of vassar and harvard eager to join him on the varesearch.
he persuades the carnegie institution of washington to fund a new research station in cold spring harbor, new york.
all for the promotion of eugenics a movement to improve the quality of the human race by selective breeding.
chief among these scientists is psychologist john watson who offers a theory that is the mirror opposite of eugenics.
this was the heyday of hereditarians and geneticists who said that human beings were constrained by their genetic inheritance.
at first, albert shows little fear even when watson places a burning newspaper in front of him.
albert is also unafraid when he encounters a white rat for the first time in his life.
he referred to them, in one of his many statements as always squalling and shouting and dirty and wanting to be fed and sort of a nuisance.
it was clear he didn't particularly like them in his own environment but he felt that the good of society required shaping individuals right from day one you had to start with the babies.
you can become what you would like to be even if you're not there yet.
and at least if you don't do it in youme this is in which your children can do it.
but the arrival of new immigrants increases all kinds of fears.
some are economic-- that the iorker will lower the wages of american workers or take their jobs altogether all the while crowding their cities and their schools.
and the idea was that many of them were defective and that the american population was quickly filling up with defectives.
the notion was that america had become the asylum of the world.
in laboratories, like this one at the university of texas scientists are studying the inheritance patterns of fruit flies.
because fruit flies breed quickly it makes them ideal subjects for experiments to see how they change.
by the late 1920s, research makes clear that genetics will not be explained as simply as "one gene, one trait."
the work shows that many traits are not the product of single genes but are polygenic, the product of several genes.
something as simple as eye color, for example can be affected by as many as seven different genetic variables.
and if a fruit fly is this complex what, scientists wonder, does that imply for human genetics?
but in the public's mind, the science of genetics the pseudoscience of eugenics to explain human behavior.
on a sheer practical level, behaviorism, for example has become far more pervasive than hardly anyone realizes.
still leading the pack is john watson himself who has left academia for the far more lucrative field of advertising.
it's the perfect home for his belief that behavior isn't fixed at all but is shaped by outside forces.
what watson believed is that he had the techniques at his disposal to shape consumer behavior.
watson went into advertising armed with the information and the views he had shown in the case of little albert namely, that if you pair two separate things together you can get the responses normally made to one attached to the other--
response to the loud noise became attached to the sight of the furry animal.
in advertising, he was the person who did things like get cigarettes shown in the context of handsome men beautiful women, big cars, mansions.
john watson and the field of advertising is the perfect marriage of theory and practice.
it's behaviorism at work-- conditioning the minds of consumers that they truly need the products that american business wants to sell.
adolf hitler and his nazi party come to power in the early '30s by using every technique propaganda has to offer to influence the german people.
in films like this one he promotes the credo of the nazi party:
next, they start to rid germany of people they feel will poison the race.
by mid-1extreme sterilization i aws partly modeled on american eugenic policies.
eugenicists thought that sterilization would stop the proliferation of undesirable aspects of the population by preventing the birth-- in blunt terms-- of folks they find as undesirable would be the neatest solution.
and they would say that you do the society a favor by not reproducing.
the excesses of hitler's germany-- the fact that mass murder, that genocide had been committed in the name of racial purity in the name of a eugenically inspired racial cleansing-- was very frightening to people even to people that previously may have been attracted
to a kind of idealism that was also part of the idea of eugenics.
and so you see in the years after world war ii a real pulling back from explanations of mental illness of intelligence, of all sorts of behaviors rooted in genetic understandings and a turn instead towards environmental understandings.
in the 1950s millions of americans scanned the daily papers for the latest advice from "dear abby" or ann landers.
they're hell-bent on self-improvement optimistic about their prospects and guided by a near-religious belief that they can always change for the better.
the opposite view-- that behavior is fixed at birth and can't be changed-- is still associated with nazi germany where eugenics was used to justify genocide.
people thought that after the stunning achievements of science and technology in the victory of world war ii that there was, in principle, no limit to what it could do now in the interest of the good life after the war.
the technology that had allowed us to win the war to defeat hitler, to defeat the nazis this technology could now be put into the service of liberating individuals of helping them develop themselves.
so it was a translation, i think of technology from an emphasis on weaponry to a technology on an emphasis on the human spirit and the development of human nature.
and we could translate that expertise from one domain to the other.
skinner declares that with the right social engineering we can create a new breed of human being.
skinner is firmly in the behaviorist tradition pioneered by john watson in the 1920s.
like watson, skinner contends that with the right tools we can predict and control behavior.
skinner really inherited the mantle from watson of behaviorism in this country but it's kind of interesting to think about how there's a subtle difference in the way they went about it.
skinner wants to do the rigorous science to prove that environment is everything.
change the environment, he argues and you can change the individual...
and skinner believes that if it works for pigeons, why not people?
in skinner's mind, behavior is behavior up and down the evolutionary scale and it is all learned.
mothers who worked during the war are staying at home to raise kids.
with economic growth and unprecedented mobility young couples are moving around the country living far from their parents and extended families.
dr. benjamin spock offers advice to millions of worried young parents about how to raise their kids in the proper environment.
he covers everything from diapers to discipline borrowing ideas more from freud than from skinner.
this monkey is an orphan separated from his mother since the day of his birth.
literally his life hangs by a thread-- a soft cheesecloth pad that is his only companion, his only comfort.
harlow is studying love because he believes it makes an indelible impact on a young life.
the relationship between a mother and her child-- what harlow calls our earliest social environment-- could hold the key to explaining behavior throughout life.
he's scared, all right and he does what any child will do in a similar situation:
he was runningtohis mother to touch her to drive away his fear.
to harlow, there is something about the experience of comfort and love-- even more than food-- that seems crucial to all these monkeys.
but what happens when the infant is raised alone without any mother at all, wire or cloth?
harlow believes he has shown how want of love can damage an infant for life and he worries the same is true for people.
in harry harlow's experiment was that early experience and the environment were crucial to the healthy development of the infant child and that in a sense, if you messed up if the right kind of maternal presence was not there
there's a fundamental optimism in american society that says that it's possible to fix almost any problem.
and the attitude of psychoanalysis that ultimately every difficulty could be understood seen as meaningful and potentially, at least, changed was something that was very appealing to americans.
was it only going to be a therapy for the worried-well for the mildly neurotic, for the anxious?
or could it really pack a sufficient therapeutic punch to help the most brutally mentally ill of our society the schizophrenics?
and her whole approach to them was based on their potential for recovery not for what was damaged.
she applied this same orientation and always searched for the part of the patient that was still intact.
by the 1950s, chestnut lodge is one of a handful of private psychls in the country which offers psychotherapy as its primary treatment.
only the well-heeled can afford to come here and the waiting list is long.
it is not well understood in the 1950s when a young girl from brooklyn arrives, seeking help.
joanne greenberg waited three years she finally enters two days after her 16th birthday.
i had no idea of what was going on on the outside but i was trying with everything i had and i had been since the age of six to try and make it right, to try and fix it.
i think the worst fear somehow is not to be all right and it's only later when you finally say a) you are never going to be all right it is never going to be all right that you say, "well, okay, let it, let it all go."
she treats her with a variation of the so-called "talking cure."
sitting with her patients-- listening, talking-- even while they were hallucinating withdrawn, recalcitrant.
my ally had a first-rate mind and would not allow me to get away with much.
she was trying to elicit from me things about my life that counted in the way i saw reality.
so, even under the best of circumstances with the most committed clinicians ho believe with the most committed the environment can curers w only achieve occasional success.
and in the united states in the 1950s most of the severely mentally ill are not in the best hospitals under the best circumstances.
the patients were dsitting on the floor.e eit staring at the ceiling, listening to voices.
i remember in one big ward where about 150 people were sitting the attendant every 20 minutes or half an hour he would clap his hands and then everybody would get up around the ward, hewhich was quite big,s and then once or twiceld get up
neither side in the ongoing battle-- at chestnut lodge or in the state mental hospital-- seems to have the answer.
the great challenge in the history of psychiatry is that a given treatment has always worked for some patients and not for others.
i remember a student group went through the hospital on a sight-seeing tour-- medical students-- and they saw patients gesticulating to the ceiling and talking to their voices, and they turned to me, one and asked, "will there ever be kind of a pill
"that we'd give these people that would stop this terrible torture they have?"
but in 1952, in france the seemingly ridiculous is pursued anyway.
here in paris, at a general-practice hospital an accidental discovery leads to research on a radically new treatment a treatment that might not only give new hope to patients but also revolutionize the way psychiatry looks at mental illness.
he finds that the new drug, called chlorpromazine or largactil, does quiet his patients.
and so he proposed to some psychiatrist friends of his that hey, maybe this drug might be useful for your terribly crazy patients because it seems to have this favorable effect.
the first test is tried here as in the rest of europe schizophrenia is considered a neurological disorder-- one that no amount of talking can cure.
psychiatrists jean delay and pierre deniker head up the first trial.
in psychiatry, we didn't know about the mechanism-- biological mechanism of the mental disorders.
so, uh, everything was tried just by, as you say, serendipity.
delay and deniker realize quite rapidly that they are onto something momentous.
they report a transformation of their schizophrenic patients and the sudden disappearance of their hallucinations and voices.
we had something that would turn it off like a water tap.
symptoms would disappear whether you understood them or not no matter what the dynamics might have been.
it was like taking an aspirin for a toothache-- it just cut it off.
it didn't cure the toothache or the bad tooth but the symptoms disappeared completely.
now they have a drug that reduces psychosis without reducing the level of consciousness.
it is a whole new kind of pharmacy-- one that seems to target just the disease.
in a sense, the drug treatment of schizophrenia happened like all of the treatments of schizophrenia-- that you are working from desperation and if something looks like it might make an effect you try it because you haven't got anything to lose.
and so they tried it, and this time it... it worked.
from pills for the severely mentally ill to tranquilizers for the mildly anxious.
from lithium and reserpine in the 1950s to miltown and valium by the 1960s.
medications for the mind become a new part of american life.
how any of these drugs work, no one knows at first.
neurotransmitters allow brain cells to communicate with each other, making up an intricate network.
ultimately, what snyder's experiments and others like his show is that there is an intimate connection between neurotransmitters and behavior.
the realization that the brain works on the basis of chemical signals which are dynamic and which are changing all the time represented a major revolution in biology represented a major revolution in biologys analogous to the revolution that galileo ushered in centuries ago.
no longer could we regard the brain as an unchanging, immutable switchboard with which we were blessed or cursed forever.
the chemical hypothesis of brain function and brain messages meant that we could understand behavior and that we might be able to change behavior.
the discovery that we are people with brains and that brains are regulated by various biological processes has certainly shaken the older view that we really are spiritual beings and that brains be damned.
they're just kind of the hardware-- like our muscles and our heart, etc.-- that we need to be spiritual beings.
the fact that we know that we have brains and that we can radically influence the way we think by ingestion of certain chemicals-- certain pure chemicals that we know the identity of-- has really changed our conception of ourselves
its anatomy is a world apart from ours but its biochemistry is similar enough to run a crucial experiment.
beginning in the 1970s work with slugs demonstrates that it is possible to physically change the brain's biochemistry just through learning;
well, just a slug, not a person but it does prove that experience can never again be so easily divorced from biology.
it's the beginning of a new, revolutionary way of thinking about behavior-- a new synthesis, putting to rest the old dichotomy between nature and nurture-- a synthesis that would even include genetics.
a tight-knit community the mormons provide a natural laboratory for geneticists looking to see how traits are passed from generation to generation.
in the 1970s, the church decided to open its doors to scientists sharing its vast genealogical records.
mormon leaders did two things for which geneticists will forever be thankful.
ncouraged their followers for which geneticists to be fruitful and multiplyy e and, as part of church practice they urged them to keep fastidious records of their family histories.
this is how the inheritance of diseases like a fatal blood disorder found among mormons is tracked.
or the inheritance of behavioral disorders like manic depression, seen among the amish in pennsylvania.
scientists, like walter gilbert at harvard and david botstein at m.i.t.
developed methods to decipher the 100,000 genes in each one of us.
they can search for genes that cause diseases like cystic fibrosis;
or ones that contribute to behavioral disorders like depression or alzheimer's disease.
in town after town, dr. lopera hears stories of others with alzheimer's, including leonardo piedrahita whhe market with his daughter and grandson.
leonardo was diagnosed with alzheimer's at age 42-- in the prime of life.
this disease emerges sometimes as much as 2so early in lifeter.why is a mystery to the townspeople.
some very interesting ideas about this d why one person would get the disease and another would not.
and one of the ideas which actually was quite interesting was that some families believed that if they touched a certain tree in a village they would get the disease but they didn't know which tree.
no era una creencia de todas las personas pero si habia algunas personas que tenian esa idea.
leonardo's children report that their grandfather also had alzheimer's as did three of their uncles, all before the age of 50.
theirs is only one of 12 extended families in this region--
they all share the same genetic inheritance which the scientists surmise must also include a genetic predisposition for this rare form of alzheimer's.
when we began this search for a gene we knew there was a gene causing this problem and it was very, very clear.
it would have been clear 100 years ago because it was obvious that the gene was inherited generation after generation and it was equally prevalent in men and women and it was also the case that about 50% of the offspring would get the illness;
are textbook features that about 50% of the offspring of a genetic illness.;
first, researcher lucia madrigal gathers blood samples from leonardo and all the other members of this great extended family.
then, using modern dna techniques they search for the culprit gene.
while lopera's team searches, so do other scientists studying family groups in other parts of the world.
in 1995, a group of canadian scientists is the first to succeed.
there is even a test to see which of his children has inherited the gene.
there are medications available and in the works to treat this devastating illness.
but having the gene is one thing the emergence of the disease itself, another.
scientists are a long way off from understanding the cascade of events that lead from a mistake in the gene that you were born with se that emerges that lead from a mistake in the gene40 years later.born with
the power of looking at alzheimer's as a case study here is that it really gives you an opportunity to see how you can study human behavior from soup to nuts-- from the genetic level through the brain level
to the behaviol, to the experiential level and back down the other direction-- and to do it around a...
an area of human experience tical to our understanding of what we're all about:
our capacity to remember to remember the story of our lives.
scientists are identifying multiple genes-- genes that don't necessarily lead to the disease but put people at risk for developing it.
the same holds true for other mental or behavioral disorders such as schizophrenia-- as common today as it was in the 1950s.
for example, being severely malnourished during prenatal development may trigger schizophrenia years later.
ideas about the causes of human behavior continue to be refined as in the case of shell shock, for example...
scientists now speculate that some are more susceptible perhaps genetically predisposed to succumb to the traumas of war.
and yet these soldiers still need the trigger of combat to cause their breakdown-- biologyandexperience.
most situations, however, are not as radical as war and most behaviors are not as extreme as shell shock or schizophrenia.
it is in the more routine encounters of everyday life that scientists of human behavior will find their greatest challenge.
we know a lot about the molecules in the brain and how they work and how they build a brain.
we know a bit about how the environment interfaces with these genes and the molecules to actually affect their expression.

in 1984, a manila envelope arrived at the home of tv producer jaime shandera.

hey, xena told us to meet her near the temple of mnemosyne.
i don't think it's such a great idea to be walking around these, wait.
tomorow, at dawn, you'll experience this life for the last time.
you owe someone so much, that you would just throw away these last few years.
i thought that i'd never come to terms, with my mistakes.
but i did, when i visited xena, in ming t'ien's prison.
i am catching a ship here that will carry me close to the kingdom of ch'in.
if there was ever a time to turn back, it's now.
i wondered how you made it to ch'in ahead of me.
i figured ares might have a hand in it, but what i couldn't understand was why?

gabrielle, i am catching a ship here that will carry me close to the kingdom of chin.
if there was ever a time to turn back, it's now.
that's why you wanted me to wait at the temple of mnemosyne, right?
i wondered how you made it to chin ahead of me.

the two of us can't do anything against an armed gang.
the only person who could do something in this situation is him.
i wanted to ask you how to steer this huge clunker.
i don't know the layout of the console but you need to regulate the amount of co2 sent to the heating plant and monitor the stress on the boiler.
between this and that native american incident, you gotta watch what you say around here.
seems like i'm the only one not shooting my mouth off like some gossipy hysterical woman.
when the cops showed up, he was trying to drag the train out of the living room by himself.
because this conductor is a city employee, they're dredging up that thing that happened last month with that guy from accounting.
his last quarterly report said we were 4 kilos over budget.
as a preemptive strike, i have decided that all of the mayor's staff should take drug tests.
i'm afraid one of the technicians at the lab had a breakdown yesterday.
i'm so sorry, but we'll need to get another urine sample.
sometimes a girl carries an umbrella just in case it rains.
well, i'd sell that umbrella and stock up on sunscreen, 'cause the forecast calls for another year of drought.
hell, i may throw caution to the wind and get rid of my diaphragm too.
mike, if you dump your sample, you're gonna have to replace it.
# hush, little jamie, it won't take long # # mama's gonna sing you the pee pee song #
# use your little potty, it'll be fun # # you'll get a treat if you go number one #

so let's slow down on the dark and stormies and get some sleep.
all we can do is batten down and ride it out.
and if it gets really bad, we have a storm shelter.

seriously, a guy on my ski team knows this girl who went camping last summer, and they saw the fisherman.
two days later, two kids didn't make it out of the woods.
you know what, you've got a lot of nerve coming down here starting shit with me!
you should worry a little less about me, and a little more about my uncle.
it's not like we can just walk up and accuse him.
kent, we got to figure out what's going on tomorrow because we're short a couple of guys, everybody's calling in sick on me.
we say we're sorry, we panicked, we got it wrong, whatever!

i'm george hanson, and this afternoon we are proud to present our own adaptation of "the little mermaid."
music will be provided by the brinkley trio led by my co-teacher melissa marx.
he says if i don't fuck him, he's going to find another girlfriend.
all right look, keesha, i don't claim to be an expert on love.
we're in a post-literate society so they don't know what to do once they're...
dr. joley seems to have made a hit with my stepsister.
george, you know, you sound like you talking about your ex-lover.
you know, why does everything have to be about sex with you?
anyway, the point is, i'm going to probably have to move out, because she'll be wanting to get rid of the apartment.
so i was hoping i could crash at your place for a couple weeks.
but... someone else, you know, a real guy, like vince gets to take them home.
and then i thought, i don't always have to be the one whose watching them leave.
i wouldn't be surprised if you never wanted to lay eyes on me again, but it would really mean a lot to me just to be with you.
i made a reservation at that sweet little inn we stayed at.
did i tell you my book is coming out in paperback in england?
it's very impressive for an american shaw scholar to do so well in europe.
and, uh, something that may be of particular interest to you,
rodney, is that the theatres in germany are filled with young people.
but you're nutty enough to believe that based on that experience you can bring him to his senses.
nina, a gay nursery school teacher is a one-way ticket to nowhere.
i actually got up the courage to talk to him one night about walt whitman.
he probably became an investment banker, had four kids, all named trotter, and, uh, never talked about poetry again.
i mean, i thought people like that were banned from the police force, you know?
i mean, it's none of his god damn business where the fuck my husband is.
i'm going to see "king lear" tomorrow night, god help me.
i fully expect him to step on stage, say he's old, he's hot, and strip down to his underwear.
well, as you probably know, paul and i visit the theater quite often.
perhaps you and your best friend would care to join us one evening.
well, perhaps we could go and have a meal together some time.
we'd like to see more of you, in any event, you know?
now, i think that nina and george have a great relationship.
yeah, when we see each other we have a great relationship.
hey, george, um, when they start complaining about not seeing you enough, you have to buy them a diamond, or take them to the theatre.
hey, maybe we could all go see a friend of mine who's in a play next weekend.
or, uh, george, you could take them for a walk, you know, while i get ready.
well, um, why don't you two children go and play somewhere.
if the object one's affection returns the favour with rather less enthusiasm than one might have hoped.
but a small observation, if i may, from someone old enough to be your grandfather.
well, paul, i think you and i ought to be getting going.
well, actually, i think i'm going to hang out here for awhile.
and if you can deal with the 20 women waiting outside with pistols, i think this union will succeed brilliantly.
my friend, nina, the wisest person i know said to me yesterday, you have to pick one person and make it work.
you gotta be hard, you gotta be tough, you gotta be stronger.
you gotta cool, you gotta be calm, you gotta stay together.
all i know, all i know, love will save the day.
herald what your mother said, reading the books your father read, try to solve the...
this afternoon we are proud to present our own adaptation of the little mermaid.
music will be provided by the brinkley trio, led by my co-teacher melissa marx.
i'm nina borowski, and i think all of you are new here, so welcome to the cobble hill community center.
i'll be your group leader, and we can talk about whatever you'd like:
how come it's ok for him to live on top of you and not me?
he's not living on top of me and he's leaving in two weeks.
yo soy la presidenta de the new york mothers of latino lesbians.
mrs ochoa is the president of the new york mothers of latino lesbians.
we got the salami, that prosciutto you love so much, the cheese...
we've got some herring and we have some deliciously fresh mozzarella.
a couple of kids who got framed on a rape and battery charge in the bronx.
defend somebody big, whether you win or lose, i'll get you $2 million on the book deal.
i always thought that i could teach other people's children, but someone else, you know, a real guy like vince gets to take them home.
then i thought i don't always have to be the one who's watching them leave.
i don't always have to be the one who waits for twilight to pass.
for the first time i thought i could be the guy who says good night.
i'm addressing a critics' convention at your old college the weekend after next.
and i've been thinking about that time we drove up there.
i wouldn't be surprised if you never wanted to lay eyes on me again, but... it would really mean a lot to me, just to be with you.

that's very kind of you, but i'm not sure she likes the theatre.
well, perhaps we could go and have a meal together sometime.
we'd like to see more of you, in any event, d'you know?
this guy must be the most interesting guy in the world, or the most tolerant.
actually, he's dating george's colleague melissa, so that takes a shitload of tolerance.
yeah, when we see each other we have a great relationship.
george, when they complain about not seeing you enough, you have to buy them a diamond or take them to the theatre.

all right, kiesha, i don't claim to be an expert on love, but i do know it can screw up your life.
we're in a post-literate society so they don't know what to do--
dr. joley seems to have made a hit with my stepsister.
i spent all yesterday afternoon watching this little kid play catch with his father.
i always thought that i could teach other people's children, but... someone else, a real guy like vince gets to take them home.
"i don't always have to be the one... who waits for twilight to pass."
for the first time, i thought i could be... the guy who says good night.
oh, just someone i had a fling with before i met joley.
you know, if you ever wanted to invite him here, that would be fine.
i wouldn't be surprised if you never wanted to lay eyes on me again.
but... it would really mean a lot to me just to, uh, be with you.
did i tell you my book is coming out in paperback in england?
it's very impressive for an american shaw scholar to do so well in europe.
[ rodney ] and our thanks to mrs. gutierrez... for an extremely interesting question and a spirited response... from the panel.
and now we move on to, um, oh, another question from mrs. gutierrez.
i have never recovered from ulrika schinkel's... brilliant production of beethoven in ketten, that's beethoven in bondage, set amongst the ruins of the reichstag.
and, uh, something that may be of particular interest to you, rodney, is that the theaters in germany are filled with young people.
but you're nutty enough to believe that based on that experience, you can bring him to his senses.
nina, a gay nursery school teacher is a one-way ticket to nowhere.
i actually got up the courage to talk to him one night... about walt whitman.
he probably became an investment banker, had four kids, all named trotter and, uh, never talked about poetry again.
"lady, you asked for it." i thought people like that... were banned from the police force, you know?
it's none of his goddamn business... where the fuck my husband is.
i have this new theory that any man... who doesn't hit you over the head with his opinions must be gay.
[ clears throat ] well, that makes as much sense as freud.
[ british man on tv ] the workings of her mind appealed to him.
[ giggling ] she leaves her warm bed in the cold dawn... to rush there full of zeal and loyalty.
i mean, what a shame to break up such a great party.
i mean, actually, i'd like to meet your friends some day.
maybe we could all go see a friend of mine who's in a play next weekend.
well, i'm on call next weekend, and frank certainly isn't going without me.
and i don't think one should be too hard on oneself... if the object of one's affection... returns the favor with rather... less enthusiasm than one might've hoped.
but a small observation, if i may, from someone old enough to be your grandfather.
* you gotta be tough you gotta be stronger * * tough, stronger *
* you gotta be cool you gotta be calm * * cool, calm *
* you gotta stay together all i know, all i know * * together *

starfleet vessel... this is captain kathryn janeway of the starship voyager.
we are in the delta quadrant at coordinates 18 mark 205 mark 47.
my readings show that the station picked up our message and relayed it across the entire network.
we should try widening the subspace bandwidth and sending the message again.
...the delta quadrant at coord... i have a possible explanation, captain.
as our carrier wave moves along the network, it may be degrading.
when i requested more away missions, this isn't exactly what i had in mind.
you may be our only chance to communicate with that ship.
when you get there, you'll be downloaded into their emh system.
i'm sending an initiation code along with your program so you'll be activated immediately.
when you've completed your mission, instruct them to move within range of the sensor network.
with any luck, they'll be able to send you back the same way you came.
if you disengage your vocal subroutines for one second, i'd explain.
i was transmitted onto this ship by a starfleet vessel over 60, 000 light- years from here.
i tried to relieve her, but she doesn't want to leave her post.
she says she doesn't need to regenerate for the next few days.
this vessel was designed to go faster than anything in the fleet, so we'll never be rescued.
we've got to find a way to turn this ship around.
we're giving this ship to someone who will make use of its full potential-- the tal shiar.
i've made arrangements to rendezvous with their fleet within the hour.
i've downloaded the ship's entire medical library and compressed it into a single data file.
it's got all the classics-- from gray's anatomy to leonard mccoy's comparative alien physiology.
being a doctor is a lot more than knowing the facts.
we still have to create analytical subroutines to help him diagnose patients, tactile protocols, so he can perform surgery, not to mention a personality profile.
by establishing a sensor link with the nearest station, i'm getting readings from the entire network.
the starfleet ship is within range of one of the farthest sensors near the outer edges of the alpha quadrant.
would you mind at least telling me what all this is abou...?
when i requested more away missions, this isn't exactly what i had in mind.
you may be our only chance to communicate with that ship.
when you get there, you'll be downloaded into their emh system.
i'm sending an initiation code along with your program so you'll be activated immediately.
we have less than 90 seconds before that ship moves out of range.
i was saving voyager from annihilation when you were only a gleam in your programmer's eye.
now are you going to help me take back this ship or not?
i suggest you let me handle the medical side of things.
as for retaking the ship, i'll leave that in your experienced hands.
only four people in all of starfleet were trained to operate it.
i hope your myriad adventures included piloting lessons because there's nothing in my program that will help us fly this thing.
your relay network gave us the unique opportunity to communicate with our people.
they are very far away and we're expecting a message back from them.
do you think we should give him a little more hair?
what do you say we try to get him working first, then we can worry about personal grooming.
it's got all the classics-- from gray's anatomy to leonard mccoy's comparative alien physiology.
and once we transfer all the data into stone face's matrix, we'll have ourselves a brand- new medical expert.

there may be a lesson for you gals about inviting strange men into your bedrooms.
that means he can come into my car whenever he wants.
you're doomed to having to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they want.
once more you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest form.
angel once told me that when he was obsessed with drusilla,... ..the first thing he did was to kill her family.
you mustn't let angel get to you, no matter how provocative he may be.
so what you're basically saying is just ignore him and maybe he'll go away?
i was raised by the people that angel hurt the most.
my duty to them was the first thing i was ever taught.
you need to just try and not let him get to you.
angel's only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid.
have you forgotten you're a bloody guest in my bloody home?
and as a guest, if there's anything i can do for you,... ..any responsibility i can assume while you're spinning your wheels...
sorry about the spiel, but around valentine's day... ..i get a lot of tourists shopping for love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers.
sad fact is, ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay the rent around here.
we had kind of a "pyjama party sleepover with weapons" thing.
i don't suppose you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment?
we're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.
but, spike, the bad teacher was going to restore angel's soul.
because this new, improved one is not playing with a full sack.
i love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke.

sorry about the spiel, but around valentine's day... ..i get a lot of tourists shopping for love potions and mystical revenge of past lovers.
sad fact is, ouija boards and rabbits' feet, that's what pay the rent around here.
we had kind of a "pyjama party sleepover with weapons" thing.
i don't suppose you had the presence of mind to locate a camera to capture the moment?
we're supposed to kill the bitch, not leave gag gifts in her friends' beds.
but, spike, the bad teacher was going to restore angel's soul.
because this new, improved one is not playing with a full sack.
i love a good slaughter as much as the next bloke.
yes, but once you've invited them in, then they're always welcome.
there may be a lesson for you gals about inviting strange men into your bedrooms.
that means he can come into my car whenever he wants.
you're doomed to having to give him and his vamp pals a lift whenever they want.
once more you've managed to boil a complex thought down to its simplest form.
angel once told me that when he was obsessed with drusilla... ..the first thing he did was to kill her family.
you mustn't let angel get to you, no matter how provocative he may be.
so what you're basically saying is just ignore him and maybe he'll go away?
i was raised by the people that angel hurt the most.
my duty to them was the first thing i was ever taught.
you need to just try and not let him get to you.
angel's only doing this to try to get you to do something stupid.

shake everything down, maybe we'll come up with a couple more dead guys.
- sir, what if we shake out some gold while we're at it?
- john thomas, a.k.a. tommy john, a.k.a. jimmy toms, done time for armed robbery and assault.
- he was a weapons expert, sir, with the 82nd airborne... specialty in explosives and tunnels.
why are we even on this tub in the first place?
there we were having a leisurely swim, doing the bloom, close, bloom...
get the gold off, set charges in the cargo, blow the hold and leave.
when the cops figure it out, we'll be just another shipwreck.
saint mary's river, which is one of the most fertile spawning grounds in the entire great lakes.
and that, in turn, could set off a chain reaction that could lead to...
- i thought turnbull was supposed to be cutting this path.
knowing turnbull, he's either taken a circuitous route, or gotten himself entangled with some bears.
the only route to safety was to meet in the middle.
you got to trust your partner, son, otherwise nothing will go right.
you didn't think they'd let you get away with it, did you?
- feels good to have a wooden deck beneath my feet again.
man, i can't tell you how it excites me to see folks haven't forgotten me.
why don't you hightail us up to that vehicle... so we can get an eyeful of who's behind that wheel?
we won't be together long enough for it to matter what you call me.
perhaps, but you never know what fate holds in store for you.
wrote everyone back home and told them to have a bash... waitin' at my estate come sunday afternoon.
i wouldn't expect much of a homecoming if i was you.
franny, why don't we settle this between the two of us.
honey, i can tell you waited on some high rollers now and then.
will you promise me you'll leave right after, rain or shine?
seeing you take a risk will be well worth a wet coat.
maybe if you told me your name, then you could remember theirs.
that's twice in two days you've let that car fly by.
all you got to do is open your eyes and ears... and you'll see the beauty in fate.
i'll bet the first look you got of beatrice... you knew it was preordained.
"but such a tide as moving seems asleep... too full of sound and foam.
when that which drew from out the boundless deep... turns once again home.
i guess the sight of all that money must've taken my breath away.
then when i woke to find such a handsome young man kissing me...
i'm in shock that you're not in graceland this time of the year.
it's been murder trying to find a good elvis during the annual vigil.
she never gave the impression at all she was tongue-tied... and i was hooked.
now, nobody will ever replace my mama... but i swear, letting myself get close to another warm soul... filled a great void in me.
she told me that the first time he was on stage, he was scared to death.
he didn't know what all the yelling was about, that his body was moving.
"marian and lilli burrows... wife and daughter of local businessman jon burrows... were confirmed to be... fatalities aboard yesterday's ill-fated flight bound for memphis.
friends expressed concern for mr. burrows who they described... as a generous philanthropist known to entertain with his renditions... of the music of elvis presley who passed on early yesterday as well."
the boys used to play this game with me all the time.
lock me out... testing how long it took for me to break into my own home.
everything about this trip... fixing the car, getting arrested, meeting ashley... you planned it all, didn't you?
one never knows what's chance and what's fate till the ride is over.
all i know is you have to forgive yourself... the woman...
god... and have faith that the next love you know won't cause you so much pain.
and i guess it should remain that way for them... and maybe for my own sake.
sometimes a man has to give up what's dearest to him to find peace.

i don't know what i would've done if you hadn't come along.
i felt i had to make it public, because i feared for mrs. hooper's life, a fear that unfortunately turned out to be justified.
now on the tape, he talked about how his loving mrs. hooper might go against god.
unfortunately, he didn't simply transfer his lust, but also his anger, his self-loathing, his rage, the hatred he felt for himself in loving his own mother.
and since mrs. hooper was a participant, he hated her, too.
the police asked you for the clothes you were wearing that night.
you said you got home and just threw them all in the laundry.
and i'll bet when she was born you made a vow to yourself to never let anything bad happen to her.
i so protected scott, homeschooled him all the way through high school, and nothing bad ever did happen to him.
we're actually talking to a therapist because i pop out of bed too fast.
yes, but when we were together a year or so ago, you always used to roll over and go to sleep after.
at your custody proceeding, you accused that man right there of molesting scott, did you not?
you later admitted to the court that that was a lie.
i felt it was in scott's best interest for me to have full custody.
and you would do almost anything to protect him, even commit perjury.
i have a fifth amendment right not to answer these ridiculous questions, and i want an attorney!
your son was trying to break away from you with another woman.
then it was all those other men she was having an affair with.
then, i can't be sure, but i think he actually seemed to accuse the father, at least briefly.
how about shame on the police for investigating nobody else but scott little?
as soon as they saw a video of scott talking about killing marcia hooper, it was cased close for them.
the killer will typically wipe clean just what he or she has touched.
but if she didn't know what scott had previously touched, she would have cleaned everything.

this afternoon, the firewall of the information bureau's information control center was cracked and destroyed by some party, and information in the wired network is currently in disarray.
this news report is being sent out at this moment, but please be aware that it may arrive tomorrow, or possibly yesterday.
some say that the wired doesn't have political borders like the real world.
but there are far too many nonsense-spouting anarchists or idiots who think that pranks are a revolution.
at any rate, it looks like they want to use you for something.
we believe that is something that must be prevented, no matter the cost.
i didn't start this, but i have to finish it somehow.

there's magic at work here... and now, she wants you to join her.
whose magic is performed... by gestures of the hands, and fingers.
the third, and highest stage of wizardry... the supreme exponents... are wizards of pure thought.
who need no words, nor gestures... but by their will alone... test the heavens.
of course, only the most... supremely gifted personages... become wizards of the third stage.
i will... that's something i do very well, sire... very well.
why is it... that i surround myself with... a bunch of incompetent fools?
i have to mix your blood... with the mortar for the castle.
this old fool tells me... it's the only way... to make the building stand.
of course, then you wouldn't... be able to cut my throat.
you're an extraordinary man... but i can't have extraordinary men... running around.
joseph, of arimathea... came there from jerusalem... with the holy grail... the cup our lord, jesus christ, used at the holy supper.
it has the power... to feed the hungry... and heal the sick.
the sisters are doing all they can, but you must pray with us.
why should i pray to your god... if he is going to take her from me?
she has been a friend of mine... since before the dawn of time.
if i can remember that... it means that i'm an old man.
do you ever think of the old school... where i tried to teach you the... fundamentals of magic?
he could have been my star pupil, morgan... but he proved... disappointing.
my mother is the lady elaine... and my father is sir launcelot.
i've come here to find a man to defend king arthur, and his kingdom.
i shall leave soon, on a god-given quest for the holy grail.
now, i seek a champion... to protect our country, and the honour of our fair queen while i'm gone.
i'm leaving you... with your misery, and pain... but... with no more magic powers!
now... you will wander through the world... ugly and alone... just as if you were human.
you left me alone for years... did you not think of me?
what of my honour... finding out my husband had a child... by a woman named morgan le fey?
i'm glad to see you haven't lost all the skills i taught you.
i've lost none of them... and it was frik, who taught me.
i was trying to smile... but it was the smile... of... desolation.
inside i felt... only the pity... and the terror... and the waste of it all.
i expected too much of him... but... he was the vessel of all my hopes.
arthur, don't charge around like that... the horses don't like it.
'though i don't see why i need to tell you about it.
that was morgan le fey... her mother was the lady igraine... your mother!
i will restore your beauty... if you take merlin... to a place that i have created for you.
you can live with him there... until the end of your days.
i have to find a man to guard the throne... while arthur goes questing... for the holy grail.
the temptation will be to seize the crown when he's gone.
there is a dispute... uh... scholarly dispute... as to whether we take it out con or contra wise.
which means, to the mere layman, turning and pulling it to the left... or to the right... contra.
they left to chase dreams... shadows... but if i'd told them... they wouldn't have listened.
and so, the years rolled on... one year merging into another... and another.
holy grail, or no holy grail... he should never have left.
merlin... he's free... he can start living his own life again.
indeed, i've always believed... that it was better to be a coward... for a second... than dead for a lifetime.
and yet... here i am fighting... fighting on the side of right... which is worse.
inside i felt... only the pity... and the terror... and the waste of it all.
everyone i ever loved... and who ever loved me... all gone.
and the cycle of death... and darkness ended... and so does my story.
now... if my story... entertained, or enchanted... you may show you appreciaton... in any way you see fit... but particularly... with money.
i mean... there will always be a need... for the perfect gentleman's gentleman.
and i was, and always will be... one of the best, you see.
do you ever think of the old school... where i tried to teach you the... fundamentals of magic?
he could have been my star pupil, morgan... but he proved... disappointing.
my mother is the lady elaine... and my father is sir launcelot.
i've come here to find a man to defend king arthur, and his kingdom.

i've lost none of them... and it was frik, who taught me.
i was trying to smile... but it was the smile... of... desolation.
inside i felt... only the pity... and the terror... and the waste of it all.
a dream of a dream... the skies parted and i saw the dream come alive, before my eyes.
that was someday, they'll describe me, arthur, guinevere, and camelot as a dream.
and so, the years rolled on... one year merging into another... and another.
if you five gentlemen don't stop trembling, i might miss, and kill you all.
holy grail, or no holy grail, he should never have left.
merlin, he's free, he can start living his own life again.
i'm leaving you with your misery, and pain... but... with no more magic powers!
now... you will wander through the world ugly and alone... just as if you were human.
let he who is not guilty of sin cast the first stone.
now, i know i have been guilty in my time. and i suspect that you have been, too.
but then, my memory of launcelot is that he never got anything right.
and so launcelot, and guinevere rode out of my story... and into legend.
inside i felt only the pity and the terror and the waste of it all.
everyone i ever loved and who ever loved me... all gone.
i mean... there will always be a need for the perfect gentleman's gentleman.
and i was, and always will be one of the best, you see.
once upon a time... no... no... that's not the way to start... you'll think this is a fairytale... and it isn't.
it has elements of a fairytale... dragons... elves... griffins... fairies and so on...
i don't like the sound of your voice... when you say that, sister.
i'm going to create a... leader for the people... a powerful wizard... who'll save britain... and bring the people back to us... and the old ways.
i called her auntie a but she was really a mother to me.
have you ever noticed... when you're miserable... time seems to slow to a crawl?
please, excuse their rudeness... we're traveling to lord lambert's castle and we've lost our way.
it's about a mile... take the right fork... but don't try any shortcuts.
and when it is unleashed... you will hold this world... in the hollow of your hand.
all the magic of the universe... and all the spells you will ever need... are in these books, merlin.
the third, and highest stage of wizardry... the supreme exponents... are wizards of pure thought.
who need no words, nor gestures... but by their will alone... test the heavens.
i studied day and night... and learned of those unseen forces... that hold this world together.
learnt the secret ways of other worlds, that exist beneath the surface... and behind the mirrors.
king vortigern... whatever you do to me... my father will do what is right.
of course, he will... if you stay loyal to me... she'll be safe.
why is it... that i surround myself with... a bunch of incompetent fools?
i've been a worshipper of the old ways... all my life.
perhaps, you need me to foretell the future... then you could crush them all... before they get a chance... to cause trouble.
of course, then you wouldn't... be able to cut my throat.
you're an extraordinary man... but i can't have extraordinary men... running around.
you're not quick enough... that's a mistake many of my enemies make... they think before they act...
she's a terrible enemy, master merlin... and a very poor employer.
well, i mean, i could tell you stories... but enough of my problems.
'way over there... beyond those hills... is an island, called avalon.
joseph, of arimathea... came there from jerusalem... with the holy grail... the cup our lord, jesus christ, used at the holy supper.
many men search for it... but no one has ever seen it, since.
but one day... a man with a pure heart will find it.
whilst the monks prayed... and i thought of revenge... the nuns were more practical.
they used their knowledge... of ancient herbs, and potions... to try and save... my only love.
rules of war: we fight in summer... we rest in winter.
vortigern isn't interested in rules, and traditions... he wants to win.
he hardly had the crown on his head... before it began all over again.
i decided to leave... let them stew in their own juices.
if i can remember that... it means that i'm an old man.
i ask you to hold excaliber for me... until a good man comes to take it from you.
he'll be his father's son... because of him... the days of blood will go on and on.
and out of it... the people will come back to me.
i expected too much of him... but... he was the vessel of all my hopes.
arthur, don't charge around like that... the horses don't like it.
'though i don't see why i need to tell you about it.

i mean... there will always be a need... for the perfect gentleman's gentleman.
and i was, and always will be... one of the best, you see.
the followers of the old ways... cried out in their agony.
there was only one being... who could save them... and she would come out... of the land of magic.
my childhood must have been very, very happy... for it was over in a flash.
please, excuse their rudeness... we're traveling to lord lambert's castle and we've lost our way.

inside i felt only the pity and the terror and the waste of it all.
and the cycle of death and darkness ended... and so does my story.
now, if my story entertained, or enchanted... you may show you appreciaton in any way you see fit...
but if some smart lawyer gets ahold of his story, we are in a lot of trouble.
well, he doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would sue you.
there's a rabbit missing over at the school, a mr., mr. boggles or something.
now, i was just over there, only the rabbit's not there.
come on, man, don't try to play me for a fool.
listen, even if you think it's me, the least you can do is start the search.
something that's largely unspoken, something almost taboo that we choose to ignore.
people, people like you, buyers, you come on to this lot with expectations and with fears and with this belief that all salespeople are basically conmen.
but you have to understand the nature of the sale, in order to understand the sell.
i don't know if you know this, but as a rule the japanese machine everything.
you got various metric measurements, centimeter, millimeter, so on and so forth.
then you got the micronometer, which is roughly the circumference of a human hair.
and what their machinists do at that microscopic level... it would be the equivalent of you or i trying to perform heart surgery on a fly.
at any rate, listen... you look like a guy from my neck of the woods.
i used to work for the guy, so i know a few things about him.
he told me once in a moment of candor, "i don't hire salesmen, i hire hitmen."
you walk on that lot, and you're stepping into the crosshairs of some zealot.
some guy so bent on selling you an auto, it becomes his primary means of existence.
you gotta keep in mind how heavyhanded the media is with the adjectives.
what everyone seems to forget is the sterling performance record... that the pinto had achieved up until that incident.
volares and aspens and every other piece of shit gremlin you wanna bring me?
and i look over at woo's lot, and i know that you're bidding for him.
while the supposition that these deaths are somehow linked may seem both premature and remote... we have established a plausible connection.
the method of killing differs in each one, but the bodies, all thirtyfour, were found in close proximity to a road or freeway.
the common denominator shared by these men outside of their present condition... is the fact that each of them has an extensive criminal history... from the three i've just profiled to the remaining thirtyone.
from shoplifting, domestic terrorism, petty thieves... convicted arsonists, mercenaries, rap sheets and arrest records abounding.
intelligence gathering up to this point has been rather marginal and slow in coming.
but given this initial information, we have ruled out any aimless murder spree.
these were not wanton, random acts of violence... they were measured, calculated attacks.
continuing on, we have two witnesses, both freight line drivers... that remember seeing drubb outside the el matador truck stop in needles, california.
no one witnessed the shooting... but we have strong physical evidence suggesting that mr. priolo was the gunman.
a discarded pistol found near the body... matches the grain and the caliber of the slug extracted from drubb.
the wounds on richter are also inconsistent with the toronado's design.
and there was a noted absence of bone and blood fragment... on both the front and rear bumper.
each of the victims was bled almost to the point of being drained dry.
we're operating under the premise that this tribe... somehow tampered or disrupted the local drug trade... and they were subsequently slaughtered.
now, strangely enough, we have several confirmed sightings... of a 1960's model red convertible car of american make... that was seen in the area before and after the killings.
a week later in cali, columbia, the same car is spotted... and five men are butchered outside a reputed drug den.
eight days later, same car, three dead... found chainsawed and burned with a blowtorch in a sugar cane field.
this pattern continues through guatemala, vera cruz, mexico, and ultimately needles, california, where both freight drivers interviewed regarding the drubb shooting, remember seeing a, quote, "red convertible car."
speculation is that this car is carrying an exceptionally large narcotics shipment... uncut cocaine, heroin, any number of possibilities exist.
one thing we know for certain is that each of these men was ambushed in succession... each knowing exactly what the cargo was, as well as its potential cash value.
you got cops and claims adjusters looking you sideways, secondguessing everything.
that's assuming you got somebody who understands fire and all its flammable cousins intimately.
the guys that skimp are the same guys that get caught.
they try to pull the job themselves, they leave big bread crumb clues.
i don't wanna come out outright and say your pal's full of shit...
but my mother, big johnny cash fan, she passes it down.
y'all listen up, 'cause what i got to say is gonna be coming fast and furious,
i ain't gonna go repeating shit that's been said already, so you best have your ears on.
and what i do have to say has to be held in the strictest motherfucking confidence.
you don't go repeating this to nobody, not even the good lord himself, you dig?
i know you two are down, 'cause you wouldn't be here if you weren't down for the dirt.
i'm gonna make my money whether it's cut long ways or lengthwise.
i don't care if it's you saying it or ray saying it or whatever.
if i see anything contrary to what you said to me... it constitutes a bullshit, null and void deal.
now that we got ourselves a little arrangement, let me tell you something.
first, when the car arrives day after tomorrow at twelve noon... it will be under surveillance for the rest of its stay.
and the trunk is going to be wired, trunk and ignition to blow...
so any attempt on your part to start the car after it's been stopped... or to open the trunk after it's been parked... there will be little pieces of your jenky ass flying through orbit.
this morning sheriff's deputies found a '68 mustang deserted off a county access road upstate.
the interior was wiped clean, no partials, nothing, but sdi matched the blood spray on the exterior passenger door to priolo's.
let them know this guy is a and d in a big way, so brief them accordingly.
we get our hands on him, this whole things gonna go from a simmer to a boil in a hurry.
long forgotten remark you made six years ago... it has a shelf life with most women.
she's filing away a folder in her head every time i fuck up, big or small.
we re gonna be two hundred and fifty thousand dollars richer.
what kind of pay day would our old ladies have offered up... in lieu of a quarter million dollars?
cop shows up on the lot, report of a stolen vehicle.
looks a lot like that red convertible you have over there.
mind if i see the bill of sale... we don have that.
mind if i see the title... we don't have that either.
you wanna take what, from all appearances, is a heads up gig...
you wanna take that and put an extortion twist on it.
- you knew it was gonna come to this all along.
but the fact of the matter remains... - we made a deal, sid.
you have to ask yourself, do you have the stomach for it?
can we gut it out and make for ourselves like we did when we started the lot?
my name is milt huggins, owner-operator of huggins roadside hacienda, formerly known as holiday agogo inn.
before i contact some sort of legal service, which i do have a right to do...
i understand your concern for your business, but we cannot disturb this area.
if we do, we put the integrity of the evidence here at risk.
all i know is i got a hotel full to capacity.
i got people going down to the kidney pool expecting a nice afternoon.
they're gonna be done with their job in just a minute.
in the meantime, we got complimentary beverages and finger food down by the pool... we got backgammon, we got baccarat, and competitive shuffleboard for the seniors.
without a key and likely a coded sequence, ain't nobody getting into this trunk.
but the guy that dropped it off, he popped the trunk.
i got surveillance guys catching all kinds of shit... prostitution, meth sales, stolen shipment swapping, i got weapons trafficking.
i could go on, but the point is, i got your country ass.
the guy gives me five grand, tells me this cat named vic is gonna show up.
he'll add another three thousand to the kitty if i just give him the keys.
now enteman revised previous testimony... and made another link to our unidentified blonde suspect.
it's my belief that the blonde man is intrinsically linked to all the murders.
i'd venture to say, no matter how extraordinary the circumstances, right now included... you're both too morally inclined for murder.
your friend ray, i shot him sixteen times and poured quick dry cement down his throat.
you don't shoot on a regular basis, you're not gonna hit anything over 20 feet away.
i can get both of you from right here in about half a second.
and they hold the fate of my wife of 43 years in their third world grasp.
each of the victims was bled, almost to the point of being drained dry.
the thought of me without her, the children without their mother... was a thought i didnt want to think.
i love my wife more than i will ever be able or ever care to put into words.
i'm a punishable soul, a sinner in every sense of the word.
but since the only redemption i've ever sought in my life... was on cash back dealer incentives and factory buybacks... which the big three in their divinity always grant... my afterlife status is unimportant.
you can follow callisto wherever she goes, but only where she goes.
and you can come back to the present, but that's it.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
with a friendship like yours..., ...my son must be very special.
he has a lot to live for, and so do i.
[ cackling ] it's the only thing that will kill a god, and the god who has it is top gun!

i wouldn't wanna be in a club that would have me for a member.

what does it matter to you if hercules lives or dies?
it doesn't, but i made a deal, and if i don't deliver, i don't get paid.
if you don't get out of here, you're all gonna die!
look, i've given every last dinar we have to xena's lieutenant.
maybe with a spare room in case i want to entertain some guests.
i'm very sorry, ladies, but i just gave my last cabin to that woman.
you gonna help, little miss goody-two-spells, or you just gonna type all day?
i know, you cast the spells, and i'll run them through my spell checker!
look, you're going to the dance with me, and that's that.
josh, you are way behind on 90s' dating rituals, and maybe you need to "catch up."
and then nanook, he hurls up a wad of blubber, and he says...
"oh, don't brush those off, 'cause you never know when you're going to run out of food in this joint."
this is the only sure way... besides dropping a house on us.
it's called the mystic abyss, and whatever goes in vanishes... forever.
well, before we turn you into a year's supply of diapers!
we happen to know for a fact that you broom jockeys can't use magic.
this warlock's coming after them, and now they've got to run for their lives.

if you are a pokémon or a person, but not to me.
if you're in this place, i guess you must be the same as all of us are
the bullet would have hit here, and come out of here.
mhatre was hit here, and the bullet came out of here.
when they told me that there is a wedding in the family..
..and there is a shortage of money then i came here.
then he moved away and became a famous pokemon expert, right, mom?
yes, but he and his family visited pallet town a few years ago.
you can use it to stay in touch with the pokemon center.
if professor oak finds out what you're doing, it won't be from me.
if i want a chance at beating you, i'd better start to rock 'n' roll.
and my onix is just how i like to rock 'n' roll.
hey, jessie, i have a question that's better i shouldn't ask:
do you think we'll get a bigger part in the next movie?
apparently you had a little bit of it left over too.
hey, becker, some guy ripped your antenna off and he's beating on your car with it.
i don't know what your father told you about running a diner, but i'll bet rule number one wasn't get a blind guy to make the coffee.
you know, between your big mouth and that cigarette, you're offending what few senses i have left.
just for your information, the place i worked before is called supercuts, part of a respected national chain.
and the fact that i didn't work out there wasn't their fault, thank you very much.
and i'm not saying i'm the capital of self-respect, but i feel pretty good about myself.
i mean, the clothes i wear have no effect on the way i do my job.
sure, if i wore a suit of magnets, then metal stuff would just come flying at me, so i don't.
but my point is, is that if i had to go out and buy a whole bunch of other stuff, well, it'd cost me a lot, and i couldn't do that on what i'm making here.
see, i got a different date every night of the week.
it seems only fair that friday gets the same quality as monday.
he just came in this morning on his way to school and said he wanted to talk to you.
oh, well, after my morning, it'll be refreshing to talk to a 7-year-old.
i'm not gonna do it on top of somebody's resting place.
we got naked and fooled around in that little park down there.
you know, people spend so much time taking about sex, they can't--
they can't possibly be getting as much as they say they are.
you know, between your big mouth and that cigarette, you're offending what few senses i have left.
i'm sorry, becker, but i can't start my morning without my run.
in the first place, i guarantee he wasn't listening to you.
and in the second place, you work for me, and so does he.
and i'm not saying i'm the capital of self-respect, but i feel pretty good about myself.
i mean, the clothes i wear have no effect on the way i do my job.

but my point is, is that if i had to go out and buy a whole bunch of other stuff, well, it'd cost me a lot, and i couldn't do that on what i'm making here.
i'm beginning to get around a little, if you know what i mean.
see, i got a different date every night of the week.
it seems only fair that friday gets the same quality as monday.
then my advice to you is to sleep all day thursday.
i have had every middle-aged lothario with hair growing out of his ears sleazing in here begging for a booster shot.
you think i'm gonna hand you a loaded gun so you can go on a rampage?
maybe i've taken a woman to mount rushmore and done it up lincoln's nose.
but you're never gonna find out, because i keep those things to myself.
they can't possibly be getting as much as they say they are.
they're too busy calling talk shows, or typing in chat rooms, or sitting around diners swapping stories about the weirdest place they ever did it.
and in our final story for tonight, we'd like to wish a special happy birthday to hazel myers.
today, the oldest woman in new york is 106 years old.
as soon as you've relived your memory, you will move on, taking only that memory with you.
yamamoto san, thinking back over the fifty years of your life...
i grew up in a working-class neighborhood, and rode the tram to school.
i always sat in the very front, by the driver's seat where the breeze came in through the open window.
the bridge where, by chance, after the war, she was reunited with her fiancee.
we'd promised to marry each other, but he told me not to count on it.
i was in the hall, tying my shoelaces, putting on my shoes to go home.
it was night, and so dark... and i wasn't wearing street shoes, but converse sneakers and tying the laces.
when we found coconuts or bananas, we couldn't climb the trees.
so we cut down the trees with our swords, wrapped the coconuts in a japanese flag, slung them over our shoulders and ran every whichway.
but i didn't have enough money, so i was the only one who couldn't eat them.
my friend gave me one of her's and it was so good.
our house was on the koshu road, and people were clinging to the ground on both sides of the road.
everyone was clinging to the ground so i thought i should too, and i joined them.
we hung a rope between two bamboo trees and swung on it.
the mothers were cooking rice in the open and made us rice balls.
i guess it's different for everyone, but one friend told me, she was thinking about the next child, as soon as her baby was born.
so i have to say... if you couldn't forget, if that pain stayed with you forever, there would be very few brothers and sisters in the world.
the cliff where he tried to commit suicide at age 20.
just as i was about to jump, the moonlight glinted off the railroad tracks.
i wonder how we look, how the world looks, to someone like her.
you have to wonder, what she thinks when she looks in the mirror.
after college, he worked for a steel company until he retired.
his wife was his only family and she passed away five years ago.
my grandmother's house was in the country, up north in yamagata.
thinking back on it now, playing in the snow there is my first memory.
i use the name sugie here, but it's not my real name.
my company went under and i had so many bad debts,
and ultimately, we end up turning memories into our own images.
of course, it really happened, so it feels very real, but...
it was in the summer and the white wash was drying in the breeze.
my head was resting on my mother's lap as she cleaned my ears.
today's the shoot day so everyone's trying to look their best.
combing what little hair they have left, putting on extra make-up.
even though your field of vision is clear, there's a patch of clouds that you plunge right through.
so basically, you're flying through a clear sky, and there's a clump of clouds ahead...
nowadays, young people go hiking, but not when we were young.
eating with my parents in a bamboo grove was a real treat!
the moment you relive your memory, you'll move on to a place where you can be sure of spending eternity with that memory.
by the time you read this letter, you will have disappeared from my memory.
when i heard your name and the date of your death, several images fell into place.
that my wife had once been engaged, to someone who died in the war...
that you did not discuss kyoko with me, was a gesture of kindness, for which i am grateful.
i would be lying if i were to say that i was not jealous of how kyoko cherished your memory.
but the years we spent together as a couple overcame that.
i've only understood that by coming here, that's allowed me to choose a memory with her.
all that women talk was just a cover for his embarrassment.
when old guys like that get assigned a young woman, they go on and on about sex.
miyahara san, mlyahara san, from the 35 years of your life, i'd like you to select your most important memory.
but today is monday, so you only have until the day after tomorrow...
but while you're here, there is one thing you must do.
from the entire 85 years of your life, we need you to select one memory.
yamamoto san, thinking back over the fifty years of your life...
i really don't want to think about all the things i've done.
i always sat in the very front, by the driver's seat where the breeze came in through the open window.
it was a short ride, but the feel of that breeze flowing past my whole body.
the pancakes at disneyland are so good, so we went to eat some.
but i didn't have enough money, so i was the only one who couldn't eat them.
my friend gave me one of her's and it was so good.
afterwards we were all full so then we decided to go, it was kind of far,
and then we were all told to go into the bamboo grove.
i was just a child, so i played among the bamboo trees.
so i have to say... if you couldn't forget, if that pain stayed with you forever, there would be very few brothers and sisters in the world.
the cliff where he tried to commit suicide at age 20.
it seems nishimura san already chose her memories while she was still alive.
i didn't realize it myself, at first, but she's living in her memories from being 9.
that's all there was to it, but thinking back, it certainly was fun.
at the time, motoori nagayo, who wrote the song, was still alive and he had three daughters.
the truth is, i was born in 1923, and died at the age of 22.
even though i don't look any older, had i lived, i would be 75 years old.
of course, it really happened, so it feels very real, but...
say i construct the future, as though i'm making a film about it.
my head was resting on my mother's lap as she cleaned my ears.
i remember how my mother smelled then, and the way my cheeks felt against her lap.
let's remove the wing, bring it on set and film it that way.
so, from his point of view, the wing will be above him.
if the background was monotone, that might heighten the effect of the red.
it's the red shoes and the dress that are important in red.
i decided this is the way to take responsibility for my life.
today's the shoot day so everyone's trying to look their best.

actually, in the forty years we were married, we never went to the movies together.
as it turned out, that was the last time we went to the movies together...
please tell me, was it that you couldn't, or that you intentionally didn't?
the reason i ask the question is that it occurred to me that not choosing, might be one way of taking responsibility...
so basically, you're flying through a clear sky, and there's a clump of clouds ahead...
you plunge into them and it's like the clouds are racing past you.
you'll move to the screening room now, and watch the memories that we recreated for you.
the moment you relive your memory, you'll move on to a place where you can be sure of spending eternity with that memory.
by the time you read this letter, you will have disappeared from my memory.
there's not much time, so i will express my feelings briefly.
even after we were married, she visited your grave, once a year, alone.
that you did not discuss kyoko with me, was a gesture of kindness, for which i am grateful.

this is your big daddy dix on kwok in the oklahoma badlands.
and here's the flip side of "two in a row" from johnny lee and tex.
and that means we're going to have to dig into big daddy's personal bag of your oldies but goodies.
the first one goes out to my boss, junior craven, and all the rest of you beer-guzzling, tobacco-chewing hillbilly dipshits out there.
you know, when you walk around here half naked like you do, trust me nobody's looking at your fucking toes!
you have no right coming at me because you had a bad day.
you know, you head due west from chicago on 80 you go straight through maleen, north platte, and then due south to maywood.
you keep doing down 83 you end up where we're standing now?
what could possibly be the logical connection between listening to that music and working in a bakery?
your husband carl listened to drug music and took god knows what.
because of it, he ended up with banal liberal arts degree and a tiresome job in a second-rate pastry shop which he owns, but still works at 70 hours a week.
my husband, leonard, on the other hand, only listens to classical.
i had to wait for jake to give me a ride.
tv says there's some whacko out there slicing and dicing women on the highways.
we couldn't have children of our own, so them kids were a real big part of her life.
the night she was killed, she was coming home from the school christmas play.
and one of the troopers says it's usually country, but when he went for supper tonight they had it on, and the jock started playing a mixed bag of blues and r and b.
well, let's find out what was being programed at the time of her death.
well, how much money do we need to get to vegas?
about 150 in gas, maybe 100 for food if we drive straight through.
if you're still listening to me, you freak, give me a ring and let's chat.
maybe i can help you out with your little problem with women.
and you've got to have more money to keep them from tearing you apart plus, they can't afford to pay you that kind of money anymore so they go looking for someone to work cheaper.
someone who may not be a true american like you, monty.
that explains why he married their maid lupe eight months later.
after she disappeared back to mexico with half the furniture and all the sliver and china then he takes up with a cowgirl in some shithole town in texas.
and i just let you enjoy it from time to time out of the kindness of my heart.
so if you got a problem with that you better stop this car and let me out right here.
you feed the lust of materialism, seducing with hours upon hours of endless temptations.
music that arouses their desire then commercial after commercial, product after product, to be prettier, to look younger, to smell better, to find pleas...
because we hadn't seen anything of the other world or been anywhere.
and then one time when my mormon mother took me to the trading post.
i lied and told them that i had been to the gulf of mexico.
i know i seem like a crazy old woman to you and the others but in my whole life it's the only lie i ever told.
sometimes i wonder what would happen if i kept playing ball.
i love my family, and i wouldn't change that for anything.
your tongue hath muttered perverseness like all the others who have come before me and have begged for the lord to heal their blasphemous thoughts like yours.
their thoughts are thoughts of outrage, trespass, greed, covetousness and the vile sin of the flesh in all its degradation.
a little while ago a guy calls in, a religious fanatic,
one of the lines he uses is, "and in return they offer their hearts up unto me."
he didn't get along with any of the others except for this one little dwarf elephant named tom thumb who was actually a she.
it didn't take long for the big fellow to lose his heart to that little lady.
as westbound express freight 151 came roaring into the yards and caught 'em by surprise.
those that witnessed it said the wheels on the locomotive locked, a deafening screech of metal, a blinding shower of hot sparks the size of a man's fist.
jumbo, racing as fast as he could, roaring like he knew the danger they were in.
of course, little tom couldn't keep up with her midget legs.
just as the freight train was beginning to bear down on her she let out a frightened shriek, stopped jumbo dead in his tracks.
he turned around, full of rage, and went back to save her.
poor old jumbo was still conscious, groaning in agony when they got to him.
everyone just stared in heart-breaking silence as jumbo gently took tom's tiny trunk in his
there was a time when i was a pretty good jock.
big game, the big game wasn't just knockin' on my door, it was tryin' to kick the mother fucker down.
i had the whole nine yards by the buck and tail and i let it go.
i let go 'cause i didn't have the brass balls to move it on the fast lane.
in the medieval period, it had some important inhabitants - a local gardener may well have dug one of them up!
it's all happened in the shadow of malmesbury's imposing abbey, in the grounds of abbey house.
'the garden is in the grounds of the original abbey, 'which henry viii disbanded in 1539.
'at the end, a magnificent medieval stone coffin - at least 6-700 years old.'
abbey house and the gardens belong to postmodernist architect ian pollard and his wife barbara, a former model.
they're not the most orthodox pair, but a giant amongst the roses was, even for them, a bit surreal.
despite no safety wire, elmer flew 200yds and survived - but broke both legs.
perhaps the most tantalising possibility of all is athelstan, the first saxon king of all england.
archaeologist john humble's first job is to remove the exposed skull.
the whole garden is protected as a scheduled ancient monument - it's been disturbed, so english heritage must now decide what to do.
after a couple of days, our first clue - the bones are emerging as a complete skeleton.
they don't look like athelstan's reburied bones, so we'll definitely have to rule him out.
sadly, we eliminate another character - the skeleton doesn't quite fill the coffin.
i never expected athelstan, but i was hoping for a giant.
but this skeleton doesn't fill the coffin, so that idea's out, too.
we're going to have to look harder to find out who this was.
i'm quite sure the skeleton still has a lot more to tell us - but not here.
it has to be carefully taken apart, then bagged and sent to the lab.
but i'm still convinced this is someone important - perhaps a senior monk, or even an abbot.
before the bones can be examined, we need to clean them up.
if we look at the teeth, there are dental problems here.
the pulp cavity had actually been exposed because of the extreme wear, and infection has passed into the pulp cavity, down the root canal, and has set up an abscess in the jaw.
initially, i thought it may be leprosy - as well as destroying the bones of the feet and hands, it can also cause new bone formation.
but signs of leprosy were absent in the skull, so we're left with a localised infection that's affecting the left foot - it's hard to say what.
'simon has studied hundreds of skeletons of medieval people who didn't.
'many suffered from acute sinusitis, the killer disease tb was rife, 'and osteoporosis was just as common then as it is now.
oh, no, they're lines which form in the bone when growth stops for a while, then starts again.
in contrast, our medieval monk is taller than average, he has no signs of tb, no signs of sinusitis.
i think it is - from just one individual, we can't come to those conclusions.
i x-rayed his leg bones - he, too, had harris lines.
harris lines on his bones show his growth stopped five times between the ages of four and nine, perhaps due to illness, or starvation during the winters.
if he was a monk, he may not have been from a privileged background, like many of his brothers.
the dating process only works if enough pure carbon is extracted from the bone collagen.
to do this, the ground-up sample will be left to dissolve in acid - but it will be several weeks until we get the results.
it would appear that it's a similar tool, and probably contemporary to this coffin.
there's a vague possibility that this was the tool that did this job.
the medieval man's bones are now spread all round the country.
while his right fibula is being carbon dated in oxford, his skull is at university college, where dr robin richards will use it to rebuild the face.
the skull is scanned with a laser to produce a three-dimensional image.
the missing bits of bone have been built up with wax to aid the laser.
now the contours of the skull have been captured, we've got the foundation of his face.
robin's programme works out where the muscles and soft tissues go.
we know he died aged about 50, so we need a selection of 50-year-old male faces, which we blend to make an average face - free from any unusual features.
now robin can stretch the face of mr average over the computerised skull.
what emerges is our first glimpse of the medieval man buried in the coffin.
illustrator jane brayne will use this image as the basis for a portrait.
'but we need to know for certain whether or not he was a monk - i need to turn the clock back.'
what's left of the abbey is just a fraction of what was here before henry viii sacked the monasteries 500 years ago.
i'm afraid we can't in this case, as it's been quite a complicated case for us - interestingly so.
we've done other tests, as well as the radiocarbon measurement, and it looks as though the diet of this man had quite a big marine component - he ate fish.
now the investigation is over, english heritage want the coffin to be reburied - but ian and barbara have other ideas.
if there was a way of not disturbing the archaeological information, and sort of...
the pollards would like to put the coffin on permanent display, but amanda isn't convinced.
the coffin would suffer if it was exposed to the elements.
i think we can, at a pinch, accept that, but i don't think it will work.
jane has now added in the details of our monk's clothing and haircut, to make him a black-habited benedictine.
'we've come to the royal national throat, nose and ear hospital.
'surgeon gus alusi has a way of visualising the skull and the face in three dimensions.'
although he ended up as a respected member of a religious community, his bones tell us starvation and disease featured in his childhood.
we can sympathise, too, with his suffering - toothache was as bad then as it is today!
ian and barbara haven't managed to come up with a solution to displaying the coffin, so it has to be filled in.
amanda's agreed to it being opened up for display in warm weather.
this is very different from the ceremony carried out here 700 years ago.
you might think the monk's bones should be put back in the grave, or that they're better off in a museum, where perhaps in a few years science will tell us more.
i think this is gonna be a great opportunity for you and my parents to bond.
i also think that this will be the right time to tell them we're engaged.
with as much money as we make, we'll be fine until they get on their feet.
i can't believe that this guy will give you 25 grand more.
all my life, i wanted to make a big hollywood movie!
i understand. ¤aste the ¤olden ¤pray was a big movie, a huge movie.
this turkish idiot who barely spoke one word of english drops us off at that schmuck next door's house.

some less than senseless thing has decided to come to my house and kidnap my goddaughter.

i've been sent here by my boss, paris whose goddaughter you all happen to be kidnapping to find her.
if you wanna stay breathing, you better tell me, melvin where the fuck she is and who the fuck, melvin is the insidious mastermind behind this plot.
and the source of constant pride to degenerate, manipulative gold-digging leeches the world over.
which leads me to my would-be son-in-law melvin who's very charming in a ¤ain ¤an kind of way.
the first thing we do when we meet this young man is have a big fight.
then the young man comes to me like sidney poitier ¤¤ guess who's coming to dinner.
you wouldn't happen to know where melvin is headed, would you?
you wouldn't happen to know where melvin might be headed, would you?
if anybody needs to make a switch to straight jacking, it's mel.
both of them chickeneads is takir my man to the cleaners.
i think this is gonna be a great opportunity... for you and my parents to bond.

it is you who must go forth... and bring these motherfuckers to me.
let's just take the money... and go to l.a. where people like us belong.
i just can't stand the idea of them not liking me anymore.
to be perfectly honest, i can't stand the idea of anybody not liking me.
who knows what unspeakable things they do to my little girl?
it says you're supposed to soak the matzo for five minutes.
you deserve to be in an environment of tolerance and brotherhood."
when i see four men of different races... colors and creeds, sitting together at the dinner table... it fills me with hope.

you wouldn't happen to know where melvin is headed, would you?
if anybody needs to make a switch to straight jacking, it's mel.
both of them chickenheads is takin' my man to the cleaners.
anyway, i took the $50,000 we had in our savings account and lent it to dad.
with as much money as we make, we'll be fine until they get on their feet.
all my life, i wanted to make a big hollywood movie!
i understand. "taste the golden spray" was a big movie, a huge movie.
i went to the bank today, and do you know what i found?
or should i say, do you know what i didn't find?

how would you respond to what your husband has just said?
you know, dan, i don't think that it's psychiatrists that you mistrust.
i actually looked up at the house and said, "goodbye, maris."
"l hope you have a happy life, but i don't have to take any more of your crap".
did you know that there are 10 quadrillion of them on this planet?
[ ben ] yeah, and, like, half of them are in this room!
um, you know, ben, i don't think we should do that.
it says right here that we can't feed them anything but the pellets... and only one pellet per day.
in addition to being great builders, ants also have an interesting family structure-- one mom and about a million kids.
in closing, ants are truly awesome, although most of the time misunderstood.
i'm not gonna spend a day of my life contesting a $75 driving ticket.
but do you know what a ticket does to your insurance?
all i have is a knife that i stole from "houlihan's" 10 years ago.
when's that part of my life gonna start, when i have it together?
i don't think i can afford your services in this situation.
dad, look, you don't have to pay me unless we win.
in the summertime we'd go out and hang out on the sets of tv shows.
and that was kind of traumatic, because these young actors were very, uh...
they kinda pushed our performing instincts out to the forefront, like, they gave us a lot of lessons...
and she was older than i was, so she kinda had a lot of advantage, plus, for a long time she used to tell me that she was a witch!
see, i just wanna be more aggressive and it's hard to be a woman and be aggressive, unless you're a basketball player.
like the women basketball players, they can be really tough and aggressive.
they always act like you don't know what you're doing, they come up to you and...
"hey, i've been checking you out over there for... quite some time, let me ask you something, where did you learn how to do all those exercises?"
i do have a license, but i just didn't bring it 'cause i don't...
i meant to get one of those wallets with the chain connected to the belt...
after our initial message, she sent me a second text message to meet her outside the club.
we did, and we walked across the street into the building.
how long have you been engaging in this kind of activity?
see, if i had to guess, i'd say about the time of speedle's death, right?
you have a stain on the bottom of your purse, and i can see salt in it.
hey, can i ask you a couple of questions about your business?
so the irregular pattern on the bumper... that matches the stitching on your jeans.
they're individually sewn, which makes each pair unique, one of a kind.
she was a complainant in a rape charge six months ago.
she was raped in the parking lot across the street from the club.
i called the police, went to the hospital, did the exam.
then the prosecutor won't file, since we were on a date.
monsieur, i used to-- l was angry at you... because when you came here, you were a worker like me... and you grew rich while i had troubles.
we've all had troubles, lafitte, and we all need help from time to time.

so i suggest you drop... this request for an investigation of the mayor.
sir, i was a guard for a year in the quarries of toulon.
once i made the connection... once i was no longer dazzled by his wealth, i've grown more certain daily.
now i recognize his f ace and voice, i'm amazed i didn't know him right away.

they said you couldn't be jean valjean, and they were right.
i've just returned from arras, where l saw the real jean vaijean.
two weeks ago, a man called carnot was arrested for poaching apples.
at the prison, a convict took one look at him and said, "l know this man.
if a subordinate of mine had done that i would have broken him.
you must punish me, monsieur, or my life will have been meaningless.
well, javert... you said he was valjean, and we ignored you.
rather than apologize... i want you to know that i've asked the prefect to transfer you to paris... to work as my deputy.
my father instructed madame toussaint to say he's out when he's on a trip... so no one will know when there's two helpless women here by ourselves.
isn't it ridiculous that he worried about it with you-- a police inspector?
whatever the truth is, a lot of people will die tonight.
is it too dangerous for us to wait here until the morning?
i'm going to spare you from a life in prison, jean valjean.

if my mother or father were to move here to vigau...
sir, i was a guard for a year in the quarries of toulon.
i saw jean valjean perform the same feat of strength the mayor did with the cart.
let me explain. i was crossing the square when you arrested her.
i asked people, and they said it was the fault of the men who'd attacked her.
you are the personification of order... morality, government-- in fact, the whole of society.
you don't have the right to forgive her for debasing all of us.
i want three of you in each direction to walk around the wall.
look for a narrow gap where someone could jump onto a roof.
if you would collect all the nuns and schoolgirls and take them to the chapel.
then my men could search everywhere and you wouldn't be in danger.
before we came here, i had money-- family money-- that i saved... to help provide for us.
well, i hope you're certain that you've made the right decision.
then they caught me... and put me in chains for almost 20 years.
they did things to me-- l can't tell you about it.
the streets are full of barricades, and everyone says something different.
whatever the truth is, a lot of people will die tonight.
it's a pity the rules don't allow me to be merciful.
i've tried to live my life without breaking a single rule.
why should you get the same as honest men like me?
and now i know how freedom feels, the jailer always at your heels.
the silver in my hand cost twice what i had earned.
in all those nineteen years, that lifetime of despair,... ..and yet he trusted me.
the old fool trusted me, he'd done his bit of good.
i played the grateful serf and thanked him like i should.
so, messieurs, you may release him,... ..for this man has spoken true.
i commend you for your duty,... ..and god's blessing go with you.
you must use this precious silver... ..to become an honest man.
by the witness of the martyrs,... ..by the passion and the blood,... ..god has raised you out of darkness.
..as i stare into the void, to the whirlpool of my sin.
i'll escape now from the world, from the world of jean valjean.
you must send the slut away, or we're all gonna end in the gutter.
it's us who'll have to pay... ..at the end of the day.
you'd be the cause, i had no doubt... ..of any trouble hereabout.
you play a virgin in the light but need no urging in the night!
it's not for the whore to say "yes, sir" or "no, sir".
it's not for the harlot to pick or to choose, or to lead me a dance.
let him give a full description, let him answer to javert.
in this nest of whores and vipers, let one speak who saw it all.
well, of course, he now denies it, you'd expect that of a con.
but he couldn't run for ever, no, not even jean valjean.
you heard me ask for something and i never ask twice.
welcome, monsieur, sit yourself down and meet the best innkeeper in town.
those who follow the path of the righteous... ..shall have their reward.
and if they fall as lucifer fell... ..the flame, the sword!
and each in your season returns and returns,... ..and is always the same.
and if you fall as lucifer fell,... ..you fall in flames!
do we fight for the right to a night at the opera now?
have you asked of yourselves what's the price you might pay?
had you been there tonight you might know how it feels.
to be struck to the bone in a moment of breathless delight.
do you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men?
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.
then join in the fight that will give you the right to be free!
do you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men?
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.
when the beating of your heart echoes the beating of the drums... ..there is a life about to start when tomorrow comes.
do you hear the people sing, singing the song of angry men?
it is the music of a people who will not be slaves again.
in my life... ..there are so many questions and answers that somehow seem wrong.
in my life... ..there are times when i catch in the silence... ..the sigh of a faraway song.
in my life,... ..she has burst like the music of angels, the light of the sun.
and my life seems to stop as if something is over... ..and something has scarcely begun.
without a home, without a friend, without a face to say hello to.
and now the night is near, now i can make believe he's here.
sometimes i walk alone at night when everybody else is sleeping.
i think of him and then i'm happy with the company i'm keeping.
and all i see is him and me for ever and for ever.
and i know it's only in my mind... ..that i'm talking to myself and not to him.
and although i know that he is blind,... ..still i say there's a way for us.
i love him, but when the night is over... ..he is gone.
better be warned, they have armies to spare, and our danger is real.
we will need all our cunning to bring them to heel.
it was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate.
wipe out the past and wash me clean off the slate.
how can i now allow this man... ..to hold dominion over me?
this desperate man whom i have hunted,... ..he gave me my life.
as i stare into the void of a world that cannot hold.
i'll escape now from that world,... ..from the world of jean valjean.
every day, i wonder every day,... ..who was it brought me here from the barricade.
don't think about it, marius,... ..with all the years ahead of us,... ..i will never go away,... ..and we will be together every day.
paris at me feet,... ..paris in the dust,... ..and here's me breaking bread with the upper crust.
beggar at the feast, master of the dance,... ..life is easy pickings if you grab your chance.
everywhere you go, law-abiding folk... ..doing what is decent but they're mostly broke.
singing to the lord on sundays... ..praying for the gifts he'll send.
but we're the ones who take it, we're the ones who make it... ..in the end.
watch the buggers dance, watch 'em till they drop,... ..keep your wits about you and you stand on top.
for the wretched of the earth there is a flame that never dies.
even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise.
they will live again in freedom in the garden of the lord.
they will walk behind the ploughshare,... ..they will put away the sword.
but when it went bankrupt five years ago incredible to think of now, he bought the works for less than 500 francs.
on second thought, captain, i should report to the mayor first.
for example, paris knows my father was a thief and my mother a prostitute.
if my mother or father moved here, i'd want everyone to know what they are.
modern science tells us that people are by nature law breakers or law abiders.
a wolf can wear sheep's clothing, but he's still a wolf.
sir, i was a guard for a year in the quarries of toulon.
i saw jean valjean perform the same feat of strength as the mayor did with the cart.
she enjoyed her sixth birthday party and the new doll we bought her.
we love her so we won't charge for her present but she needs a new coat and shoes.
if a subordinate of mine had done that, i would have broken him.
you must punish me, monsieur, or my life will have been meaningless.
in prison, i was as ignorant, mean and devious as these men here, but not kind.
i wish i could keep my mouth shut and let this poor wretch suffer for me, but....
even if you were to offer 1000 francs, even 1,200, i couldn't give her to you.
it's true, i owe 1,500 francs and my whole life would be solved if only i had 1,500 francs, but....
well, javert you said he was valjean, and we ignored you.
rather than apologize, i want you to know that i've asked the prefect to transfer you to paris to work as my deputy.
whatever the truth is, a lot of people will die tonight.
is it too dangerous for us to wait till the morning?
i'm going to spare you from a life in prison, jean valjean.
it's a pity the rules don't allow me to be merciful.
i'll give you a ring in the morning...when you're feeling better.
'to say forensic pathology is an absolute science would be rather like saying' the universe ends at the milky way.
be confident within yourself before you commit your thoughts to other people, and if you're unsure, then say nothing.
the body and the scene of the crime, if you look closely enough, will give you the answers.
annabelle would have been deeply touched to see so many friends and colleagues here today.
this is, of course, a sad occasion and there's absolutely nothing that i or anybody else can say to make it any easier.
it all adds up to the fact she was fully clothed when first assaulted.
she was dragged over a hard surface, clothes removed, nightdress put on, then placed on her bed.
sixth man: "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."
seventh man: "your husband served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond..."
now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of ike's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
we tried to make our way up through the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed, high-density field-- little bit of everything.
sprengmine 44s, schumine 42s, pot mines, a-200s-- the little wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
i've been with him since kasserine pass, and i don't have a clue.
he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting lightbulb or something.
'cause the truth is, i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep.
maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh?
and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name.
ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.
so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate.
no, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.
i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is, why don't we just go around the thing?
i hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of 2.
you got the 2 bazookas, but they only got 8 rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
hit them hard as we can one-on-one and fall back to the bridge.
machine gun on the move down here, number 2 up high somewhere to piss a little bad news on their heads.
"when you're over there, if you see anything that upsets you, or if you're ever scared,
i want you to close your eyes and think of these.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
and so alice jardine hears this, and she screams and she jumps up and she tries to get running out of the barn, but she's still got this shirt over her head.
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer.
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the men and women of the united states army, and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other american families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
o my god, i am heartily sorry for having offended thee.
o my god, i am heartily sorry for having offended thee.
sixth man: "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."

now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of ike's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone.
"dear madam, i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you... are the mother of 5... sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost... and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice
we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here.
they'd already gotten 4 of our shermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves.
sprengmine 44s, schumine 42s, pot mines, a-200s-- the little wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
this road here... they placed big mushrooms-- teller mine 43s, i guess for our tanks-- from here right up to the edge of the village, right here.
i mean, you got a mother, sarge has got a mother.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
"theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die."
well, in that case, i'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir.
moreover... i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to ease her suffering.
somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
i've been with him since kasserine pass, and i don't have a clue.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
"war educates the senses, calls into action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man."
yeah, well, i guess that's emerson's way of... finding the bright side.
meantime, other guys keep showing up, 1, 2, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit, head off to make trouble, sir.
some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
and when-- and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling.
and the others, they stopped easy enough ok, though, you know?
we were just-- we were just too damn heavy, you know?
maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh?
and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name.
ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.

i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is, why don't we just go around the thing?
sir, i just, uh, i don't have a good feeling about this one.
well, when was the last time you felt good about anything?
i teach english composition in this little town called addley, pennsylvania.
the last 11 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
corporal henderson... i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
the chief of staff for the united states army says it does.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me, i was here with the only brothers i have left.
you got the 2 bazookas, but they only got 8 rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful, because she's just pouring out of this thing, you know?
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice-- alice jardine.
[laughs] i mean... picture a girl who just took a nose-dive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down.
so he grabs her by a leg, and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
my dear mrs. ryan, it's with the most profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son,
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.

and i might share with you some words which have sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
to be honest with you, l-- l wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.

to be honest with you, l-- l wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
he was a fine soldier and he believed very strongly in what we were doing...
it's no secret anymore that we were involved in one of the most important operations of this war.
we came to a clearing, where over 4,000 troops had passed.
your husband served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself...
- mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
general, first reports are that the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone!
"... sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle. "
"i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... "
"but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... "
"... in the thanks of the republic they died to save. "
"i pray our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement... "

we, uh we took out towed 88's, here, here, and here.
they've already gotten four of our shermans, a number of deuce and a halves.
yeah, i think he's up there somewhere, part of all the airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy to find one particular soldier in the middle of this goddamn war.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
- there's not to reason why, there's but to do and die.
in that case, i'd say, "this is an excellent mission, sir...
"... with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir. "
captain, the decent thing to do is to at least take her down the road to the next town.
we're not here to do the decent thing, we're here to follow fucking orders!
there's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said the 101st is scattered to hell.
we tried going through, but it turned into a high-density field... little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s, pot mines, a-200s... the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
anybody there have a big mouth, say where the drop was?
no, sir, but they had the same rally point as us.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
we missed our drop zone by 20 miles, ended up by bumville or some damn place.
we were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men
rommel knows that, so he's gonna try to get his armour across the river.
then he can hit us in the flank when we turn to cherbourg.
but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?
someday we might look back and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess.
i think they're going to try to whip around the flanks...
unless we draw them up here between these buildings, where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn, into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice...
and alice jardine screams, and jumps up, and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head, and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad, he starts coming after us, but alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer... my shield and he in whom i trust.

so, captain, what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
the last 1 1 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
i was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
sir, there's no way to tell. i mean, we have no idea what's happening south of us.
the chief of staff for the united states army says it does.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
you got the two 30-caliber machine guns, 1 7 grenades, 1 1 hawkins mines.
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
well, i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks.
unless we can draw them up this main road here in between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
yeah, that, sir, is the one thing we got plenty of.
i got that bridge wired with enough composition b to blow it twice.
you take a standard-issue gl sock, cram it with as much comp b as it can hold, rig up a simple fuse, then you coat the whole thing with axle grease.
that way, when you throw it, it should stick. lt's a bomb that sticks.
"l see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
jesus, upham, any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me.
and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 d, all right?
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and there was my oldest brother dan
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is just so mad at us, he starts coming after us, but at the same time, alice is over there unconscious.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.
the thing explodes, the whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
my goodness and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer,
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
sixth man : "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."
seventh man : "your husband served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond..."
eighth man : "...which we all cherish and hold so dear.
the loss of lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment."
now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of ike's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
we tried to make our way up through the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed, high-density field-- little bit of everything.
sprengmine 44s, schumine 42s, pot mines, a-200s-- the little wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
i've been with him since kasserine pass, and i don't have a clue.
he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting lightbulb or something.
'cause the truth is, i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep.
maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh?
and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name.
we missed our drop zone by about 20 miles, ended up way over by bumville or some damn place.
him, me, and a couple of other guys were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to, uh...
ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.
so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate.
no, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.
i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is, why don't we just go around the thing?
i hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.
yes, sir, that was one hell of a call, coming to take this nest, but, what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.
i hope mama ryan's real fuckin' happy knowing that little jimmy's life is more important than 2 of our guys!
sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife is even going to recognize me whenever it is i get back to her.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
the chief of staff for the united states army says it does.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?
some day we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess.
we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man, you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
we're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches... right up there.
so you got to be johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo, or we're dead.
she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful, because she's just pouring out of this thing, you know?
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice-- alice jardine.
so he grabs her by a leg, and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the men and women of the united states army, and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other american families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
there's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said the 101st is scattered to hell.
we tried going through, but it turned into a high-density field... little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s, pot mines, a-200s... the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
anybody there have a big mouth, say where the drop was?
no, sir, but they had the same rally point as us.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
and the others, they stopped easy enough ok, though, you know?
we were just... we were just too damn heavy, you know?
we keep pressure on till he has to change his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
to march a thousand paces, then he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to allied patrols.
sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife will even recognise me whenever i get back to her.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn, into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice...
and alice jardine screams, and jumps up, and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head, and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad, he starts coming after us, but alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer... my shield and he in whom i trust.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.

i share with you some words which sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flat-hatting through swarms of german reinforcements along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here... written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
we keep pressure on till he has to change his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
to march a thousand paces, then he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to allied patrols.

i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
i teach english composition in this little town called addley, pennsylvania.
the last 1 1 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
ah, ryan... i don't know anything about ryan. i don't care.
is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me, i was here with the only brothers i have left, and that there's no way i was gonna desert them.
but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?
someday we might look back and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
my dear mrs ryan, it's with a profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son private james ryan is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.

nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
to be honest with you, i wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.

they came in, and beat the hell out of us with 88s.
tell you what, sir, if you're our relief, i'm gonna file a complaint.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
now, our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of two.
you got the two 30-caliber machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 hawkins mines.
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
well, i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks.
unless we can draw them up this main road here in between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
jesus, upham, any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me.
and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 d, all right?
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.

nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
to be honest with you, i wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
i just learned that this afternoon their mother's going to get all three telegrams.
there's also a fourth brother who parachuted in with 101st airborne - the night before the invasion.
he was dropped 15 miles inland near neuville, behind german lines.
mac, there is no way you can know where he was dropped.
and frankly, if we go sending some sort of rescue mission, - flat-hatting throughout german reinforcements along our advance, - they're going to be k.i.a., too.
i have a letter here written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
"i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement" -
"of the adjutant general of massachusetts" - 'that you are the mother of five..."
"and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost" -
"and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid such a sacrifice" -
he'd better go home and cure some disease - or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb or something.
for the truth is that i wouldn't trade ten ryans for one vecchio or caparzo.
i used to lie in bed and stay awake as long as i could,but it never worked because the harder i tried the faster i'd fall asleep.
that wouldn't have mattered in my house.ma would've come home, shook me awake,chatted me up 'til dawn.she was never too tired to talk.
that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is,sometimes she would come home early and i'd pretend to be asleep.
she'd stand in the doorway looking at me, and i would just keep my eyes shut.
and i knew that she just wanted to find out about my day, that she came home early just to talk to me.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
when we released i cut as hard as i could, trying to gain some altitude and keep her from stalling.
him, me and a couple of others were coming here to the rally point.
we ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to ramelle.
he's going to try to get his armour across the merderet river anyway he can.
that way he can hit us in the flank when we make the turn for cherbourg.
i don't know how fast you are, but if we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
i teach english composition... in this little town called addley, pennsylvania.
in the last 11 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me i was here, and i was with the only brothers that i have left, and that there was no way i was going to desert them.
you've got the.230 calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 hawkins mines.
you've got two bazookas, but they've only got eight rounds left.
as our colleague from airborne pointed out what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.
how do we stop the tank if we get it to commit?
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
any more songs like this, the krauts won't have to shoot me.
when i want to think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, - or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
they took me to the barn up into the loft and there was my oldest brother dan with alice jardine!
picture a girl who just took a nosedive from the ugly tree and hit every branch coming down!
"the men and women of the us army, and the citizens of a grateful nation"
"in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james."
to be honest with you, i wasn't sure how i would feel coming back here.
every day, i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
there's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said the 101st is scattered to hell.
we tried going through, but it turned into a high-density field... little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s, pot mines, a-200s... the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
well, when it gets up to 500, i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
to march a thousand paces, then he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to allied patrols.
sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife will even recognise me whenever i get back to her.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
well... i think they're going to try to whip around the flanks...
unless we draw them up here between these buildings, where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
"l see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
any more of this, the krauts won't have to shoot me.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn, into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice...
and alice jardine screams, and jumps up, and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head, and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad, he starts coming after us, but alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer... my shield and he in whom i trust.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the united states army and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
i share with you some words which sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
mac, there is no way you can know where he was dropped.
first report from ike's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered.
"may our heavenly father assuage the anguish of your bereavement" -
"and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost" -
sprengmine 44s, schumne 42s, - pot mines, a-200s, the little wooden bastard the detectors don't pick up.
here, they placed big mushrooms, teller mine 43s, i guess for our tanks, - from here right up to the edge of the village, right here.
"moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private ryan" -
"and i'll lay down my life and those of my men, especially yours, reiben," - 'to ease her suffering."
that wouldn't have mattered in my house.ma would've come home, shook me awake,chatted me up 'til dawn.she was never too tired to talk.
that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
then some officer will come along, patch together a mixed unit, - and head off to make trouble.
we're looking for a private ryan, baker company, 506th of the 101st.
yeah, we missed our dropzone by about 20 miles and ended up way over by "bumville" or some damn place.
him, me and a couple of others were coming here to the rally point.
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port and rommel knows that.
he's going to try to get his armour across the merderet river anyway he can.
that way he can hit us in the flank when we make the turn for cherbourg.
that makes any village on the river with a bridge solid gold real estate.
no, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.
i don't know how fast you are, but if we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
i hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.
upham, switch off with jackson and you linger in the rear.
we advance and keep pressure on him 'til he has to change out his barrels.
that was one hell of a call coming to take this nest, but what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.
i hope mama ryan's really happy knowing that little jimmy's life was more important than two of our guys!
in the last 11 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
i was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.
but another part of me thinks, "what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?"
some day we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we pulled out of this whole godawful, shitty mess.
we had a.60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
they push us this far, the last man alive blows the bridge.
we've only got a 30-second delay on the fuse, so tell everyone that if you're last you'd better hurry or you'll not live long.
"and then one day you left me and i've been desperate ever since."
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
"over there, if you see anything that upsets you, if you're scared,"
"i want you to close your eyes and think of these, you understand?"
you don't just think about their faces, you think about something specific, something you've done together.
when i want to think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, - or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers woke me up in the middle of the night.
"even after he was informed of the loss your family has suffered"
"in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression."
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flathatting throughout swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here, written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
i've been with him since kasserine pass, but i don't have a clue.
the one that was always walking around on his hands, you know?
and he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze.
he'd better go home, cure some disease, or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
'cause the truth is i wouldn't trade 1 0 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
meantime, other guys keep showing up, one, two, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit,
we missed our drop zone by about 20 miles, ended up way over by bumville or some damn place.
him, me and a couple of other guys were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to ramelle.
ramelle is on the merderet river, right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port.
and rommel knows that, so he's gonna try to get his armour across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate.
no, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.
yeah, well, i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
i hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.
we advance and keep pressure on him till he has to change out his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
the last 1 1 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
i was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.
they came in, and beat the hell out of us with 88s.
tell you what, sir, if you're our relief, i'm gonna file a complaint.
corporal henderson, i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
now, our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of two.
is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me, i was here and i was with the only brothers that i have left, and that there's no way i was gonna desert them.
but another part of me thinks what if, by some miracle, we stay and actually make it out of here?
someday we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
hit them hard as we can, one-on-one, and fall back to the bridge.
machine gun on the move down here, and number two up high somewhere to piss a little bad news down on their heads.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful 'cause she's just pouring out of this thing, you know?
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
and so alice jardine hears this and she screams, and she jumps up, and she tries to get running out of the barn, but she's still got this shirt over her head.
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so he grabs her by a leg and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
to be honest with you, i wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
there's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said the 101st is scattered to hell.
we tried going through, but it turned into a high-density field... little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s, pot mines, a-200s... the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
well, when it gets up to 500, i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
we keep pressure on till he has to change his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
i teach english composition in this little town called addley, pennsylvania.
the last 1 1 years, i've been at thomas alva edison high school.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
ah, ryan... i don't know anything about ryan. i don't care.
is that what they're supposed to tell your mother when they send her another folded american flag?
tell her that when you found me, i was here with the only brothers i have left, and that there's no way i was gonna desert them.
but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?
someday we might look back and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
my dear mrs ryan, it's with a profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son private james ryan is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the united states army and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
to be honest with you, i wasn't sure how i'd feel coming back here.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flathatting throughout swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here, written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.

it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
i'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir.
moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan, and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to ease her suffering.
the one that was always walking around on his hands, you know?
and he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze.
he'd better go home, cure some disease, or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
'cause the truth is i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.

meantime, other guys keep showing up, one, two, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit,
some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling.
and rommel knows that, so he's gonna try to get his armour across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
yeah, well, i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.

now, our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of two.
you got the 230-calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 hawkins mines.
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
well, i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks.
unless we can draw them up this main road here in between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
jesus, upham, any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me.
and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 d, all right?
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and there was my oldest brother dan
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is just so mad at us, he starts coming after us, but at the same time, alice is over there unconscious.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.
the thing explodes, the whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, fiat-hatting through swarms of german reinforcements along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here... written a iong time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'ii just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
anybody there have a big mouth, say where the drop was?
no, sir, but they had the same rally point as us.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
we keep pressure on till he has to change his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn, into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice...
and alice jardine screams, and jumps up, and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head, and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad, he starts coming after us, but alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer... my shield and he in whom i trust.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the united states army and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
i share with you some words which sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
sixth man: "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."
seventh man: "your husband served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond..."
now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of ike´s people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here.
they´d already gotten 4 of our shgermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves.
i mean, you got a mother, sarge has got a mother.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain´s got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
"theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die."
somebody must know where he´s from, what he did for a living.
i´ve been with him since kasserine pass, and i don´t have a clue.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she´d get home.
yeah, that´s probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she´d come home early, and i´d pretend to be asleep.
some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
and when-- and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling.
and the others, they stopped easy enough ok, though, you know?
we were just-- we were just too damn heavy, you know?
we missed our drop zone by about 20 miles, ended up way over by bumville or some damn place.
him, me, and a couple of other guys were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to, uh...

and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name.

tell him to march 1 ,000 paces in that direction, then he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to the first allied patrol he comes across.
corporal henderson, i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
the chief of staff for the united states army says it does.

i got that bridge wired with enough composition b to blow it twice.

and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flathatting throughout swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here, written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
i'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir.
moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan, and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to ease her suffering.
the one that was always walking around on his hands, you know?
and he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze.
he'd better go home, cure some disease, or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
'cause the truth is i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
meantime, other guys keep showing up, one, two, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit,
some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling.
and rommel knows that, so he's gonna try to get his armour across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
yeah, well, i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
they came in, and beat the hell out of us with 88s.
tell you what, sir, if you're our relief, i'm gonna file a complaint.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
now, our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of two.
you got the two 30-calibre machine guns, 1 7 grenades, 1 1 hawkins mines.
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
well, i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks.
unless we can draw them up this main road here in between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
jesus, upham, any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me.
and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 d, all right?
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and there was my oldest brother dan
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is just so mad at us, he starts coming after us, but at the same time, alice is over there unconscious.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.
the thing explodes, the whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
my goodness and my fortress, my high tower and my deliverer,
the loss of lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment."
"i fully understand your desire to learn as much as possible regarding the circumstances leading to his death."
now, mac, there is no way you can know where in the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of ike's people at shaef said the 101st is scattered all to hell and gone.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here.
they'd already gotten 4 of our shermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting lightbulb or something.
'cause the truth is, i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep.
"war educates the senses, calls into action the will, perfects the physical constitution, brings men into such swift and close collision in critical moments that man measures man."
yeah, well, i guess that's emerson's way of... finding the bright side.
we missed our drop zone by about 20 miles, ended up way over by bumville or some damn place.
him, me, and a couple of other guys were coming here to the rally point, ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to, uh...
ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.
so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate.
i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is, why don't we just go around the thing?
we advance and keep pressure on him till he has to change out his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
yes, sir, that was one hell of a call, coming to take this nest, but, what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.
i hope mama ryan's real fuckin' happy knowing that little jimmy's life is more important than 2 of our guys!
sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife is even going to recognize me whenever it is i get back to her.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of 2.
we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
hit them hard as we can one-on-one and fall back to the bridge.
machine gun on the move down here, number 2 up high somewhere to piss a little bad news on their heads.
"when you're over there, if you see anything that upsets you, or if you're ever scared,
i want you to close your eyes and think of these.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice-
so he grabs her by a leg, and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer.
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the men and women of the united states army, and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other american families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
sixth man: "...came to a clearing near a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."
seventh man: "your husband served in a combat unit whose dangerous duty is to place itself beyond..."
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flat-hatting through swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be k.i.a. too.
i have a letter here... written a long time ago to a mrs. bixby in boston.
i have been shown in the files of the war department a statement of the adjutant general of massachusetts that you... are the mother of 5... sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle.
i feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine... that would attempt to beguile you from the grief... of a loss so overwhelming.
but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
i pray that our heavenly father may assuage the anguish of your bereavement and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost... and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice
we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here.
they'd already gotten 4 of our shermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep.
maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh?
and wander the woods like hansel and gretel, calling his name.
ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.
you know anything about this bridge he was talking about, captain?
we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.
so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can.

sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of 2.
but another part of me thinks... what if by some miracle we stay and actually make it out of here?
some day we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole god-awful, shitty mess.
we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man, you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
we're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches... right up there.
so you got to be johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo, or we're dead.
"when you're over there, if you see anything that upsets you, or if you're ever scared,
i want you to close your eyes and think of these.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.

so he grabs her by a leg, and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
my dear mrs. ryan, it's with the most profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son,
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.

nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other american families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
and i might share with you some words which have sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flat-hatting through swarms of german reinforcements along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.

he'd better go home and cure some disease or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
we missed our drop zone by 20 miles, ended up by bumville or some damn place.

corporal henderson, i don't mean to leave you even more shorthanded, but orders are orders.
any communication about when you're going to be relieved up here?
the chief of staff for the united states army says it does.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.

someday we might look back on this and decide that saving private ryan was the one decent thing we were able to pull out of this whole

machine gun on the move down here, and number two up high somewhere to piss a little bad news down on their heads.
yeah, that, sir, is the one thing we got plenty of.
i got that bridge wired with enough composition b to blow it twice.
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful 'cause she's just pouring out of this thing, you know?
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
and so alice jardine hears this and she screams, and she jumps up, and she tries to get running out of the barn, but she's still got this shirt over her head.
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so he grabs her by a leg and he's dragging her.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.

but i cannot refrain from tendering to you the consolation that may be found... in the thanks of the republic... they died to save.
we, uh... we took out towed 88s here, here... and here.
they'd already gotten 4 of our shermans and a number of our deuce-and-a-halves.
i mean, you got a mother, sarge has got a mother.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
"theirs not to reason why, theirs but to do and die."
somebody must know where he's from, what he did for a living.
i've been with him since kasserine pass, and i don't have a clue.
well, when my mother was an intern, she used to work late through the night, sleep through the day.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
yeah, that's probably the only time she could get a word in.
funny thing is, sometimes she'd come home early, and i'd pretend to be asleep.
maybe we should bust up into a couple of different groups, huh?

ramelle... is on the merderet river right here, just to the southwest of us.

we can't push on paris until we take a deep water port, and rommel knows that.
so he's gonna try to get his armor across the merderet river anywhere he can.

that makes any village on that river with an intact bridge solid gold real estate.

we had a 60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man, you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
we're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches... right up there.
so you got to be johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo, or we're dead.
she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
and it's beautiful, because she's just pouring out of this thing, you know?
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard or... my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice- alice jardine.
and so alice jardine hears this, and she screams and she jumps up and she tries to get running out of the barn, but she's still got this shirt over her head.
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel, and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war and my fingers to fight.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer.
my dear mrs. ryan, it's with the most profound sense of joy that i write to inform you your son,
private james ryan, is well and, at this very moment, on his way home from european battlefields.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after he was informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.
i take great pleasure in joining the secretary of war, the men and women of the united states army, and the citizens of a grateful nation in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with james at your side.
nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son, can compensate you or the thousands of other american families who have suffered great loss in this tragic war.
and i might share with you some words which have sustained me through long, dark nights of peril, loss and heartache.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
and frankly, sir, we go sending some sort of rescue mission, flathatting throughout swarms of german reinforcements all along our axis of advance, they're gonna be kia, too.
i have a letter here, written a long time ago to a mrs bixby in boston.
they think he's up there somewhere, part of all those airborne misdrops.
it's not gonna be easy finding one particular soldier in the middle of this whole goddamn war.
i mean, shit, i bet even the captain's got a mother.
well, maybe not the captain, but the rest of us got mothers.
i'd say this is an excellent mission, sir, with an extremely valuable objective, sir, worthy of my best efforts, sir.
moreover, i feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of private james ryan, and am willing to lay down my life and the lives of my men, especially you, reiben, to ease her suffering.
the one that was always walking around on his hands, you know?
and he was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze.
he'd better go home, cure some disease, or invent a longer-lasting light bulb or something.
'cause the truth is i wouldn't trade 10 ryans for one vecchio or one caparzo.
so the only time that we ever got to talk about anything was when she'd get home.
so what i used to do, i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake as long as i could, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
meantime, other guys keep showing up, one, two, half-dozen at a time.
then some officer'll come along and patch together a mixed unit,
some fucking genius had the great idea of welding a couple of steel plates onto our deck to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me about it until we were just getting airborne.
i nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.
and when we released, you know, i cut as hard as i could, tried to gain some altitude and still keep her from stalling.
and rommel knows that, so he's gonna try to get his armour across the merderet river anywhere he can.
that way, he can hit our invasion forces in the flank when we make the big right turn to cherbourg.
yeah, well, i don't know how fast the rest of you betties are, but i'm thinking we detour this way quick and quiet, the krauts will never even know we were here.
so, captain, what i'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?
we advance and keep pressure on him till he has to change out his barrels.
i think we should be able to hit him from grenade range.
they came in, and beat the hell out of us with 88s.
tell you what, sir, if you're our relief, i'm gonna file a complaint.
sir, our orders are to hold this bridge at all cost.
now, our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the merderet with the exception of two.
you got the 230-calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 hawkins mines.
you got the two bazookas, but they only got eight rounds left, and assorted small arms.
we had a 60 mortar but an arty round took it out.
might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.
well, i'm thinking they're going to try to whip around the flanks.
unless we can draw them up this main road here in between these buildings where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
they push us back this far, last man alive blows the bridge.
we only got a 30-second delay on that fuse, so let everyone know that if you are that last man you better hurry your ass off, or you're not going to be alive long.
"i see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
jesus, upham, any more songs like this, the krauts aren't going to have to shoot me.
and i've got her convinced that she's, like, a 42 d, all right?
so we're in the dressing room, she's trying to squeeze into this side-cut, silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle with the shelf-lift brassiere.
well, when i think of home, i think of something specific.
i think of my hammock in the backyard, or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.
this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
so they took me to the barn, up into the loft, and there was my oldest brother dan
she goes running right into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is just so mad at us, he starts coming after us, but at the same time, alice is over there unconscious.
at the same time, he picks up a shovel and he's going after sean.
and sean said, "what are you trying to hit me for?
it goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.
the thing explodes, the whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.
every day i think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.
and i've tried to live my life the best i could.
there's no way to know where the hell he was dropped.
first reports out of shaef said the 101st is scattered to hell.
we tried going through, but it turned into a high-density field... little bit of everything.
spreng mine 44s, pot mines, a-200s... the wooden bastards that the mine detectors don't pick up.
well, there isn't any easy way to say this, so, uh... so i'll just say it - your brothers are dead.
we have, uh, orders to come get you... 'cause you're going home.
my mother was an intern, she worked late nights, slept through the day, so the only time we got to talk was when she'd get home.
so i used to lie in my bed and try to stay awake, but it never worked 'cause the harder i tried, the faster i'd fall asleep.
well, when it gets up to 500, i'll tell you and we'll split the money, how about that?
well, sir, i feel it's my duty under your command to suggest we wait until it gets to a thousand, sir.
some fucking genius had the idea of welding steel plates on to keep the general safe from ground fire.
unfortunately, they forgot to tell me until we were getting airborne.
to march a thousand paces, then he can take off the blindfold.
we'll be gone, and he turns himself in to allied patrols.
sometimes i wonder if i've changed so much, my wife will even recognise me whenever i get back to her.
and how i'll ever be able to... to tell her about days like today.
well... i think they're going to try to whip around the flanks...
unless we draw them up here between these buildings, where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck.
"l see you all over the sky, i see you all over the earth."
any more of this, the krauts won't have to shoot me.
well, this one night, two of my brothers came and woke me up in the middle of the night, and they said they had a surprise for me.
they took me to the barn, into the loft, and... there was my oldest brother dan... with alice...
and alice jardine screams, and jumps up, and tries to get out, but this shirt's over her head, and she runs into the wall and knocks herself out.
so now dan is so mad, he starts coming after us, but alice is there unconscious, he's gotta wake her up.
blessed be the lord, my strength, which teaches my hands to war.
my goodness and my fortress... my high tower and my deliverer... my shield and he in whom i trust.
reports from the front indicate james did his duty in combat with great courage and steadfast dedication even after informed of the tragic loss your family has suffered in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression.

miss drake, the drama club had their heart set on guys and dolls this year.
well... maybe if they use last year's set from our town.
crusoe's afraid that he'd be stuck on that island forever... with nothing but calluses.
- [ classmates chuckle ] - [ teacher ] no, that's not correct.
yeah, i've always been good at football and basketball and every other sport i try.
i think maybe it's time i try something i'm not so good at, something different.
we were hoping that she would get through the school year, but unfortunately it--
i hope you can understand the sensitive nature of the situation.
well, miss burke, we have a problem... because i'm sitting on my car and that's my property.
well, um, i've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
you want to tell me about it or take it up with principal drake?
you're too tense, miss burke, but i've got just the thing for you.
so after the accident, i came here to live with relatives, you know.
so i moved in with my cousins and... here i am.
will someone please tell me what the hell's going on here?
it all started yesterday when i found this thing, this new species.
i mean, you seem to know an awful lot about this stuff.
no offence, but you're not exactly known for your academic achievements.
with mr furlong, we plunged it into his eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.
you stick her, and then i'll shoot her before it erupts all over the place.
eternal little loser... who comes to school every day knowing that this is it.
you've been labelled pathetic... since first grade, and you're afraid it's gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.
- well, she can just fit right in with people who are just like her.
you see, casey, even marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
both the local authorities and the f.b.i. have largely discounted... several students' claim that an extraterrestrial was involved.
a spokesperson for the f.b.i. has indicated... that no substantiating evidence has been found.
i don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.

i know you pride yourself on being the outsider, stokely, but aren't you tired of being something you're not?
where the underachiever goes home at night to parents who care.
the jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror.
you see, casey, even marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
i can make you a part of something so special, casey, so perfect, so fearless.
as you can see, life has returned to normal at herrington high... after the mysterious disappearance of several faculty members one month ago.

it all started yesterday when i found this thing, this new species.
it can survive on its own, but it's really part of a greater organism.
look, it has the ability to replicate, but it needs a host.
with mr furlong, we plunged it into his eye, and the reaction was instantaneous.
you stick her, and then i'll shoot her before it erupts all over the place.
eternal little loser... who comes to school every day knowing that this is it.
you've been labelled pathetic... since first grade, and you're afraid it's gonna bleed over for the rest of your life.
maybe they just bettered who he was, cleared away his confusion.
i know you pride yourself on being the outsider, stokely, but aren't you tired of being something you're not?
the jock can be smart, the ugly duckling beautiful, and the class wuss doesn't have to live in terror.
and the new girl– well, she can just fit right in with people who are just like her.
you see, casey, even marybeth's feelings can be hurt... by a bunch of pathetic, lost, little outcasts... who truly believe that their disaffected lonely life... is the only way they can survive.
i can make you a part of something so special, casey, so perfect, so fearless.
as you can see, life has returned to normal at herrington high... after the mysterious disappearance of several faculty members one month ago.
both the local authorities and the f.b.i. have largely discounted... several students' claim that an extraterrestrial was involved.
i don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.
miss drake, the drama club had their heart set on guys and dolls this year.
yeah, i've always been good at football and basketball and every other sport i try.
i think maybe it's time i try something i'm not so good at, something different.
well, miss burke, we have a problem... because i'm sitting on my car and that's my property.
well, i've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
you want to tell me about it or take it up with principal drake?
you're too tense, miss burke, but i've got just the thing for you.
so after the accident, i came here to live with relatives, you know.
so i moved in with my cousins and... here i am.
the point is they're here, they've been here and they're here again.
you know, casey, i think you've been racked into the flagpole one too many times.

took her out of a bassinet, put her in your hands, and told you to take her home, and that's after you said no thank you.
now i appreciate you're taking the interests beyond the needs of the assignment, but that indulgence ends now.
the f.b.i. is curious why the las vegas based linderman group would be so interested in helping a new york business.
my father was in charge of the group before he passed away.
i tell you that flood in our basement turned into a right vacation for this family.
too bad claire is missing it all with that cheerleading retreat.
that's the only way to make sure that claire will stay safe.
i didn't know that i could talk to you like this.
i mean, to be truly happy, a man must live absolutely in the present.
no thought of what's gone before and no thought of what lies ahead.
but a life of meaning, a man is condemned to wallow in the past and obsess about the future.
my guess is that you have done quite a bit of obsessing about yours these last few days.
but i bet the football team gets their new jerseys and their new equipment.
have you seen the football stadium on a friday night, mr tate?
i don't see why we can't have a few new computers... so the children will learn a little set up.
miss drake, the drama club had their heart set on guys and dolls this year.
[ male teacher ] hey, speaking of which, has anybody seen principal drake?
[ tate ] oh, maybe she had a sunstroke and died.
i think maybe it's time i try something i'm not so good at, something different.
and what am i supposed to do while you're on a yellow-brick quest for a brain?
[ stan ] i've just been thinking ahead, coach, and, uh...
i've decided to quit the team... and concentrate on my academics.
well, um, i've had complaints from several students... that you've sold them mind-altering substances.
you want to tell me about it or take it up with principal drake?
[ olson ] luckily, she carries her medicine in her bag, so we were able to help her.
we think it was brought on by this terrible cold she's had.

in january last year, deep inside the limestone rocks of the yorkshire dales, cave divers, andrew goddard and phil murphy, were exploring the narrow and boulder-choked passages of a little-known underground river.
when they surfaced in an uncharted chamber, they thought they were the first to set foot in these caves.
it's an amazing find, and means that the cave's probably a burial site belonging to our bronze age ancestors.
so, this morning, i'm on my way to meet the team who are going to explore the site.
i shall be joining in excavations of burials across the british isles, and finding out more about our ancestors.
i'll be talking to specialists, trying to discover who these people were, and when and how they died.
back in the yorkshire dales, the team was heading into the hills.
their first task is to find an alternative way into the cave that doesn't involve dangerous water-filled tunnels.
our prehistoric ancestors couldn't have potholed into the cave, so there must have been another entrance.
could one of these depressions on the hillside be the way in?
this is why we're using the radio location device, to try and find exactly where we are.
andy and phil have volunteered to dive back into the cave with a small radio transmitter.
we hope this will guide us to a suitable spot on the hillside where we can find a way into the cave.
on the surface, bob's location device can pinpoint the exact location of the divers, even if they're deep underground.
the divers have to work their way through 120 metres of narrow, water-filled passages before they re-emerge into air.
from here, they climb up a steep, rocky slope up into the burial cave.
andy and phil had found a shaft that led almost up to the surface.
so all we have to do now is clear the rocks blocking the entrance.
for that job, andrew and his team needed some heavy equipment.
there are lots of caves in the area, some of which contained human burials, but many were excavated over a century ago and very little survives today.
i went off to find where bronze age people in this area lived.
i found some clues in the next valley, where tumbled stone walls marked the remains of a prehistoric settlement.
this may not look much, but it's the remains of a prehistoric hut.
i'm sitting on what remains of the back wall, level floor in front of me, and there is the entrance, pointing out to the valley bottom.
and in this wonderfully sheltered spot, they would have been able to have grown their crops of wheat and barley.
back at the site, they'd got a grip on the last rock blocking the entrance.
as an archaeologist, i've spent a fair bit of my working life digging in holes in the ground.
but this will be the first time i've gone underground in search of ancient remains.
i felt an enormous sense of anticipation and excitement as i climbed down the flimsy wire ladder.
andrew had gone ahead, and helped me to land on a platform the team had built at the top of the steep rocky slope.
it's not fused, the person died before the age at which that fuses, which is in the late teenage years.
so we can be sure this is a separate individual from this one here.
denning activity is when they go into a cave, a hole underground where they can have their cubs without being disturbed.
there's adult wolves down there and there's juvenile wolves down there.
the adults are bringing in animals for the juveniles and themselves to eat.
you can see, along the passages, as the small cubs have taken bones and they've dragged them along the passages.
in fact, they're only ancient human footprints ever found in a cave in the british isles.
i still find it difficult to grasp that somebody could have come in here, thousands of years ago, and left a footprint in the mud that we can still see all this time afterwards!
we've got three really clear ones and we've got some others that are obscured by the flow-stem covering.
what we're trying to do is get a photograph of the whole track so that we can recreate how whoever it was walked.
as far as possible, andrew wants to leave the cave as it was found.
the only bones he feels should be removed are those that have fallen down the steep boulder slope.
from that boulder slope, he'd recovered part of an incredibly delicate skull.
it's not a very prominent brow ridge, but we need to know how old it is.
after a day that was spent mainly underground down the cave, it's a real relief to be out in the sunshine and also to have retrieved this very fragile fragment of one of the people buried in the cave.
i can't believe phil was able to relocate it down that boulder slope and bring it out.
how much can we find out about a person from a few skull fragments?
i went to see richard neeve at manchester university - one of britain's top specialists in facial reconstruction.
the loss of the lower jaw is one of the more important things when it comes to recreating a face which can be recognised.
that is an important feature and without that, you don't get the overall vertical proportions of the face as such.
the first stage is to rebuild the skull using casts of the original fragments, a copy of a suitable jaw and clay.
a plaster cast is then made of the whole thing and this forms the foundation for the reconstruction.
but before richard can get on with the next stage, he needs to know how old the woman was when she died.
i hate going to the dentist, but at least it's the lady from the cave who's got the appointment, not me!
let's look at the maxilla - the upper jaw of this incredibly delicate piece of bone.
and we're going to take this tooth out to see if we can do an ageing on it.
it's in amazingly good condition considering the age of a tooth like that.
before the tooth can be cut, it's set into a block of resin.
then it's mounted on what looks like a tiny bacon slicer.
what we're expecting to see under the microscope is something like this tooth that we've dealt with before.
what we're going to be looking for is this change here.
and from the age of about the mid-20s onwards, this transparent change starts here and spreads along the root of the tooth.
it produces this glass-like transparent appearance compared with the living healthy tooth.
we have this scale to actually measure how far that change has gone.
if that were a forensic tooth, i'd be very happy about that age, give or take six years either way.
now we know her age, richard can calculate the correct depths for facial muscles and soft tissue.
now, on this one, it doesn't matter because the skin surface, the skin texture is less than perfect.
it's lost that peachy bloom which you associate with young skin.
we think that children this age are likely to have been herding sheep up on the hills.
maybe they wandered into the cave because it was raining or just wanted to look around.
it's a direct record of their behaviour, rather than just an artefact.
in his studio, richard was putting the final touches to the woman from the wolf den.
i'm amazed you managed to do so much with those tiny little fragments of bone.
when i saw them come out the cave, i wondered if we'd see a face.
when she died, she was taken on a final journey, from the place where she lived, across hills and rivers, to a very special place, perhaps one she knew during her life.
bearing offerings for the next life, her grieving relatives laid her to rest deep in the cave.
i don't think an operative should be cancelled for one mistake.
if you've read her jacket, you know it's not the first time.
i guess that all depends on what you value more... the journey or the destination.
sometimes i don't know if you're incredibly wise or just full of crap.
he has a number of contacts which will prove useful to us... especially in eastern europe.

about ten years ago a pop idol killed herself, and people saw her ghost on tv.
yeah, but everyone you ask about this one talks about the izu peninsula.
in the last 12 years everyone who was there has died.
not one of the reporters at that demonstration is alive today.
if it were all a dream when i awoke if only you were there.
but the light of morning shows me as i really am.
a grade-school boy was on holiday down in izu with his family.
he wanted to go out and play but there was a tv show he didn't want to miss.
no station there uses that channel, so it should have been blank.
but when he played it back at home, there was a woman on the screen.
the girl was named tsuji yoko. 17, in her third year at seikei academy.
the boy was nomi tadahiko, 19, doing a college prep year.
they say there's one way you can see it and not die.
you have to copy it and show it to someone else within one week.
a grade-school boy took a trip to izu with his family, and they stayed in a cabin.
he wanted to go out and play... but there was a tv show he didn't want to miss.

but when he played it back at home, a woman appeared on the screen and said:

they say she appears when you watch late-night shows on tv.
about ten years ago... a star killed herself, and people saw her ghost on tv.
yeah, but this time everyone mentions the izu peninsula for some reason.

"with a rapidity and vehemence which seemed to have in it... a touch of insanity, the sudden sense of the danger to which the child must necessarily be exposed in the charge of such a keeper increased the lady's desire to keep him in the castle, if possible.
'you may mistake me, tate', she said, addressing the older man".
i can't tell you how much i miss the theatre, the opera, the ballet.
i'm afraid in my last situation i was not lucky enough to...
i know this will not reach you for a month... and the money comes under separate cover.
comfort mother... but heed aunt sofka... and do not let benjamin forget me.
and i've seen him with a great many dead things from the beach.
and once i did wonder if he'd found a mermaid and was trying to give it life... like i saw at a fair in dundee.
but let me tell you, if anything of that sort ever happens again, or if you continue to kick that infernal chair, not only will your father hear about it but i shall come into your bedroom in the dead of night
and cut off all your hair, and put a live rat up your nightgown!
but until now, the image couldn't be captured... on the paper, but if you sensitise the paper... make photogenic paper... thus...
i can create a stable image by exposing it to sunlight, but as you can see, my studies, like butterflies, are doomed to die within the day; they cannot, as yet, be fixed upon the paper.
last night i dreamt about christmas, and that i had a large chocolate pie.
and little baby jesus made me eat it all by myself, or my legs would be cut off.
"...and the very birds of the air... came and bewailed snowdrop's death.
first an owl, and then a raven... and last of all a little dove.
snowdrop lay a long time in the coffin... and she always looked the same.
and she remained as white as snow... as red as blood... and her hair as black as ebony".
time passes faster now, and my employer is really quite human.
gentiles are not monsters, i find, although they are still deeply mysterious."
my images are much admired... and i am even to give a lecture at the royal society.
they say i have captured the beauty of my father's people, and i am glad.
i don't suppose you could tell us which one caused the crash.
if i could, i wouldn't be cutting bodies for a living.
if their captive wouldn't talk, they would strap him into this vest with his thumbs holding down the detonation buttons.
he'd eventually grow too weary to keep his fingers on the buttons...
i thought i'd check up on our award-winning chief medical examiner.
everyone, i would like you to meet jesse randolph, assistant to the director of the state of maryland,
you've done wonders in making this one of the top-notch forensic facilities, but there's a lot at stake with the dietz case.
all we're asking for is a minute change that, based on your expertise, no one will question.
yeah, akton was rejected by the fbi in 1973 and again in 1974 and 1975.
he was also turned down by various police departments in kentucky, tennessee and maryland.
traffic's conducting their own investigation, analysing skid marks, damage to the vehicles.
even if it's called a murder, it's still only gonna matter on paper.
you're not a person who follows orders and says, "what choice did i have?"
if i want to keep my job, maybe that's who i'm gonna have to be.
these kids, 14, 15, gettin' shot at, shooting at each other, the mothers show up sometimes to bail them out, but the father, he's never in sight.
i mean, i was 12, 13 on the street, causing my share of trouble.
it's evident that both parties have a great deal to offer their son.
however, given the boy's age, taking into account the lifestyle and personalities of both parents,
a pile of money like that would just be a nuisance to a drifter like me.
now i can eat all the salmon sandwiches i want here!
wandering through the wreckage of what used to be a city at the age of 3.
i'll let you have a taste of the pain and sadness i felt then.
that ruined city and piles of debris were the first things i ever saw.
i have no memory of anything before that except for memories of my childhood.
i sent you a glass of chardonnay, and you sent it back.
still, you know, i was wondering, maybe you'd like to go out sometime?
and what are you doing today, on a saturday no less?
the auction starts on monday, and the shipment arrived three days late.
no, i believe you think you saw marks on your back.
but i'm watching you down your third cup of coffee, and we're talking about a nightmare you had while asleep in the tub.
but last night, he's on his way back from his acting class when, bam!
flat tire on his motorcycle, right across the street from quake.

i hear you're home for a week and nobody hears from you.
yeah, look, i was gonna call you guys but i figured i'd run into you sooner or later.
i hear you're home, i figured i'd come by, say hello.
you gonna invite me in, or are we gonna freeze our asses off?
yeah, and also, you know, i mean, i just wanted to see if, you know if you're happy with all this.
still living here, working in this place, you know, your whole routine.
we're talking about a guy who abandoned his wife in the middle of the night, no explanation.
if he didn't love her anymore, he should have asked for a divorce.
i hate the son of a bitch for what he's done to her.
but he's my father and i grew up in that house, so i can sort of understand his side.
maybe if i lived at home, they'd make my bed too.
look, michael, i don't know if claudia mentioned it at all but i stopped in at the diner the other day for lunch and i happened to notice she didn't have a ring on her finger, man.
i mean, i don't know, you know maybe, you know, he may have mentioned it but--
then why don't you just come back tomorrow like you said you were gonna?
i got nothing better to do than come over when michael's not around and see if i can sweet-talk you for a couple hours?
i mean, come on, claudia, you know i'm not that kind of guy.
i give my mother a week before she's got her house up for sale.
all right, but tell me, why'd he have to come into my house?
i tried the other night at the bar, but he didn't get the hint.
i think he got back with his ex-girlfriend and i wouldn't feel right about that.
couldn't we go into the city and go to a nice restaurant?
i just told you i can barely afford to pay our bills and you want to go to the city to a restaurant?
oh, yeah, and he wanted to tell ma that she can have the fucking house.
he's living down in vegas now and he says he's not gonna call us anymore and doesn't wanna hear from us neither.
when she was on the phone with him, she just sat there just listening to him, not saying nothing.
and then she hung up the phone, real calm, you know told me what he said and then she just went to bed.
jimbo's leaving at the end of the month, leaving me high and dry.
i'm gonna need somebody full-time at this point so if you give me 30 hours a week built, you're the man for the job.
all right, so you gotta explain to me your deal with florida, all right.
i got a guy that i know from california who's got a place down in gainesville.
you don't know where you were or you don't know who you were with?
or you don't know if you give a damn about us anymore?
i'm not gonna let you make a jerkoff out of me.
there's plenty of other women out there who'd show me a little bit of respect.
i hear you're home for a week and nobody hears from you.
yeah, look, i was gonna call you guys but i figured i'd run into you sooner or later.
i hear you're home, i figured i'd come by, say hello.
you gonna invite me in, or are we gonna freeze our asses off?
yeah, and also, you know, i mean, i just wanted to see if, you know if you're happy with all this.
still living here, working in this place, you know, your whole routine.
we're talking about a guy who abandoned his wife in the middle of the night, no explanation.
if he didn't love her anymore, he should have asked for a divorce.
i hate the son of a bitch for what he's done to her.
but he's my father and i grew up in that house, so i can sort of understand his side.
maybe if i lived at home, they'd make my bed too.
look, michael, i don't know if claudia mentioned it at all but i stopped in at the diner the other day for lunch and i happened to notice she didn't have a ring on her finger, man.
i mean, i don't know, you know maybe, you know, he may have mentioned it but--
then why don't you just come back tomorrow like you said you were gonna?
i got nothing better to do than come over when michael's not around and see if i can sweet-talk you for a couple hours?
i mean, come on, claudia, you know i'm not that kind of guy.
i give my mother a week before she's got her house up for sale.
all right, but tell me, why'd he have to come into my house?
i tried the other night at the bar, but he didn't get the hint.
i think he got back with his ex-girlfriend and i wouldn't feel right about that.
couldn't we go into the city and go to a nice restaurant?
i just told you i can barely afford to pay our bills and you want to go to the city to a restaurant?
oh, yeah, and he wanted to tell ma that she can have the fucking house.
he's living down in vegas now and he says he's not gonna call us anymore and doesn't wanna hear from us neither.
when she was on the phone with him, she just sat there just listening to him, not saying nothing.

well, first... we have to find a way to reactivate the portal.
it's been abandoned a long time and it was destabilized when molly fell through.
according to the archaeologists i talked to the portal was built by a civilization that vanished 2000 years ago.
which means... if molly survived the fall she would have found herself all alone.
maybe if you tried again you could pull her out when she was still a little girl.
if you do that, there'll be no one to grow up and become this molly.
well, i offered to watch him so that the o'briens could spend some time with molly.
i thought you said you were going to be working tonight.
well, just be careful not to push her too hard, miles.
if she gets frustrated, she might withdraw and relapse into her old behavior patterns.
it's a klingon exercise designed to teach children hand-eye coordination so they will grow up to become warriors.
oh, i get it- the rattle is like the baby's first bat'leth kind of thing?
one minute, she's on a space station the next minute, she's running around outside.
well, there's no reason we can't take her here for an hour or two every day.
i tried to tell him that but he wasn't interested in hearing "excuses. "
as far as he's concerned she's dangerous and should be incarcerated.
it won't do any good to keep sedating her like this.
the bottom line is she needs open spaces and plenty of it.
is she going to get that at a special care center?
i'll talk to the captain about putting her back in a holosuite for the time being.
i was pretending to be a grint hound and chased him.
he was laughing so hard he did not look to see where he was going and... fell against the edge of the table.
i dropped him off at the o'briens' a few minutes ago.
you should have seen his face when he saw his sister again.
all right, maybe i had my doubts but i've never been happier to be proven wrong.
oh, we'd better get going if we're going to make that holosuite reservation.
according to dax the recalibration didn't hold so the portal sent her back to the same point in time it sent little molly.
i wonder if she realized that the little girl she was looking at was herself.
i think i might want to have one of my own someday.
according to the archaeologists i talked to the portal was built by a civilization that vanished 2,000 years ago.
i think i've found a way to modulate the field generators.
if it works, molly will be home in a few hours.
if you tried again you could pull her out when she was still a little girl.
do that and there'll be no one to grow up and become this molly.
i'm going to keep her sedated until we get back to ds9.
i've asked captain sisko to create a safe environment for her.
i'll pay for their time if they can wait another half hour.
they seem to have their heart set on some afternoon carnage...now.
we were playing. i was pretending to be a grint hound and chased him.
he was laughing and did not look to see where he was going.
according to dax, the recalibration didn't hold, so the portal sent her back to the same point in time that sent molly.
i wonder if she realised that the little girl was herself?
i think i might want to have one of my own someday.
according to the archaeologists i talked to the portal was built by a civilization that vanished 2000 years ago.
it's a miracle you managed to get her back at all, miles.
maybe if you tried again you could pull her out when she was still a little girl.
well, i'm going to keep her under sedation until we get back to deep space 9.
i've asked captain sisko to create a safe environment for her.
i thought you said you were going to be working tonight.
i was going to run a spectral scan of the comet that's passing through the denorios belt but if i did that, who'd watch you?
at this rate she'll be reading and writing in a few weeks.
well, just be careful not to push her too hard, miles.
the bottom line is she needs open spaces and plenty of it.
is she going to get that at a special care center?
i'll talk to the captain about putting her back in a holosuite for the time being.
well, what happens when they put her on a transport, huh?
yeah, little cat and i thought it would be better this way.
as you can see, me and the cute little guy have really grown attached to each other.

...i got my show clothes, make sure that brian sends out my trunk, and, uh, the avocados.
oh, for god's sakes, hank, you're not goin' off to college, you know.
we're back with, uh, steven wright, of course, steven, who is... oddly enough...
i just realized when i said steven wright, you were actually to my right.
a lot of people don't know hank used to work at the house of pies before he worked here.
and... voilá, that is how you make grandma kingsley's famous apple pie.
i wish we could have talked more about your personal life.
yeah, but you mention one hooker, you gotta mention 'em all.
so tell me about how your character's coming along on e.r.
um, he... basically messed up and got his girlfriend pregnant, and they had a baby.
* i've got this something to tell you * * there ain't no doubt in my mind *
* all i'm asking is to keep you near forever * * just till the end of time *
yes, it's your haircut, but you know, it goes with the, uh... you know what?
i'm a little uncomfortable, and i think it's time for me to go, ok?
and then if sandy throws a wobbly, you can go up to her room and get her out.
oh no, if i try that, she'll say she's not dressed.
the farthest your impulses have got you before is asking me to move in with you.
i want you to know that that offer still stands should you say no to marriage.
i mean, i can see the attraction for judy, but i can see the danger too.
what chance does a marriage stand with the wife's mother living next door?
i'll tell harry it was my idea and let them sort it out.
and then if sandy throws a wobbly, you can go up to her room and get her out.
i do wish people would let us sort things out for ourselves.
we've not been doing a good job of it, have we?
the farthest your impulses have got you before is asking me to move in with you.
i want you to know that that offer still stands should you say no to marriage.
i mean, i can see the attraction for judy, but i can see the danger too.
what chance does a marriage stand with the wife's mother living next door?
as a result, we both deny ourselves sex with other partners.
i mean, i'm not that fussed, but i just don't think it's fair on jonathan, to feel he has to save himself for me.
thank you for your honesty and for coming all this way.
i don't forget faces or a guy who spills hot coffee over his foot.
every time he tries to take a picture, people keep walking through, wasting his film.
i'll go to hell if your guy wasn't on one of them.
only while he's back here, something goes wrong... and the murder never takes place.
so, what, he gives up and drives 35 miles to bishop's stortford for a cheeseburger?
i know this seems like totally the wrong moment, antonia, but... we've picked our way through it all now, and it's not what you'll want to hear.
a man who can't bear the thought of time slipping away, desperate to claw back the past, but cling to the present.
if we weren't looking at a man with two identities, how about two men with one identity.
two men who for the past three years were both norman stangerson.
the way mine was structured, there was enough money and more than enough pressure to split down the middle, so... we arrived at a dream solution.
i'd work the uk end and, er... he'd be me in new york.
while porthropp was in the states, you were free to pursue... other interests.
you want to tell your wife about gillian, mr stangerson, or shall we just ring her up and let her hear it for herself?
usually, i'd phone antonia in the evenings, but if she called mel, he'd ask to call her back, then tip me off at gill's.
personality traits like, er... my problem with clocks, he began to weave into his performance.
now it's like i've sent him over there... to his death.
next to which, dropping your wallet in that hamburger joint, paying lewis french to keep his mouth shut, is incidental.
i said that rebecca's a lovely girl, but one misguided act of passion on a kitchen table didn't mean we were romantically suited.
it ended very amicably when her father threw me out in a waitress trolley.
actually, i was just asking if you saw "kojak" last night.
it was a really old one about some bloke in utah with three wives.
i left them on this table for 10 seconds, and now they're gone.
i'd say they didn't walk off by themselves, but in this house it could happen.
i know this is non-science club business, but uh, i was just wondering.
uh, my parents are going away for the weekend, and, you know, we have that big-screen tv, and the indoor pool--
if i don't go, i'll be president of the geeks anonymous, only i won't be anonymous.
then i hope god grants you the serenity to know that my answer is something you can't change.
i'm gonna find out not just how but why you dissolved.
no rush, but i would like to be let out of the anti-aging experiment.

then i hope god grants you the serenity to know that my answer is something you can't change.
i can't believe you tricked me into letting you go to that party.
well, now that aunt hilda's gone, why don't we just blame it all on her and call it a night?
now, you have to choose which aunt you wish to live with.
this choice will affect the rest of your life, so choose wisely.
i'm gonna find out not just how but why you dissolved.
no rush, but i would like to be let out of the anti-aging experiment.
when i made it into university my home-room teacher said it was a miracle.
but if it was a miracle i want to call it a miracle of love.
when i made it into university my home-room teacher said it was a miracle.
but if it was a miracle i want to call it a miracle of love.
and having sex with you, but you develop a texas-sized complex
because you don't trust me to stay here when you're not here?
to make us believe we're going to be rewarded for the shitty
lives we lead instead of simply facing the fact that if we
did i ever tell you about the one about the dead bunny?
yeah, well, this kid's pet bunny dies, so he gives it to his dad
i've been made fun of by a lot worse punks than you.
all i know is you're one mean son of a bitch.
so what do you say we stop remembering how we got here
and start focusing on a way to get out of this mess.
they spend 12 hours a day in the gym for a couple of months,
and then they tear their shirts off within the first act,
so if you don't know him, how are we going to find this guy?
i mean, it's not like you can go to your local vampire hangout
i will lead you out of the desert, and you can live,
and all you have to do is kill the stranger next to you.
you really picked the wrong girl to change your policy on.
you know, i could have handled it if you would have just told
you sneaking out of my house like a goddamn cat burglar
before the sun was even up, i thought about finding you,
you straight men think that if you come within 100 yards
of a gay man, the next morning, you'll simply wake up
this lady says that you"ve been attacked by a man called georgian.
they threatened to set the bus on fire and they wanted a ransom.
for 70 years you got kicked in the ass and you still take it!
your whole nation likes to be getting it in the ass!
we were suspecting siemieniuk all along of selling such things but we never caught him red handed.
the mayor and the town council prohibit the sales of such things.
but if you shout and chase it with a fork, what happens then?
i can tell a stressed out pig even in a sausage.
people don"t give much during the sunday mass, but they are poor.
the five hundred i got for the iast year"s honey was spent on trees and tomato plants.
if a stranger is doing harm to another stranger in our town, is this our worry or not?
so far we didn"t interfere, and they didn"t want us to.
i beg you, virgin mary, to help me overcome my natural kindness.
god, if i am not strict with them they will go astray completely!
you got no insurance, no savings and another kid on the way.

take them behind the scenes for a revealing and intimate look... at the story within the story.
because what they don't know is how we really were there... even though they didn't know we were there, you know?
no fractures, no lacerations... no concussions, contusions, or injuries of any sort.

if my father's alive... and if he's in this horrible place, why would he bring me here?
shang tsung can be very... creative when it comes to getting people to do things.
you see, a man once told me he was brought here after a slave raid.
he was so broken up at the thought of never seeing his beloved daughter again.
in case you haven't noticed, i am his personal slave down here.
you can't even begin to imagine what life's like down in this pit.
the guy she buys vegetables from saw her late last night.
she was following a strange man into the same north alley... where shang tsung said the portal's going to be.
we have a new student, lisa, and i want you to show her the works- the lunchroom, the tree.
but when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock-and-bull story.
i see the trophies are still out for cleaning, eh, lisa?
okay, boy, this is where all the hard work... sacrifice and painful scaldings pay off.
boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.
um, i don't know how much more school i can miss.
just, you know, add some accessories, lip gloss, maybe drop five pounds.
aren't we a little young for makeup and- what do you mean, five pounds?
boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.
um, i don't know how much more school i can miss.

hell, if it was up to me, i'd let you go.
but the lads have a temper, and they've been drinkin' all day!
but without the grease... all you can taste is the hog anus.
i'm so sorry, but i sold it all to the rendering plant.
uh, dad, i don't think the dog can handle any more bacon.
- [ whimpering ] - [ homer ] looks like he's about ready for another squeezing;
we have a new student, lisa, and i want you to show her the works- the lunchroom, the tree.
but when you get to the trophy case, give her some cock-and-bull story.
i can't believe those goons muscled me out of my grease business.
i've been muscled out of everything i've ever done... including my muscle-for-hire business.
boy, if we're ever gonna earn paper money, we have to expand our operation.

but the lads have a temper, and they've been drinkin' all day!
after what i just did for you, you don't trust me?
i've been knocked out twice tonight but i still have my long-term memory.
it is a way of life, an evil and malignant way of life.
it reveals a condition akin to a disease, that spreads like an epidemic, and like an epidemic, a quarantine is necessary to keep it from infecting this nation.
the cold war made america renew its values, invent new images for american virtue.
men and women in all walks of life, we are shareholders in the greatest enterprise on earth:
that small clique has been referred to, has been discussed as more or less following the tactics that we associate with the communist party.
if i had my way about it they'd all be sent back to russia or some other unpleasant place.
ten witnesses, the hollywood ten, defied the committee's right to ask about their beliefs.
are you a member of the communist party or have you ever been a member of the communist party?
i have told you that i will offer my beliefs, my affiliations and everything else to the
american public and they will know where i stand as they do from what i have written
are you or have you ever been a member of the communist party?
i believe i have the right to be confronted with any evidence that supports this question.
people generally in hollywood were pretty scared to have anything to do with us.
whereas before we went to prison they had not been nearly as scared and there were plenty of undercover arrangements that were made to write scripts under pseudonyms for a good deal less money than you were accustomed to being paid.
a soviet spy ring unearthed in 1946 led investigators to alger hiss, who had been a wartime foreign policy adviser.
he was accused of passing secrets to the soviet union by a former communist, whittaker chambers.
microfilm reportedly found in a pumpkin on a maryland farm is examined by investigator stripling and congressman nixon.
richard nixon, an ambitious young republican, was convinced that hiss was lying.
everyone from vets to youngsters reveals his inborn dislike of communism.
anti-communism became the language for a new, more defiant vision of america.
what the state police did is make the cars go out and go ten miles an hour through that gauntlet.
so the road, i mean, cars were smashed, the windows were smashed.
armed and equipped by russia, red hordes brought ancient cathay to its knees.
at the end of '49 all china sags under the red yoke.
americans have always had, most americans, a special feeling, a special attachment, special interest in china.
so it seemed incredible to most americans, uninformed americans, that this country which we had lavished so much care and affection on and we thought was so friendly, so many of their people had studied in america and so on,
i had trouble renting a home, renting an apartment in new york and the companies, well what'll their stockholders say, you know.
so the companies that i had known and had dealings with abroad, export companies and so on, they said, sorry we think you're a fine guy but we don't dare touch you.
one communist among the american advisors at yalta was one communist too many.
and even... even if there were only one communist in the state department, even if there were only one communist in the state department that would still be one communist too many.
we are not going to turn the united states into a right wing, totalitarian country in order to deal with a left wing totalitarian threat.
but leaders of the american communist party were jailed and the persecution spread.
left wing labor organizations were banned, radical groups indicted, demonstrations broken up.
and if they put the word commie oh someone that meant that that person was an agent to the soviets.
they used the national interest to justify any method of locating subversives.
we were using the same methods that hoover accused the communist party of using and that's getting people to spy on their friends and this was one of the criticisms that he had of the communist party.
i'd never even gotten a traffic ticket and here i was called before in public a state senate investigating committee about my beliefs.
i felt very very wronged and i felt that i had to not only uphold myself, my reputation, but that of my fellow teachers, my fellow union members, my fellow citizens.
it belongs to men who know that freedom's fight must be forever, relentless, uncompromising and fair.
it belongs to men who today are ready to bear spiritual and intellectual arms against an alien army of communist ideas.
i spent about half ah hour with the general last night.
while i can't report that we agreed entirely on everything, [ laughs 1
i can, i can report that when i left that meeting with the
general i had the same feeling as when i went in and that is, that he's a great american, will make a great president, an outstanding president.
he was roundly criticized for that because it seemed to indicate that he was influenced by mccarthy.
in 1953 two americans julius and ethel rosenberg, were convicted of spying for the soviet union.
and he stands up, turns his back to us and walks away and we were devastated.
we began to sense something which in later years we understood so clearly.
and that was that jerome frank, as the leading liberal judge, was terrorized himself and frightened by the atmosphere of fear in the country.
that if he as a liberal would do something to save
he died quickly, there didn't seem to be too much life left in him when he entered behind the rabbi.
he seemed to be walking in a cadence of steps as if keeping in time with the muttering of the 23rd psalm.
steto...stetho can't say it... placed the stethoscopes to her and then looked around and looked at each other rather dumb founded and seemed surprised that she was not dead.
and she was given more electricity which started again and a kind of a ghastly plume of smoke rose from her head and went up against the skylight overhead.
it all sort of came to pieces and then there was this move to censure him and he fought that very badly.
now a number of us were advising him on how to handle that and he agreed to everything we said and then he did just the opposite.
obsessively stalin spoke of the danger to world peace, the need for vigilance against internal enemies.
conformity was enforced by police terror, and by a slavish cult of stalin's personality.
the gulag - the secret empire of concentration camps - stretched over four thousand miles from the baltic to the pacific.
in the cold war years, the camps continued to devour the lives of millions.
last year the contributions of sixteen million americans to the crusade for freedom made possible the world freedom bell- symbol of hope and freedom to the communist dominated peoples of eastern europe.
in western berlin great crowds turned out to see it raised to the tower of the west berlin city hall.
this was the effort of the cia and the young refugees were recruited.
they were trained in haste in all kinds of subversion, sabotage, intelligence, they were given cameras, the short radio stations codes and were simply sent there.
in yugoslavia, marshall tito had defied stalin and broken away from the soviet bloc.
moscow abused him as a traitor, a deserter to the camp of american imperialism.
at the beginning i avoided this but then i had to repeat their obscenities.
then i started to make up fairy tales for my son.
the president of the court and so on, were listed and your answers were listed.
slansky and ten others were hanged in december 1952, their ashes scattered over the ice on an unknown country road.
in the soviet union itself, culture and science were kept insulated from the infection of all western influence.
the arts - painting, literature, music - were regimented by the doctrine of socialist realism.
stalin's interference with the work of the bolshoi theater was done with love and good taste.
but the fear that it created and the fact that people were under his spell,
official art showed the soviet union as a promised land of plenty and of opportunity, guided by wise and selfless leaders.
but those who discussed real change, even in private, like susanna pechuro and her student friends, risked punishment.
they pulled children out of the arms of their screaming mothers, and then beat the mothers.
the children just disappeared, they never knew what happened to them afterwards.
there was nothing more awful than that, even though i saw them killing people, and anything else they felt like doing.
in 1952, stalin presided over the 19th congress of the soviet communist party.
the hall was packed with foreign delegations gathered to honor him.
stalin was old now, but still the unchallenged leader of world communism.
cold war - military competition with america - was already putting a heavy load on soviet society.
in public, stalin's analysis of the world class struggle was hopeful.
above all, he suspected so-called cosmopolitans, mostly jewish intellectuals and professionals, who had already been persecuted for their western contacts.
stalin needed an internal enemy, a fifth column that could be blamed for the difficult situation in the country.
so to present jews as the fifth column, agents of american imperialism, was very convenient.
in january 1953, nine kremlin doctors were accused of plotting with western intelligence to kill soviet leaders.
that i was familiar with certain facts which showed that my father and other doctors were wrongly treating certain patients.
they wanted me to make this kind of statement but they didn't get it from me, even though twice i was sent to the punishment cell.
stalin had towered over the soviet union, in peace and war, for more than twenty years.
even those who hated him could not imagine a future without him.
[man's voice] i'd like you to solve a problem for me.
if he starts singin' "the rain in spain," i'm gonna pass out.
then if he's getting his memory back, he must know something about them.
if that's true, then somewhere in that demented mind he might know who killed my mother.
they stole me from my parents, and now they're trying to steal another child, aren't they?
i'm not sure, but recent events make me feel you may be right, yes.
it's just that we've had a scad of burglaries around here lately.
what with the hour and all, i just didn't think anybody was gonna be checking in.
these blocks-they were used by the child that the centre wants.
if you could just feel something that would tell us who it is.
now, davy's only hope for recovery is this injection of serotonin.
and if i don't give it to him now, his condition becomes irreversible.
no one's doing anything until i figure out what the hell's goin' on.
if you wanna shoot me, then go ahead and do it.
business stand point, having a doctor named spock on staff could be worth million bucks.
i am glad to be a part of the nugenesis family.
nugenesis prides himself being on the cutting edge of reproductive technology.
and i am proud to say that jarod here, is on the cutting edge of all.
then if he is getting his memory back, then he must know something about them.
if that's truth is somewhere in that demented mind, he might know who killed my mother.
it's just a awake head scared of burglary around here lately.
well, with the hour i know, i just didn't think anybody's gonna be checking in.
and i will be your substitute teach for miss markam today.
well, the first of all business, is we'll divide up to small groups and we will...
last time i saw that little bambi's mother was in my cross hairs.
well, i've been hitting dead ends on this birthing things, so this morning i helped myself to raines's moving boxes where i found some personal surveillance files.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
it's just something i remember from when i was a child.
five years ago, you-- you came to me to learn the healing arts, but...
through me, all who march on jerusalem... shall be blessed by the holy spirit.
they will attain glory in this life... and paradise in the next.
"services rendered in the apprehension of"... et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
next thing i know, you'll be helping old ladies cross the street.
i didn't know i was gonna fall in love with you.
nick, the part of my life that's about being immortal has nothing to do with you.
i'm either in your life-- all of it-- or i'm gone.
how about we take care of one thing at a time?
hey, honey, how about we do it right in the middle ofyour golf course next sunday?
oh, gee, honey, i was kind ofhopin' to play next sunday.
we went into that building across the street to get our marriage license.
then we came back over here and we shared a hot pretzel.
besides the behaviour problem, he won't do homework and his test scores are...

it's a slap in the face to everyone who studied hard and worked long hours to earn our d's.

something out there is making filets of the populace and i think you might be next.
but in the back of your mind, you start to wonder.

on that note, i think i'm gonna go have a little talk with our coach.

what i'm thinking about is i should probably get out of this car.
according to statistics, dodd and cameron were the best swimmers on the team.
first and second, so if my theory's correct,... ..gage petronzi, the third-best swimmer, would be the next item on the menu.
i don't know two finer boys than cameron and... that other one.
but i know they'd want their friends to go on and win that state championship.

giving birth to three babies is not that different than giving birth to one.

the best thing for me to do is drop out of college and get a job.
it's not over because she's gonna call you and tell you she loves you.
the reason why she couldn't is because her feelings were so strong that it scared her.
i'm gonna open up my own massage place and frank's gonna help me.
and we can work it around his schedule, so he doesn't have to quit school.
i can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back and you know what i've got?
a place that no one will ever get out of alive?
is that why you hung out with that ukrainian kid in school?
yeah, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything.
y'know, i have to find a job where i carrying a smaller table.
or a job where you don't have to carry a table.
meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.
is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that ukrainian kid?
you're probably just gonna catch her just as she's about to go to the gate.
you're gonna call out her name and say, "i love you!" and she's gonna say, "i love you, too!" and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.
and it's gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!
actually, giving birth to three babies isn't that different from giving birth to one.
we're gonna have a big family, i've always wanted a big family!
oh god, i'm so glad you guys are happy, i was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.
i need to make a lot of money really fast, and i had an idea that i want to talk to you about, 'cause you work for a big company.
okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.
and the reason why she couldn't, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her.
now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane!
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america?
she doesn't know which one of us she wants, me or this colin guy.
that's sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?
well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised¡¦
okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn't show up by then, then just come on home.
hey, tell him about relaxi-taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks that's better than relaxi cab.
i uh, i've been to his apartment and he wasn't there, and uh.
i need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?
i came here to tell you that, and to tell you-yes, joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it!
uh, i came here to tell you that i love you.
i suppose i've either just told you i love you or given my neighbours a good laugh.
mrs. newman if you're listening, bugger off this in none of your business.
meet a foreigner, fall madly in love and spend your lives together.
is that why you hung out with that ukrainian kid in school?
so in a few months, i'll have three babies walking around inside me?
it'll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out.
meet a foreigner, fall madly in love and spend your lives together.
is that why you hung out with that ukrainian kid in school?
so in a few months, i'll have three babies walking around inside me?
it'll be like one of those log rides when they come shooting out.
tensions culminate with the shooting down... of an american high-altitude reconnaissance plane... while a u.n. ambassador, henry cabot lodge... shows a hidden microphone the reds disguised in the great seal at an embassy.
abroad, often in the midst of bloodthirsty marxist regimes... tiny islands of free american territory... in the person of united states embassies... carry on round-the-clock efforts to maintain stable relations... often against hostile and aggressive populations.
one slip in the world of cold war diplomacy... could lead instantly to nuclear disaster.
one such free outpost... deep in communism's fanatic, totalitarian underbelly... is where our story takes place.
here in a quaint but sturdy mansion of traditional structure... a dedicated and disciplined group of foreign-service workers... representing the united states government... navigate with patience and skill the treacherous shoals... of international relations in the atomic age.
it is in this small haven that negotiations take place... asylum is given and gracious dinners with dignitaries from all over the world... are a part of uncle sam's efforts to coexist.
i didn't mean to imply that the work we're doing here is not significant.
we've got a job to do, and we're going to do it.
i intend to run a disciplined ship, but a fair one.
now the word around here is that you don't really approve of me.
i encourage my staff to honestly express themselves... in an environment of open frankness.
so,you know, off the record... what do you think of me?
you know, it's refreshing when someone despises you... to hear it phrased so succinctly.
[ narrator ] and so ambassador magee departed for the united states... to pursue the political plum of a cabinet position... in thej.f.k. administration.
and, indeed, the embassy left in his son's care... did proceed with business as usual.
a daily operation, well oiled over time by ambassador magee... functioned almost on automatic pilot.
- it's a lovely place to be under the right circumstances.
- we'll try to get you out of here as soon as we can.
did you tell him not to bother to come to idyllwild airport... with the station wagon because we may be six years late?
mrs. hollander, i meant to speak to you about the telephone.
i have friends who could help me escape... but i feel it is my duty to return and someday lead my people once again.
but until you lead your people, you stay in your bedroom?
[ grunts ] i could only carry the small items, but...
[ laughs ] it's enough for the first few hours of the show.
sweetheart, could you put your mother on for just one minute?
try and find out, and i'll call you back in an hour.
my father's crushed he has to be in washington while you're here... but i'm chief executive officer in his absence... and i assure you that the entire embassy is at your disposal.
listen, i don't want my government doing business with this guy.
- he's gonna make a name for himself someday... in the area of hair transplants.
it's fine for him, i just-- i don't know if it's for me.
you know, um, a fortune-teller... actually once told me that i'd meet the man... that i was gonna marry under special circumstances.
she just said that, and i said "what's this special circumstance gonna be?"
and... then at trader vic's... when donald pulled the shrimp out of my throat...
i figured this is special, so i thought it might be him.
"last night i happened to doze off in the living room...
"and when i awoke, mr. magee was on the phone... and i overheard him. "
and don't worry about the board of health, 'cause they'll never catch you.
i may as well tell you, mr. hollander, that the veal you had last night... was eel, and you cleaned your plate.
- if i could have my way... you and all those like you... would hang in the public square... as an example to all the enemies of the state.
say, listen, mister, when was the last time... you propositioned a woman and she said yes?
[ susan ] will you forget my father for a minute?
if we never get out ofhere, how are we going to have a future together?
[ axel ] it's not fun, the wife of a career diplomat.
especially one who spends most of his life in the unemployment insurance office.
my contacts are ready to see to it that you'll be on your way home within hours.
mr. hollander, i implore you, for the safety... of everyone involved.
about midnight, when some of the other guests are leaving... we casually say, "excuse me," and we leave with the largest group.
our chauffeur then drives us directly to the lobby of the grand hotel.
uh, someone comes up to me, a man-- presumably not suspicious-- and he whispers in my ear, "the grass is green."
for my money, marion, he may as well have a neon sign that says, "i am a spy."
i got the worst hay fever in america, he gets us on a hay wagon.
he takes us to the seashore, where we're picked up by a submarine.
axel magee quit the foreign service... and went to work for his father-in-law... who was overwhelmed with the young man's natural gifts... for sculpting the bride and groom out of chopped liver.
at last, the fortune-teller's prediction about magee as a new michelangelo... had proved true.
it's good to see both your sons doing so well, mr. yang
well, i may be guardian to both kenichi and tian-wen... but to them i'm just an old man who talks too much
i'll call yuan cheng-gui and tell him to leave you alive
i wouldn't want to lose out on a good deal, would i...
when i came to he was right in front of me
he stuck a gun in my face and said, where's my woman?
i want to bring yuan to your restaurant... and turn fu-chun over to him
i want you to get papa yang to come along as insurance
tell mr. ye i appreciated his concern, but i'll be fine
you called papa yang and said we were there, didn't you
now, if wu fu-chun is dead... then perhaps we might have this lady return the money
if she can't this is a serious loss of f ace for mr ye
he was setting xui-hong up... so he'd control the shanghai group
and he'd been aiming at ye's position for a long time
the worst thing about nightmares... is when you forget them the second your eyes jerk open
i have a lot of nightmares... but i don't remember any
i'll call yuan cheng-gui and tell him to leave you alive
i wouldn't want to lose out on a good deal, would i...
she went back to her place then left right after that
i pr etend to make a mistake and knocked next door
i knew ther e'd be a price on his head her e
i figur ed i'd lur e him up her e... and sell him to you
go straight for 50 meters to a lane... called new center str eet
on your right... is a chinese medicine stor e called seikando
w hen i came to he was right in front of me
he stuck a gun in my face and said, w her e's my woman?
w hen i came around the police wer e ther e
i guess he didn't shoot because we all used to be friends
i tell him some malaysians have got fu-chun... and i'll hand him over
somewher e yuan will feel safe lik e tian-wen's r estaurant... at say, 5 p.m.
i need you ther e as insurance so yuan will come
but r eally, befor e yuan r eaches the r estaurant...
i'm supposed to meet them at the tao yuan r estaurant
at 4:45 a boy will come and give you a sports bag
tell mr. ye i appr eciated his concern, but i'll be fine
you called papa yang and said we wer e ther e, didn't you
now, if wu fu-chun is dead... then perhaps we might have this lady r eturn the money
if she can't this is a serious loss of face for mr ye
he was setting xui-hong up... so he'd control the shanghai group
and he'd been aiming at ye's position for a long time

i don't know these streets... but i do know that we're just driving around
is that because you don't want to be alone with me?
do me a favor we're going to be together for a while
even if you don't mean it, treat me as your lover
i tell him some malaysians have got fu-chun... and i'll hand him over
somewhere yuan will feel safe... somewhere yuan will feel safe like tian-wen's restaurant... at say, 5 p.m.
it seems they robbed an underground bank there... killed two of its staff and stole 60 million yen
now, if wu fu-chun is dead... then perhaps we might have this lady return the money
all i was supposed to do was deliver you two to yang
now if i need a witness about today to keep mr yang honest...
she knew exactly what she wanted... and she'd do anything to get it
maybe she was the only way i had... to get out of this shithole of kabukicho
i am sorry about the shit i put on your car."
so you did put shit on my car, didn't you, hank, huh?
he didn't have the courage to get the help he needed.
so, know that i appreciate what you' re doing and i honor it.
tuesday's pretty full , but i can slot you in somewhere.
we land at four, then do a drop-by at the teachers union party... .
more like it's too bad, but we don't take it seriously.
it's not as frightening as things that happen to real people, like losing a job.
you couldn't live with yourself if you deprived america of this great man.
tonight, an aide of governer jack stanton is joining us to play a tape.
it was you, asking the head waiter at cafe des artistes... .
. .to seat you right away because you hadn't eaten all day but how. .
i took innocent statements of governor stanton's off his cellular phone...
edited them and paid cashmere mecleod to pretend she was talking to him.
in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheep, and that is not here.
so to compete, you have to exercise a different muscle the one between your ears.
i know we all wish senator harris a full and speedy recoery.
i think the people of florida will understand if i forgo...
how do you think new york will take the thing with harris?
well , susan, i think first we've to see if harris is still in.
. .or having any polls, because i'm not paying any ploosters.
i'm not hiring folks to tell me what you' re thinking or how to get at you.
but it might be good to get on some tv shows like "oprah" and "geraldo"
you mean strip away those last annoying shreds of dignity and wallow in trash.
all i heard about was a development named clearwater estates... .
where the state and county matched funds to build a connecting road.
it would be god's joke if he got nailed for it anyway.
freddy didn't know you hired his wife and brother to get to him?
and if he doesn't, the repubilcans will lead him to it next fall .
it will be like eagleton, only it'll be ou fault this time... .
that's why you still talk in that tender voice about being in it for the folks...
... andsusancanonlytalk in that voice from hell about your ppolitical career.
you don't think lincoln was a whore before he was president?
he had to tell his stories and smile his back-country grin.
he did that so one day he'd have the opportunity... .
. .to stand before the nation and appeal to our better nature.
the mayor said, "maybe you'd like a college scholarship in state university"
the banker said maybe charlie didn't want to go back to school.
get me the national mailing lists of every donor... since the beginning of time.
i also need a complete database of voting records on every candidate... so we can set up a rapid response operation.
like a barefoot, dipshit, third rate, southern fried... piece of shit alderman!
you didn't know ozio was speaking at the dinner... to keep me from shooting my mouth off!
i remember a time when being a democrat... meant more than just giving welfare recipients a safety net.
it meant giving them a ladder... giving them a way to climb back to an equal height.
or do you try to pull your britches up and grab the doves you just shot... and then try to run, all at the same time?
or do you just forget about the doves... pull your britches up and, because you got no time... to aim and button your fly?
more like, "it's too bad, but we don't take it seriously."
"it's not a frightening as thing that happen to real,... people like losing a job.
i know she wanted to play with me and ask me about school.
but sometimes you're too tired to do anything but blob... out in front of the tube.
push a button in new york and a billion dollars moves to tokyo.
in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheap,... and that is not here.
that's why we going to see some upsets today, but the biggest will be for jack stanton.
stanton, like romney, muskie and hart before him, flamed... then burned out.
governor jack stanton, who is still campaigning, has decided to... fight right down to the wire and is out on this cold and rainy night... working to get last minute votes.
this has been his technique and... many are surprised at how effective it's been.
according to exit polls, an overwhelming number... of stanton voters say that what decided them was actually... meeting the governor.
so, we predict governor jack stanton... a close second to lawrence harris.
i agree with many of his votes, but some it's important... to stand with our friends.
and america has no better friend than the state of israel.
the governor is very concerned about this situation with your daughter.
he'd like to see it resolved as i'm sure you would.
my guest today is presidential nominee... and jfk lookalike, governor jack stanton.
jack, when we were talking before... you said your mama liked vegas.
but hospital sources will not comment... on the senator's condition at this point.
it's difficult to say what affect this will have on the campaign.
i want to thank all of you... for your remarkable outpouring of affection.
it's obvious my husband will not be able to continue his campaign.
as i know him as a man of action rather than words... the best action is for me to go down and donate a pint of blood,... because that's he needs now.
if you want to come with me and donate a pint,...
i quit, in part to see if i could salvage my marriage... but i couldn't.
so then i just wanted to make sure... my boys knew i loved them.
i think if you ask them, they'll say we made it through okay.
they're in college now and when mrs. harris asked me to do this... they were very enthusiastic.
politicians have to explain things to you... in simpler terms... so that they can get their little oversimplified explanations... on the evening news.
and eventually, instead of even trying to explain... they give up and start slinging mud at each other.
but it seems it's the only way we know how to keep you all riled up.
so what i want to do is quiet things down... and start having a conversation... about what sort of country we want this to be in the next century.
two reasons... no recording devices, and i've always... wanted to see this hotel.
yes, in my work, i'd hoped being the governor's brother-in-law... would be an advantage.
it would be god's joke if he got nailed for it anyway.
freddy didn't know you hired his wife and brother to get to him?
everything we've worked for since miami 25 years ago dies, and fast.
the second thing that happens is someday, soon when they're sick of...
picker's quiet, righteous act some intrepid journalist... will stumble onto this.
and if he doesn't, the republicans will lead him to it next fall.
that's why you still talk in that tender voice about... being in it for the folks and...
susan can only talk in that voice from hell about your political career.
everything that we hoped to be, everything we wanted the world to be.
all those young promises made, libby remembered in the original wording.
but probably the bottom line is i'm going to be a national joke.
and i'll have to explain it to my boys, either way.
he had to tell his stories and smile his back-country grin.
he did that so one day he'd have the opportunity... to stand before the nation and appeal to our better nature..
look at me and tell me it's not going to happen.
look at me and tell me you don't want to be part of it.
the mayor said, "maybe you'd like a college scholarship in state university"
the banker said maybe charlie didn't want to go back to school.

look at me and tell me it's not going to happen.
look at me and tell me you don't want to be part of it.
he took out four machine gun nests of japaneses soldiers... who had pinned down his buddies.
did it with one grenade, his rifle, bayonet, and bare hands.
he had the courage to win the medal of honor... but didn`t have the courage to do what you`re doing here.
he didn`t have the courage to get the help he needed.
i wondered how it wouid be to work with someone... who actually cared about...
i mean... it couidn`t always have been the way it is now.
i`ve never heard a president say "destiny" and "sacrifice"... without thinking, "bullshit."
okay, maybe it was bullshit with kennedy, too, but... but people believed it.
get me the national mailing lists of every donor... since the beginning of time.
i also need a complete database of voting records on every candidate... so we can set up a rapid response operation.
tuesday`s pretty full, but maybe i can slot you in somewhere.
we land at four then do a drop-by at the teachers union cocktail party... before their dinner at the sheraton.
i can`t help feeling sad as i listen to senator martin.
i remember a time when being a democrat... meant more than just giving welfare recipients a safety net.
it meant giving them a ladder... giving them a way to climb back to an equal height.
if we don`t control spending... and shore up the economy of this country, it will go under.
because he just has to get on the good side of lawrence harris.
a lower deficit means working families... will have lower mortgage rates.
or do you just forget about the doves... pull your britches up and, because you got no time... to aim and button your fly?
and if you miss... you don`t want to die with your dick hanging out.
well, i mean... what if you`re not prepared for the boar... get caught with your britches down and lose the doves?
what richard is saying is... if you get caught in the forest...
be prepared, so when a story hits, we can fight back with the truth.
but how can we know what garbage they`ii come up with?
in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheap,... and that is not here.
so to compete, you have to exercise a different muscle... the one between your ears.
i will fight to make education a lifetime thing in this country... to give you the support you need to move up.
but you have to do the heavy lifting your own selves.
it means someone thinks you`re only interested in that kind of garbage.
so tuesday, when you go to cast your vote, think about that.
is we`ll see some upsets today, but the biggest will be for jack stanton.
stanton, like romney, muskie and hart before him, flamed... then burned out.
governor jack stanton, who is still campaigning, has decided to... fight right down to the wire and is out on this cold and rainy night... working to get last minute votes.

my guest today is presidential nominne... and jfk lookalike, governor jack stanton.
jack, when we were talking before... you said your mama liked vegas.
but hospital sources will not comment... on the senator`s condition at this point.
lt`s difficult to say what affect this will have on the campaign.
i want to thank all of you... for your remarkable outpouring of affection.
lt`s obvious my husband will not be able to continue his campaign.
as i know him as a man of action rather than words... the best action is for me to go down and donate a pint of blood,... because that`s he needs now.
if you want to come with ma and donate a pint,...
no. i won`t be doing any spots or having any polls,... because l`m not paying any pollsters.
l`m not hiring folks to tell me what you`re thinking... or how to get at you.
i quit, in part to see if i could salvage my marriage... but i couldn`t.
so then i just wanted to make sure... my boys knew i loved them.

so what i want to do is quiet things down... and start having a conversation... about what sort of country we want this to be in the next century.
and i want governor stanton to know that i... welcome him to this conversation.
i`m sorry about losing daisy and richard... but we`re pros and these things happen.
now, i want to talk about something richard said about picker... that i want to find out.
is there a reason we`re meeting in neo bwanaiand and not his office?
two reasons...no recording devices, and i`ve always... wanted to see this hotel.
we hear that mcgovern had chosen a vice president who... had electric shock therapy.
and i consider the possibility that we way lose to that fuckbrain nixon.
the second thing that happens is someday, soon when they`re sick of...
picker`s quiet, righteous act some intrepid journalist... will stumble onto this.
and if he doesn`t, the republicans will lead him to it next fall.
it will be like eagieton, only it`ii be our fault this time... for letting it happen.
the blood dr. beauregard took wasn`t from you... it was from uncle charlie.
you sent him in your place because dr. beauregard loves... you and wants to "teach those yankees a lesson."
i am so sorry that i can`t look at her and say... that i will promise to do better.
she lent us her courage and her warmth... and her madness.
and i`ii have to explain it to my boys, either way.
because no matter what i do... the press will find out the rest, won`t they?
you don`t think lincoln was a whore before he was president?
he had to tell his stories and smile his back-country grin.
you know that there are plenty of people in this game... who don`t think that way.
they`ii sell their souls lie to people, divide them,... play on their fears, for nothing.
if he gets any higher, if he gets on your shoulder, like that, it's not as intimate.
it means he'll share a laugh with you or a secret, a light secret, not a real one, but very flattering.
it's the only reading program like it in new york, that i know of.
- of course, there may be others, but i don't-- -...know of them.
[ clears throat ] anyway, graduation come, and my mama come.
she take the day off from the laundry where she work at.
i want to thank all of you for having real courage.
m-my uncle charlie... was a-- a war hero, world war ii.
- japanese soldiers-- who had a squad of his buddies pinned down.
he had one grenade, his rifle, his bayonet and his bare hands.
when he came home to grace junction, they had a parade for him.
the town fathers came to my parents' house and said to him,
the mayor said, "maybe you'd like a full scholarship to the state university."
the banker said maybe charlie didn't want to go back to school after all he'd been through.
maybe he'd like a management job, a big future at the bank.
sawmill owner said, "you may not want to be cooped up in a school or a bank.
he had the courage to win the congressional medal of honor, but he didn't have the courage to do what every one of you is doing here.
he didn't have the courage to admit he needed help and get it.
i understand what you're doing, appreciate it, and i honor your commitment.
people say, "why do you spend so much time and effort on adult literacy?"
how can you walk out on adam larkin and get into bed with some cracker...
- i'm not getting into bed-- - who hasn't done piss for blacks in his state?
that's why there are so many black men running the country.
if you're so upset about politics, come work at the black advocate.
jack stanton could also be a great man, if he wasn't such a faithless, thoughtless, disorganized, undisciplined shit.
- honey, why are you making such a big deal of this?
anyway, we'd win, and then we'd be gutted in the senate.
we'd settle for their version, then the white house would veto, which we knew from the start.
well, neither have we, but that's how history is made, henry-- by the first-timers.
[ woman on p.a. ] we are beginning our pre-boarding procedure.
okay, get me the national committee mailing lists... of every donor since the beginning of time.
also, i need a complete database... of voting records on every possible candidate, so we can set up a rapid response negative operation.
- ¶ you'll never know, dear how much i love you ¶¶ - [ dog howling ]
i have a printout of every grassroots organization in new hampshire.
can't let a lady carry a suitcase, not in the south.
henry, i am so glad that you finally got a wardrobe.
- you didn't know that ozio was speaking at that dinner.
you couldn't tell me, so i don't go shootin' my mouth off about that party.
jimmy ozio is probably telling' his father he's got nothin' to worry about.
that would be the case even if henry hadn't screwed up.
you said your mama's in beverly hills, so if you're free, maybe you'd like to spend it with susan, jackie and me.
it's not the same as being with your mama, but we're family too.
- ¶ you make me happy when skies are gray ¶ - [ phone ringing ]
- ¶ you'll never know, dear how much i love you ¶
gentlemen, welcome to the first debate... of the democratic presidential primary.
- i remind you to keep your responses to one minute.
he couldn't get elected with a record, so he had that expunged.
that's the kind of man you want to work for, somebody who just wants to get elected?
or do you just forget about the fuckin' doves, pull your britches up and run, 'cause you ain't got time to aim and button your fly?
and if you miss, well... you don't want to die with your dick hanging out.
it should be like, "well, it's too bad, but we don't take it seriously."
[ richard ] this ain't as frightening as things that happen to people, like losing your job or getting foreclosed.
today a potentially explosive development for governor jack stanton... in his quest for the democratic presidential nomination.
a hairdresser has come forward alleging... a long-term affair with the married candidate.
- ¶ if you know what i mean ¶ - [ libby ] all right!
[ henry, country accent ] ¶ i don't ever want to play that song again ¶¶
[ cashmere on tape ] but you said you loved me.
you said no one could do the things i did to you.
he said, "do you think it's at all possible to get yourself laid?" he was talking to me.
he said he didn't want me too horny to think straight.
- [ jack ] i'm on my way to meet with the family.
"meet with the family." there was an accident, a bender on the interstate.
yes, it was off a cellular telephone, but don't pull that outraged-puppy shit with me.
it's not like you've suddenly become an innocent because the tape is phony.
put that thing away before you do something stupid and get into trouble!
randy, you wet fart of a human turd, you ambushed jack stanton, and you're gonna admit it or you're gonna die.
now, i want you to be eloquent in this letter you're about to write... and guilt-ridden about your jealousy and greed.
you could not live with yourself... if you deprived the american people of this man.
[ king on tape recorder ] uh, i can be there in 15 minutes.
[ woman on tape recorder ] i could come up there, sugar.
"i confess it now because i can no longer live with the fear...
"that i may deprive the american people... of a great man."
- ¶ you're still the one who can scratch my itch ¶
- [ phone continues ringing ] - ¶ still the one that i wouldn't switch ¶
thank you all for stickin' with us and workin' so hard through all this.
w-we don't have much time, but with your help and the grace of god, we will get done what needs to get done.
no politician can make it be the way it used to be, because we're living in a new world now, a world without economic borders.
a guy can push a button in new york and move a billion dollars to tokyo.
and in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheap, and that is not here.
if you want to compete, you're gonna have to exercise a different set of muscles-- the ones between your ears.
i will fight, sweat and bleed to get the money to make education... a lifetime thing in this country, to give you the support you need to move up.
but you have got to do the heavy lifting your own selves.
it means someone thinks that you're only interested... in the kind of garbage that they've been throwin' at me.
so tuesday, when you go to cast your vote, you think about that.
i don't think i'll be able to take it if he loses.
if he does lose, maybe we want to go away for a while.
it's primary day in new hampshire where the polls are still open.
harris is a serious man... and has serious things to say about america's economic future.
people of this country recognize that, and that's why we're going to see upsets today.
but the biggest upset has got to be for jack stanton.
- [ man ] the fact is jack-- - [ woman ] if it rains across the upper midwest.
and with 15% of the vote in, we are predicting lawrence harris to win in new hampshire.
according to exit polls, an overwhelming number of stanton voters say... the deciding factor for them was that they actually met the governor.
so we predict governor jack stanton a close second... to lawrence harris, with nilson and martin a distant third and fourth.
- i served my country in korea, and my boy jeff fought in the gulf war.
jack stanton dodged the vietnam draft... and used political connections to cover up his antiwar arrest record.
i'm sure your daughter's a fine young person, but she's a child.
children are impressionable, and there's been a lot of news about the governor--
when we were talking before, you were telling me that your mama liked vegas.
as a tip to our listeners, when she goes there, where does she stay?
i guess i have to fly back tonight, address the victory party, try to get mrs. harris on the phone at the hospital again.
she hasn't been returning my calls, but, uh, can't blame her, can ya?
with god's help he will rise to fight again a worthy and honorable opponent.
- and i know every one of us throughout this great country...
- i think the people of florida... will understand if i forego any talk of victory or defeat... and ask them to join me in a prayer.
[ howard ] we'll need a consultant in new york, jack.
- [ tv ] i want to thank all of you... for your remarkable outpouring of affection.
it's obvious that my husband will not be able... to continue his campaign for the presidency.
[ man ] what kind of changes can we expect in the campaign?
lawrence harris has made several negative 30-second spots, and his pollsters have advised even more.
i won't be doing any spots... and i won't be having any polls because i'm not gonna be paying any pollsters.
i'm not gonna hire folks... to tell me what you're thinkin' and how i can get at you.
no, no, it's not, but i guess... it's part of the game now, so i'll be candid.
what happened was i got too wrapped up in the business of being governor... and i began to neglect my family, and my wife fell in love with another man.
i quit in part to see if i could salvage my marriage, but i couldn't.
so i just wanted to make sure that my boys... knew that they had two parents that loved them very much.
and i think if you ask them they'll tell you that we made it through okay.
they're in college now, and when mrs. harris asked me to do this, they were very, very enthusiastic.
but it might be good to get on some tv shows like montel and geraldo.
you mean strip away those last annoying little shreds of dignity... and just wallow in trash?
th-that's why i'm so, so happy to be in new york,
- ¶¶ [ band playing ] - to have the opportunity to--
if, if you just give me a chance- [ crowd shouting ]
- please give me a chance... to answer your, your questions--
and politicians have to explain things to you in simpler terms... so that they can get their little oversimplified explanations... on the evening news.
and eventually, instead of even trying to explain things, they just give up and start slinging' mud at each other.
and it's all to keep you excited, keep you watchin', like you watch, uh, a car wreck... or a, uh, wrestling' match.
as a matter of fact, that's exactly what it's like: professional wrestling'.
but it seems it's the only way we know how to keep you all riled up.
so what i want to do with this campaign is kind of quiet things down... and start having a conversation... about what sort of country we want this to be in the next century.
in '78 she actually wore a button that said, "i'm a picker person"... and nosedived when he quit the race?
didn't even try to get the goods on why he was--
the only way it would matter is if i were the father, because guilty is what's interesting.
am i supposed to live by these rules and let picker slide in on a special pass... because you were a picker person in the '70s?
for the first time i considered the possibility... we might lose to that fuckbrain nixon.
i mean, before that, i was absolutely convinced we would win.
i couldn't believe that tom eagleton would really be a nutcase.
they had to have dragged him off and drugged him and made him crazy.
everything we've worked for... since miami 25 years ago dies, and fast.
the second thing that happens is someday very soon, when the romance dies, when they've gotten sick of freddie picker's quiet, righteous act, some enterprising journalist will stumble onto this.
if he doesn't, the republicans will lead him to it on their timetable.
next fall, it'll be another eagleton, only... it'll be our fault this time for letting it happen.
you sent him to have his blood tested in your place, because you know good old dr. beauregard loves you and...
[ imitating beauregard ] "wants to teach those yankees a lesson."
he's not gonna love you enough to lose his license, jack.
once he knows i have proof, he'll fold like a cheap accordion.
i am so sorry i can't look at her and say... that i will promise to do better.
she lent us her courage and her warmth... and her madness.
and i'm gonna have to explain it all to my boys, either way.
because no matter what i do, the press is still gonna find out the rest of it, aren't they?
what i did now, i did for libby, but it wasn't right.
if picker hadn't quit, he'd have won the nomination, gone down and taken the party with him.
and who pushed him off the cliff when he was falling.
those are fine points, "how many angels fit on the head of a pin" points.
you don't think abraham lincoln was a whore before he was a president?
he had to tell his stories and smile his shit-eating, back-country grin.
you know as well as i do there are plenty... of people playing this game that don't think that way.
they're willing to sell their souls, crawl through sewers, lie to people, divide them, play on their worst fears just for the prize.
i'm gonna win this thing, and when i do, we're gonna make history.
look me in the eye and tell me it's not gonna happen.
he had the courage to win the medal of honor... . .but didn't have the courage to do what you' re doing here.
he didn't have the courage to get the help he needed.
...giving them a way to climb back to an equal height.
if we don't control spending... and shore up the economy of this country, it will go under.
more like it's too bad, but we don't take it seriously.
it's not as frightening as things that happen to real people, like losing a job.
he said, do you think it's at all possible to get youself laid?
he said he didn't want me to be too horny to think straight.
you couldn't live with yourself if you deprived america of this great man.
tonight, an aide of governer jack stanton is joining us to play a tape.
it was you, asking the head waiter at cafe des artistes... .
. .to seat you right away because you hadn't eaten all day but how. .
and the grace of god, we'll get done what needs to be done.
it's would be easy to get laughs... by doing some cheap blow-dry jokes... so i'll get started.
i know she wanted to play with me and ask me about school .
but sometimes you' re too tired to do anything but blob out
push a button in new york and a billion dollars moves to tokyo.
in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheep, and that is not here.
this has been his technique and many are... surprised at how effective.
according to exit polls an overwhelming number of voters said what decided them was meeting the governor.
i want to thank all of you... for your remarkable outpouring of affection.
it's obvious my husband. .will not be able to continue his campaign.
as i know him as a man of action rather than words... .
the best action is for me to go down... and donate a pint of blood, because that's what he needs now.
. .or having any polls, because i'm not paying any ploosters.
i'm not hiring folks to tell me what you' re thinking or how to get at you.
so then i just wanted... to make sure my boys knew i loved them.
i think if you ask them, they'll say we made it throught okay.
but it seems it's the only way we know how to keep you all riled up.
so what i want to do is quiet things down... .
all i heard about was a development named clearwater estates... .
where the state and county matched funds to build a connecting road.
we hear that mcgovem had chosen a vice president who had electric shock therapy.
and i consider the possibility that we may lose to that fuckbrain nixon.
and if he doesn't, the repubilcans will lead him to it next fall .
it will be like eagleton, only it'll be ou fault this time... .
the blood dr. beauregard took wasn't from you... it was from uncle charlie.
you sent him in your place because dr. beauregard loves you and wants to teach those yankees a lesson'
i am so sorry that i can't look at her and say... that i will promise to do better.
she lent us her courage and her warmth and her madness.
you don't think lincoln was a whore before he was president?
he had to tell his stories and smile his back-country grin.
he did that so one day he'd have the opportunity... .
. .to stand before the nation and appeal to our better nature.
he took out four machine gun nests of japanese soldiers... whohadpinnedsownhisbuddies.
did it with one grenade, his rifle, bayonet, and bare hands.
. .but didn't have the courage to do what you' re doing here.
he didn't have the courage to get the help he needed.
get the mailing lists of every donor since the beginning of time.
i also need a complete database of voting records on every candidate...
he said, do you think it's at all possible to get youself laid?
he said he didn't want me to be too horny to think straight.
i confess it now because i cannot live with the fear...
that i may deprive the american people of a great man.
i know she wanted to play with me and ask me about school .
but sometimes you' re too tired to do anything but blob out
push a button in new york and a billion dollars moves to tokyo.
in that world, muscle jobs go where muscle labor is cheep, and that is not here.
it means someone thinks you' re interested in that kind of garbage.
tuesday, when you go to cast your vote, think about that.
i don't think i'll be able to take it if he loses.
if he does lose, maybe we could go away for a while.
and donate a pint of blood, because that's what he needs now.
if you want to come with me and donate a pint,
but it seems it's the only way we know how to keep you all riled up.
so what i want to do is quiet things down... .
we hear that mcgovem had chosen a vice president who had electric shock therapy.
and i consider the possibility that we may lose to that fuckbrain nixon.
he had to tell his stories and smile his back-country grin.
he did that so one day he'd have the opportunity... .
look at me and tell me it's not going to happen.
look at me and tell me you don't want to be part of it.
you know, listen, i was thinking about what you said last night.
what if we just asked my mother... to come over and show you how to make those meatballs?
you know, marie, you don't have to go to all this trouble.
yes, but ray tells me that this is something you really want to iearn.
could you just show me where your mom keeps the recipes?
i just wanted to see if i jotted it down correctly.
okay, i have a problem, but let me ask you something, raymond.
would you come over here so much if i didn't make food for you?
okay, mom, it's very good food... but, no, you can't do this.
i know it was wrong... but debra asked for my recipes and i panicked.
that way, you would feel better because you knowhow to do it... and that's better, right?
what if she just comes over and just shows you how to do it?
i don't get that you couldn't see my side in this!
you're so busy defending your saint of a mother... that you make me out to be some kind of ungrateful nutcase!
that way, you would feel better because you know how to do it... and that's better, right?
what if she just comes over and just shows you how to do it?
okay, i have a problem, but let me ask you something, raymond.
would you come over here so much if i didn't make food for you?
okay, mom, it's very good food... but, no, you can't do this.

what if we just asked my mother... to come over and show you how to make those meatballs?
you know, marie, you don't have to go to all this trouble.
yes, but ray tells me that this is something you really want to learn.
could you just show me where your mom keeps the recipes?
i just wanted to see if i jotted it down correctly.
okay, i have a problem, but let me ask you something, raymond.
would you come over here so much if i didn't make food for you?
okay, mom, it's very good food... but, no, you can't do this.
i know it was wrong... but debra asked for my recipes and i panicked.
cory, all we're doing is treating the man who has been the driving force in our lives to a brunch.
and if he happens to go a little easier on us in class, so be it.
i mean, we really took you out as an appreciation of how much you've taught us thus far.
and we know that you've got a vested interest in us and want to see us do well.
first of all, i'd like to thank the boys in the audio-visual department.
i would like to thank the wonderful people at milt's masonry who built that lovely brick wall, and i would like to thank my roommate jack, and, of course, the heroine or our saga...
just because we thought it was the right thing to do.
and because we want to earn our grades on the strengths of our efforts and not on the strengths of our friendship.
it's for everyone, with the help of laura hall on the keyboard.
i need the audience, something of life that the modern disturbed.
previously both of you used to sleep with the same girl.
you used to kiss her from one side and he from the other side.
he killed my sister by repeatedly laying her on a push-cart.
now bulla will kill him by throwing him on the ground.
because he is a white sheet in between the law and us.
if we quarrel with him we will be dragged to the court.
if a person shows off too much then bulla does not leave him.
bulla, i will make you wear a nose-ring worn by the whores.
...will have of loads of things to be looked after by you.
i wonder what the boy will be like whom you will be married to.
"it seems your heart has something to say to my heart."
"it seems your heart has something to say to my heart."
"i have to just say that i want live with you from now on."
"oh my sweet heart, i want to forget myself in your love."
" i am crazy in your love, now everything seems rosy."
"oh sweetheart, hide me in your eyes, don't ever leave me."
and with whose tears will we light the lamps on diwali?
this is why we have not yet fixed your date with death yet.
...in front of which you are nothing but a small ember!
it is these embers that give rise to fire in hell father.
if i find you on the road, i will beat you there.
if i find you on the bed, i will bash you there.
i am like the coconut which is hard from outside but soft within.
i also have a great amount of sympathy for the poor people.
well, after i thought about it he sort of had a point.
if he was boyfriend material, i'd have given him the test which he would have failed.
this might come down not to what the jury wants to do, but what they need to.
what they need is to believe that airplanes don't crash for no reason.
or else i wouldn't have slept with you, and i wanted to.
it's hard to say this because i slept with him forever.
well, after i thought about it he sort of had a point.
if he was boyfriend material, i'd have given him the test which he would have failed.
this might come down not to what the jury wants to do, but what they need to.
what they need is to believe that airplanes don't crash for no reason.
or else i wouldn't have slept with you, and i wanted to.
it's hard to say this because i slept with him forever.
one or two is not hard to find, but eight, that's really tough.
it all sounds very exciting, but all your work has been for nothing.
i ordered more gas, but we didn't know about the leak.
soon they began to twitch all over, like they were dancing.
don't forget that and don't ever forget the file i have on you.
i tried to do things the nice way, but fine, we'll do it the hard way.
i always believed a man should take responsibility for his family.
when you came to me in tears and asked me to intervene, then i realised this was not a matter to be trifled with.
todd, i've seen your record, and every grade is way down.
even your strongest subject, history, is down from a to c-.
this is between the three of us, if it makes things easier at home.
but if you try to trick me again, i show up at your door.
when the time is right, i'll tell richard about all this.
he and monica need to know what's happening to their son.
your grandfather thinks you can do this, and i know you can.
i don't want you to feel like you have no one to talk to.
hawthorne was one of the most interesting writers of his time...
why did some people do something and others nothing at all?
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
so one sleepless night, the old man got out of bed and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy.
he wrote how the boy forced his way into the old man's house.
how he blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
even though his hands were stinging with arthritis, he felt happy for the first time in weeks.
he went to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
the bank officer told him that only the old man could open the box, with one exception:
a man five years older than me worries more about his heart than being sent off to israel.
and the day will come, if i live long enough, when i decide that what you know no longer matters.
then they dropped that cinder block on that cop and it got all crazy.
but you've got to be moving or they catch you hooking their ride.
the young boy who took the wings his father built for him.
wings that were meant to carry him over the ocean to freedom.
this is our destiny, and we hold it in the palm of our hands.
an investigation by police, l, and the department of justice, has uncovered a body in the house of arthur denker, the man believed to be a nazi war criminal.
you must really have wanted to shake my hand or something else.
are you going to tell people i did something to you?
it takes eight "compares" to get a print accepted in court.
one or two is not hard to find, but eight, that's really tough.
this is nothing compared to what the israelis would do to you.
don't forget that and don't ever forget the file i have on you.
i tried to do things the nice way, but fine, we'll do it the hard way.
you'll put this on because i want to see you in it.
i must admit that the situation in richard's home is appalling.
i always believed a man should take responsibility for his family.
with your father's work problems and your mom... drinking, maybe home isn't the best place to be studying.
he's offered to let you study over at his place after school.
if you didn't excuse me, my desire for a cigarette would.
when the time is right, i'll tell richard about all this.
i know it's not easy being a senior and only 16.
your grandfather thinks you can do this, and i know you can.
you will work for the rest of this quarter and all of your vacation.
hawthorne was one of the most interesting writers of his time...
today, i will tell you the story of an old man who was afraid.
he was afraid of a certain young boy who was, in a queer way, his friend.
over time, the old man felt his hold on the boy slipping away.
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
how he blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
the following morning, the old man put on his best suit.
he went to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
we alone decide how our talents are bestowed upon the world.
this is our destiny, and we hold it in the palm of our hands.
one or two is not so hard to find, but eight good ones, that's really tough.
it all sounds very exciting, boy, but i'm afraid all your work has been for nothing.
i ordered more gas, but we didn't know about the leak.
soon they began to twitch all over, like they were dancing.
but my poor eyesight kept me out of combat, thank god.
i spent most of the war in the military hospital washing bed linens and nurses' uniforms.
i was raised to believe that the man should take responsibility for his family.
but when you came to me in tears and asked me to intervene then i realized this was not a matter to be trifled with.
todd, i've been looking at your record, and according to your progress report, every grade is way down.
even your strongest subject, history, went from a solid a to c-.
finals for this quarter are in three and a half weeks.
if you can give me all a's, then i'll talk to your teachers, and see if we can't discount your midterms, and let this quarter's grades rest with your final exams.
mr. bowden, i can't thank you enough for coming down here today.
but if it's all right with you, i'd like to talk to todd alone for a few minutes.
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
so one sleepless night, the old man got out of bed, and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy.
he wrote how the boy forced his way into the old man's house.
and blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
at the end, his hands were stinging with arthritis, but he felt happy for the first time in weeks.
and went down to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
the bank officer explained to the old man that only the old man could use the old man's key, with one exception:
a man five years older than me worries more about his failing heart than being sent off to israel.
and the day will come, if i live long enough, when i decide that what you know no longer matters.
this is our destiny, and we hold it in the palm of our hands.
man [over tv]: an investigation by local police, the sheriff's department, fbi, and the department of justice.
police have confirmed that a body has been found in the basement of arthur denker.
the santo donato resident believed to be a nazi war criminal.
one or two is not hard to find, but eight, that's really tough.
it all sounds very exciting, but all your work has been for nothing.
i ordered more gas, but we didn't know about the leak.
soon they began to twitch all over, like they were dancing.
don't forget that and don't ever forget the file i have on you.
i tried to do things the nice way, but fine, we'll do it the hard way.
i always believed a man should take responsibility for his family.
when you came to me in tears and asked me to intervene, then i realised this was not a matter to be trifled with.
todd, i've seen your record, and every grade is way down.
even your strongest subject, history, is down from a to c-.
this is between the three of us, if it makes things easier at home.
but if you try to trick me again, i show up at your door.
when the time is right, i'll tell richard about all this.
he and monica need to know what's happening to their son.
your grandfather thinks you can do this, and i know you can.
i don't want you to feel like you have no one to talk to.
hawthorne was one of the most interesting writers of his time...
why did some people do something and others nothing at all?
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
so one sleepless night, the old man got out of bed and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy.
he wrote how the boy forced his way into the old man's house.
how he blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
even though his hands were stinging with arthritis, he felt happy for the first time in weeks.
he went to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
the bank officer told him that only the old man could open the box, with one exception:
a man five years older than me worries more about his heart than being sent off to israel.
and the day will come, if i live long enough, when i decide that what you know no longer matters.
then they dropped that cinder block on that cop and it got all crazy.
but you've got to be moving or they catch you hooking their ride.

you must really have wanted to shake my hand or something else.
are you going to tell people i did something to you?
i think that for most of you, we moved a little too tast through chapter one.

i was in the reserves, as were most young men, victor.
but then, my poor eyesight kept me out of combat, i thank god.
we ordered every jew in kiev to come to the babi yar ravine.
you must remember, boy, the '20s were a desperate time in germany.
this note is to suggest that we have a group conterence... concerning todd's first semester grades.
in light of his previous excellent work, the sudden decline in his grades... suggests a specific problem which should be addressed... before his academic advancement is jeopardized permanently.
i was raised to believe that a man should take responsibility... for his family.
but when you came to me in tears... and asked me to intervene... well then, i realized that this was not a matter to be trifled with.
your grandfather and i have been talking and we both agree... that with what's been going on, what with your tather's work problems... and your mom with the drinking... that maybe home isn't the best place to be studying.
so he's offered to let you study over at his place... every day after school.
now, if you can give me all a's... then i'll talk to your teachers... and see if we can't discount your midterms... and let this quarter's grades rest with your tinal exams.
but it you come back with b's or c's, i can't help you.

you'll put this on because i want to see you in it.
i must admit that the situation in richard's home is appalling.
i always believed a man should take responsibility for his family.
with your father's work problems and your mom ... drinking, maybe home isn't the best place to be studying.
he's offered to let you study over at his place after school.
if you didn't excuse me, my desire for a cigarette would.
when the time is right, i'll tell richard about all this.
i know it's not easy being a senior and only 1 6.
your grandfather thinks you can do this, and i know you can.
you will work for the rest of this quarter and all of your vacation.
hawthorne was one of the most interesting writers of his time ...
today, i will tell you the story of an old man who was afraid.
he was afraid of a certain young boy who was, in a queer way, his friend.
over time, the old man felt his hold on the boy slipping away.
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
how he blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
the following morning, the old man put on his best suit.
he went to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
the young boy who took the wings his father built for him.
wings that were meant to carry him over the ocean to freedom.
this is our destiny, and we hold it in the palm of our hands.
an investigation by police, fbi, and the department of justice, has uncovered a body in the house of arthur denker, the man believed to be a nazi war criminal.
you must really have wanted to shake my hand or something else.
are you going to tell people i did something to you?
one or two is not hard to find, but eight, that's really tough.
it all sounds very exciting, but all your work has been for nothing.
this is nothing compared to what the israelis would do to you.
don't forget that and don't ever forget the file i have on you.

over time, the old man felt his hold on the boy slipping away.
he thought the day might come when the boy no longer needed him.
so one sleepless night, the old man got out of bed -
- and wrote down the story of his involvement with the boy.
he wrote how the boy forced his way into the old man's house.
how he blackmailed the old man to serve his own morbid fascinations.
when the boy's grades began to fall, he blamed the old man and ordered him to impersonate his grandfather.
even though his hands were stinging with arthritis, he felt happy for the first time in weeks.
he went to one of the local banks and rented a safe-deposit box.
the bank officer told him that only the old man could open the box, with one exception:
a man five years older than me worries more about his heart than being sent off to israel.
and the day will come, if i live long enough, when i decide that what you know no longer matters.
then they dropped that cinder block on that cop and it got all crazy.

one or two is not so hard to find, but eight good ones, that's really tough.
it all sounds very exciting, boy, but i'm afraid all your work has been for nothing.
everything i have on you, the compares, the want sheet, all the photographs are all in a very safe place.
if anything happens to me, someone will find it, believe me.
i ordered more gas, but we didn't know about the leak.
soon they began to twitch all over, like they were dancing.
but my poor eyesight kept me out of combat, thank god.
i spent most of the war in the military hospital washing bed linens and nurses' uniforms.
in light of his previous outstanding work, the deterioration of his grades suggests a specific problem, which should be addressed before his academics is jeopardized.
i'm ready to work out a time for us to meet.
i was raised to believe that the man should take responsibility for his family.
but when you came to me in tears and asked me to intervene then i realized this was not a matter to be trifled with.
todd, i've been looking at your record, and according to your progress report, every grade is way down.
even your strongest subject, history, went from a solid a to c-.
if you can give me all a's, then i'll talk to your teachers, and see if we can't discount your midterms, and let this quarter's grades rest with your final exams.
if you come back with b's or c's, i can't help you.
for now, we can deal with just the three of us, if it makes things easier at home.
but you try and pull one over on me, next time i show up at your door.
your edward french is not going to give you any more trouble.

as many as 19 murders over seven years were attributed to avatar.

i don't think there was anything more beautiful on the screen than a close-up of a beautiful actress in technicolor.
the rainbow arrived on the silver screen thanks to a man named herbert kalmus who preferred the masters to motion pictures.
sir isaac newton gave a scientific explanation to what all great artists knew intuitively.
that pure white light contains all the colors of the spectrum.
each one has its own meaning, each one has its own specific reason to be there.
in 1 855, less than two decades after louis daguerre developed the first photographs, physicist james maxwell employed newtonian science to add color.
he took three pictures of fruit, one each through green, red and blue filters.
then projected lantern-slide images of the three on top of each other rebuilding much of the original colors.
actress lillian russell startled the world appearing in the first photographic color process, kinemacolor.
it required special equipment, cost a fortune and gave many people headaches.
acceptable and affordable color would come thanks to a chemical engineer from boston who didn 't think much of motion pictures.
when a baseball collided with a finger of young herbert t. kalmus his father's dream that he'd become a concert pianist ended.
when both parents died by the time he was 1 1 herbert's chance at a normal new england childhood ended too.
he worked in a boston chocolate factory and paid his way to study physics and chemistry at the massachusetts institute of technology.
he had th-- lt wasn't such a deep voice but it was a penetrating voice and these eyes that just latched onto you.
at a school dance, herbert's eyes latched onto catalog model natalie dunfee.
kalmus became a professor at mit and formed a research firm that invented such gizmos as a flash-frame camera to compute the speed of a moving automobile.
one day, an investor asked the kalmus firm to perfect the projection of motion pictures.
his first headquarters and lab was a railway car which he rode to florida to shoot the first technicolor film.
only a single frame exists of the gulf between which required the dual lens projection of color-filtered film.
kalmus himself said any operator had to be part college professor part acrobat.
in early 1920, he brought a new process and an appeal for money to the founder of kodak.
based on the story of madame butterfly, the film demonstrated a new process where two dyed strips of film were cemented together.
the technicolor camera photographed the original scene through red and green filters on black-and-white film.
color wasn't really added back into the image until the final printing process when the images were dyed red and green and combined to form an approximation of natural color.
during production on the toll of the sea dr. kalmus secretly divorced natalie citing irreconcilable differences.
she had attended art schools in boston and europe and she had a great color sense but that didn't always agree with the art directors at the different studios.
although they never spoke the doctor and his ex-wife continued to share homes on both coasts.
she insisted on being called mrs. kalmus and spent 35 years taking the doctor to court in an attempt to nullify the divorce.
the novelty of color made the toll of the sea a box-office success.
but the one role that eluded him was a treasure lsland-style pirate as depicted by artist howard pyle.
inspired by these drawings, fairbanks told dr. kalmus he'd spend 1 million dollars of his own money to make a technicolor feature.
fairbanks spent four months shooting color tests until he found an acceptable saturation level.
he was more concerned about the background and the trees, and sky, and things rather than what the faces looked like.
"a glorious, chromatic production reminiscent of the paintings of the old masters. "
the new york premiere had expert technicolor projectionists ensuring the bonded red and green sensitive film strips didn 't cause problems.
but across the country, untrained operators were screening the double-thick prints.
after they were glued together and dyed on either side they warped, cupped and scratched because they were so thick.
there was a lot of trouble, and they had to replace those.
color remained an impractical and expensive gimmick at a time when black-and-white photography had evolved into a respected art form.
riding his studio 's financial success with talkies jack warner cast about for another novelty to bring in the audience.
the screening problems with the black pirate had forced technicolor to develop a new process.
this time two dyed strips of film were superimposed or transferred, onto a single piece of film.
the technology had improved but the quality of movies being made only seemed worse.
mgm had a contract with technicolor but louis b. mayer had so little faith in the process he relegated the novelty to short subjects or brief inserts.
like this performance of romeo and juliet featuring norma shearer and john gilbert whose career ended with talking pictures.
listen, my children, and you shall hear "the midnight ride of paul revere. "
other curiosities include porky pig's two-color screen debut and a rare two-color appearance by the three stooges.
dr. kalmus knew he had to bring the entire rainbow to the screen before his 1 6-year experiment would be a success.
in 1932, dr. kalmus announced completion of a camera capable of shooting all-color motion pictures.
but when dr. kalmus showed him a three-color test disney scrapped the black-and-white footage he'd already shot on a cartoon called flowers and trees.
impresario sid grauman agreed to run the cartoon at his chinese theatre prior to the feature strange interlude.
the new technicolor camera ran three strips of black-and-white film simultaneously.
one sensitive to red light, one to green, another to blue.
each of the three strips is washed in a complimentary color and then all three are superimposed or transferred to a single piece of film.
we build colors as we go at the very last minute which is the only way you get true color.
we also have the ability to control the contrast which is so important in photography.
from the beginning, technicolor controlled its process and cameras like a mother hen.
natalie kalmus believed natural, muted colors did not tax the eye as much as bright, man-made colors.
walt disney initially agreed that audiences might not accept florid colors for two hours.
fantasia celebrates the full spectrum of color and showcases the flexibility of the technicolor process.
i like to think dye transfer is like making a painting.
you are actually creating the color, and that's why the colors are so true.
even when walt disney decided to go color with dr. kalmus his brother roy objected to it.
he was a king and a god in the world he knew.
two months after he unleashed king kong on the world producer merian c. cooper took on color by forming pioneer pictures with financier jock whitney.
here is the screen as you know it, in its customary shades of black and white.
here it is flooded with the rich reality of natural color.
each scene of the film would have a different page with the fabrics on it the wall coverings, costumes, everything.
they then shot that on film to see how the colors would play against each other.
people used to be unnecessarily prejudiced about color in the sense that they said it was unnatural.
and it simply was that they weren't trained to observe color.
some believed the film improved the case for color by lessening its importance, but the industry remained split on technicolor's artistic and commercial value.
it would take one maverick filmmaker to remove all lingering doubt.
they felt it had none of the mystery and allure created by the interplay of shadow and light.
carole lombard, never one to mince words called color motion pictures "screwy. "
in 1936, he partnered with financier jock whitney who had recently dissolved pioneer pictures.
every single film that selznick international was considering from 1 936 on, i'm sure jock was saying:
to sell the public on technicolor selznick believed he needed major stars.
merle oberon looked spectacular, but in 1936 a big star she wasn 't.
like, whenever they got through with a good scene one of the assistant cameramen, like the slate-board guy would hold up a color sign and say, "that was a lily. "
and i didn't know what that meant, so that must have been terrific because that was their expression that the color was good.
with garden of allah, david selznick had scored a critical and commercial triumph.
the film more than made back the added expense of technicolor.
when a tall actress from sweden arrived in hollywood selznick shot her first screen test for a picture called lntermezzo.
but ingrid bergman did not appear in a color film until five years after this test.
so it was an economic thing because it was very expensive in the beginning to make films in color.
with a star ls born, selznick's second hit in 1937 the major studios began to look at technicolor as not an expensive novelty, but good box office.
the adventures of robin hood was the top grossing film of 1938.
illustrations by artist n. c. wyeth inspired cameramen sol polito and tony gaudio.
they somehow convinced natalie kalmus to relax her opposition to bright colors on the screen.
that light, that color is reflected from the screen arriving on you.
competing systems emerged but quickly disappeared due to the superiority of technicolor.
of the major studio chiefs louis b. mayer remained most skeptical about technicolor.
mgm also released a series of short-subject color films showcasing its stars and its stars of the future.
one year after la cucaracha made technicolor history 1 3-year-old judy garland sang the song then signed a studio contract.
its opening and closing scenes appeared in sepia or black-and-white film washed in a brown bath.
this made dorothy's technicolor arrival to the land of oz all the more astonishing.
they even had a pond where they had to put in bluing to get the right color.
to find the proper color for the yellow brick road art director cedric gibbons tried imported paints and exotic dyes.
he's the horse of a different color you've heard tell about.
animal cruelty protectors said no to using real paint on the horse.
the tortured production of gone with the wind at least had no wizard of oz heat problems.
director victor fleming, who went straight from oz to tara shot using a higher-speed film one that reduced lighting requirements by half and allowed a more natural look on-screen.
and he made these color tests of vivien leigh that i think were a revelation.
color reveals the complexion of her skin, the color of her eyes.
but ashley wilkes was described by margaret mitchell as having a kind of "golden hair. "
so leslie howard sat still for weeks on end until my father found the right kind of gold hair that wouldn't look phony but looked like leslie howard's real hair.
selznick seemed less color-sensitive about rhett and scarlett's daughter bonnie blue butler.
they say that when victor fleming took a good look at me, he said:
"well, first they give me a british scarlett then they give me a 40-year-old ashley wilkes and now, by god, i've got a brown-eyed bonnie blue butler. "
and selznick said that if they just dressed me in blue and lit me a certain way nobody would notice that i didn't have blue eyes.
her undoing was the color of the walls in this brief scene.
she felt the actors ' costumes wouldn 't stand out enough.
he wanted to get away from her so he sent her here, and she became color consultant here.
and she was renowned for these ghastly hats she used to wear.
so-called gone with the wind experts say colors in the second half of the film are brighter due to the absence of natalie kalmus.
but that discounts the overriding vision of art director william cameron menzies who used color to set the mood and tone of each scene.
he later wrote, "when unpleasant colors were required to enhance the drama they were used.
the changing colors of daylight were studied more than ever before. "
to dr. herbert t. kalmus, president of technicolor a special oscar for color development.
the father of technicolor, who disdained awards in hollywood actually hired a publicist to keep his name out of the press.
lucille ball walked in and out of 30 black-and-white films before technicolor showcased her new red hair whipping her career into shape.
carmen miranda 's three black-and-white films bombed at the box office.
in wartime hollywood no studio embraced technicolor more than 20th century fox and no director more than the wildly imaginative busby berkeley.
his finale to the gang's all here shows off technicolor at its psychedelic zenith.
many actors bristled at technicolor's special requirements like standing around while the lily was brought in to balance the camera.
i many times thought, "what is lana turner doing right now while i'm holding this damn lily?"
not everyone who excelled in black and white considered color a step backward.
clarence brown, who directed crawford and garbo in some of their finest work and charles rosher, who shot mary pickford's biggest films...
director brown, wanting to depict a real family's fight for survival in the florida wilderness, decided no actor would wear makeup.
cameraman rosher later said, "i had an inkling of the difficulty involved but i had always wanted to show skin color and texture as they really are. "
gregory peck's ruddy complexion was treated with ice to hold the redness down.
and jane wyman, who had very fair skin spent 1 5 minutes each day under a sun lamp to achieve a believable outdoors look.
black-and-white veterans clarence brown and charles rosher knew what they were doing.
the yearling won a 1946 academy award for best color cinematography.
shooting in africa with a lumbering three-strip camera was compounded by one brave actress suffering from dysentery.
she had a bucket by the side, just out of shot.
which even technicolor would have a job with at that time.
john huston had a talent for painting and a passion for art.
when john arranged a test screening for technicolor executives they became outraged.
and he turned to me and he said, "what do you think, os?"
so i said, "well, john, i think we're doing the right sort of thing. "
he said, "so do i. " so he said, "gentlemen, f* *k you. "
the people who make the pictures the more they understand about the power of the technicolor system the more they can get what they want, the more expressive they can be.
perhaps no one understood the interplay of shadow and light color and movement better than director and painter, vincente minnelli.
anything to do with what he planned to do, you see.
of course, you notice right away, a difference in the lighting.
beginning in the war years, the archers under director michael powell and producer emeric pressburger engaged in what martin scorsese called:
"the most subversive period of filmmaking at a major studio in history. "
he would much more trust a cameraman than he would an outsider like natalie kalmus who i think he was pretty strict with and threw off the set at one point because he felt they knew better than she did.
jack cardiff, who cut his teeth shooting technicolor travelogues had a renegade spirit that complimented powell's surreal style.
i had a silly idea, if you like that when they're playing table tennis, and it's a bizarre, magic atmosphere i said to michael, "suppose instead of using the real-looking amber sun i use the lemon sun to make it sort of slightly weird?"
he said, "do it, do it. " immediately, never questioned it.
they called it the "enchanted cottage" because it was so big.
but the things they did with it, in a matter of life and death for example, all those incredible shots of the ceiling of the hospital as david niven is being wheeled in.
in this scene, kim hunter gets david niven back when the spirits see she's willing to ascend the stairway to heaven so her lover may live.
in order to get that shot, he had to light it in such a way that as i was running down the stairs to david the lights were so bright, there was at one point i couldn't see the stairs at all and i missed the last 1 0 or 1 5 of them.
the black narcissus tells the story of nuns trying to establish a convent in india.
jack cardiff created his vision entirely on a sound stage in england.
he wrote, "to enhance the dream-like strangeness and sensuous beauty i exaggerated my effects.
in the dawn sequence where sister ruth goes mad i used soft greens in the shadows because the juxtaposition of green and red is suggestive of tragedy.
everybody figured out that it's just that english skies are always covered with fog and rain so the light is diffused.
and it was simple diffusion of light, which all cameramen now use.
but it was really the atmosphere in england that was creating this different look to the colors.
for the ballet sequence in the red shoes jack cardiff invented a device which could change camera speeds in the middle of a shot, allowing a magical sense of weightlessness.
natalie kalmus called the red shoes the best color film she'd ever seen.
seven thousand miles away her ex-husband and technicolor founder felt the same way.
natalie kalmus received more credits than perhaps anyone in film history.
and it is her name that is most identified with technicolor.
divorced since 192 1, natalie spent 30 years appealing demanding a bigger piece of the technicolor pie.
in the formative years of the company, natalie kalmus contributed mightily to the aesthetic use of color holding her own in a male-dominated world.
but by the late '30s, art directors found her taste old-fashioned and manner inflexible.
although her credit appeared on virtually all technicolor films until 1948 her dictates went unheeded.
but in the beginning, some found the quality of color inferior.
every color that we put on lips came out sort of a liver color.
the competition posed by television forced the movie industry to invent new ways to maintain its audience.
because television was black-and-white the push for all-color films seemed a smart move.
then dr. kalmus told me one day, even after that he came to my office and said he was sorry he let it happen.
that even at his age he would like to have stayed on and contributed more.
dr. herbert kalmus died on july 1 1, 1963 at the age of 8 1.
twelve years later, technicolor management phased out the dye-transfer process he perfected and some say, has never been equaled.
in response to scorsese, eastman kodak said it had the technology to prevent color film from fading.
but hollywood didn 't see the value in paying for it.
that attitude changed with the industry boom of the '90s when thriving cable and home video markets made studio libraries and their preservation good business.
archivists couldn 't help but notice that technicolor prints showed little signs of age.
i'm astounded how anything can live since 1 944 that went into a can and sat on a shelf in as perfect mint condition that that is.
in 1994, technicolor announced its plan to return to an updated version of the dye-transfer process created by dr. kalmus.
four years later the company showcased the new process with fresh prints of a technicolor classic.
if you believe in quality, then i believe you have to go the way of film.

while she's here, let's pretend that the real world is run by responsible adults.
i'd rather not shatter her hopes and dreams until after she graduates.
i have pointy elbows, and i am not afraid to use them.
what makes you so sure she could even be a model?
when i forced their last trump and you laid down that run of clubs...
and how about when you gave me that look and i played that king of hearts?
no, i just thought of a way to double my income.
dennis, could you find out from nasa what they do with their old space shuttles?
you know, if i really wanted to hit you, i would have.
well, when you want to, i'll be right here, asleep in the dark,
i just feel like i want to do things with you, not just talk about stuff.
well, cory, i don't do things with eric because i don't want to do them with you.
dad just doesn't look at you as as much of an action-adventure guy as he looks at me, cor.
but it takes real guts just to get up here in the first place.
i would have the pride to wash it myself, you hoity-toity, stuck-up, middle-class snot!
just 'cause you want to live like a pig doesn't mean i have to.
well, on the way to getting there, we got two boys.
two complete boys that want a complete relationship with their dad, and now they are calling you on it.
well, i wanted to do something with you that i've done on occasion with cory.
i came here with my school once, and i really liked it, so i told dad about it, and we've been here a couple times.
my interpretation is that the artist is illustrating a very painful situation, where the father monkey has two sons, but only one coconut,
so he splits the coconut in half, but only a half a coconut isn't enough for either son.
fear not, fair viewers, for there is a man, a man of science a forward-thinking man, who looks back to a sweeter time when there was spice to life, and everything was...nice.
i must profess, sir this man holds the ingredients to townsville's salvation!
well, your powers are very special and unique and although we have a lot of fun doing things in the house out in townsville, people don't understand how special you girls are.
and unfortunately, people often get scared or angry when they don't understand something special or unique.
secondly, i'm afraid we won't have any lights or water for a while.
and a broken refrigerator means snack-time is out so let's try to ignore all the workmen and noise and such and get right to work, shall we?
how could you know what it is to be cast out into a world that only offers misery?
how could you know what it's like for people to fear and despise you for the very things that make you special because you don't fit in, because you are a freak?
they do not know it is their saviors they are speaking to.
they are unaware your actions will have helped change their world forever.
i, hota wata, am boiling mad, for you are all wet behind the ears.
so i shall unleash a scalding torrent to drown you out, for i don't give a--
maybe if somebody hadn't insisted on walking home so we could run into the biggest liar in the universe!
we weren't allowed to use our powers, and you know it!
i'm not fighting with you, and i'm not talking to you ever!
well, prepare yourself for a long silence, girl because we're gonna spend the rest of our lives here, thanks to you.
if it wasn't for them, none of this would have happened.
and maybe everyone would like us more if we were just normal little girls.
it wasn't the first time i woke up alone after a night like that.

thus far, they have left no survivors in the wake oftheir seemingly unstoppable wave ofdestruction.
i feel like the victim of the biggest practical joke ever.
isn't our mission to get the genesis list through to the beta site?
i think we'll try to stop the attack on earth first.
we estimate the death toll to earth as 1. 5 billion.
who do you think is flying those ships, trying to blow up our world?
i know i'm an outsider, but what good will that do?
forget that it won't change anything here, what if they have an iris?
if this is the address of the goa'uld world where this attack originated and i can tell my world, maybe i can stop this before it starts there.
what makes you think the goa'ulds will try attacking earth in your universe?
look, because i came here i have seen what can happen.
i have a chance to stop this happening to the earth i come from, ifyou help me.
if we get the stargate open we will retreat through it.
but until then, we must keep them away from the control room and the stargate.

if we get the stargate open we will retreat through it.
but until then, we must keep them away from the control room and the stargate.

colonel, he's the only one who can put our conciseness back into our real bodies.

they walked above the surface, far from here, outside of the range of the power source.
wallas, he was the last one, he gave his life for the station.

it draw heat in from the planetary core, must be vented.
the surface wind drives irradiated acid rain into the ventilation system.
how do we find these vents, how do we open them?
the automatic controls no longer work and the vent are rusted close.
you and i have go a few things to talk about.
i'm not going to give you a hard time about who gets to go back, if thas what you mean.
they have slowly begun systematically annihilating all signs of civilisation, starting on the east coast and moving west with frightening inevitability.
there has been no response to attempted communications with the aliens.
thus far, they have left no survivors in the wake of their seemingly unstoppable wave of destruction.
i feel like the victim of the biggest practical joke ever.
isn't our mission to get the genesis list through to the beta site?
i think we'll try to stop the attack on earth first.
if they fire on us, chances are we won't even feel it.
the blasts on the east coast were equal to 200-megaton nuclear warheads.

as agent hollis has suggested, the scope of this case has expanded considerably.
the two women responsible for the plane crash were in recent contact with the woman now hospitalised due to a gas explosion at home.
what we first learned about advanced soviet weapons - typhoon subs, t72 tanks, microwave installations -
all of it was foreseen right here in one of these rooms.
see, i'm the investigator in charge, so you don't flit off without telling me about it.
and when i say mcclaren is looking for you, you sprint toward his office.
i drove her home from the fillmore one night... when she passed out.
finkelstein, ifiyou're so all-fiired cool about this salazar guy... why don't you come on down to the opening?
- as you do know, it is raining. [ chuckles ]
uh, anditseems that the rain... is gathering inside inverted cone no. 8... um, which is acting effectively as a funnel... um, causing a minor flooding condition...
the old ones, the veterans they would've called for support, just in case.
speaking of the old ones why don't we have riley and his crew put up the monitoring unit?
well he didn't say the word "growl." he said, "a throat noise."
but i asked him to imitate it, and it sounded like a growl to me.
at night, they'll go back and pound that place with mortars, rockets, cannons everything we got from a safe distance.
it ain't fancy but it will sure take care of your hostile military force.

let's see if there are others like you then to remove.
want to know what i did and has a formidable opponent?
to be high at home, as in the old times, accompanied by cultivated and intelligent friends, is one thing.
but destroying your body in the middle of the street, is something different.
today i must meet people that don't exist beyond my memory.
i think this last sunday of july is a very appropriate day to find people who don't exist beyond memory.
they sell all kinds of stuff, loads of clothes, even on sunday.
but i don't know how to get to the cemetery of pleasures.
an imitation costs a thousand escudos, an authentic one is a thousand and one hundred.
so what's the difference between a false one and an authentic one?
if you want a real lacoste, buy a false one first.
then you buy the crocodile and stick it on, so you have a real one.
for a hundred escudos i give you four crocodiles because they always come unstuck.
for another five hundred i'll tell you why you're sweating that way.
this day waits for you and you can't escape from your destiny.
it'll be a day of tribulations, a day of purification and then, you'll be in peace.
that bill you gave me the day of your death, at the hospital.
you had tubes everywhere and death on your face, you'd made an incredible effort can you remember what you wrote?
cut the pork into regular pieces and season it with garlic, salt, pepper, wine, cumin and leave it macerate.
next day put it in a clay pot, cut into pieces the fat around the intestines, then let it melt over a low flame
then brown the kidneys over high heat and let it cook.
when it's nearly made, baste the meat in the marinade and let it evaporate.
while you cut the intestines and liver and toss them in oil
chop the kidneys, season with salt and oil and add it to the clay pot.
of course not, i just wanted to show you my identity card.
pleased to meet you, but i've got to go to the bathroom.
i want to know how my life is going to end.
today's sunday, july 30th, 1932, and you are in the present.
they've got you in resusitation for fifteen days and you manage to survive.
during all that time the illustrious director of the clinic, who had operated on you, won't come around asking about you anymore
a surgeon friend reconstructs your pierced oesophagus and you live for three more years.
you can't speak, we communicate by writing, on one of those kids' magic boards, i refuse to talk as well.
i want you to know, son, that it wasn't because of me that i came to this room.
it's been you who called me, you wanted to dream with me.
and besides, there are the women's singing, those from the tapestry weavers, or from the swingers or the harvest songs.
in the alentejo, it is the women who collect the harvest.
it can never be suggested the way things may happen in the future,
you run the risk of making it happen exactly like that.
i was writing, and wondered why i did it, my story didn't have a resolution.
i couldn't imagine my life would finally end up by being like...
let's say i'd like to know what are your intentions towards me.
listen, i've spent my life making hypothesis about you, and i'm already tired.
taking into account all the problems we already have, i'm sure we need that drink.
i'd like to drink to the "saudosismo" the poetic movement about nostalgia.
i wanted to show my son, ivan, his grandparents house really quick.
look, here's where your grandpa... would mark how fast we grew.
my dad also died... killed by a cannon when jogging on santa lucia.
after that, some lady found me... she wore black boots, like my sneakers.
he acts like a left winger and does what he wants.
all kids like to have their own way... that doesn't make them communists, left wingers hippies or liberals!
you also said... you'd take care of all our mistress' debts.
master hong... how can you blame our mistress for being upset?
master tang, i've been with master wang for 2 1/2 years... and what you see in this room is all that he's ever given me.
he's been calling on jasmin for only ten days... and she already has an entire new wardrobe.
she said we could marry if i paid all her debts.
so i paid them... and then she said her parents didn't approve of the match.
if you don't like it... go somewhere that you can be happy!
i'm being patient with you, and you're so rude to me.
frankly, what i want is the business she brings... not her person.
if i don't let her go, she'll be in no mood for business.
i wouldn't want to criticize her, but... as you know, emerald is a mischievous girl.
in this business, i buy in girls when they are seven or eight.
master luo, even if you paid me $3,000... it would balance only one year's earnings.
and she could still earn a lot as a flower girl.
if you don't ask for too much, i'll make it worth your while.
we can be partners, and both of us can do well.
our advice would be... to work hard, not create scenes like that one!
i think that what jade did... was half because of young master zhu... and half aimed at treasure!
you also said... you'd take care of all our mistress' debts.
master hong... how can you blame our mistress for being upset?
master tang, i've been with master wang for 21/2 years... and what you see in this room is all that he's ever given me.

she gets a few bookings and she's so full of herself.

you and crimson have been together for 3 or 4 years now.
what can i tell you about her that you don't know?

it's twice as big as the wickston museum of natural history.
elliott, i'd like you to meet herb stanton, our new managing editor.
janet, i have something to tell you, and you're not going to like it.
this is very scary for me to say, and please, please don't be mad.

i don't mean to second-guess, alan, but if we don't let her give some statement, doesn't that automatically make her suspicious?
jerry, she can't remember what she was doing for two hours prior to calling you.
i don't want to be implicated in the murder of that wrinkly old sack.
and i should like a name partner to do my bidding.
i expect to be on the client list and invited to all the office parties.
you and i can dance, shirley, get on with our special friendship.
i'm still the same woman you fell in love with, the same passionate woman.
of course, i'm not looking to steal my daughter's boyfriend, but if you and bethany are really over,
we will waive the remainder of the reading and promptly enter a plea of not guilty.
i would like to point out to the court at this time that my client has no criminal record and she has strong roots in the community and does not pose a flight risk.
moreover, she is under a doctor's care, for which treatment remains essential, not only for her well being, but also to enable her to adequately contribute to her own defense.
i would therefore implore this court to release her on her own recognizance.
denise, you've always struck me as a woman who secretly longs to be debased.
it's an awfully big job, but i feel i'm just the man to... do it.
i just wanted to tell you that what you said to me last night was truly... disgusting.
and i assure you, denise, i'm a man of my word.
though the police seem to be ruling out suicide, there's some evidence your wife... ex-wife was having some depression.
the breakup of our family caused her a lot of pain.
i had a brief thought of that bella, i admit, but my mind always comes back to you.
i don't know if anyone's ever told you this before, lincoln, but you're a pretty weird guy.
in fact, i'm gonna take you to someplace nice, and i'm gonna surprise you with candy and flowers.
shawn, that's great, but i don't care as much about candy and flowers as much as us being together.
you know, this whole valentine's day thing is one big scam.
the greeting card companies, the candy stores all trying to rip off the innocent consumer.
that's an awful lot of candy for somebody who's already so sweet.
one box is from henry, and one box is from jimmy.
i don't want to end up saying things that i don't mean.
and i don't want to end up making a promise that i can't keep.
so you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
right, if i was getting the chair i'd go for something hot and spicy, you know?
well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about the a-team.
so you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
why does it always seem like i'm the only one working at this breakup?
george, i listened to your arguments and they were rambling and flimsy.

now i have an in to strike up a conversation with him.
well, whoever he was, he knew a lot about the a-team.
so you would choose your last meal based on the method of execution?
now, i gotta find a good place to hide this key.
because if somebody finds this, they hold the key to all my possessions.
apparently, i was unable to break up beyond a reasonable doubt.
if only he could have been cheating on his wife, you know.
i-i know we kind of got off to a bad start.
but your bird-- which is lovely, by the way-- made a mess on my door.
you were more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture.
if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
i only wish i had someone who'd given up babies that told me how terrible it is.
it'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.
we want to let you know that there's still no pressure.
if there was something you wanted to say, we'll be right there.

so however hard it is for you to give up this puppy it'd be a million times harder to give up a child.
i don't know about your jackets and separate tables but ross is my friend.
and if i save him a seat, he will sit in it.
yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl.
so we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.
they give you all the information, it's uh, it's like memorizing a script.
"and on your left, you have tyrannosaurus rex, a carnivore from the jurassic period.
i'm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.
you're gonna carry their child and get them a sony play station?
pheebs, you're talking about putting your body through an awful lot,
i mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and it's all for somebody else!
y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture.
no, pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work.
(that is old "putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your mouth trick.")
well, because you'd be giving up a baby, and i-i really don't?
i don't know if there's anything i can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby.
y'know, i realise i don't have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, uhh...
phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, it's very important.
i gave up two babies, and i only wish i had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies.
i just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life.
maybe it's crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now.
see that scientist with the glasses, he and i used to play together all the time in grade school, but now...
thank you, dr. phillips, but i'm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle.
i'm having lunch right here, with my good friend joey, if he'll sit with me.
now, i look around this cafeteria, and y'know what i see, i see-i see division.
division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and i ask myself, "my god why?
you were more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture.
if you decide to do this, we'll be supportive like crazy.
it'd be something you'd regret every day for the rest of your life.

we could pay someone but we don't have that kind of money.
plus, you know, you're family and, you know i just don't want my baby to grow into some chick i don't know, you know?
and we were wondering if you could give us a ride down to the train station.
well, actually, we kind of need an answer to that one right now.
you were more supportive when i wanted to make denim furniture.

okay, rach, when was the last time you had lunch with the shipping clerks?
i've never had lunch with the shipping clerks but it's totally different.
now, i want you to know it took a tour guide to show this scientist the error of his ways.
you might even say he took me on a tour of myself.
we want to let you know that there's still no pressure.

well, the food for next week is supposed to be delivered today.
could you stop by and unload it, put it in the back for me?
hey, half the reason people come to a banquet is the entertainment.
i learned this when i was eight years old from a court jester.
before the man became legend, before the legend became myth, came the greatest adventure of all.
i mean, what's hercules doing, running a place like this, anyway?
hmm, this much money, you could corrupt a village of mortals.
it's a shame to waste it on the crowd that silenus runs with.
it's almost a shame to waste food like this on silenus, don't you think?
i mean, look at this, an apple like this usually ends up as an offering at some temple, you know?
maybe we could bring a herd of them into the inn.
hercules won't sell the food, now that he knows it belongs to artemis.
i think that's what i'm going to remember most about this war - looking through casualty reports.
sometimes it feels like that's all i do - stare at the names of the dead.
get me out of this vole-hole and all i'll do is take it easy!
according to starfleet regulations, we're supposed to be rotated off the front lines after 90 days.
they're a wonderful, friendly people as long as their bellies are full and their holosuites are working.
but take away their creature comforts, deprive them of food, sleep, sonic showers, put their lives in jeopardy over an extended period, and those same friendly, intelligent, wonderful people... will become as nasty and as violent... as the most bloodthirsty klingon.
i'm sending you, larkin and reese out on a scouting patrol.
i need to know how many jem'hadar are out there, where they're camped, what weapons they have.
if you really cared about nog you would never have sent him out on that patrol.

so is red still thinking about giving you the car maybe?
even if we do get it, we're gonna need some serious gas money... 'cause the cruiser's a boat.
like, there's this guy who invented this car that runs on water, man.
it's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine, and it runs on water.
since i've been cut back to part-time at the plant... and the hospital is so close...
i can take the toyota to work, and your mom can take the bus.
when i ride the bus in my nurse's uniform, people always show me their scars.
then i'll drop you off on my way to the plant.
you know, it's amazing what one act of civil disobedience... can do for you.
i mean, there's a whole world that's waiting to be driven to.
we'll trade you our battery, plus $5 for one of your batteries.
that's a really sweet deal, my friend, but how about this?

welcome to our live show from theater 10 for the last night of the year...
we're here together to celebrate these last hours of the last night of the year.
but that night, that sonofabitch mario started buggin' me 'bout these stuffed olives from ascoli.
ya gotta eat 'em because this, because that, gotta eat 'em because here...
no, they drug him, so he'll need drugs, and he'll look for it in luggage.
the first part of the story is all about his training.
and then how he sinks into total addiction, when he's at the ciampino airport, trying to catch drug dealers.
i won't tell you everything that happens next, but at a certain point, when he's become hooked on heroine, he decides to run off, and regain his freedom.
this munificent space is provisioning us with wide and ranging refreshments, satisf ying all of us here, and we know it's a specialty place, a verificable space, one that is severely right!
i give a thank to the coach of all coaches the true innate son,
i recs es magnificent í you stay migraço of the killer whales.
could you do what the with a chamber mounted on a boat or a submers í level?
you know, you can go looking the white shark that both speak.
do you have any idea how much worth one of those jaw?
you know, for we have a goal where direct life, in are men.
the goal of the chase is so strong for him, like any other man.
now, i can be the expert in shark s, but this seems to me even the tooth a shark.
chase, it is said by the í you knew and the shark until it was labeled.
then up the torso, over my head, down over my hair resting again on my butt.
he'd usually end with a squint and purse of the lips.
i decided to sue, not for me, but to stop him from harming others.
t o think that other women could be objectified, and to know...
i suspect your friends are telling you to play it safe, so do that, if it works for you.
three years of law school, five in practice, all to end up a ball girl.
they'd go up my legs pause at my calves, then to my butt, again a pause.
then up the torso, over my head, down over my hair resting again on my butt.
i don't mean to offend but could your work attire be construed as provocative?
i dress modern, but not to incur the vile thoughts your client has.
if you think i'm a person who'd be swept up by an attractive package why would you be interested?
i suspect your friends are telling you to play it safe, so do that, if it works for you.
love to, babe... but unlike you gods lounging about up here...
i regrettably have a full-time gig... that you, by the way, so charitably bestowed on me, zeus.
i dreamed i was gonna train the greatest hero there ever was.
so great, the gods would hang a picture of him in the stars... all across the sky... and people would say, "that's phil's boy."
i thought you were gonna persuade the river guardian to join my team... for the uprising, and here i am, kind of river guardian-less.
i gave it my best shot, but he made me an offer i had to refuse.
which is exactly why i got a feelin'... you're gonna leap at my new offer.
you give me the key to bringing down wonder breath... and i give you the thing that you crave most... in the entire cosmos:
baby, we're not buyin' hon, we saw you hit the ceilin'
face it like a grown up when you gonna own up that you
you were willing to give your life to rescue this young woman.
for a true hero isn't measured by the size of his strength... but by the strength of his heart.
ooh, i'd like to make some sweet music with him- # [muses humming]
- our story actually begins... long before hercules, many aeons ago.
- # locked those suckers in a vault # - # they're trapped #
# and on his own stopped chaos in its tracks #
- # ah, ah # - # oh, yeah, yeah #
- # ah, ah # - # hey, hey, hey #
but my the time they found the baby, it was too late.
- # young herc was mortal now # - [ chorus ] # mmm #
- # but zeus andhera wept # - # ooh, ooh, ooh #
- # because their son could never come home # - # ooh #
now, there was a guy who had it all-- the build, the footspeed.
he could jab, he could take a hit, he could keep on comin'.
[ sighs ] at least i beat him, didn't i ?
next time, don't let your guard down because ofa pair of big goo-goo eyes !
- [ grunts ] along with all those rippling pectorals ?
[ shy chuckle ] uh, i'm, um, uh- [ stammering ]

that's good because that's what got you into this jam in the first place.
you sold your soul to me to save your boyfriend's life.

take no unnecessary risks, profits do me no good in a six-by-six cell
i've done my own risk-assessment here, and i'm passing on this deal
okay, but if i let you live today, it's gonna be my ass
so only one of us is walking out of here today... sweet thing
my old paflnefis gonna join this pafly, affer clearing up a couple things
we ran some bigtime cons in china when we've told just to start in hong kong
get this job cleaning lady, you must have college degree and know how to speak chinese, ok?
this is the czech republic, why do we need speak chinese?
visitors punch in and out at the main entrance but for employees, here's where we do it
when the guards rush out, janick and i run our con
and mandy's at the castle waiting for karloff to show up for pay day
security office is on the second floor it controls the alarm system for the entire building so they tell us when to clean it
we heard from our buyer, we meet tuesday the observatory near poland and make ourselves a 300% profit
plus, we start a beautiful friendship, with a one super rich camel jockey
we found out what happened some bees got in and triggered the alarm
bees ain't our god damn problem see you guys in about 2001.
now all of a sudden you're back, with a bunch of rowdy strangers
mellow orit, mom, we'll be here only for a couple of days
damn right we got five units in progress to the main streel robbew
duking-it-out right on our front porch, geez, what a bunch of boneheads
but then he found somebody willing to pay 4.5 million u.s.
now who can come up with that kind of cash on short notice?
-knock on doors and ask if anybody saw a car driving away from the scene.
the media only need to know that it was a false bomb threat.
if the child was alive then how do we apportion guilt?
the guilty party is the one who put the baby in the case.
it is a red suitcase outside the south side police station.
it contains five kilograms of tnt with a timer trigger set to detonate the bomb at 09:30.
-popular, cool nightlife, moving easily among the city's hot spots, etc..
why would he put a child in a bag outside a police station?
-... did you threaten anita, did you say she'd begged for it.
you took a suitcase with you out onto saltsjöbanan and then came back here.
i think we just got a look at the top brass.
i say we take them out now and save ourselves a headache later.
i was asleep in bed one night and this bright light shined in through my window.
next thing i know, i was being dragged out in this crazy spaceship.
i figured i'd get probed and i'd wind up on the "jerry springer show. "
but instead, it's alien safari time and i'm the endangered species.
they slapped tattoos on our arms, gave us each a piece and cut us loose.
if we can survive 20 days, then we can go home.
for 10 generations, the elites have been the pride of the dynasty.
it sickens me to think that their ranks are sullied by your human blood.
the first week i was here, they caught this surfer kid from san diego, tim.
they shot him in the leg and they nailed him to a billboard.
it's possible that he is an infiltrator, and there may be more.
anyone who captures a live unmarked human will be rewarded with two kills.
if i could cut the human part from my body like a tumor, i would.
just because it's a part of us doesn't mean we have to embrace it.
is it true that i've never known the pleasure of being liked for myself?
i hope you believe i like you for yourself, my lady.
tell philip i fear neither him, nor his priests, nor his armies.
tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we're ready to give him such a bite, he'll wish he'd kept his hands in his pockets.
you see a leaf fall and you think you know which way the wind blows.
well, there is a wind coming, madam, that will sweep away your pride.
philip of spain is a god-fearing man who cannot declare war without a just cause.
i intercepted every letter mary stuart secretly dispatched, but failed to see that spain knew i was reading them.
and philip's friend, the duke of parma, has 1 5,000 men on the french coast.
they plan to cross the channel in barges and sail into the thames.
the forces that shape our world are greater than all of us, majesty.
how can i promise that they'll conspire in your favor, even though you are the queen?
the cords of hell have encompassed me about and the snares of death have overtaken me !
the cords of hell have encompassed me about and the snares of death have overtaken me !
we must also thank his majesty for this event which is nothing short of a miracle.
what news, my lords, of the rebellion against our authority ?
sir thomas wyatt and the other leaders are already dealt with.
if they had succeeded, these protestants and heretics meant to place your sister upon the throne.
madam, if there is some small truth in these charges, however innocently or unknowingly you did proceed, you had best confess.
i ask you why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion.
there is so little beauty in this world, and so much suffering.
do you suppose that is what god had in mind ?
that is to say, if there is a god at all.
perhaps there is nothing in this universe but ourselves and our thoughts.
the navy is run-down, there is no standing army, and no munitions.
there is not a fortress that could withstand a single shot.
here at home there are those who wish your majesty ill.
mary of scots has already laid claim to your throne, and norfolk...
now it appears you do not have the stomach for it.
i am in agreement, your grace, ifyour majesty's throne is at risk.
i say a prince should rather be slow to take action and should watch that he does not come to be afraid of his own shadow.
you are not, sir francis, a member of council, nor are you in the majority.
send him back to his queen and make sure he remains alive.
tell that bastard queen not to send children to fight mary of guise !
the bishops will pass no measure which severs us from rome.
your majesty would improve all these matters if you would agree to marry.
so i'm not sure how best to please you unless i married one of each.
now your majesty does make fun of the sanctity of marriage.
your graces must forgive me, but you are now free to go.
i am sure this infernal work has not saved your bastard queen.
on a night such as this could a queen say no ?
does not a queen sit under the same stars as any other woman ?
perhaps he does not know enough english to perform the ceremony !
alas, madam, in this matter i can be of no help to you.
is it not enough that english pirates attack and rob our ships but we are to be made fools of in this court.
the king, my master, has become impatient for your grace to act.
it deprives elizabeth, pretended queen of england, servant of wickedness, of her throne, and declares that her subjects are absolved of their allegiance to her.
his holiness also decrees that any man who should undertake her assassination will be welcomed by angels into the kingdom of heaven.
i have followed your advice in all the affairs of my kingdom, but your policies would make england nothing but part of france or spain.
from this moment i am going to follow my own opinion.
from his holiness the pope to his grace the duke of norfolk.
"to legitimise your claim to the throne of england, his holiness proposes
"your grace should take as your bride mary, queen of scots, and overthrow elizabeth..."
the illegitimate and heretical whore who now sits upon the throne.
all men need something greater than themselves to look up to and worship.
they must be able to touch the divine here on earth.
the catholics' greatest fear is the succession of mary's protestant halfsister
e l i z a b e t h and so shall be saved from mine enemies!
the cords of hell have encompassed me about and the snares of death have overtaken me!
in my tribulation i call to the lord and cry to my god and he heard my voice cry out his temple...!
by order of their gracious majesties, queen mary and king philip, we are come to witness the burning of these protestant heretics who have denied the authority of the one true catholic church and of his holiness the pope.
let them burn for all eternity in the flames of hell.
you are accused of conspiring with sir thomas wyatt against her sovereign majesty and are arrested for treason.
i am commanded to take you hence from this place... to the tower.
when i am gone, you will do everything in your power to uphold the catholic faith.
do not take away from the people the consolations of the blessed virgin.
yes, and have made plans to massacre every catholic in england.
there would be butchery indeed if such a plan were even conceivable.
but these are most uncertain times and your life remains in danger.
you must therefore say nothing and meet no-one whose visit may compromise you.
lord robert, you were appointed to the council to protect england's interests.
now it appears you do not have the stomach for it.
for the love of god, madam, let not the care of your diseased estate hang in the balance any longer.
in marriage, and in the production of an heir, lies your only surety.
the bishops will pass no measure which severs us from rome.
your majesty would improve all these matters if you would agree to marry.
so i'm not sure how best to please you unless i married one of each.
now your majesty does make fun of the sanctity of marriage.
i would know on what authority you have kept us locked up here.
your graces must forgive me, but you are now free to go.
on a night such as this could any woman say no?
on a night such as this could a queen say no?
his holiness also decrees that any man who should undertake her assassination will be welcomed by angels into the kingdom of heaven.
give these letters of blessing and hope to our friends in england.
i have followed your advice in all the affairs of my kingdom, but your policies would make england nothing but part of france or spain.

yes, and have made plans to massacre every catholic in england.
there would be butchery indeed if such a plan were even conceivable.
but these are most uncertain times and your life remains in danger.
you must therefore say nothing and meet no-one whose visit may compromise you.
lord robert, you were appointed to the council to protect england's interests.
now it appears you do not have the stomach for it.
for the love of god, madam, let not the care of your diseased estate hang in the balance any longer.
in marriage, and in the production of an heir, lies your only surety.
the bishops will pass no measure which severs us from rome.
your majesty would improve all these matters if you would agree to marry.
so i'm not sure how best to please you unless i married one of each.
now your majesty does make fun of the sanctity of marriage.
i would know on what authority you have kept us locked up here.
your graces must forgive me, but you are now free to go.
on a night such as this could any woman say no?
on a night such as this could a queen say no?
his holiness also decrees that any man who should undertake her assassination will be welcomed by angels into the kingdom of heaven.
give these letters of blessing and hope to our friends in england.
i have followed your advice in all the affairs of my kingdom, but your policies would make england nothing but part of france or spain.
from this moment i am going to follow my own opinion.
from his holiness the pope to his grace the duke of norfolk.
"to legitimise your claim to the throne of england, his holiness proposes
"your grace should take as your bride mary, queen of scots, and overthrow elizabeth..."
the illegitimate and heretical whore who now sits upon the throne.
all men need something greater than themselves to look up to and worship.
they must be able to touch the divine here on earth.
by order of their gracious majesties, queen mary and king philip, we are come to witness the burning of these protestant heretics, who have denied the authority of the one, true catholic church and of his holiness, the pope.
let them burn for all eternity in the flames of hell.
sir thomas wyatt and the other leaders are already dealt with.
but if they had succeeded, these protestants and heretics meant to place your sister upon the throne.
you are accused of conspiring with sir thomas wyatt and others against her sovereign majesty and are arrested for treason.
i am commanded to take you hence from this place to the tower.
madam, if there is some small truth in these charges, however innocently or unknowingly you did proceed, you had best confess.
i ask you why we must tear ourselves apart for this small question of religion,
that is to say, if there is a god at all.
perhaps there is nothing in this universe but ourselves and our thoughts.
many of our friends are, even now, returning from exile, but...
these are most uncertain times and your life remains in danger.
lord robert, you were appointed to the council to protect the interests of england.
now it appears you do not have the stomach for it.
for the love of god, ma'am, let not the care of your diseased estate hang in the balance any longer.
in marriage and in the production of an heir lies your only surety.
so i'm not sure how best to please you unless i married one of each.
now your majesty does make fun of the sanctity of marriage.
your graces must forgive me, but you're now free to go.
i am sure this infernal work has not saved your bastard queen.
i will ask for guidance in this matter, but do not despair.
was it not truly said that the righteous shall inherit the earth?
on a night such as this, could a queen say no?
does not a queen sit under the same stars as any other woman?
the duke cannot love me so much if he demands my answer so precipitously.
perhaps her majesty will not answer because her heart is already set upon another.
it deprives elizabeth, the pretended queen of england, servant of wickedness, of her throne, and declares that henceforth her subjects are absolved of their allegiance to her.
his holiness also decrees that any man who should undertake her assassination will be welcomed by angels into the kingdom of heaven.
because i love you, and though you will not see me, i am the only one who would care for you.
you love me so much, you would have me be your whore?
sir thomas wyatt and the other leaders are already dealt with.

do not take away from the people the consolations of the blessed virgin, their holy mother.
these are most uncertain times and your life remains in danger.
you must therefore say nothing and meet no one whose visit may compromise you.
your majesty should know that you have inherited a most powerless and degenerate state.
it's threatened from abroad by the ambitions of france and spain and is weaker in strength, in men, moneys, and riches than i have ever known it.
the navy is run down, there is no standing army, and we are bare of munitions.
there isn't a fortress left in england that could withstand a single shot.

if you would be prepared in secret to renounce heresy and embrace the true faith, then you might find many new and powerful friends, and keep your queen.
you are most mistaken, monsignor, if you think i might so easily be persuaded to act against my conscience and my love.
the duke cannot love me so much if he demands my answer so precipitously.
perhaps her majesty will not answer because her heart is already set upon another.
have not i suffered enough already, for loving her and showing it?
i envy you, my lord, to love a woman so deeply.

there is not a fortress that could withstand a single shot.
here at home there are those who wish your majesty ill.
mary of scots has already laid claim to your throne and norfolk...
now it appears you do not have the stomach for it.
i am in agreement, your grace if your majesty's throne is at risk.
i say a prince should rather be slow to take action and should watch that he does not come to be afraid of his own shadow.
you are not, sir francis, a member of council nor are you in the majority.
send him back to his queen and make sure he remains alive.
tell that bastard queen not to send children to fight mary of guise!

a prince should never flinch from being blamed for acts of ruthlessness which are necessary for safeguarding the state and their own person.
you must take these things so much to heart that you do not fear to strike even the very nearest that you have if they be implicated.
from his holiness the pope to his grace the duke of norfolk.

i am your queen and, like my father, i mean to rule.
there is one thing higher than royalty, my lords, and that is religion.
the truth be, my lords, your votes are nothing without my consent.
if there is no uniformity of religious belief here, then there can only be fragmentation,
for some say france, and others spain, and some cannot abide foreigners at all.
so i'm not sure how best to please you unless i married one of each.
now your majesty does make fun of the sanctity of marriage.
i do not think you should lecture me on that, my lord, since you yourself have been twice divorced and are now upon your third wife.
i would know on what authority you have kept us locked up here.
your graces must forgive me, but you're now free to go.
on a night such as this, could any woman say no?
on a night such as this, could a queen say no?
or perhaps he does not know enough english to perform the ceremony.

what news, my lords, of the rebellion against our authority ?

it would be a mistake to insult elizabeth t aylor in my courtroom.
i' m sorry, your honor, but i' m on trial here.
if cruelty is the issue, that brings us back to the cow and the pig.
you don't seem to be too sympathetic on this at all.
if people don't want to eat it, they shouldn't order it.
but i shouldn't be hauled into a courtroom for serving it.
the idea that a radio personality can be sued for sexual harassment by someone he's never met--
i must say, ms. porter, your client does not work for harold wick.
keep in mind that this is just one state court ruling and it'll be appealed.
anyone suing rush limbaugh would be hard pressed to prove that people....
we're not expected to rise to some level of decency when it comes to livestock.
we' re not expected to have feelings for them and why should we?
in this country, we have another credo which is innate to us all.
as long as folks keep consuming it, don't blame the guy who serves it up.
it appears that certain physical or psychological dysfunctions may be the root of mr. wick's compulsion to fixate on sexual content.
i feel it would be wrong for me to exploit any of his medical inadequacies or conditions.
but as long as we have you, i know we'll keep what we have.
that might be the best thing anyone's ever said to me.
i' m sorry, your honor, but i' m on trial here.
i' m using my money to defend against a suit based on hypocrisy.
you don't seem to be too sympathetic on this at all.
if people don't want to eat it, they shouldn't order it.
how does he contribute to any discrimination that goes on there?
t obacco companies had no duty to people who didn't use their products.
but if it results in discrimination or a hostile work environment, he should be held accountable.
how would you prove that what he says on the radio affects what the men think and say at that plant?
well, listen, truth be told, i don 't really know what was said in there.
the other attorney did most of the talking and she was just so yummy.
as long as folks keep consuming it, don't blame the guy who serves it up.
plaintiff's counsel says we should allow the horse to keep his dignity in the end.
i feel it would be wrong for me to exploit any of his medical inadequacies or conditions.
in light of this new information i bear no ill will towards mr. wick.
but what everybody doesn't know is how sexy and trashy looking all of the lawyers are.
we're really lucky to have ally mcbeal here for everybody to see.
my ex-wife used to say that having sex with me was like being vaccinated.
that hurts, because i thought it was a great 3 seconds.
the two superpowers watched and waited, preparing for a nuclear holocaust.
the world's safety depended on mutual assured destruction - the treat of mutual suicide that came to be known as m.a.d. -
we started flying parallel to the soviet coastline, which had murmansk and the mouth of the
white sea and so forth up there, and we knew there was quite a bit of activity going on up there by the russians at that time.
when i saw the enemy plane, i identified it, and radioed my base.
the co-pilot said, 'check, check, check, right wing', and the aircraft commander, major palm, said,
american titan missiles, each with a warhead that could destroy moscow, were ready to be launched.
it would be done before we had time to stop and think about what we were doing.
it doesn't take all that long and it was just automatic.
there was no question in our mind that this was the thing to do.
if we had ever received a launch message over the pas system,
i ha... would have had absolutely no doubt that my life expectancy was measured in probably less than a half an hour, and the only question was would we able to launch this missile before the incoming hit us.
the world and actually we were one of their largest stumbling blocks in that effort and therefore we were one of their primary enemies, and their primary target was to take over our country.
they were banging it into our heads and we couldn't have imagined otherwise:
the americans were aggressors who wanted to conquer the whole world, and we had to protect the world.
in 1961, the new american president john kennedy, had taken office in a tense nuclear world.
there was a syndrome to catch up and overtake, to try and show everyone that we weren't far behind the americans, that we too had nuclear weapons.
there were those who said that we can only prevent a nuclear war if we oppose world imperialism with a force of similar strength.
we had to put on special glasses, and pull down curtains to protect us against the radiation.
we'd put on the glasses, but we'd forget to draw the curtains as we wanted to have a peek.
in the west, public opinion was turning against the arms build up, and the testing of the bomb.
in britain, what started in 1958 as a march to the weapons centre at aldermaston, swelled to an annual rally of tens of thousands of campaigners for nuclear disarmament.
we did seriously accept the fact that if a nuclear bomb was used in the london area the effect was going to be so massive over such a geographical area that even people living miles out would have repercussions.
and we were quite serious in our expectations that this could happen.
the scientists have made it, it's there and available, somebody's going to want to use it.
kennedy and his secretary of defense, mcnamara, were increasingly aware of the danger of relying on the strategy of "massive retaliation".
nuclear weapons have no military utility whatsoever, excepting only to deter one's opponent from their use.
which means you should never never never initiate their use against a nuclear-equipped opponent.
and if both sides did that, then the casualties, in the unlikely and very undesirable prospect of a nuclear war, would be less.
this idea of a "no-cities" plan, this striking only against military bases, rocket forces and submarines-
i mean we were scared we said we're on our way.
so we simply ran to that airplane and fired up the ground carts to get get power to the airplane and air to start the engines and we cranked those engines as fast as we could and we would listen for a message
from strategic air command to give us instructions on what type of exercise it was, if it was a practice or if it was the real thing.
you know, you literally swallowed because you didn't know what it was going to be.
it showed just how close to the edge of the nuclear precipice the world was standing.
moscow and washington realized that direct communication between the two capitals must be improved.
never again did it want to confront america from a position of weakness.
lack of nuclear armaments and the weakness of the soviet union came as a shock to the soviet leadership.
mcnamara had concluded that his 'no cities' plan was a dangerous illusion.
war would only be avoided, he now thought, by the threat of mutual suicide.
if you want a stable nuclear world- if that isn't an oxymoron, to rephrase it, to the degree one can achieve a stable nuclear world - it requires that each side be confident that it can deter the other, and that,
that requires that there be a balance and the balance is the understanding that if either side initiates the use of nuclear weapons, the other side will respond with sufficient power to inflict unacceptable damage.
for mad to succeed, each side needed to be able to retaliate, even after it had suffered a surprise attack.
the polaris system to begin with was really a city killer.
it might take some time to get the message to them from a destroyed national headquarters, but at some day the missile warheads would come raining in and they would pay the price.
i don't think that there would have been hesitation on the part of any commanding officer to launch.
first of all to your own side and second to the other side.
always you want to minimize losses on both sides, but first of all yourself:
but you want to win the thing and get it over as soon as possible.
if the first day had involved attacks on cities then it would have been just unbelievably catastrophic:
world war ll killed 50 million people, but it didn't do it in one day.
in 1963, peter watkins, a british film-maker, made a drama documentary to show what a nuclear war would mean.
"whether you're sitting in your desk next to the window, or standing in the elevator shaft, it wouldn't be of any great significance if the bomb were dropped in this area within a radius of 25 miles."
"i assume you're supposed to go to a shelter, but in a city like new york there's not much chance that a person would survive if there was an attack or something...
"in the case of a real attack, nobody would know what to do i'm quite sure."
officially the russians took civil defense more seriously, but the reality was not encouraging.
the leaders were guided by the idea that as there might not be a nuclear war, why spend money which we were so short of?
on the other hand, if there was a war, civil defense would not help.
i remember all this fire in the air and pieces of airplane falling to the ground.
i remember all the neighbors running to the place where the smoke came from.
but the conventional high explosives, used to trigger a nuclear blast, had gone off, scattering radioactive plutonium.
they started doing medical check-ups here in the town with a geiger counter.
the russian military were unconvinced by mcnamara's notion of 'assured destruction'.
they saw it as their first duty to protect their homeland.
it was an umbrella to protect our population against a possible missile strike.
in terms of mad, if you believe in mutual assured destruction, anything that interferes with the... with...
but, now if one side could counter the other's ability to respond, then they had the advantage.
america too, had been developing an abm system, but mcnamara was reluctant to authorize production.
the system was easy to beat, and the sums just didn't add up.
the ratio of cost to the defender, as against the offense, was very unfavorable, in that it would cost say, like, five dollars to the defense to counter every dollar that the offense spent.
the president and the premier had a meeting, and the president started speaking.
he said, "let's come to an agreement, let's each not build such expensive abm systems."
one anti-ballistic missile is enough to shoot down one ballistic missile.
but now imagine that a ballistic missile has 10 separate warheads.
the soviet union realized that unless we stopped the arms race, then the americans, who were financially better off, could out-do the soviet union.
the leadership began to understand that now we had to choose between building socialism and communism,
it was like diving into a swamp with your eyes closed.
there were a lot of doubts and difficulties in organizing these things.
particularly because before going to the talks, the members of the delegation were called up by brezhnev and very seriously warned not to say too much.
he reminded them that the kgb was listening, and the lubianka prison was watching.
negotiations dragged on throughout 1970 and 1971, as each side tried to come to terms with the other's philosophy.
the soviets really had it in their gut, in the marrow of their bone, this... this right, this inherent right of a nation to defend itself and there wasn't really any argument in those days,
early days of a technical nature, of a... of a strategic analytical nature.
it was just the god given- they wouldn't have said god- right of a nation to defend itself.
when we had developed our own ballistic missiles, although we had very few, we realized that it had acted as a counterbalance.
but when we started the talks, we remembered all the kinds of weapons that could reach us.
the living-dead like ghosts, but a heart is still beating which imagines, oozes frustration and puts up with murder, even though i still read the words of a forbidden song which says that what goes up must come down,
that the rope breaks and the cards fall apart, and the shit always falls on this side of scale.
...and in the coordination of policies leading to the single currency.
the main result of the summit is that spain and italy have coordinated their policies as regards nato and the european union.
dad was hanging on to the door, saying it was his house, and he'd paid for it.
he looked at me and said he hadn't hit mom even though she said he had, and showed me the bruise.
a youth died in the capital after being fired on by a police officer.
the youth, a minor, whose initials were r.m.l., was awaiting trial for robbery and drug trafficking.
we started doing this when we were merely grad students sharing leftovers, right?
instead of the powerful academicians sharing leftovers that we are today.
there is an albert here, but he fell off the roof.
we're just squatting in his apartment until the ganja runs out.
it is high time the piercing light of truth cuts through the dim veil of psycho-babble we wade through each week.
i want to see the hands of everyone who comes here not for the yackety-yak of the over-educated and under-sexed, but instead thought "fresh meat".
okay, look at the shoots of hot-ironed curled bangs that cascade tantalizingly down into the eyes.
eyes, by the way, painted with no less care than the sistine chapel.
i swore to myself that i wouldn't go to another one without a date.
that was my resolution, but here i am another year older and no closer to finding anyone.
oh, you know, you're educated and attractive, and i'm gonna keep trevor away from you.
thanks, claire, but i really don't mind helping you with your patient.
you're not really expecting me to go through with this, are you?
well, you can do whatever you want but if the spirit moves you, you know, you definitely have free will.
now, tell me, ms. white, would you rather have your son marrying a woman who excuses herself so that she can freshen up or one who does the same to take a squat?
all right now, let's turn to page forty-two in your text.
as cool and relaxed as you are in a classroom, that's how you got to be with a woman.
easier said then done, in class i know all the lines.
and this was strike three, so as soon as you can find you another place... you're out.
the ayatollah would suck as a roommate, just so you know.
i grew up smaat in a paat of town where smaat got your butt kicked on a near daily basis.
i didn't exactly fit in, got all of thety-five miles away fo' college...
our ten-year reunion was last summer, but we decided it would be too depressing to show up unmarried, childless, and barely employed.
not that we would care, you know, but tongues would wag.
i know that you work lunches at the faculty dining room every day except friday.
yeah, i, uh, i assist at a culinary class on friday.
i know that it's you who loosens the salt shaker on dean wetland's table.
i know that you always wear black a day after a bears loss.
so i guess at no point during you lengthy and intimate conversation did she say to you "jennings, guess what, i'm clairvoyant, so i know all about this party that you're desperate to get a date for, and it's obvious that you
and i like each other, so maybe you should just ask me." did it ever come up, something like that?
uh, listen, they're having last minute call-backs for that "sunset and vaughn" part.
that's all well and good but what a call-back means is that they've seen and liked you once already.
so, we're thinking the game is over, there's no time left on the clock.
here i am this little freshman clarinet player, wandering out onto the field with the rest of the band.
before that play i had only the vaguest idea of what football meant to american culture.
i mean, suddenly there were requests for interviews, marriage proposals from cal fans.
hmm, uh, by the way i was meaning to ask you, uh, all the time you spent with trevor, were you able to come to any determinations regarding his background?
do you know it was trevor who arranged my meeting kate?
illness is-- is more the, uh, accurate word, dr. crawford, but, um, ahem, so do you-- do you think you could help?
i'm sorry claire, in all the excitement i didn't have time to study his dialect.
let me go, siro, and i'll try to forget any of this happened tonight.
nothing's happened yet, but when it does, i sure don't want you to forget it.
you're gonna be a very busy woman going from house to house and shop to shop.
i don't know what's going on... but i'm gonna find out.
if you die in noble combat fighting evil, your soul will reside in a place of greatness.
but dishonoured, killing the innocent, for that you will be sent to netherrealm... where quan chi holds power.
you buy yourself five lottery tickets, and you buy us a six-pack with the change.
no, if i buy beer for a minor, i can get arrested.
so i went up to your liquor cabinet and i took a bottle of whiskey,
and i made shawn drink, because i didn't want to be alone.
now, why don't you stop being so crazy and sit on cory's lap?
mr. hunter, we will discuss your outburst at the end of the class.
by the way, you know, she's getting out of school right about now.
why don't you go across the street from her and cry?
if you won't accept my apology, then i want you to have this $12.
the only thing of value for me, mr. hunter, would be to know that you're all right.
the actual ceremony will take place this saturday at high noon.
before the distribution of your hard-earned diplomas the winner of the capeside pinnacle award ms. josephine potter, will deliver a speech which i am sure will both razzle and dazzle us for many years to come.
how well you do on your final exam will determine if you can graduate.
principal peskin insists that you spend your time studying rather than attend the rehearsal.
no, i was just invoking the hard-earned lessons of my youth.
"avoid eye contact with any and all authority figures at all costs."
yeah, so he has been known to occupy my thoughts on occasion.
seeing him forced to leave his own graduation rehearsal was painful.
i just wanted to go up to him and say something.
what stopped me was knowing that he would resent me for it.
so what do i owe the pleasure of this little visit?
well, mother and i we got into one of our debates tonight.
i need your backpacks, your books, and your cheat sheets on the floor.
as promised this final will cover material from all previous tests.
still as unprepared as the day you started this class, mr. witter?
it's nice to know, though, that in this ever-changing world i can still count on your remarkable consistency.
so right now, what i want to do is just move on and get over you.
the only way for me to do that is to not be around you anymore.
if our strife has caused you pain remember, it also makes you strong.
bessie is strong, and i'm sure she's taking good care of you.
whatever you decide to do with your life i know your future will be luminous.
wherever you decide to go when you leave remember your days in capeside fondly and keep close those who shared your childhood.
did you study for that final you so dramatically walked out on?
i can categorically say that i studied my ass off, sir.
those honour students that turn your stomach they don't need me.
they're gonna forget me as soon as they walk out the door.
that certainly doesn't mean that this is how i want it to end between us.
so hypothetically speaking if i were lucky enough one day to find myself owning a sailboat again and i were to ask the woman that i love to go sailing with me would she?
you know, i gotta tell you it would be an absolute shame for me to let another day like today pass without ever telling you how much i've always looked up to you as my big brother.
or mentioned the fact that i do actually think that one day you will make a girl very happy.
by the way, if i haven't said it enough already thank you for understanding.
well, i'm only too well aware of that man's taste in music.
i stand here before you, aware of the similarities that we share.
i know that you're feeling outside of my incredible stage fright the same things that i'm feeling.
pride and accomplishment, closure and regret and a hopeful outlook on the future.
but i don't think you need me to elaborate on those feelings.
instead l-- l wanted to share something personal and tell you that there are people in my life who are gone now people i miss very much and people who i am haunted by in different ways.
but whether we're separated by death or merely distance i know that they're still with me because i keep them in my heart.
whether you're here with each other now or you're merely in each other's thoughts remember each other on that road ahead.
and i hope that no matter where your travels lead you in this life you'll always take capeside with you.
i'm sure we'll eventually find a way to restore our friendship.
i don't see how you can restore your friendship if you're not speaking.
and i'm sure it's not gonna be on the market very long.
if we tore apart that upstairs room, it would make a great gym.
i want you to look me in the eyes and tell me this is not about sending me to college.
i admit, the money from the house will primarily go towards your tuition.
which is why i've decided to move to la brea park.
okay, run that by me one more time because when you say la brea park, i think a retirement community with bunnies and lawn bowling.
i need a sign. i need someone or something to tell me what to do to show me what's right, because i don't know anymore.
if this guy offers me a chance to go to worthington then i have my answer.
the fact is, i should have applied for a student loan.
just because i wouldn't take money from my parents doesn't mean that i need to burden you with my entire college tuition.
the ceremony where l sit and listen to other people talk for three hours?
before i walk across a field in a cap and gown to pick up a piece of paper, which isn't a real diploma?
and you can't think of one reason why i shouldn't come with you.
something in my gut is telling me that this is our moment.
i think it's high time i pursued a little happiness of my own.
but if it's not guilt, why am i having such a hard time writing this letter?
i can't help but notice that although you're clearly swimming in a vat of guilt over leaving your best friend in the lurch like this you also seem to be just a bit relieved.
as if you're happy to have found something so you don't have to go away to college.
i don't know if you remember the last party that you and i attended but you were kind of a jumble of nerves.
i guess i was kind of hoping that you would need for me to be your saviour again tonight.
and somehow the idea of having you nearby just to know that you're there, well, you know, it scares me less.
so before you start writing sonnets about my big, beautiful heart you should know that i'm not doing this for you.
it would be difficult to find a place as nice as la brea park.
well, even if i could find a suitable home, what would i do in boston?
as much as i want not to care and as much as i wish i could let it roll off of my back, i can't.
when we were at that party together last night, jo, i was jealous.
because they're gonna get to be with you and i'm not.
you know, i was so certain that kubelik's offer was gonna be the answer to all of our problems.
i've been thinking about what to say since i left your house yesterday.
i thought about waiting for you to come, saying this face to face.
your whole life is about to change in a way that will never be the same.
you're opening a new chapter and you have to give a proper goodbye to the old one.
let it wash over you so that your memories of it are strong.
besides, i don't need to spend a month in a car to fall in love with you.
- bela lugosi- and they bring the monster back to life.
it's not as cheesy as thejames whale movies, but it's definitely got cheddar.
although i am wondering... why a special effects coordinator would do that fire stunt himself.
no one pulls a stunt i've designed unless i've tried it first myself.
friendship and fire, as tragedy strikes during the filming of a blaster beer commercial.
stuntman dave dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma... while attempting to drive this cadillac through that exploding billboard.
although a small explosion was planned... witnesses described the one that occurred as "massive."
well, our thoughts and prayers at geary-hawkins-leavitt... as well as blaster brewery, the makers of blaster beer... are with dave dugger and the dugger family.
it needs a remote control to do whatever it is it does, and i can't find it.
i'm sure its whereabouts lie within the clues he's given us.
you wanna keep the good rep, you gotta produce the flashy effects.
so you think that mickey put his best friend in harm's way to enhance his reputation?
when the explosion happened, i knew she'd stolen some and put it on the radiator.
i confronted her about it, and she threatened to involve me if i talked.
i've set it up to be every bit as safe as you set it up for dave dugger.
i even smeared ray's homemade napalm all over the radiator, just like you did to dave.
tell me, what demographic says that beer sales are more important than a man's life?
if the commercial hadn't been right, i'd have lost the account.
[raines] you don't know your husband as well as you think you do.
my advice is to remain quiet about this... if you know what's best for you.
- smart, considering the accident on the blaster beer set last week.
i figured the fx coordinator was a little smart that's exactly what you mean.
who attending to drive this cadillac through out an exploding billboard.
although a small explosion was planned witnesses describe the one occured as massive.
adding irony a pain, this stunt was maximized by dugger's long time fx coordinator, and childhood friend mickey clausen.
dave and me have done some of the stunts a hundren times.
i need some remote control to do whatever it does but i can't find it.
i'm sure it's whereabout its line with the clues he's given us.
how long has the center been doing this stuff down here?
are you going to browse or you are going to help us find ...?
one day she talked to me about the explosions and i told her about my napalm and gave her a little demonstration.
when the explosion happened, i know she's stolen some and put it on the radiator.
i get to tell you i put so much napalm on that billboard.
when this cadillac hits it, it's going to explode like baghdad during the gulf war.
broots, why don't you watch son of frankenstein again, and see if basil is a wonder boy.
we have half of our sweapers out there looking for him.
although i've been wondering why a special effects coordinator will actually do that fire stunt himself.
no one pulls the stunter design unless i try to first myself.
i figured the fx coordinator was a little smart that's exactly what you mean.
producing a super sunday can pay a new beer, can make a break of an agency.
stuntman dave dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma.
who attending to drive this cadillac through out an exploding billboard.
although a small explosion was planned witnesses describe the one occured as massive.
well, our thoughts and prayers, at secure ... as well as blaster brewery, that make us blaster beers all with dave dugger and dugger family.
to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident.
adding irony a pain, this stunt was maximized by dugger's long time fx coordinator, and childhood friend mickey clausen.
at show base, you want to keep good rep, you get to produce the flash and fx.
so you think mickey put his best friend in harms way to, enhance his reputation?
somewhere in this hell hole are the answers about timmy and igor, and the truth about what happened to my mother.
and it's time to take a look in the raines' private deal and safe files.
when the explosion happened, i know she's stolen some and put it on the radiator.
i confronted her about it, and she threatened to off me if i talked.
i don't think your ...agency is going to be giving your ... officer after all this.
look on the bright side, maybe you have a career ahead of you.
basil rathbone goes back to his dad's castle and meets igor
- bela lugosi- and they bring the monster back to life.
i figure a effects coordinator with a little "smart" is exactly what you need.
producing a super sunday campaign for a new beer could make or break the agency.
[anchorman] and now we cut to marianne bosha live at the scene.
friendship and fire, as tragedy strikes during the filming of a blaster beer commercial.
stuntman dave dugger was hospitalized with severe burns and head trauma... while attempting to drive this cadillac through that exploding billboard.
although a small explosion was planned... witnesses described the one that occurred as "massive."
in the meantime, we've launched an internal investigation... to make sure we get to the bottom of what caused this tragic accident.
adding irony to pain... the stunt was masterminded... by dugger's longtime effects coordinator... and childhood friend mickey clausen.
so you think that mickey put his best friend in harm's way to enhance his reputation?
as much as i hate to say it, that's exactly how i see it.
somewhere in this hellhole... are the answers about timmy and igor... and the truth about what happened to my mother.
maybe it's time to take a look into raines's private d.s.a. files.
i told her about the napalm and gave her a demonstration.
when the explosion happened, i knew she'd stolen some and put it on the radiator.
- people thought i was when i set myself on fire.
but i did remember to put on the suit and coat myself with zell gel... so i should bejust fine.
i don't think your ad agency is going to be giving you a corner office after all this.
but look on the bright side- maybe you have a career ahead of you...
a blood oxygen level of 74% would be alarming at sea level

at the top of the icefall, there is a bottleneck of climbers.
ed viesturs puts on his pack at the back of the line.

(music) tried to talk me into a ride said i wouldn't be sorry (music)
you've got yourself a dead driver and a cute little shipment of guns!
but you don't have the seller, and you don't have the buyer!
it's just i told my wife i'd pick my daughter up from school and...
well, that's real fatherly of you, but if you want to keep this job, you're gonna stay here till it's finished.
sir, if you know i can drive, you also know that i lost my license permanently when i went to prison.
the way i see it, you only need a license if you get pulled over.
melanie, i'll make enough money to get us out of this.
the last time you said one more load then we'd be okay, we weren't.
well, the truth is, jack, if you wanted to know what was in the back of that truck, you would've asked.
the reason i hired you, crews, is 'cause i knew you could get the job done.
now, you just go back and get in that truck and do the job
i'm paying you to do, because i don't think your parole officer is gonna be nearly as understanding as i am.
we don't take him out, he'll have $3 million in automatic weapons comin' up from georgia this time next week.
i mean, that might keep you in a job, but it's not the solution.
i've hauled a lot of things, but this is a first for a truckload of shitters.
yeah, it smells like somebody's already been usin' some of 'em.
had to carry a catheter bag for a year and a half.
so when i say i gotta take a piss, you can believe that i gotta take a piss.
tennessee highway patrol has eyewitness accounts of four tractor-trailers slammin' the hell out of each other down seven miles of interstate.
three of those trucks are destroyed, and their drivers are dead.
i was, uh, hauling a load up from atlanta on my sixth straight georgia run.
it was my daughter's birthday, and i thought i could make it home in time.
i was on this long, dark stretch of /-75 with nothin' to look at but the white line when i saw it.
it was in the middle of the road, comin' straight at me with his teeth bared and red eyes staring.
i don't wanna say this in front of your wife, but if i do not have my guns by midnight, lam gonna kill her and the kid, and i am gonna do it ugly.
no, you're not gonna do that, cutler, because you want your little guns too bad.
does this mean we can all go to my game tonight?
as long as you think we have time to stop and pick up a pair of high-top tennis shoes.
you've got yourself a dead driver and a cute little shipment of guns!
but you don't have the seller, and you don't have the buyer!
it's just i told my wife i'd pick my daughter up from school and...
well, that's real fatherly of you, but if you want to keep this job, you're gonna stay here till it's finished.

i was on this long, dark stretch of i-75 with nothin' to look at but the white line when i saw it.
no, you're not gonna do that, cutler, because you want your little guns too bad.
so i'm gonna tell you where to bring melanie and tracy, and we will trade my family for your guns.
i offer to get your operator's license back, and this is how you say thank you?
you let them go, or the whole load goes in the water.
there's got to be a way i can program the coordinates to my brother's world.
all we can do is hope that he's got the coordinates for our home world.
welcome to this assembly of the oracle, followers of the way.
today is a very special assembly because today, a group of welcomers will pass through the portal to the other side, to the next world, to make it ready for us.
there is a beautiful new world waiting for us beyond the portal.
a beautiful place you might think of as this earth, so alike it will be.
but there we will find true peace and contentment, leaving behind all of our cares and concerns.
we must be in constant readiness to go, to cross over when we are called.
we'll wait till nobody's around and i'll get a better look.
they believe that life here is just to prepare you for life on the next world.
near as i can figure, it's pretty much all of those.
on earth prime we had a right wing political movement that wanted to establish a system based on family values.
well, you guys don't have to go if you don't want to.
but i've got to get a look at the mechanics of that machine.
the oracle is a way of life that removes care and doubt.
it's a system of belief and behavior based on obedience to the master oracle.
through love and care, i've seen even the most militant come around to our way of thinking.
yeah, i was just getting to the love and care part.
but the oracle can use it for many good works here.
i know you believe that you're going to a better place.
and the oracle has the only device that does control that.
the timer, and if we don't get it back before the time runs out, we're gonna be here for a very long time.
the tunnels we used will be closed, and the guards will be doubled at the cloister and the assembly hall.
i think it would be better to make a surgical strike with a small force, not a big raid like this morning.
when we didn't return at the appointed time, they're trained to move.
how are they gonna get by all the security the oracle has piled on us?
oh, as dangerous as samson is, the others are much more so.
we don't know where they came from, we don't know if there are any more like them, and they possess some kind of advanced scientific knowledge they may have passed on while they were underground.
my friends and coworkers in the way of the oracle, the signs of the end times are all around us.
the confusion that you may be feeling today as you see the unrest increase has been foreseen by the master oracle.
change is painful, but we know the rewards that come of endurance and of steadfast faith.
today, we are sending two very special groups of welcomers to that reward.
we have decided that our methods of reconfiguration are inadequate here.
consequently, we are sending them with the welcomers to the other side in the hopes that the wisdom provided there will help them to their salvation.
people over there think the portal brings them to a better world, and no one's ever come back.
but if somebody did, that somebody will bring such a powerful message, nothing the oracle said could stop it.
i am not a welcomer come back from the other side.
what you just saw was not a miracle, but the result of pure science.
but tonight, i made the delivery, and boy you would not believe this woman
well, wait, just because pete brings her pizza doesn't mean he's delivering the sausage

- listen pal, i've had a really bad day - join the club hey, you wanna piece of me, huh ?
berg, you're not a physician, you're a med student give yourself a break no, no, see, you said it yourself it takes dedication and commitment alright, listen to me, berg, this is the first time in your life that you're doing something where you don't know all the answers

and the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night.
on a lighter note, a kwik-e-mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.
to put you at ease, we have re-created... the most common spawning locations of your species.
you may choose either the backseat of a camaro... an airplane bathroom, a friend's wedding... or the alley behind a porno theater.
well- [ bleeping ] hyperbolic paraboloid- [ bleeping ] your mama.
yeah, i got a question for that gross thing, whatever it is.
nobody wins when parents put their petty squabbles above the welfare of a child.
let's hope they put their differences aside and do what's best for maggie.

i wouldn't sell you my horses not even for those huge great diamonds your ladyship wore at the ball.
i wouldn't give much for your ladyship's chances of getting them safe back to england.
not too bad, for he carried me all the way to the surgeon.
made me promise to tell you, ma'am that captain osborne is well, and we won the day.
he could have had half my money or his children could.
instead of that, he's a doomed pauper with a... dancing girl for a wife.
i'm sure young pitt here has told you he'll inherit queen's crawley so he's hoping he'll get my fortune, too and he'll be able to set the old house to rights and cut a fine figure in court.
but i expect he's told you all this has he not?
and i myself am now an accredited agent for the supply of coals and fine madeira wines.
if you wish to be of service you might avail yourself of the opportunity to introduce the same to your military acquaintance.
all men are fools one way or the other... except you, rawdy, my love.
raggles is the sort of fool who loves to serve great folk.
the longer he has to wait for his rent the more he'll admire us and soon he'll have sunk so much money and hope in us he'll have to hang on.
and best of all we have a house where we can invite people people of influence... people like lord steyne.
" a man and a woman are the fox and the bird "
" but the woman is a fox, i beg perhaps you haven't heard "
the melancholy intelligence which it was my duty to convey to my family must have long been anticipated... by your good self.
lord, it seems an age since i was last in this carriage... just a little governess on my firstjourney into the world.
my friend, lord steyne, has a very high opinion of sir pitt crawley.
he looks for great things from you in parliament, he says.
i was so frightened that if the worst were to befall...
i have my barouche, ma'am and there will always be a place in it for you.
you have cut me at the opera and at the ball and in the street.
i wouldn't sell you my horses not even for those huge great diamonds your ladyship wore at the ball.
not too bad, for he carried me all the way to the surgeon.
made me promise to tell you, ma'am that captain osborne is well, and we won the day.
no father in all england could be more generous than me.
it was his fault... and now he must bear the consequence for it.
he could have allied himself with one of the best families in england.
he could have had half my money or his children could.
instead of that, he's a doomed pauper with a... dancing girl for a wife.
but he was mentioned in dispatches, ma'am as a very gallant officer and i believe he truly is.
i'm sure young pitt here has told you he'll inherit queen's crawley so he's hoping he'll get my fortune, too and he'll be able to set the old house to rights and cut a fine figure in court.

well, um, rebecca may i... help you to a-a small bird?
i hope you intend to open up the old house in great gaunt street.
stuart, you are no longer allowed to buy the donuts in the morning.
it took me a couple of weeks to figure this out,
i'm sure the teamsters were just trying to cheer me up.
you know, tomorrow's gonna be a pretty tough day for me...
because i was just so proud of myself for being independent.
but now i realize you were the best thing that ever happened to me.
i was just wondering if, uh, if you don't mind, there's these two guys outside, and they don't believe in you.
so i was thinking maybe you could do something, like haunt them or something.
i will become a ghost, and there's nothing you can do to stop me.
and the beam fell and she pushed me out of the way.
first, you play chicken with the mailman and almost wind up part of the pavement.
second, you go on a simple ghost-finding mission, and what do you know, no ghost.
a guy named jeff mccullaugh is going down a highway one night.
and the cops stop him because his tail light isn't working.
six months go by and a very shaky, very crazy jeff mccullaugh goes to court.
the public defender tells jeff that he can get him off if he pleads guilty.
but the fact is that i'm innocent and i will have that proven in court.
mr bates and i feel, in this particular situation, you would be perfect to handle my defence.
what would happen if he stuck a firecracker in somebody's mouth?
so, i read in the newspapers that there was this nut who held people at gunpoint and forced cherry bombs in their mouths.
you know what this whole thing comes down to, don't you?
every day, defence lawyers get guilty people off and are not affected by it.
come, let daddy show you what he's got in his pants for you.
she's got the same thing under her skirt that you've got in your pants.
recess is almost over, and i only have this lottery case...
did you know there's a guy eating something off your table?
i was in an alley, petting my dog, when they came down on me.
it states here the dog was attacking you when you were seen in the alley.
so, one little guy has already spent a year and a half in jail because his lights didn't work.
i've spent the last year gathering evidence to prove he's innocent.
but the fact is that i'm innocent and i will have that proven in court.
mr bates and i feel, in this particular situation, you would be perfect to handle my defence.
i always calculate how far i can go on the fuel i have and still get back.
then i figure out the halfway point and i go just a little beyond it.
he sat in my office and rattled off the most grotesque fantasies imaginable.
i handled him on a burglary charge and i heard that stuff every day.
they want me to defend fleming because of my moral integrity.
and if i don't defend him i'll be disbarred for being unethical.
you know what this whole thing comes down to, don't you?
every day, defence lawyers get guilty people off and are not affected by it.
he wanted it for me and he made sure i got it.
to him being a lawyer was the finest thing you could be.
does not have one piece of evidence other than the testimony of the victim herself.
another truth is that my client voluntarily, and the prosecution is well aware of this,

do you honestly think that bringing johnny cash into prisons to sing railroad songs is gonna rehabilitate anyone?
most people are sick and tired of crime in the streets.

to him being a lawyer was the finest thing you could be.
does not have one piece of evidence other than the testimony of the victim herself.
another truth is that my client voluntarily, and the prosecution is well aware ofthis, took a lie detector test ...
however, it is the defence counsellor's duty to protect the rights of the individual.
as it is the prosecution's duty to uphold the laws of the state.
not one piece of evidence other than the testimony of the victim herself.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, i have a case to end all cases.
she got the same thing under her skirt that you got in your pants.
all right, come on, you guys, we got a lady here.
you push fleming on that mccullaugh thing there's going to be big trouble.
mccullaugh's innocent and i can't get that goddamn fleming to even look at the evidence, jay.
recess is almost over and all i've got left is this illegal lottery case.
did you know that there's a guy eating something off your table?
i want to apologize to you, sir, for my behavior in the courtroom the other day.
i don't want to hear your apologies, or anything you have to say.
i don't do it because it's gonna give me a couple of good laughs.
you could spend the rest of your life, you know what you'd accomplish?
i read a report, i can tell if somebody is bullshitting me or not.
either you give me some straight answers or you get yourself another lawyer.
it wasn't my idea, but i did know what was coming down.
me and my cousin, royce royce shavers he figures that since i am the way i am....
they pull him over to the side, run a make on him.
the computer kicks back that there's a jeff mccullaugh wanted in alabama for assault with a deadly weapon.
there are two lawyers up in the third floor men's room who think differently.
as a matter of fact, one of them, right now is laughing so hard, he's choking in the sink.
in that case, your honor, we will call the defendant, robert avillar, to the stand.
and as far as your star witness goes, leah shepard well, we know about her and her credibility.
i'm not going to permit this type of conduct in the future.
when you're due in my court at 3:00, i expect you here.
do you honestly think that bringing johnny cash into prisons to sing railroad songs is going to rehabilitate anyone?
most people are sick and tired of mugging and crime in the streets.
the clinic doctor was signing the release papers to send him back to his cell.
i'm not sure what happened but all of a sudden, mccullaugh had a gun.
i was in an alley, petting my dog, when they came down on me.
it states here the dog was attacking you when you were seen in the alley.

and if i don't defend him i'll be disbarred for being unethical.
that the one lawyer who felt something is brought before your ethics committee?
don't make yourself out to be the only sensitive person around here.
however, these proceedings are here to see that justice is done.
and justice is, as any reasonable person would tell you, finding the truth.
our existence within that world is like the elementary particles that make up everything.
and, the waves, through collision and interference, suddenly change all of the elements.
today, i want you to turn to page one hundred and twelve of the textbook.
i want to talk about the particle characteristics of the electron.
in other words, when observing electrons the moment its coordinates are determined its momentum is no longer definable.
on the other hand, if you can measure its momentum you will not be able to define its coordinates.
the interpretation suggests a theory in which matter exists given that the micro realm is fundamentally indefinable.
developed by physicists such as bohr and heisenberg in copenhagen this theory has become known as the copenhagen interpretation.
they had a whirlwind romance and they took off for new york.
and, in order to feed his family he worked himself so hard and he died.
we change the world a little bit so that we can fit into it.
it tries to digest the foreign matter that suddenly comes in.
moving in as a transfer student probably minimizes the changes in the new world.
but i also have to carry out the role that i've taken.
that's how my mother and i have been crossing into many different worlds.
hey, if we all have that ability i'd like to cross into another world too.
relax your spirit and clear your mind and remove yourself from this world.
once you do that then some kind of power will automatically transport us to another dimension.
it may look that way, but this is a different world.
let's say you were also born two minutes earlier so this would be a dimension that's off by two minutes.
that anything you imagine in your mind is all a part of reality.
but why is it that you and your mother have been traveling to different worlds?
that's because every world we go to ends up being destroyed just like the world we originally came from.
every time that happens, i take my mother and escape that dimension in the hopes that we'll find a world in which we can stay.
when i was little, my dad got me "alice in wonderland".
i'd think that the pictures would be moving when the books closed.
yesterday, it was announced that the satellite myutos had left its stable orbit.
according to predictions by the experts brought together by the un task force myutos is expected to crash anywhere from the yangtze...
in order to not forget about the world that we were in we can't just stay in one place.
we have to always keep crossing over into other dimensions forever.
does that mean you cross into that underground bunker world because...
at this rate i don't know how much longer that world will last.
why is it that all of the worlds are being destroyed at once?
did you say that the delusions of one patient were realized?
our existence within that world is like the elementary particles that make up everything.
and, the waves, through collision and interference, suddenly change all of the elements.
you sound like a guy who can't face the reality that it's over.
not to sound harsh, but you can't live in the past.
look, i know that sometimes after a breakup well, there's that awkward period.
you know, where two people who had so much to say to each other suddenly find their conversations reduced to the merest of small talk.
this is your chance to let jen see you in action with other girls.
now, i'll admit that going on a double date with the ex is an advance maneuver but this could be exactly the thing you're looking for.
it's just, i know that you just broke up with jen.
and while i don't know the particulars of it all i do know it's a common mistake made by many people to begin to date before they're really ready.
the last time i checked, you were pulling a stellar f minus.
so without this extra-credit project, i'm certain your grade will not only place you among the morons but you may very well be their leader.
yesterday, we had a science project, and today we have a charm bracelet.
i'll just tell dr. rand that this experiment within an experiment isn't working out.
look, maybe on your planet taking an ex-girlfriend on a double date is a good idea, but where i come from, it's not.
it's a lousy idea, especially when you fail to inform your companion.
despite what you may think this isn't my first choice for a saturday afternoon either.
but then again, i wasn't the one who tried to turn our aquarium into plato's retreat.
i better have the grades that don't give them a choice.
a scholarship is pretty much my only way out of capeside.
i would say we're just getting to know each other and i don't think i wanna talk about this with you anymore.
dawson, i know i made a big deal out of remaining friends with you.
i'm not sure you'd have time for me anyhow what with your hectic dating schedule.
i'd love to get off this ferris wheel without insulting each other further.
could it possibly be your reasons are the same as mine?
that you need me just as much as i need you?
- you know that joey and i have never particularly liked each other, right?
that's why it seemed like such a bad idea when we got stuck together on that bio thing.
i don't know how to say this but i know you two have this long, tortured subtext together.
i wanted to make sure that if i was to do something about this like kiss her, that i wouldn't be stepping on any toes.
you don't sound like a guy who's disappointed in jen's breakup etiquette.
you sound like a guy who can't face the reality that it's over.
from now on you'll be known as the guy jen dropped.
most girls will view you as tainted goods and a few will feel incredibly sorry for you and offer a certain kind of sympathy.
you should prepare for the possibility jen will begin dating again.
seeing her around school with her new boyfriend watching her from this very window as she pauses coyly by your garden gate and accepts a good-night kiss from a guy you feel superior to in every way, and you can't possibly--
how can you be friends with someone when all you think about is how much more you want?
well, you know, i'm no expert at this, dawson but i think it can be done.
this is your chance to let jen see you in action with other girls.
now, i'll admit that going on a double date with the ex is an advance maneuver but this could be exactly the thing you're looking for.
the last time i checked, you were pulling a stellar f minus.
so without this extra-credit project, i'm certain your grade will not only place you among the morons but you may very well be their leader.
yesterday, we had a science project, and today we have a charm bracelet.
i'll just tell dr. rand that this experiment within an experiment...
before you run off to dr. rand there is an explanation for this.
you know how you said this experiment was about seeing which environment was best for these snails?
so i added some food, and then i added some water.
still nothing happened so i thought maybe the problem wasn't the environment.
i would've remembered that if i listened when you talked to me but i thought that maybe snails are just like guys.
that their ultimate fantasy is to be with two female snails at the same time.
i regard trolling for snails as one of the underrated ways to spend time.
despite what you may think this isn't my first choice for a saturday afternoon either.
tell me that you tied our boat up and the one that's floating downstream isn't ours.
i tied our boat up, and the one that's floating downstream isn't ours.
i better have the grades that don't give them a choice.
a scholarship is pretty much my only way out of capeside.
i would say we're just getting to know each other and i don't think i wanna talk about this with you anymore.
dawson, i know i made a big deal out of remaining friends with you.
i'm not sure you'd have time for me anyhow what with your hectic dating schedule.
i'd love to get off this ferris wheel without insulting each other further.
could it possibly be your reasons are the same as mine?
that you need me just as much as i need you?
-you know that joey and i have never particularly liked each other, right?
that's why it seemed like such a bad idea when we got stuck together on that bio thing.
i don't know how to say this but i know you two have this long, tortured subtext together.
i wanted to make sure that if i was to do something about this like kiss her, that i wouldn't be stepping on any toes.
...thanking the almighty your thick head isn't splattered into pieces on that motel shag.
all i know is that i gave two people in need a ride, and then it turns into this nightmare.
the nurse spotted a total placenta previa blocking the birth canal.
she'll bleed out in three minutes if she delivers outside of a hospital.
records show the house was purchased eight months ago by its current owners, john and jennifer bayton, who moved here from california.
as far as we know, they've had no involvement with either woman.
i've never seen this kind of thing in a prison situation.
it's more like what you see when a mother kills her own child, or something.
she was beaten down almost from the day she was born.
whatever love, whateverjoy she found, she found it right here with janette.
janette keeping her pregnancy a secret all those months, i have to ask myself:
what is the first thing a woman thinks of when she finds out she's pregnant?
officer, we have samples from her cell which can prove who the father is beyond a doubt.
we can wait until the results come in, or, if they're gonna point to you, you have an opportunity to help yourself out here.

i can't say i didn't know about it, but i don't remember taking part in it.
i get the feeling my freedom cost me dearly, but i don't remember selling my soul cheaply.

ok, delvin, why don't you show us some of the tools of the blacksmith trade?
well, the most important tool to any blacksmith is his anvil.
now you boys are both here, we've got something to tell you.
there is a reason that jeff is traveling with pots and pans.
actually, i was just gonna ask you to pass the butter.
if you're so freaked out about getting glasses, why don't you get contacts?
i'm just gonna go up and look in a full-length mirror.
if you had different glasses, you wouldn't have to cover that thing.
it'd be tough to get a bank loan when your last business went belly-up.
i got a private backer, and there's the money that i owe you.
i talked to jeff about it and he just said it's none of my business.
well, it's true, but considering jeff's track record, the concerns you have are totally understandable.
and i can afford to take a risk if i really believe in it, like jeff's mailbox business.
he can have his grand opening sale and going-out-of-business sale in one day.
she is known throughout the middle east as the blind princess.
if that is not invitation enough, then i would be honored to have her and her escort enter as my guests.
i feel like the ka of some ancient egyptian is trying to speak to me.
i feel like there are mysteries out there that even science can't explain.
woman good morning, chicago, and here's the extended forecast for today and tomorrow.
dry and cool, with highs in the 40's and lower 50's, lows in the 20's and lower 30's.
you know, in my country, you wouldn't have to pretend to be a princess, you could live like one.
well, i guess i was just born in the wrong place.
like... an attractive woman, and i don't get to feel that way very often.
what are you saying, i don't make you feel like an attractive woman?
are you telling me that that mummy was some special cat.
you see, they believe she was a direct descendant of bastet.
you know, because bastet was the protector against contagion and disease.
and there is this inscription- the inscription said that if anyone plunders the tomb, there's going to be a terrible plague.
they got counts that suggest everything from toxoplasmosis to viral pneumonitis.
white cell counts dropping below 200, bronchoscopy shows pulmonary lesions proliferating in both lungs.
all right, i don't want to jump the gun, diane, but don't you think we should call the health department?
i mean, you're the expert on infectious diseases, and you've never seen this before.
now, you'd at least have to check into it before you let the people in to see it, right?
surely you don't expect me to delay the opening any further based on some theory.
you realize there's only four places in the world that still store it?
i mean, what if it turns out to be real next time?
i'd tell you what i think, but the cat's got my tongue.
all right, class, our next stop is the inuit canoe, which was once used to hunt whales in the arctic.

i started them on acyclovir on the outside chance this is some form of herpetic infection.
i mean, without knowing the pathogen, phillip, there's not much more we can do.
i was granted the opportunity to examine her on the outside chance, uh, she was carrying a disease we know nothing about.
well, then, then you, then you would agree that it is a possibility...
well, right, but it, but if it's a possibility, then you've gotta follow that, because you don't have any other leads here, and...
listen, this, this is a very dear friend of mine in here, and i don't want her to die.
if there's any truth to all this, we got to find out.
i mean, it's no crazier than any of the other things that goes on around here, if you know what i mean.
it's been documented to survive months, even years, outside the human body, in-in bales of cotton, in dust.
i mean, put it into a virtually airtight environment, who knows how long it can lie dormant, or mutate.
if nothing else, i'm gonna try to convince atlanta not to destroy their stock of smallpox vaccine.
you realize there's only four places in the world that still store it?
when youn daddy was alive, this day used to be a day of celebnations.
and youn daddy used to be with his fathen the whole day.
then thene came into his life... a woman who was to change him completely.
she taught him how to love, and she taught him how to live.
it's a phenomenon of confused language, seen most often in patients with schizophrenia or another underlying psychosis.
now similar symptoms may also result from head trauma or an invasive tumor.
the truth of it is, the brain is very much a mystery.
it's theoretically possible that these symptoms might be brought on by acute anxiety.
it used to be a personality trait one was allowed to have, like abraham lincoln or lord byron.
now one is required to grin and say things like, "great".
he would play before school, after school, in the middle of the night.
he'd played other video games before, but this one, this one was different.
so he began going to friend's houses after school to play.
i realized i couldn't win, so i gave him the game back, figuring aleast that way, i could keep an eye on him.
he said he just needed five more minutes to get to the next level.
he promised he would go to bed as soon as he was finished.
apparently your son did not eat, drink or sleep for over 36 hours straight.
now i can't speak to the pain that you must be feeling, but how did this happen?
imagine leaving for your job and never having to worry about day care, late baby-sitters, nightmare nannies.
your child gets sick, you have someone there you trust, who loves your children, someone with a warm home who cooks healthy, homemade meals for your children and has a lovingly prepared dinner waiting for you when you walk in the door,
at any one time, there's a parent to give a hug, some advice, share a story.
families these days are no longer together, scattered across the country.
my husband comes home, he's tired, too, but somehow, he still has a little energy for baby making.
now if we were in a traditional marriage, at that moment, we would have an explosive argument.
but since we're not, when i am that exhausted and he has that look in his eye,
i simply ship him off to evette, where she satisfies him and he her.
your honor, there's not a shred of evidence for which a jury would rule against my client.
now as tragic as his death may be, plaintiffs have not shown any causal link between mr. beller's death and his playing "hell born".
a jury is gonna want to make somebody pay for that.
now did you hire this dr. williams to make your games more addictive or not?
and alcove games is not gonna be a scagoat on this, even if this goes public.
dr. klaywig, as a historian of family law, could you tell us why laws against polygamy were enacted?
but the company wanted to take the desire to play the game to the next level.
in other words, change the motivation from "i want to play this game"
playing this video game is like receiving a jolt equivalent to an injection of amphetamines.
and my duty was to help create a game that would maximize dopamine output for the players.
why not go down to a hospice and marry 50 terminally ill women so they can have your health benefits?
if a billionaire could marry a thousand women and claim them all as dependants on his tax return, don't you think he would?
today, the traditional family is under constant assault from every direction.
one refuge, maybe the last refuge against that assault is the law.
we have single mothers, single fathers, two mommies, two daddies, ex-wives, ex-in-laws, you name it.
if we're going to universally apply a law, we need to look at what it is that law strives to protect.
obviously, denny, but telling me to do so is like saying to a starving man,
"you just need money. " it doesn't exactly solve the problem.
i quit, never smoked again, and thank goodness it didn't hurt me.
but tobacco companies have been found liable, assessed penalties in the millions of dollars because cigarettes are addictive, and they do kill people.
but other children will become addicted, your honor, and there will be other deaths.
it's time to let a jury decide who's responsible for the death of wesley beller.
your honor, i know i'm supposed to be a dispassionate advocate for my client's position but...
i have to tell you that this case, it, it just makes me mad.
believe me, if anyone who's addicted to crystal meth could suddenly wave a magic wand and be addicted to video games instead, they would do it in a heartbeat.
now you heard testimony that playing this game raises your dopamine level.
but where do we draw the line between addiction and passion?
and the fact is, this case is an insult to anyone who has a real addiction to a harmful substance.
for the first time in your life, you feel trapped, and i'm the reason.
why can't we just leave it at, "i'd miss you, denny"?
have you thought for one second about what you're doing to the richardson children?
yeah, i'm about to make parent-teacher night a lot less awkward.
as part of the 12-step program of recovery, they strongly suggest that she not be involved in any relationships for a year.
this allows her to focus on mending her life, and any distractions could jeopardize that process and make her more susceptible to returning to drugs.
with my night terrors, the clown phobia and now word salad, you don't worry about me?
you know, strangers aren't always gonna be there for us, denny.
i think it might be useful to clarify a few things right off the bat.
by simple definition, we are in the business of winning wars.
the russians couldn't shovel money into the fire as fast as we could.
number two, and this is where my command comes in, technology.
(woman) it missed by a mean distance of five miles and nearly 50% of the time.
you know... in baseball, a guy who hits.400 is considered pretty damn great.
(man) in baseball the losing team isn't killed by their opponents.
be that as it may, the paveway is one hell of a bomb.
it takes people with sophisticated knowledge and expertise to conduct these tests and to interpret the results.
if the us army acted on the advice of every tom, dick and harry who had an opinion, we'd wind up with a bunch of b-52s powered by outboard motors.
all right, let's make the fuselage in michigan and the landing gear in mississippi.
by all means, let's keep congressman groves and his bloodsucking buddies happy.
- any test involving a live round, there's a freak chance that something might blow.
we don't wanna lose you first day on the job, colonel.
the question is, how did they get to that... from this?
gentlemen, our mission was to design and implement an infantry transport vehicle that would be a worthy replacement for the m-113 armoured personnel carrier.
it will hold 11 men plus a driver, and features a 20mm cannon, which will provide ample firepower and flexibility.
lightly armoured, speedy and solidly engineered, our troops will arrive at the battlefield in the finest american technology.
colonel smith, could you explain why you put those portholes there?
yes, sir, as per your request, so the men can shoot out at the enemy.
we are talking about 11 years with nothing to show for it!
except an ulcer the size of the district of columbia and a career on permanent hold!
i've been a bird colonel so long, i swear i'm growing feathers!
if you have to design hats to haul those goddamn missiles, then just do it.
it is also equipped with a rapid-fire cannon, and an anti-tank rocket launcher.
which means it's loaded with... 1500 shells and ten tow anti-tank missiles.
it says there when the sergeant york proved incapable of hitting airplanes, we test-fired it at hovering helicopters.
when it failed to hit hovering helicopters, we fired at stationary targets and it missed those.
terrorists in lebanon, and colonel qadhafi in libya, and sandinistas in nicaragua, and let's not forget our ongoing problems with the soviet union.
frankly, i don't appreciate calls from reporters and congressmen asking me why nothing we are working on works,
about these tests you've been thinking about conducting on the bradley.
i understand your concern, but if you were an armoured warfare expert instead of a flier, you'd understand the bradley is a good vehicle.
that's the point of doing tests - to find out what happens.
if we knew what the results would be, we wouldn't need to do the test.
and just because the tests didn't always come out the way colonel burton expected... is no reason to assume that anything devious was going on.
(woman) i ask you, general, filling the fuel tanks with water for a test designed to check the combustibility of those tanks - that wasn't devious?
(woman) are you suggesting colonel burton had no reason to be concerned?
i am suggesting that colonel burton and his tests did not reveal anything we didn't already know.
my job is to oversee the joint live-fire test programme and report to congress.
in order to do that, i'm gonna have to insist on a live-fire test of the bradley under combat conditions.
let's not let this little blip on the screen ground you permanently.
would the colonel ever consider having a drink with an enlisted soldier?
i've been around long enough to know that the pentagon is not a charity, it's cashflows and egos.
that's part of it, it's what helps drive it, fine, but... somehow... somehow i always thought the men came first.
70,000 american boys will ride into battle in the bradley if america fights another war.
we can't be a part of sending them to their deaths.
yes, and i am as distressed as you that anyone in the pentagon would stoop so low.
leaks within the pentagon are how i get most of my information.
i guess there was some confusion between the army, the air force...
the sort of trouble you always get with these cross-departmental joint-testing programmes.
to play by the rules, cos i always play by the rules.
then why do you need a rule book to tell you what the rules are?
in fact, general partridge's report on the bradley doesn't even mention the word casualty, not once.
i came to the conclusion that what was required was a live-fire test.
there are forces at work, even now as we speak with one objective in mind - the destruction of this country.
we must not, we will not allow those forces to prevail, for if we do, you can be certain that you and i, and everyone else will never again enjoy the luxury of meeting in this building to debate anything!
only phil has been in a coma for the last 20 years.
since the day his m-16 jammed somewhere outside of vinh long.
no more than it would have if it was in combat, sir.
(partridge) seven tow missiles fired from a launcher mounted on the left side...
we take atoms and molecules and make them into everything from combat boots to bombs.
bombs the other side will never see until they're ploughing down their chimney like santa claus from hell!
i'll be the first to admit that this programme had its share of difficulties.
we did experience a glitch or two with the thing, that much is certain.
what would you say the batting average is for the bradley, general?
it takes people with sophisticated knowledge and expertise to conduct these tests and to interpret the results.
all right, let's make the fuselage in michigan and the landing gear in mississippi.
by all means, let's keep congressman groves and his bloodsucking buddies happy.

we don't wanna lose you first day on the job, colonel.
i'm not sure regulations allow us to borrow the door from the ammunition shed for a pop quiz, sir.
sir, regulations state that the ammunition shed should never be left open, sir.
the question is, how did they get to that... from this?

of course, steel is much heavier than aluminium, so it won't go as fast.
we can't lose speed - it won't work as a scout.

you don't want to be the one who drops the ball, cos if you drop the ball, no promotion, no star, no cushy job with a contractor when you retire.
which is why, colonel, everyone attached to the bradley will stop your tests.
like you, i work inside the system, and you don't have a prayer of running your tests, not unless you're willing to sacrifice your career.
and if you think you're safe because congress gave you your job, think again.
if we knew what the results would be, we wouldn't need to do the test.
and just because the tests didn't always come out the way colonel burton expected... is no reason to assume that anything devious was going on.
i ask you, general, filling the fuel tanks with water for a test designed to check the combustibility of those tanks - that wasn't devious?
if the tanks had been filled with fuel there's a good chance the vehicle would have exploded.

"the failure of the bradley to incorporate even the most elementary safeguards
"to protect the troops inside raises questions about the integrity. "
no, no, no, i assure you that memo of his had nothing to do with his being transferred.
senator, i'm sorry, i've just been informed secretary weinberger is on the other line.
the army test reports do not make the possibility of casualties a top priority.
in fact, general partridge's report on the bradley doesn't even mention the word casualty, not once.

we must not, we will not allow those forces to prevail, for if we do, you can be certain that you and i, and everyone else will never again enjoy the luxury of meeting in this building to debate anything!
about a year ago, i went to the veterans' hospital to visit a friend of mine from my flying days.
only i took a wrong turn when i got off the elevator.
in the early days of that war, they sent guys off to fight with m-16s that jammed in combat.
a little bit of dust, a little bit of rain, and the gun was useless.

we are pleased to present a scale model of the new bradley fighting vehicle.
featuring scout, troop transport, and anti-tank capabilities, it carries six men.
a troop transport that can't carry troops, a reconnaissance vehicle that's too conspicuous to do reconnaissance...
and a quasi-tank that has less armour than a snow-blower but has enough ammo to take out half of dc.

for generations we have dreamed of being able to see into space beyond the great ion veil.
today, the first men from our small planet have begun to travel beyond that great ion cloud, that shrouds our small planet in silence and isolation and we will... we will... er, we will... begin to see,

one great big goodbye to eagle 5, from all the boys here at mission control.
i would take my super model to a real expensive restaurant - fancy, fancy, fancy.
but she can't concentrate on the food, cause she's so turned on.
becky boo'll come out on the back porch and she'll say
"ej, are you gonna stop playing around in that silly old garden, and come in here and start playing around with me?"
i would like now, on behalf of all the great citizens of potatoho, to take a moment of heartfelt prayer,
and we pray that our boys will do us proud, that they -

need a drop of cider to do a job like that, do you, uncle sid?
our mother says you drive better with a drop of drink inside you.
she fell in love with him immediately, and remained in love forever.
and herself being comely, sensitive and adoring, she attracted my father also and so he married her.
so, in the ample night and the thickness of her hair,
i consumed my fattened sleep, blessed by her bed and safety.
rose-coloured men through the rain-wet windows seemed to bulge and break into flame.
they breathed out smoke, drank fire from golden jars, and i heard their great din with awe.
at any moment, i'd look for a spectacular end to my already long life.
oh, the end of the war and the world, i never expected to see another day.
to suggest i might watch her getting dressed in the morning seemed to me both outrageous and wonderful.
in a long hot summer, a serious drought hit the country.
springs dried up, the wells filled with frogs and the usually sweet water from our scullery pump, turned brown and tasted of nails.
as the drought continued, prayer was abandoned and more devilish steps adopted.
finally, soldiers with rifles marched to the tops of the hills and began shooting at passing clouds.
the drought broke soon after, and it began to rain as it had never rained before.
the first big festival that i can remember was peace day in 1919.
it was a day of magical transformations - of tears and dusty sunlight, and bands, processions and buns by the cartload.
our mother, you're washing slow as a duck with all the summer to do it.
well, go on and get on the bus, then, if you're so keen on it.
they had lived together in the same house for 50 years.
and to me, they resembled two tawny insects - slow but deft in their movements, a little foraging, some frugal feeding and any amount of stillness.
thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.
give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as they forgive us who trespass against them.
and now little vincent thorne could buy you all up, including squire and all his manor and still have a fortune nestling in the bank.
fill 'em up proper again, landlord, there's plenty more where that came from.
well, it's most difficult to find words to express... what i think.
but... the time of year has come around again when i can announce... an entertainment.
the signs upon her showed the way i should go, then she was folded and put away.
very soon, i caught up with other travelers, all going in the same direction, and together we entered that tricky wood.
boney was raped himself soon afterwards and married his attacker, a rich farm widow, who worked him to death in her bed and barnyard.
the others married too, raised large families and became members of the parish church council.
the wet winter days seemed, at times, unending, and quite often, they led to self-slaughter.
indeed, during one particularly gloomy season, even the coroner did himself in.
they did not see each other again, for in a week they both were dead.
i was haunted by their end as by no other, and by the kind killing authority that arranged it.
divided, their life went out of them, so that they ceased as by mutual agreement.
their cottage stood empty on the edge of the common, its front door locked and soundless.
first the roof, then the walls, and lay scattered in a tangle of briars.
its decay was so violent and overwhelming, it was as though the old couple had wrecked it themselves.
soon all that remained of joe and hannah brown and of their long, close life together, was some grass-grown stumps, a garden gone wild, some rusty pots and a dog rose.
the last days of my childhood were also the last days of the village.
i belong to that generation which saw, by chance, the end of a thousand years' life.
myself, my family, my generation, were born in a world of silence, of white narrow roads, rutted with hooves and cartwheels, innocent of oil or petrol, down which people passed rarely, and almost never for pleasure,
he had tried to carry off our willing sister, and we had all of us very near killed him.
a moment before i'd been blind with anger, ready to slay for the family.
never to be forgotten, that first long secret drink of golden fire.
juice of those valleys and of that time, wine of wild orchards, of russet summer, of plump red apples and rosie's burning cheeks.
rosie was close-up, salty, an invisible touch too near to be seen or measured.
and it seemed that the wagon under which we lay went floating away like a barge out over the valley where we worked unseen, swinging on motionless tides.
it was then that i began to sit on my bed and to make up poems from intense abstraction.
time squared itself and the village shrank and distances crept nearer.
"hands" espenson, banking and finance genius, only don't call him "hands."
i've been working very hard to deal with my asperger's syndrome.
and then hope that in the constitution somewhere it says it's okay to sell your body parts to the highest bidder.
all right, you wanna marry some guy, a criminal no less, that's fine,
it took some digging, but i eventually learned that it was daniel post.
i asked my father who daniel post was and if he knew anything about it.
something was supposed to come up in the closet at 10 o'clock.
i've got a few minutes now if you'd like to go somewhere and grab a bite.
- because the plaintiff died, but not before you tried to buy your way out of the inconvenience of a trial.
and when the study here at home didn't work, you just got yourself into another one in switzerland, didn't you?
and the one lung that you have left, it's not gonna last forever, is it?
and every time you have to stop on the street, and you feel that tightness in your chest, it reminds you of how vulnerable you are, doesn't it?
it should be about whether or not our government has the right to control what we can and cannot do with our own bodies...
what you should be able to do to save your own life.
judge brown doesn't want to hear about these issues, because they cut a little too close to the bone.
you see, i did some research, and it seems judge brown is himself a survivor of colon cancer.
it's become all too common, in fact, and i've treated many like you, who prefer dolls.
mainly they're motivated by a desire to avoid rejection, which, when you think about it, every man fears rejection from women on some level.
equally cherished is the notion that our law-making bodies seek to protect the public good.
as a result, we don't have carte blanche to do whatever we please with our bodies.
hundreds of thousands of people donate their organs every year so that others might live, and they count on the system of distribution to be fair.
if it's not, those organ donations could stop or most certainly decline, and people die.
i can get you one in brazil for as low as $3,000, in the philippines for $1,800.
i can get you an achilles tendon in south korea for anywhere between $200 and $1,200 dollars.
sure, you can put your name on a list, along with 92,000 people who are left on the list each year.
in the meantime, anyone who can circumvent that list is doing so.
you can't turn on a cartoon today without seeing an ad for erectile dysfunction.
it's one of the fastest-growing industries in our country, better sex through chemicals.
i move for costs, and i'd ask your honor to sentence this idiot to sensitivity training, preferably for life.
all right, i'm gonna take this under advisement, and i will rule quickly.
i'm also mindful of the hypocrisy mr. shore alluded to earlier.
big pharmaceutical spends billions of dollars cultivating a national obsession with sexual performance.
you women are always born from a little piece of us men
you know, gedeone, without that thing you can't do a thing!
i bet he goes on duty at night and stops in the morning
with a woman like that, just imagine the sweat fosco is working up
remember when he locked himself in the hotel with that blonde from pordenone?
he went to the front desk when he got downstairs and said
if i had a sister like yours, i'd go for it in a minute
nothing compares to a lay with your sister in the hays!
thank goodness i'm not dead yet i don't want to die
a man who can break me has yet to be born
i have allocated three hours, 20 minutes for the task and an additional 17 minutes for ensign kim's usual conversational digressions.
i am scheduled to take a nutritional supplement at 1500 hours, engage in one hour of cardiovascular activity, then i intend to review a text the doctor recommended entitled a christmas carol.
we kept it stable for one- trillionth of a nanosecond before it destabilized.
we didn't have enough boronite ore left to synthesize more, but the knowledge we gained allowed us to...
not to me, not to my crew, and not to the people who live in this quadrant.
i'm going to neutralize this threat, seven, with or without your help.
the omega directive doesn't allow me to say much, but i want you to know what to expect.
at 0600 hours, i'll be leaving in a shuttle with seven of nine.
you're asking me to abandon my captain and closest friend without even telling me why.
if it were a simple matter of trust, i wouldn't hesitate to tell you.
that's a reasonable argument, but you're not always a reasonable woman.
you're determined to protect this crew and this time, you've taken it too far.
a dangerous mission-- fine, i'll acknowledge that-- but isn't it more likely to succeed with everyone behind you, working together?
ordinarily, i'd agree, but this directive was issued many years ago.
i'd be in contact with starfleet command and they'd send in a specialized team to deal with the crisis.
in their absence, we're going to have to make do with the training i've received and the knowledge
omega...the last letter of the greek alphabet-- chosen by starfleet to represent a threat not only to the federation but to the entire galaxy.
only starship captains and federation flag officers have been briefed on the nature of this threat.
a single omega molecule contains the same energy as a warp core.
in theory, a small chain of them could sustain a civilization.
the molecule was first synthesized over a hundred years ago by a starfleet physicist named ketteract.
i think he was hoping to develop an inexhaustible power source.
but i was always told that it was a natural phenomenon.
you're saying it was caused by a single molecule of this stuff?
i have to admit, i've never been this apprehensive about a mission.
i know how einstein must have felt about the atom bomb, or marcus when she developed the genesis device.
stand by to transport the molecules into this chamber and neutralize them as ordered.
i have been a member of this crew for nine months.
how soon can we clear the subspace ruptures and go to warp?
ten, maybe 15 minutes, but those ships will catch up to us before then.
we've arranged for our guests in sick bay to be taken back to their homeworld, and we can finally put this mission behind us.
this will be my last encrypted log concerning the omega directive.
i was studying them to help me understand what i saw in cargo bay 2.
the data wasn't clear on why omega stabilized in the last few seconds, but chances are it was simply a chaotic anomaly, nothing more.
as i was watching it, it seemed to be watching me.
the borg have assimilated many species with mythologies to explain such moments of clarity.
today ensign kim and i will conduct a comprehensive diagnostic of the aft sensor array.
i have allocated three hours, 20 minutes for the task and an additional 17 minutes for ensign kim's usual conversational digressions.
on one occasion, we were able to create a single omega molecule.
we kept it stable for one- trillionth of a nanosecond before it destabilized.
but we never found another source of the ore... until now.
sorry... but if someone out there is experimenting with omega, i'm under orders to stop them.
at 0600 hours, i'll be leaving in a shuttle with seven of nine.
would it be out of line to ask where you're going?
either seven and i will succeed on our mission and return within a few days, or your long- range sensors will detect a large explosion in subspace.
if that occurs, you'll have less than ten seconds to jump to warp and get the hell out of here.
let's just say i've had to amend the directive, given the circumstances.
but you have your orders and i expect you to follow them.
if it were a simple matter of trust, i wouldn't hesitate to tell you.
but we've encountered situations where information was taken from us by force.
you're determined to protect this crew and this time, you've taken it too far.
a dangerous mission-- fine, i'll acknowledge that-- but isn't it more likely to succeed with everyone behind you, working together?
if we were in the alpha quadrant right now, we wouldn't be having this conversation.
i'd be in contact with starfleet command and they'd send in a specialized team to deal with the crisis.
only starship captains and federation flag officers have been briefed on the nature of this threat.
what you're about to hear will not go beyond these bulkheads.
not just any molecule... the most powerful substance known to exist.
a single omega molecule contains the same energy as a warp core.
in theory, a small chain of them could sustain a civilization.
the molecule was first synthesized over a hundred years ago by a starfleet physicist named ketteract.
ketteract and 126 of the federation's leading scientists were lost in the accident.
rescue teams attempting to reach the site discovered an unexpected secondary effect.
we're approaching the star system where we believe we'll find omega.
i have to admit, i've never been this apprehensive about a mission.
i know how einstein must have felt about the atom bomb, or marcus when she developed the genesis device.
they watched helplessly as science took a destructive course, but i have the chance to prevent that from happening.
federation cosmologists had a theory-- that the molecule once existed in nature... for an infinitesimal period of time at the exact moment of the big bang.
some claimed omega was the primal source of energy for the explosion that began our universe.
captain... i'd be negligent if i didn't point out that we are about to violate the prime directive.
for the duration of this mission, the prime directive is rescinded.
the captain left me in charge of our efforts on voyager.
i would be negligent if i ignored a new source of information.
there's enough here to wipe out subspace across half the quadrant.
i'll order the away teams back to voyager, and target this facility with a gravimetric charge.
this simulation shows the molecules in their free state, highly unstable.
i've modified the chamber to emit a harmonic wave form that will dampen the molecules.
i have been a member of this crew for nine months.
in all of that time, i have never made a personal request.
we're heading into an area of open space-- no indications of life or any kind of technology.
we can carry out the procedure with no risk to anyone else.
i have allocated three hours, 20 minutes for the task and an additional 17 minutes for ensign kim's usual conversational digressions.
i am scheduled to take a nutritional supplement at 1500 hours, engage in one hour of cardiovascular activity, then i intend to review a text the doctor recommended entitled a christmas carol.

the borg have assimilated many species with mythologies to explain such moments of clarity.
look, i appreciate the concern, but... this is not something that you want to mess with.
now, can i please have the front page of the real paper?
look, i-i-i know you went to a lot of trouble for all of this, and i-i appreciate that.
it's very nice of you, but i've-- see, i've gotta get dressed, and i've gotta go do what it is that i do.
see, we took the eisenhower over to the dan ryan, the dan ryan down to the stevenson.
from the stevenson, we hopped onto the tri-state, and then a quick loop back around to the eisenhower, and here we are.
there's stuff on here that my boss has never even seen.
so, if there is a way to tell the future, it may very well be right there.
wait a second, if that's the disc, what do they have?
did you see any of those government guys sneaking around the gray ghost?
i mean, had you said a dog, oh, i would have been all yours.
if it would have been a dog, it would have worked, huh?
now, can i please have the front page of the real paper?
all right, son, maybe we did go a little too far.
see, we took the eisenhower over to the dan ryan, the dan ryan down to the stevenson.
from the stevenson, we hopped onto the tri-state, and then a quick loop back around to the eisenhower, and here we are.
you should have seen me when i was an undergrad at the, uh, u.s.c.
i can't tell you how many nights i slept in the stacks at the library.
you see, it was a- well, it was a misunderstanding because i thought that my par...
no, you thought that the poor little math nerd was so desperate for a date that she had to have her mommy help set her up, right?
there's stuff on here that my boss has never even seen.
so, if there is a way to tell the future, it may very well be right there.
wait a second, if that's the disc, what do they have?
did you see any of those government guys sneaking around the gray ghost?
i mean, had you said a dog, oh, i would have been all yours.
if it would have been a dog, it would have worked, huh?
if you don't... then you won't want to watch this show either.
it could be shown all over the word, so who's gonna lose?
everyone comes here wanting to do trade and they all end up washing dishes.
don't stand by, and saying critical words give me some suggestions.
if i was your sister would you let rne be a strip dancer?
if you were my sister, i wouldn't have let you come to america.
say what you came to say, if they see me talking to you my boss will fire me.
i'm here to tell you that you can fire your boss.
and who said this group was a business delegation anyway it's a whole goddamn family.
you take them to the hotel i'll deal with the luggage.
you said this was going to be a desk job answering phones and booking tickets, then how come i'm lugging bags around on my first day?
i never thought you were so strong, a desk job is wasting your talent.
i told them the american police were cracking down on pornography.
i told them if the cops arrested you, they stamped the word "pervert" in your passport.
i don't know if you're still in l.a, or even in the states.
i lost you a year ago today i don't want to cause trouble
at night in the darkness i see you looking at with the sun shining behind you.
you look as transparent as pure cubes of ice in a crystal glass.
if i fall in love i'll bring him back for your approval.
my name is liu yuan last name liu first name yuan,
ten police three times a week for two hours for eight weeks.
all we have to do is teach them a few words in chinese
most of the residents under the supervision of monterey park police are chinese.
and most of them can't speak english while the policemen know nothing about chinese.
therefore language obstruct the communication when the police are on duty.
so all the chinese residents in the area won't keep walking when the police ask them to halt.
the kids love it and don't nod off and their parents say their chinese is getting better.
wherever i try to say something you disagree with you'll prepare a speech to retort.
you start with a kiss before you do "you know what"
you must train children's habit for study first then say other word
you say i'm unreliable but she thinks that i'm just independent.
you say i'm immature, but she thinks that is the cutest thing about me.
american girls, if they love you, they love you to death and they don't care if they chase after the guy.
chinese girls, they might like you, but they pretend that they don't
they think the'l i getjust saying that monica did something to me.
if she kept me guessing i would have said forget it.
monica and i met by chance, it's something you can want but you have to wait for it.
you need to be practical and find someone who is good enough, who has most of the things you want...
it would be a mistake to give it up for me.
it would be a mistake to give it up for me.
let me have a check to see any other part of your body is fake.
you know, i gotta say that i'm enjoying adulthood for a lot of reasons.
yeah, you know, doc, i gotta tell you, i feel a lot better.
well, we looked at your ekgs, ran some tests, did a complete workup.
in fact, we were forbidden to socialize with anybody who didn't have their tonsils.
that's interesting, because no one in my family has their tonsils.
i mean, what is he, up for a big job promotion down at the office or something?
afraid the boss is gonna catch this on tv and go:
maybe i could be, like, an announcer, like, a colour man.
you know how i always make interesting comments during the game?
on thursday when i came home, i had 1500 dollars on me.
for some reason, i decided to hide it in my laundry bag and then i completely forgot about it.
you go over there, you start flirting with him and i'll come by, and while you're keeping him busy i'll slip it in his drink.
wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?
of course, when it's over, it's hard to get used to all this clothing, you know.
so a lot of times i'll just lock the door to my office and i'll just sit there naked.
i'd also like to welcome back into the fold our little, shrimpy friend, george costanza who, although he really didn't have a very good year...
how you blew that mcconnell deal, i'll never know but, hey, what the hell, huh?
see, that's why i don't have cable, because of that naked station.
if i had that in my house, i would never turn it off.
thousands of years, people have tried to have their cake and eat it too.
so all of a sudden, the two of you are gonna come along and do it.
but the one thing i do know is, they're not happy if you don't spend the night.
it could be a hot, sweaty room with no air conditioning and all they have is a little army cot this wide.
okay, what about a nice frame with a picture of another guy in it?
the frame says, " i care for you, but if you want to get serious perhaps you'd be interested in someone like this."
i don't like to sit next to men on airplanes because our knees might touch.
i can't see joe dimaggio sitting at the counter at little, tiny, filthy, smelly dinky doughnuts.
i think it's because men know that deep down we have weak sales resistance.
we're constantly buying shoes that hurt us, pants that don't fit right.
a long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.
i remember you donated to some volcano thing on our first date.
like you'd make this donation for 50 bucks and i'd start tearing my clothes off?
those brave krakatoans east of java who sacrificed so much, for so long.
an old friend of mine, whom you may have met george costanza, has recently become intimate with a female accountant who was formerly a highly placed official with a little outfit known as the irs.
and as we speak, at this very moment he is handing over to her all of my pertinent tax information and she has assured us that the matter is well within her field of expertise.
my cousin douglas was in a place like this one time.
came over to my house for dinner, there was no soda and he went berserk.
and they don't do anything to keep your spirits up through the ordeal.
i think they should take all your receipts and put them in one of those big, lucite sweepstake drums and just kind of crank it around there.
of course when they say they're making up time obviously, they're increasing the speed of the aircraft.
now my question is, if you can go faster why don't you just go as fast as you can all the time?
if aliens are watching this through telescopes they're gonna think the dogs are the leaders.
if you see two life forms, one of them is making a poop the other one's carrying it for him...
well, you better pick up your dog tonight or he has humped his last leg.
i could understand if there was something else playing but it's this or nothing.
he says kinky things, because he's made out of wood and he can spin his head around.
we're somehow expected to believe because the face is so animated they think we're not noticing the feet are just swinging there.
they just give it to you and say, " bring it back when you're done."
reminds you of that pathetic friend everybody had as a kid that would let you borrow any of his stuff if you would just be his friend.
look, if you think this is about overdue fines and missing books you better think again.
this is about that kid's right to read a book without getting his mind warped.
so i get in the water in this thing, and it's, like, floating around me somewhere.
you ever put on a bathing suit that you don't know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit?
i mean what the hell do i care whether you have sponge cake?
because i saw the look on your face last week when i took the scotch tape.
between you and me, what the hell is this guy doing?
do you really need somebody waving a stick in your face to play the violin?
most of the time, you feel like you're in some depressing single guy's apartment from, like, 1975.
all that maroon velour furniture couple of bottles of wine, three cassette tapes.
there is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport.
sources tell me he is en route and should be arriving momentarily.
she took no responsibility for mutilating the property of a stranger and then she sped off like a criminal.
on the other hand should she never be allowed to date again?
- because i hate being at a table alone with a married couple talking about their married friends and their married furniture.
they're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better.
but he's such an unbelievable guy when he hits someone, he doesn't leave a note.
he sits in his car and waits for the other person so he can exchange license, registration and apologize.
once he passes on that option that "god bless you" is up for grabs.
no argument, unless she's one of these multiple sneezers and he's holding his "god bless you" in abeyance until she completes the series.
well, well, mr. seinfeld that must have been so frightening when you confronted that guy in queens.
now, let me just see if i've got the scenario right.
if it wasn't for you, i wouldn't have had an excuse to talk to her.
well, i'm happy to help in any way that i can.
he's getting $5 an hour to protect millions of dollars of priceless art, with what?
he's got a light mocha brown uniform and a usa today.
you wouldn't want that, because you always have to remain friends.
i like to remain friends with people i was friends with.
listen to this. " i don't know what you expect to find, jerry.
you know what you want better than me, but there's one thing i do know.
i can stand here watching you try to destroy everything i've ever wanted in my life wanting to smash your face with my fists because you won't even make the slightest effort to opt for happiness and still know i love you.
you mean so much to me, i'm willing to take your abuse insults and insensitivity."
"because that's what you need to do to prove i'm not gonna leave you.
i'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships.
did you ever sneak down to better seats at the game and get caught by the usher?
when you're a kid, you're getting chased from every place anyway.
maybe you ought to think about not getting the "hoof cut" once in a while.
what is it about sleep that mak es you so thirsty?
so instead of giving them to her, you give them to me.
unfortunately, when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers.
if i want my ass hanging out of the back of my parking spot that's my business.
there are people with real asses hanging out of their pants.
and there were these, like, this pack of extremely wild teenagers in a convertible behind us, okay?
and for some reason, i don't know, they just started to taunt us.
and then they followed us all the way into the city.
and then they stopped, and they turned around and they went home.
he could have pulled up to that car and backed in but he chose to go in headfirst.
no, he couldn't, because the other car was already backing in.
people will kill each other for a parking space in new york.
because they think, " if i don't get this one, i may never get a space."
you know. " i'll circle for months until somebody goes out to the hamptons."
everybody in new york city knows there's gotta be way more cars than parking spaces.
somebody who just has to appreciate being with me because he's so desperate.
i mean, it's gotten to the point where i'm flirting with operators on the phone.
i mean, if my mother weren't around, it wouldn't be so bad.
but, i'm telling you, if i'm not married by the time i'm 40, i'm gonna have to kill her.
i mean, women pluck their real eyebrows out of their head one by one until they're bald, jerry, bald above the eyes.
and then they paint in these eyebrows to look like that.
i've seen him lift 100 pounds over his head without even knowing it.
and you wouldn't know it to look at him, but george can bait a hook.
i think we should have, like, a secret signal with the druggist.
that you just walk into the drugstore, you go up to the counter.
i mean, you wanna fight with somebody, you fight with me.
oh, by the way, george, you know those condoms i gave you?
i think the whole airport-airline complex is a huge scam just to sell the tuna sandwiches.
i think that profit is what's supporting the whole air travel industry.
most of the time, you feel like you're in, like, some depressing single guy's apartment from, like, 1975.
all that maroon velour furniture, couple of bottles of wine, three cassette tapes.
there is a full house inside awaiting his arrival from the airport.
sources tell me he is en route and should be arriving momentarily.
police have set up barricades, but, quite frankly, bill and jean,
i don't think they're any match for the emotional fuse that has been lit here tonight.
you know the way they tuck the covers in real tight in those hotel rooms?
i can't sleep like that, so i tried to kick it out and i pulled it.
so i was watching this movie the other night, it was a world war ii movie, and, uh, there was nazis in the movie.
and i noticed that the nazis in those movies always had, like, two separate heils.
they had, like, the regular heil that they would do, and then they were...
when they were around the offices, they had, like, this casual heil.
[###] the payphone, the cordless phone, the multiline phone, the phone pager, the call waiting, call forwarding, call conferencing, speed dialling, direct dialling and the redialling is that we all have absolutely nothing to say,
and we've got to talk to someone about it right now.
on the other hand, does that mean she should never be allowed to date again?
you scratch one car and you're forbidden to have social contact for the rest of your life?
i hate being at a table alone with a married couple, talking about their married friends and their married furniture.
they're always trying to make me feel like their life is so much better than mine.
once he passes on that option, that "god bless you" is up for grabs.
no argument, unless she's one of these multiple sneezers, and he's holding his "god bless you" in abeyance until she completes the series.
well, well, well, mr. seinfeld, that must have been so frightening when you confronted that guy in queens.
now, um, let me just see if i've got the scenario right.
don't you love ads where you see, like, the woman in the bikini next to the 32-piece ratchet set, you know, and she's...?
you know, we'll be looking at the girl in the bikini, looking at the ratchet set going, "all right, well, if she's right next to the ratchet set, and i had that ratchet set,
he's getting $5 an hour to protect millions of dollars of priceless art, with what?
he's got a light mocha brown uniform and a usa today.
oh, well, you wouldn't want that, because you always have to remain friends.
well, i like to remain friends with people i was friends with.
"i don't know what you expect to find out there, jerry.
you know what you want better than me, but there's one thing i do know.
i know i can stand here watching you try to destroy everything i've ever wanted in my life, wanting to smash your face with my fists because you won't even make the slightest effort to opt for happiness and still know that i love you.
you mean so much to me that i'm willing to take all your abuse and insults and insensitivity."
"because that's what you need to do to prove i'm not going to leave you.
i'm sick and tired of running from places and people and relationships.
get away from the job, you camp out, you're with friends.
i mean, come on, it's a week-long game of hide and go seek on horseback.
yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from kramer he never would have taken his back from you and given them to me.
in which case, i wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.
you were gonna give her her spare keys, and she was gonna give them to me.
so all that's happening is, instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to me.
it's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give her hers.
because then she would have given them to me because she has mine.
they tell you it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the pa system:
"ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna be delayed here on the ground for a little while.
i'm doing things in this car, you have no idea they're going on.
want to see me make a right turn from the left lane?
and then they followed us all the way into the city.
and then they just stopped, and they turned around and they went home.
hey, just because i went in front-first doesn't mean i'm sneaking in!
you only went in front-first because you saw me backing up and you didn't have room to parallel park!
i only wish i could teach you, but, you know, it's inborn.
oh, by the way, thanks a lot for inviting me to the flea market.
see, they had to move the cars so the truck could get through, right?
but these guys don't trust each other, so they got these two nonpartisan drivers to move them.
because they think, " if i don't get this one, i may never get a space."
you know. " i'll be circling for months until somebody goes out to the hamptons."
well, what do you think, they put the statue on a giant raft and a tugboat pulled it all the way from france?
think they brought it in pieces and screwed it together like a coffee table?
i gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me when i started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon...
you know, because i've worked in a lot of offices and i tell you, people do that all the time.
but any kind of physical test, i don't know what it is i always click into this thing where i wanna do really well.
if it's gonna be a physical test, i wanna do well.
he was doing standup comedy in kennebunkport, maine in this really ominous nightclub.
the stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics off.
they can't get out of it by 24 hours, it's a land rush.
so if the coma victim wakes up in a month he's thrilled.
it is too small for someone with such a big mouth.
let me ask you what will you do if martin wakes up?
- george i would like to thank you for the greatest four days of my life.
they were shooting the sports illustrated swimsuit issue right in the hotel pool.
in fact, it's worse, because now they've found out here's one more thing you stink at.
that's why these people don't succeed at life to begin with.
well, i was gonna say, "why don't you get off with me."
but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort of lunatic, anyway.
i mean, only a sick, twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
well, you know, maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
even if this so-called mental defective did put something on her leg she's still the one who laughed.
probably someone is holding her back maybe against every fibre of her being.
if she wants to continue to have a fibre of her being, she'll be very careful.
you think people are gonna pay $80 a bottle to smell like dead fish and seaweed?
that's why people take showers when they come home from the beach.
only the female has it so the male has pouch envy!
"why should she have this huge pouch and i have nothing?
the only reason that you're getting in shape is that so you can get through the workout.
so we're working out so that we'll be in shape for when we have to do our exercise.
what exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes?
i'll give my car to any guy in front of a restaurant because he's got a short red jacket.
when you're in your 30s, it's very hard to make a new friend.
whatever the group is you've got now, that's who you're going with.
the spit then proceeds to ricochet off the temple, striking newman between the third and the fourth rib.
the spit then came off the rib made a right turn, hitting newman in the right wrist causing him to drop his baseball cap.
i told them i was very close to getting a job with vandalay industries and i gave them your phone number.
so when the phone rings you have to answer, "vandalay industries."
you know, it's one thing to not give me the extension.
but to tease and to torture me like this there's no call for that.
even if you get a job after you've been unemployed they take unemployment out of your check every week and show it to you in that little box.
how good can it be for your confidence that every paycheck has the word "unemployment" on it?
he's down there every week waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs.
if they had any idea the effort and energy that he is expending to avoid work, i'm sure they'd give him a raise.
jerry, i can't believe it took you so long to see the baby.
i kept saying to michael, "when is jerry going to see the baby?"
you know, i hate to brag but i did win 11 straight gold gloves.
i wouldn't have brought it up, but since you mentioned it.
well, i'd watch the third-base coach if i were you because i don't think he's waving you in.
you know, i hate to say this but i really think that we're hitting it off.
i was turning to say something and as i turned around i saw roger mcdowell behind the bushes over by that gravelly road.
anyway, he was talking to someone, and they were pointing at you.
maybe because we were sitting in the right-field stands cursing at him in the bullpen all game.
he must have caught a glimpse of us when i poured that beer on his head.
the only ones you could really ask to help you with a big move like that.
and the casket is that great, perfect box you've been looking for your whole life.
if you had, like, suction-cup feet, then you could just walk right up on it.
then you could tell, you could be on it going, "all right, i'm here.
they're not at some mall in jersey watching their friends trying to find the world's cheapest air conditioner.
you should see what my father used to do before he bought a new car.
what i care about is the sanitary condition of the parking facility.
why would i do it unless i was in mortal danger?
you know, i've been issued a public urination pass by the city because of my condition.
unfortunately, my little brother ran out of the house with it this morning.
well, i once saw this thing on tv with people who are terminally ill.
every one of them believed that the secret of life is just to live every moment.
i had a bottle of very tepid water and i poured it out.
i could see how you made a mistake because pouring water out sounds very much like a person urinating.
well, what happened was my father was staying with one of china's great military leaders general chang, who, by the way, came up with the recipe for general chang's chicken.
the one with red pepper and orange peel at szechwan gardens?
may i say you have a splendid establishment here, my friend.
i'm sure you'll flourish at this location for many, many years.
you know, how, like, the big toe is, like, the captain of the toes.
but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so big that there's, like, a power struggle.
what do the chinese have to gain by faking a cure for baldness?
if it was real, they'd never let it out of the country.
i told you he went to the track that one time and he was yelling at this jockey.
and the jockey got off the horse and started chasing him.
and he plays an airline pilot who's just returned from rome.
and i'm about to show him how much i've missed him.
what the hell is he doing he can't be on the floor with you and me?
brain surgeons, airline pilots, nuclear physicists, we're on the same level.
i don't wanna think about it, i don't ask to think about it, but i think about it.
i go to bed, i tell myself, " don't think about the nose." i think about it.
i have never been so repulsed by someone mentally and so attracted to them physically at the same time.
it's like my brain is facing my penis in a chess game.
"we're going to perform a cue ball-ectomy on you, mr. johnson.
we're going to attempt to remove the skinheadia of your chromedomus, which is what we...
wouldn't it be nice to have a car alarm that was more subtle?
maybe just, you know, somebody tries to break in, and it goes:
yeah, it looked like you were in a real conversation over there.
well, we do have a compact if you would like that.
i've got him chewing, but i don't think he's gonna swallow.
let's put a few cookies in a blender and he could drink it.
what do you think first aid was like hundreds of years ago?
i mean, they had no medicine, no drugs no technology, no equipment.
- "the commotion also delayed production of a woody allen movie that was shooting up the block.
a spokeswoman for the legendary filmmaker said that mr. allen was extremely agitated and wondered if his days of shooting movies in new york were over."
but at this point in my life, i'm not really sure that i'm ready to make a commitment to one person.
i'm just not really sure that we have enough in common.
- then i took a swig of beer and i slammed the glass down on the bar, and it shattered.
well, one of the pieces must've hit woody and he started crying.
the best part of being sick is when you're in a relationship.
but if i got married, you know those vows for richer or for poorer, for better or for worse.
not even rolling and you look out the window, you see gum clearly.
but we know that in the future, traffic will get even worse than that.
and then the verbal hellos stopped and we just went into these little sort of nods of recognition.
so fine, i figure, that's where this relationship is finally gonna settle.
am i supposed to wear a kerchief put stockings on rolled below my knee?
the other thing is, if you don't like anything he takes it back.
i get to the top of the wall, the front door i open it up, i'm one foot away.
i take one last look around the penitentiary, and i jump!
i don't know, i was just in one of those moods so i said to myself, " marlene, just do it." and i jumped in.
as i'm getting out, i feel all these eyes on me.
you don't want to be in the largest room that they have.
you ever see these operating theatres that they have with, like, stadium seating?
that's hard to get used to when you're on so many fast ones.
apartment elevators are always slower than offices because you don't have to be home on time.
women need to like the job of the guy they're with.
if they don't like the job, they don't like the guy.
she made me fly from florida for this, and then she criticizes my jacket.
at least come and say hello, have a cup of coffee, then you leave.
i mean, in all the pictures i saw of immigrants on boats i never saw one of them sitting on a pony.
but why would anyone come here if they had a pony?
i mean, they got the guy in a suit, with a pillow.
now, is he going to a meeting, or is he catching 40 winks?
leave the winter clothing in the apartment and i'll watch it for you.
and i'll live there, and i'll make sure that nothing happens to it.
i remember saying to myself, "why is jerry so far off the base?"
i'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.
look, i feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job.
let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish your résumé and undergo a series of gruelling interviews.
i just wanted to let you know that i'm really sorry that happened.
and if i can help out in any way, i'll certainly be glad to do that.
i told him i've been having my period the last five days.
and i'm sleeping all squished over on the edge of my bed.
for 5 bucks, he turned me onto the rockaway boulevard shortcut.
now look, his plane leaves at 10: 15, we're getting up at about 8.
- and the same night of the accident while looking for paquita i find a job in a restaurant where they pay me almost twice what i was making before.
and, when i returned to the apartment paquita, perhaps frightened from the explosion had miraculously returned.
she was aiming at me, like she was putting out a fire.
so for the rest of the show i'm sitting there with chocolate all over me.
you'll have the whole thing installed by the time you get back.
no, every time i turn on a tv, sirens are gonna go off.
i think fear of flying is quite rational, because human beings cannot fly.
humans have fear of flying, same way fish have fear of driving.
- well there were fire engines and ambulances all on the runway.
and then when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.
well, you know, there are many differences between american and soviet cultures that you're not aware of.
see, in russia, the cable guy, they got the whole run of the house.
if you're around and i'm around i'll see you around that area.
you'll be around other people, you won't be around me but you will be around.
when i leave the house in this it's with a whole different confidence.
like, tonight i might've been a little nervous, but inside this jacket i am composed, grounded, secure that i can meet any social challenge.
now i am standing outside and i am freezing, but i cannot leave because i gotta tell him what happened to the car.
so finally, finally, he comes down with this giant cage filled with doves.
he said he was getting instructions, that each dove has a different diet.
so we're wandering around, trying to get a cab when two of these doves fly out.
and worst of all, i don't have the time to say it.
the only excuse she might possibly have accepted is if i told her i am, in reality, batman.
and they serve you this different food that you never saw before.
and they put it in front of you and it was such a delicious and exciting adventure.
my uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister to me.
you should've just had dinner with him tonight and gotten it over with.
and it's like, you know, they're spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and i'm standing there, " maybe i'm putting too much ice in mine."
so then, as we were leaving we were just kind of standing there, and she was smiling at me.
because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them.
the guy will be like, " i don't think her eyebrows are even.
it would have cost him $15,000 so he waited outside the guy's house.
when the guy came home, he went with him and switched the tape.
if you could just leave a message, i could walk away."
i also have a cordless phone, but i don't like that as much.
i just look for a lump with two slots in it.
looks like a pig is trying to push his way through from the other side.
i don't know if you should sit for this or not.
sitting is good if you faint but standing is good for jumping up and down.
oh, elaine, you know the way i am rarely ever thinking of myself.
my only concern is the welfare and happiness of those close to me.
i think life would be a lot better if it was like you're always making a movie.
you mess up, somebody just walks on the set and stops the whole shot.
now he says that if your friend has $5000, we'll give it to her.
that's a lot of money but if that's the way it's gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be.
you know, i used to think that the universe is a random, chaotic sequence of meaningless events.
but i see now that there is reason and purpose to all things.
have you ever gotten up in the morning and felt that it's great to be alive?
that every breath is a gift of sweet life from above.
hey, jerry just got me a great apartment in his building.
well, jerry, it'll be nice to have a close friend nearby.
i've actually heard of single guys who wear wedding bands to attract women.
you would have to be a real loser to try something like that.
who, in this situation, would be more likely to make a mistake?
me, who had access to my wallet, knew exactly what was in there or you?
well, i knew the exit on the long island expressway and i thought that the address was 8713 riviera drive.
so i drove around knocking on everybody's doors that had those numbers.
i figured i'd give you a break see what it's like to hang out with someone in show business.
listen, i'm really sorry, but i'm just on my way out to meet a friend.
now we sleep together and suddenly i don't know how to talk to her.
every time i go to the bathroom, i pass her desk.
then afterwards i sit in my office and analyse how it went.
if it was a good conversation, i don't go to the bathroom the rest of the day.
it's been sitting there for three years until he saw it.
all right, so just take what you want, and let's get it out of here.
you realize how crazy he had to be to do this?
he knew i was gonna know it's missing and that he took it.
if you really want, maybe i can contact the guy in singapore.
have him make a photostat of the receipt and send it over.
they have no record of a ray thomas at that school, you liar!
that is because i am registered under my full legal name raymond thomas wochinski.
say you got a big job interview and you're a little nervous.
well, throw back a couple of shots of hennigan's and you'll be as loose as a goose and ready to roll in no time.
oh, but i grabbed onto his leg, screaming for him to give me the sweater, and he dragged me through the streets.
and then he kicked me with the other foot and he threw some change at me.
i tell you, i gotta plead ignorance on this thing because if anyone had said anything to me at all when i first started here that that sort of thing was frowned upon...
you know, because i've worked in a lot of offices and i tell you, people do that all the time.
but, in a way, i think i inadvertently turned this guy into an alcoholic.
and i hate being around alcoholics because they're either telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you.
and those are the two statements that scare me the most.
but i think he's okay now because i have no idea how he feels about me.
but any kind of physical test, i don't know what it is,
i always kind of click into this thing where i wanna do really well.
you know, if it's gonna be a physical test, i wanna do well.
you know, like, remember when you were in school and they'd do those hearing tests?
it is too small for someone with such a big mouth.
let me ask you, what will you do if martin wakes up?
well, then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my closet?
are you going to walk me to a cab or not?
well, it would take a hell of a lot, because a friend is something you earn.
okay, jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the cayman islands this weekend.
okay, you can take the b or the f and switch for the n at broadway and lafayette.
or you can go over the bridge to dekalb and catch the q to atlantic avenue, then switch to the irt, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
well, i was going to say, "why don't you get off with me."
but you're obviously very busy on your way to some important meeting or something.
into the stretch, with an 1/8th of a mile to go, stepagain, passionel battling it out.
they're clear from jamet, pappernick is starting to mak e some ground, but stepagain is the leader.
i mean, only a sick, twisted mind could be that rude and ignorant.
well, you know, maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her leg.
only the female has it, so the male has pouch envy!
"why should she have this huge pouch and i have nothing?
the other thing i don't get about it is why we're so careful about locking up our dirty towels and smelly jockstraps.
what exactly is the black market on these disgusting gym clothes?
i'll give my car to any valet guy in front of a restaurant because he's got a short red jacket.
"yeah, he must be the valet guy." i don't even think about it.
why did he come over to me if he didn't want to see me?
i mean, here i meet this guy, this great guy, this ballplayer, best guy i ever met in my life.
when you're in your 30s, it's very hard to make a new friend.
whatever the group is that you've got now, that's who you're going with.
you remember when you were a little kid, what are the qualifications?
"if someone's in front of my house now, that's my friend.
unfortunately, the immutable laws of physics contradict the whole premise of your account.
allow me to reconstruct this, if i may, for ms. benes, as i've heard this story a number of times.
you know, it's one thing to not give me the extension.
but to tease and to torture me like this, there's no call for that.
this guy has never worked this hard in his life to keep this thing going.
he's down there every week waiting on the lines and getting interviewed and making up all these lies about looking for jobs.
jerry, i can't believe it took you so long to see the baby.
i kept saying to michael, "when is jerry going to see the baby?"
well, uh, i'd watch the third-base coach if i were you, because i don't think he's waving you in.
you know, i hate to say this, but i really think that we're hitting it off.
i was started to turn around to say something, and as i turned around,
i saw roger mcdowell behind the bushes, over by that gravelly road.
and the casket is that great, perfect box you've been looking for your whole life.
the only problem is, once you find it, you're in it.
if you become sick or injured you'll need a strong constitution or plenty of luck to survive even if you are president of the united states.
it's been a few decades since the french scientist louis pasteur discovered the microscopic creatures we call bacteria and demonstrated that these germs could cause many illnesses.
though the scientific community knows that germs cause disease they don't completely understand how they're spread and they certainly don't know how to destroy them.
in the early morning hours of june 27, 1899 a ship sails into san francisco bay ending a fateful voyage from hong kong.
at the u.s. quarantine station on angel island a delegation of health officials anxiously awaits the ship's arrival.
two passengers aboard may have died from the dreaded bubonic plague.
if it's true, the ship cannot be allowed to reach the mainland.
angel island is san francisco's bastion of defense against infectious diseases.
all immigrants must first pass through these hallways to be examined and disinfected.
anyone who shows signs of illness could be quarantined or sent back home.
there was a great deal of fear and anticipation in san francisco that the plague was going to invade the west coast.
in fact, the plague had already begun in china 30 years earlier and had moved down the coast to cities like canton and hong kong with which we had a great deal of commercial traffic as well as immigration traffic.
at angel island, the ship is quarantined by the u.s. government's top bacteriologist, joseph kinyoun.
assuming that plague bacteria is spread person to person kinyoun quarantines the mostly asian passengers and crew.
ike his colleagues i he also believes plague bacteria thrive in dirt and can be spread to human dwellings by vermin.
so he orders the ship fumigated with steam and poisonous sulfuric sprays.
fearing imprisonment the ill stowaways escape during the night and try to swim to san francisco.
early the next morning their corpses are found floating in the harbor.
on march 6, 1900, the chinese year of the rat the body of chic gin, a chinese merchant is found in the basement of a cheap hotel.
an autopsy confirms everyone's worst fears-- the plague has struck in chinatown.
accusing the chinese of being foul spreaders of disease the city jumps into action.
policemen string a heavy rope around the 15 square blocks of chinatown.
to their surprise, chinese san franciscans discover they are now prisoners to their surprise, chinesin their own homes.iscover guards are assigned to keep residents from spreading the disease to the white community.
armed with crowbars and disinfectants posses systematically raid and fumigate every house destroying the worst of the slums.
aging fires spread in 1906, a devastating earthqthroughout the city.isco.r more than a thousand people die.
rats, disoriented by the earthquake swarm through the streets and the plague strikes again.
rats had always been associated with plague outbreaks but now scientists understand their role in transmitting the disease.
researchers in india noticed that plague-ridden rats and human victims were both covered with flea bites.
when they found plague bacteria in the saliva of fleas the connection was made.
fleas were biting diseased rats and then transmitting the plague bacteria when they bit humans.
the victims develop reddish, rough skin that often appears as a butterfly-shaped rash.
as the disease progresses patients become confused, hallucinate and finally go insane.
at the time it was a mystery disease and pey theories about what caused it.
the most prominent theory was that it was caused by eating corn.
and there were other people who thought that it must be carried by an insect.
this was fairly early on in the bacteriological revolution and so some people thought that it was carried by a bacteria but no one knew what caused it, and there was great panic.
everywhere he travels, the picture is strikingly similar-- working in cotton fields and textile mills suffering from the disease.
goldberger visits insane asylums e institutions where alarming numbers of new cases are being reported.
one would think that if this were a germ disease the germs certainly wouldn't be aware of status boundaries.
why would only the inmates get pellagra and why never a nurse, a physician or a teacher?
and he began to look at what people ate and he was horrified at what he saw because the diet was so miserable-- not like anything he had ever seen before.
it was the diet of the southern frontier consisting primarily of cornbread and so increasingly as he went from institution to institution, uh, observing goldberger became convinced that he was dealing with some sort of nutritional issue, but not a germ disease.
he also knows that diseases like scurvy and beriberi have been linked to vitamin deficiencies and he suspects pellagra may be the same kind of disease.
goldberger decides to test his theory at two orphanages full of pellagra victims in jackson, mississippi.
and lo and behold, much to his own delight the children who had pellagra got well when their diets were changed and those who didn't have pellagra didn't contract pellagra after their diets were changed.
well, that was all well and good but it certainly wasn't scientific evidence and goldberger was very much aware of that.
it's like proving a negative and they just couldn't h that.
some of them may have taken offense also at the fact that his criticism of the diet implied a criticism of the southern way of life.
he persuades the governor of mississippi to pardon any convicts who volunteer for a controlled diet experiment.
he chooses the ranking prison farm because there ra and plenty of room to isolate the convicts from germs.
instead of eating the vegetables from the prison garden what they're now going to be eating is what other impoverished southerners eat-- cornbread, cornmeal, corn mush, occasionally some pork.
in short, he's going to switch their diet in such a way that it will be the diet that he has observed pellagra victims eating
when he links pellagra to jobs that don't pay enough for people to eat well southerners hear only his social criticism not his medical reasoning.
goldberger, the scientist, is stunned by what he sees as total irrationality.
he hasn't found the answer when death comes atge of 53 from another mystery disease, cancer.
he died a disappointed man because pellagra was more prevalent in 1929 than it had been in years and he thought that he was a failure.
of course, people still get sick a lot and when they do, they have mostly these to turn to.
here is cooper's new discovery for indigestion, rheumatism for blood disease, fever and chills, male and female problems and if that isn't enough, it also removes worms.
using x-rays and laboratory tests science is carefully studying the body now.
beginning to understand science is carefully our internal organs, our glandse sbeginning to understand science is carefully our intcalled "hormones" glandsr ate so muchto understand science is carefully our of our inner chemistry.regul but how we can use this knowledge
of all the ways our bodies can betray us few are as terrifying as diabetes.
the disease strikes some when they are young others when they grow old.
slowly, the victim slips into a deadly coma that doctors are powerless to halt.
no one can explain this breakdown of the body's internal chemistry but it's reasoned that if diabetics cannot tolerate food perhaps they can survive by eating less.
and there are terrible stories of diabetic patients stealing hot food from ovens burning their hands to do it eating toothpaste and birdseed left in their rooms.
but if you starved yourself carefully you could buy another year or two of life but it was not a very satisfactory life.
elizabeth and her parents can only pray for a scientific breakthrough to save her.
a glimmer of hope comes when researchers discover that a gland in the abdomen, called the pancreas plays an important role in the disease.
because diabetics have a high level of sugar in their blood scientists wonder if their disease is being triggered by the gland's failure to produce this internal secretion.
almost immediately, attempts are made to isolate this substance in hopes of curing the disease but by 1920, no one has succeeded.
then a young canadian surgeon named frederick banting stumbles across an article about the relationship between diabetes and the pancreas which gives him an idea.
he goes to toronto university and meets with an internationally known expert on the metabolism of carbohydrates, j.j. macleod.
although banting has no background for this type of research he proposes a new approach to the problem.
banting's idea is to tie off the pancreatic ducts leading to the small intestine so the cells making the digestive juices will atrophy and die.
then only the pancreas's "internal" secretion will be actively produced, making it easier to isolate.
intrigued, macleod agrees to give banting ten dogs to experiment on a tiny lab the services of a research assistant, charles best and a few mont on the problem.
you have to imagine working in a laboratory in sweltering weather without air conditioning.
imagine a couple of enthusiastic young researchers trying to operate on dogs the sweat pouring off their bodies dripping into the wounds of the dogs...
finally, after weeks of fumbling banting and best manage to make an extract they hope will contain the internal secretion.
they inject it into the dogs whose pancreases have been removed and who are now severely diabetic.
it will be hours before the researchers will know if the injection has lowered the dogs' high level of blood sugar.
when they measure the level again it's gone down dramatically a sign that the extract is working.
he also wanted some money because he was working for nothing and was broke.
um... wanted his research to have the highest priority in j.j.r. macleod's lab.
macleod was not prepared to do this because the results were not yet at anything like that level of credibility.
so banting and macleod, at the end of the summer of 1921 had a terrible confrontation with banting finally saying to macleod:
macleod saying, "dr. banting, as far as you are concerned iam the university of toronto."
best remembered banting coming out of the meeting frothing best remembered banting coming at the moutheetinglly saying, "i'll show the little son of a bitch that he isnot the university of toronto."
but to carry out the new experiment banting and best will need far more of the internal secretion than they presently have.
in a desperate move, banting grinds up pancreases obtained from the local slaughterhouse and tries to isolate the internal secretion by cooling and separating it with alcohol solvents.
surprisingly, this simple method gives him the supply of extracts he needs.
the exhausting months of tying off pancreatic ducts have been totally unnecessary.
but dog 33 is alive and well even after 70 days of injections.
theorizing that dog 27 was killed by impure extract macleod suggests bringing biochemist j.b. collip onto the team.
on january 11, without collip's knowledge banting prepares his own version of the extract.
it will be given to a 14-year-old diabetic boy named leonar.
banting hopes the injection will lower the boy's high level of blood sugar.
but when it fails to work and causes a reaction the experiment is halted.
it's the first successful use of insulin on a human diabetic.
amazingly, sadly the great breakthrough on leonard thompson was followed by the utter breakdown of relat of the research team as collip went to banting and best in the lab and said
how could researchers on the brink of a great discovery like this-- a discovery that really is of global importance-- how could they turn into wrestling children?
somebody had talked about patenting the discovery and as often in science teamwork, co is all very good until immortality, glory and dollars start to intrude.
he had blended and filtered, concentrated and diluted distilled and evaporated never making the same batch of extract twice and now he has trouble recalling what he has done.
as the first store of insulin runs out the team is besieged by dying patients.
they put aside their differences and work together in the lab.
three months and countless combinations later they regain the ability to make insulin but still only in small quantities.
one doctor, stunned by the resurrection of his patients evokes the biblical story of ezekiel:
"i will bring flesh upon you, put breath in you and you shall live."
four months later, she seems like a healthy, normal girl with years of life ahead of her.
yet of all banting's grateful patients his most memorable is elizabeth hughes who had barely clung to life.
in boston, dr. elliott joslin is one of the first american specialists to be supplied with insulin.
he endorses it as one of the greatest discoveries of the century-- the beginning of a new epoch in medicine.
joslin is among the first to realize that insulin has transformed diabetes from a fatal disease to a chronic one.
he warns that the era of coma and death has given way to the era of complications.
he teaches his patients that the disease can only be held at bay by strict diet, constant testing and a rigid schedule of injections.
but there's no mistaking the elation that although diabetes cannot be cured it can at least be tam.
and this gave not just doctors more confidence in what they were doing but it gave patients a greater confidence in what medicine could do for them and it immeasurably boosted the image of medicine in the eyes of the public.
by now, when a doctor comes to your house-- yes, there are such things as house calls-- he comes with a few real remedies in his leather case.
but the elusive prize for medical science is to find something that can cure people after they've gotten sick.
since the days of pasteur, researchers have searched for substances that could kill bacteria-- the germs that cause infections ranging from pneumonia to blood poisoning all of which can be life-threatening.
the fields in northern europe, in belgium, flanders-- these were richly fertilized fields and richly fertilized fields are rich in micro-organisms which, when they come in contact with exposed wounds cause deadly infections.
it's said that probably more soldiers died from infection than died from direct bullet or shell injury.
fleming went off at the end of july every year for summer holidays in the north of scotland, and july 1928 was no exception.
he tidied up his laboratory before leaving, of course and in doing so, he took all the plates that he'd been growing bacteria on and he stacked them in a bath of antiseptic.
professor fleming was examining colonies of bacteria when he came upon one which had gone moldy.
round the mold, the jelly was clear as if the mold were preventing the bacteria from growing.
he manages to recover just enough to test on the kind of surface-wound infections he saw during the war.
in the broth in the laboratory didn't produce enough penicillin to cure infections by applying it topically.
when world war ii breaks out, soldiers on both sides are given sulfa powder to carry into battle.
if injured, they're told to sprinkle it directly on the wound to thwart the growth of bacteria.
but sulfa proves ineffective against a number of infections and sometimes causes severe reactions.
the man who will take up the challenge is howard florey chairman of the pathology department at oxford university.
florey hires a biochemist, ernst chain who has recently fled from nazi germany.
they begin exploring natural substances that can kill bacteria when they chance upon fleming's ten-year-old article on penicillin.
on may 25, 1940, while britain prepares for another night of air raids the oxford team attempts the experiment fleming never tried.
they inject a group of mice with a fatal dose of streptococcus bacteria.
they would run around for a bit, they'd sleep for a bit and if you clicked your fingers, they'd wake up.
the researchers involved certainly had a strong feeling that they were on the brink of something major.
the team actually took some of the spores of the penicillium and rubbed it into their clothing under the lapels of their jacket so that if britain was invaded they could flee perhaps to america or somewhere else where they could begin the research all over again.
ople working with the penicillin at oxford certainly had tremendous faith in it.
none of the sulfa drugs had helped and he was really at death's door and so he was given penicillin and within a couple of days, the effect was noticeable and he made great progress for five days and then the penicillin ran out.
the urine of the policeman had been collected taken back to the laboratory over the proceeding days and they'd recovered penicillin which was unchanged in the urine and purified it as best as they could in those days and re-injected it.
despite the tragedy, a new batch of penicillin completely cures infections in the next five patients...
but it has taken 19 ress working night and day for months florey knows that if the drug is to save thousands he will have to get help.
he finds it in america where government agencies and pharmaceutical companies figure out how to go from tiny quantities to mass production.
on the eve of d-day, 1944 millions of units have been produced and stockpiled.
the allies now have enough penicillin to treat all their battle casualties in the invasion of europe.
they can treat difficult wounds that once would have led to amputation or death.
by mid-century, the crippling disease polio is so feared that some parents lock their children away during the summer months when the risk of infection is greatest.
but before long, a new life-saving polio vaccine joins penicillin in what the public assumes will be a long line of medical breakthroughs.
our confidence seems to be well founded when polio is virtually wiped out in western countries.
so continuous is the string of new vaccines and antibiotics that many observers predict an end to all infectious diseases in the foreseeable future.
the carnage of world war ii forces surgeons to try risky procedures to save the battlefield wounded.
one of the most dangerous involves soldiers with bullets and shell fragments lodged in the chambers of their hearts.
few surgeons hto a heart out of fear it might suddenly stop.
going against conventional wisdom a young army doctor dares to try.
he cuts a small hole in the wall of the heart and secures it with stitches.
then, blindly by touch, as the heart still beats he locates and removes the metal fragments.
within days, his first group of soldiers recovers proving that the human heart is not too fragile for surgery.
buoyed by harken's success postwar doctors hope to save thousands of children born with defective hearts.
but these people were dying because these defec center of the heart.
you cannot reach them from the outside and there was no way of sewing in a blood-filled heart that was beating until you empty the heart.
he knows that the fierce canadian winter acts to slow down the hearts of hibernating animals allowing them to survive months without food.
so he tries to get the same effect by chilling dogs and discovers that he can operate on their slowed hearts for more than four minutes.
this convinces lillehei and his colleagues that hypothermia might work on humans as well.
after months of preparation the minnesota surgeons are ready to try.
a dying girl is wrapped in a special blanket that cools her body temperature 17 degrees below normal.
the doctors have ten minutes to empty her heart of blood locate the hole and make the repair.
many times the diagnosis was incorrect and the surgeon would be standing there looking at a very complex congenital heart anomaly with only ten minutes to carry out some kind of an operative maneuver.
and if you went colder with the body to get more time to protect the brain, you could not restart the heart.
in an attempt to gain more time to operate lillehei tries an even more audacious procedure called cross-circulation.
he connects the blood vessels of a dying child with those of his parent.
while the father's heart pumps the child's blood lillehei has all the time he needs.
but this is a desperate operation few surgeons dare to try because of the risk it poses to the healthy parent.
invented by surgeon john gibbon, it has taken decades to perfect.
by 1956, lillehei is so confident of its effectiveness he dares to repair the heart of a child on.
if a valve is damaged beyond repair an artificial one can be put in.
if arteries are blocked, they can be bypassed or replaced thus diminishing the major cause of heart attacks.
in boston, doctors at the peter bent brigham hospital take the first tentative steps.
the hospital is already a pioneer in the use of dialysis machines that cleanse the blood of patients with kidney disease.
but for those whose kidneys have permanently failed dialysis is the last stage before death.
in a final attempt to save these patients the brigham doctors try transplanting kidneys taken from cadavers.
transplants of skin had been tried during world war ii but only skin from the victim's own body would take.
when foreign skin was transplanted the body's immune system destroyed it as if it were an infectious invader.
then in 1954, richard herrick comes to the brigham dying of kidney failure.
he's accompanied by his identical twin, ronald whose kidneys are a genetic match to his brother's.
the hope is that one of ronald's kidneys will be accepted by richard's immune system.
but surgeon joseph murray knows that even the idea of removing an organ from a willing donor is highly controversial.
we had to plan a major surgical operation to remove one kidney not for his good but for somebody else's.
now, the good lord has given us two kidneys and we knew that we could live on one kidney.
but it so basically and profoundly violates what physicians are trained to do-- do no harm.
in this case, you harm a healthy person and turn that person into a patient because you have submitted him or her to a major surgical procedure.
they were mostly young and if we didn't do it, who was going to do it?
and it was the plight of the patients, i think that really kept us going.
richard's new kidney works perfectly proving that transplantation is possible for identical twins.
as news of the operation spreads twins in similar circumstances rush to the brigham.
and we entered a very unhappy period that i've called the "black period"
when patients were sent to us from all over the world who needed a kidney but who'd had no identical twin.
we were on what i called the "knife-edge of survival"-- tip one way, the kidney would reject tip another waradiation.
was probably going to turn out to be a drug a chemical compound-- it might be a very simple chemical compound-- that would alter the patient's immunology so that the patient would be, you might say fooled into thinking that the kidney belonged there.
it describes a family of anticancer drugs that unexpectedly suppress the immune system.
at the brigham doctors wonder if the drugs will prevent rejection and begin experiments on animals recovering from transplants.
when the dogs remain alive after a year the team feels ready to test the drugs on humans.
when people start surviving as well patients dying of kidney failure besiege the brigham and other hospitals.
i think there was a big lying contest that was going on particularly in kidney transplantation where the results with cadaver kidney transplantation were really terrible.
the national average survival of kidneys at one year was 45%.
that means 55 out of every 100 cadaver kidneys that were transplanted were lost within the first year and almost half within the first six months and yet many centers were claiming high rates of success.
personally, i thought at that time that kidney transplantation was more like a disease than a cure.
because the margin between effective therapy and fatal complications was so narrow-- right in that zone between the two were found a number of new diseases.
and here you have exotic new infections with new viruses never previously seen in humans.
from a few ounces of soil gathered in norway's remote tundra comes a fungus containing cyclosporin.
the new compound would be vastly more successful at preventing the rejection of transplanted organs.
programs that had abandoned transplants were springing up again and everybody was getting good results.
and it did something that i had almost begun to despair would never be possible.
the problems in solid-organ transplant are not the medical and technical ones anymore.
the problems today are that we don't have enough organs for the people who could benefit from transplantation.
we once thought if wewould be lifted.ctionans but there are too few organs to save all the people who need them.
some patients still suffer severe complications and others just don't make it.
but many people who once faced death are living reasonably full lives now grateful for the gift of transplantation.
as surgeons performed ever more miraculous feats other scientists were asking new questions about the nature of human illness searching for reasons why our bodies fail in the first place.
it's a quest that leads medical science to the very core of our being.
by 1953, james watson and frcis crick had already unraveled the structure of dna-- the molecule that makes up our chromosomes and genes.
many scientists saw genes as a critical piece of the puzzle that explains how our bodies function what we inherit from our parents what makes us individuals and perhaps what makes some of us terribly sick.
when medical researchers turn their attention toward diseases that mysteriously spring up within us, like cancer-- which is ravaging more and more people each year-- some suspect that genes are involved but no one knows how.
throughout the 20th century the number of cancer cases has grown steadily and alarmingly.
but one of the most baffling trends is the rise in lung cancer.
some experts theorize that pollution from industry or automobiles may have something to do with the increase.
but there is no proof for this or any other theory.
roads had been tarred and we knew that fumes from tar could be carcinogenic and if i'd had to bet
i would have bet it was something to do with the tarring of roads and with motorcars.
they'd begun smoking earlier in life they had less often given up smoking.
and then when we looked around the world, we found countries where cigarette smoking had been common for some years lung cancer was common.
exposure to asbestos, certain chemicals even too much sun can cause cancer.
meanwhile, doctors try radiation in addition to surgery in an effort to cure the disease.
the disease develops when the body's blood-producing center, the bone marrow creates an excessive group of malignant white blood cells-- here, the large purple ones.
they quickly crowd out and destroy other cells in the marrow including platelets, which help the blood to clot and normal white blood cells, which help prevent infection.
in 1949, dr. sydney farber of boston'stal begins to experiment with a radical new approach to fight the disease.
because leukemia is characterized by the overproduction of white blood cells farber looks for any substance that might impair their growth.
he knows that soldiers exposed to mustard gas suffered such severe damage to their bone marrow that it destroyed their white cells.
farber experiments with mustard compounds leukemia patientsriments with mustard compounds but the chemicals prove too poisonous to use.
that is, their anemia went away their white count came up to normal they could resist infections, they did not have bleeding.
and when the marrow was looked at after three or four weeks very often the marrow was free of leukemia cells and they entered complete remission and that was the good news, that was spectacular that was, in fact, a miracle.
the bad news was that unfortunately all of the patients relapsed.
because the drug they receive does not destroy all the leukemia cells left in their bodies.
they want to expand on farber's work by experimenting with additional drugs and they want to lengthen the course of treatment.
but testing becomes impossible because the children die too soon either from infections or excessive bleeding.
uh, if you had five patients like that in a ward of 20 patients it was chaotic, it was enormously difficult.
you could pack the nose in front, pack it in back but that was traumatic and often when the packs were removed the bleeding started again and psychologically the...
the leukemia team learns how to stop the bleeding by transfusing platelets from family members.
they also administer regular doses of antibiotics which halt the infections.
now children are living long enough to test the experimental drugs.
using farber's compound and a new drug simultaneously the team anxiously monitors the effect on their patients.
now, that's an extraordinary achievement if you think of it in terms of the context of the time.
these were kids who came in destined to die of their disease and to have 90% of them turn over and go into complete remission have the disease completely disappear in three to four weeks was the thing that i think persuaded me
despite these setbacks the team has made a critical breakthrough in their understanding.
using four powerful drugs, they administer all of them simultaneously over several months.
the regiment is difficult to tolerate and patients suffer greatly from so many toxic chemicals in their bodies.
but by the mid-'60s, though no one knows it yet about 40% of these pioneering children will survive long enough to be called cured.
the main reason is that chemotherapy is not working nearly as well on the deadliest adult cancers like those of the lung and breast.
in truth, the treatment has always been a blunt instrument that happens to kill somecancer cells.
it became increasingly apparent that if we were to create a new generation of anticancer drugs we'd have to figure out what makes cancer cells grow or rather, what makes them grow abnormally and at that time, virtually nothing was known
about the origins of human cancer-- the motors that drive the unceasing proliferation of cancer cells.
d discovery the revolution in this field came in 1975, 1976 when harold varmus and j.
michael bishop discovered that within normal cells there lay genes which, when they became damaged would now begin to instruct a cell to grow unceasingly;
what bishop and varmus discovered is one gene from a special group we are all born with called proto-oncogenes.
over one's life-span proto-oncogenes help normal cells to reproduce like these in the skin.
we may have inherited an abnormal form from our mother or from our father-- that's a hereditary mutation.
we may have a mutation result during our lifetimes because we encounter environmental factors that change the structure of our dna or we may simply suffer the results of the error-prone process that our cells must undergo to divide.
we'd be amoebae or something, however we started because we couldn't have evolved.
so viewed in that context cancer is a side effect of evolution.
although we now know how cancer begins we have yet to find new cures.
but throughout the century once science has truly understood a disease it has, more often than not, found ways to overcome it.
they're already slowly coming on-line and in the first decade of the next century we're going to be able to reap some of the fruits of this enormous amount of information we gained the last quarter of this enormous amount ofof the 20th century.ed in
although we're still waiting for new cancer remedies modern ms already given us the potential for a life that's longer and healthier than ever before.
there are medicines now that seem to be holding at bay the symptoms of some aids patients.
for everyone, the's better diagnostic equipment that can detect disease early enough to cure it.
in a regional hospital in northern ghana patients die of liver failure just as they do in the west but no one in this hospital expects a transplant.
throughout the century scientific medicine rarely reached places like west africa and life expectancy lagged far behind the developed nations.
but modern medicine is beginning to make an impact here even if its benefits are sometimes hard to see.
every morning, villagers of savalagu must travel a well-worn path to the local pond.
throughout this region people are still plagued by infectious microorganisms and dangerous parasites long vanquished in the west.
and water, so precious to life, can harbor germs that disable and even kill with depressing regularity.
this pond is savalagu's only source of drinking water the worms can grow several feet inside a person's body and cause a painful swelling when they are about to emerge.
victims can suffer for weeks at a time unless they get relief by having the white threadlike worms removed at the local clinic.
today, northerana is one of the last remaining homes of guinea worm disease.
but the parasite is on the verge of extinction mainly through the efforts of donald hopkins.
diseases like malaria, which are spread by insects may never be eliminated entirely.
but illnesses that rely on people to spread infection are more susceptible to eradication.
hopkins has traveled the world over teaching villagers and health workers how to filter guinea worm parasites from their water.
he also warns people to stay away from ponds when they have emerging worms.
the decline of guinea worm disease is just one indication of an extraordinary transformation in the health of many developing nations around the world.
not only is medical aid reaching more people but better nutrition and a declining birth rate are also starting to make a difference.
i'm very much heartened by the progress that we've seen over the last ten years over the last five years and a much longer perspective than that.
i've seen many more children immunized now, for example than were being immunized five years ago.
we're on the verge of eradicating polio within about five years of that, we think.
we have many more communities having access to safe drinking water.
it has been the less visible products of medical science-- the vaccines, prenatal care and basic health services-- that have made the biggest impact on the lives of people here just as they did in the west earlier in the century.
lacking most of medicine's more expensive technologies many people in developing nations are now routinely living to their 70s-- quite a change from just a few decades ago.
as people everywhere grow older societies will be challenged to care for an aging population.
but at the start of the century, many of us died in infancy and few of us ever reached our 70s.
but he saw all of the 1950s and then he saw all of the 1960s and incredibly he saw all of the 1970s and then he saw all of the 1980s and the amazing thing is he's now seen the majority of the 1990s.
i think one of the most remarkable things of this century of science has not been what happens in an emergency room or in an intensive care unit or in the laboratory.
so the information given to the average person to run their average day can actually affect what happens to them in the future.
and at the beginning of the century we were struggling just to get scientific knowledge.
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event!
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall before it is gutted and completely renovated as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight is the swan song for this storied hall.
the final event to be held here before it is gutted..
and now, the distinguished secretary of defence of the united states of america, mr charles kirkland.
and seated next to him is a man that needs no introduction.
someday if i manage to get my face on tv a few times, maybe i'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as i want to go.
because i was made for this sewer, baby, and i am the king!
i seriously wonder just how seriously the champ is taking this fight.
the champ has shown up here tonight in the worst condition of his career.
i can't see if it's opened up a cut over his eye or not.
we saw it in the holyfield-tyson match, and we see it here.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.
i get assigned, i step out of position, the secretary takes a bullet in the throat.
i'm not some beat cop that needs you to plant a piece for him.
kevin, if there's one thing i know, it's how to cover my ass.
if we're first contact when the feds get here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
we just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
look, you don't know what this would mean to me, rick.
you think i want to do this, this pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life?
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
the people that set this up said if i dropped this one, they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
i had to take a punch, fall back into the corner, let him charge in and knock me out because they wanted everybody up on their feet, distracted, giving him a clear shot right through the count.
but that punkass son of a bitch didn't sweep through the punch, and i was so far into the act in my own head, you know, by the time i realized he didn't connect, i was already in the corner.
commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please?
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
i'm betting the redhead is the person who told tyler to throw the fight.
she's one, shooter's two, tyler's three, the drunk who shouted the signal's four, and whoever was on the other end of that radio is five.
you know, 'l fly into the arms of allah', shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel, and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
it's light years ahead of the sea sparrows our ships have now.
i've been tracking its results for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
i need you to look at the heat flashes here at the moment of impact.
if the airguard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
the airguard doesn't work, and the... but they're pushing it through anyway.
i know what they're thinking we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
production of the airguard missile system will go ahead in accordance with secretary kirkland's wishes.
when the renville took that iraqi missile hit below decks, do you know what happened?
a hole ripped open in the bulkhead, and the sea flooded in.
atlantic city's new police hero, received a special valour award for heroism from mayor frank sanchini.
the mayor extended the public's thanks to santoro for his lifesaving efforts on behalf of julia costello, the powell aircraft researcher who exposed the deadly conspiracy that led to the assassination of defence secretary charles kirkland.
there are gonna be all sorts of indictments up and down the administration, and things have really changed.
i know you may not wanna see it right now, but it's true.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall before it is gutted and completely renovated as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
i'm eager to go ringside along with 14,000 fight fans who have braved hurricane jezebel to-- [ man ] cut!
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event.
well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel...
someday if i manage to get my face on tv a few times, maybe i'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as i want to go.

plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
i had to take a punch, fall back into the corner, let him charge in and knock me out because they wanted everybody up on their feet, distracted, giving him a clear shot right through the count.
but that punkass son of a bitch didn't sweep through the punch, and i was so far into the act in my own head, you know, by the time i realized he didn't connect, i was already in the corner.
commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please?
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
you don't get out of bed unless there's an angle in it for you.
guys get elected president just for being in the right place at the right time.
the problem is that i was in too good a mood.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
i was three feet away from a known terrorist, and i had my eyes buried in some broad's tits.
well, kevin, this might not make you feel better, but don't you see?
we go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
we gotta get our hands on the redhead or the guy that shouted the signal.
[ silenced gunshot ] [ thunder rumbling ] [ man ] we got 1,500 cameras-- 800 on the casino side,
720 on the hotel side, quadruple redundancy on the gaming floor.
secretary of defence charles kirkland is in critical condition at the atlantic city medical center after being struck by an assassin's bullet while attending a boxing match at the atlantic city arena.
we've been getting live updates from the only reporter allowed inside the arena, a lou logan of powell pay-per-view television-- ## [ hard rock ] - [ shouting, laughing ]
i've been tracking its results for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
the south jersey worker we are interested in tonight is the atlantic city executioner.
[ julia ] so i decided to wait until the fight started.
i need you to look at the heat flashes here at the moment of impact.
if the airguard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
the airguard doesn't work, and the... but they're pushing it through anyway.
i know what they're thinking-- we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
bert powell's out of his mind. - [ cel phone ringing ]
if you deploy that weapons system and a war breaks out--...
yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
production of the airguard missile system will go ahead in accordance with secretary kirkland's wishes.
what do you know about being a good soldier, the guy who finds an envelope full of cash in a squad car every friday?
what do you think i've been doing for the last ten years?
the press starts looking for dirt on you, and they will, it'll be a mud slide.
forget about your job, your sweet life in margate. - [ groans ]
- [ crackling ] just may be a hurricane after all.
[ thunderclap ] - [ electricity crackling ] [ crackling ] [ groaning, grunting ]
atlantic city's new police hero, received a special valour award for heroism from mayor frank sanchini.
the mayor extended the public's thanks to santoro for his lifesaving efforts on behalf of julia costello, the powell aircraft researcher who exposed the deadly conspiracy that led to the assassination of defence secretary charles kirkland.

[woman] good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event!
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall... before it is gutted and completely renovated... as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event.
well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight... as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel... lashes the boardwalk outside the grand old atlantic city arena.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for this storied hall.
the final event to be held here before it is gutted--
i call a few guys i know from annapolis, arrange some interviews, get you a g.s. rating, you're in our programme.
bureau of diplomatic security pays double what your salary is here, and the money's clean.
i pulled rank on regular detail and took command of security.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.
if we're first contact when the feds get here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
[sighs] we just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
look, you don't know what this would mean to me, rick.
you think i want to do this, this pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life?
what with us both being from the same school and both being sea devils and all.
the man head-butted me, and i don't remember anything after that.
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
in order to exit the arena, we must see an authentic picture i.d.
if you cannot produce one, you must step to the left... where the officer will take your photograph... and record your name and address.
he's in pretty heavy at some of the casinos, isn't he?
and some people are saying that maybe he's looking to clean up the books a little.
the people that set this up said if i dropped this one, they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.

he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.

guys get elected president just for being in the right place at the right time.
the problem is that i was in too good a mood.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test... for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
now, the newest missile, the airguard, i've been tracking its results... for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland... telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
- copy. - there would be one dot, but there's two every time.
the target blows up, but the airguard never gets within ten metres of it.
the airguard doesn't work, and the company knows the system doesn't work, but they're pushing it through anyway.
i know what they're thinking-- we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
at this time i'd like to extend my deepest sympathies... to the secretary's family...
[louder] and to the nation... and to the people that he so faithfully and proudly served.
what do you know about being a good soldier, the guy who finds an envelope full of cash in a squad car every friday?
what do you think i've been doing for the last ten years?
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall... before it is gutted and completely renovated... as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
i'm eager to go ringside along with 14,000 fight fans... who have braved hurricane jezebel to..
we gotta go live on this one, so don't screw it up.
and al, i think that's powell going in there with secretary kirkland.
well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight... as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel... lashes the boardwalk outside the grand old atlantic city arena.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for this storied hall.
and now, the distinguished secretary of defense... of the united states of america, mr charles kirkland.
and seated next to him is a man that needs no introduction.
maybe if she knew... the rules, she could play the game too.
listen, if angela knew the rules, there would be no game.
i call a few guys i know from annapolis, arrange some interviews, get you a g.s. rating, you're in our programme.
bureau of diplomatic security... pays double what your salary is here, and the money's clean.
i pulled rank on regular detail and took command of security.
i told them the secretary... would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of... the arena and the local law enforcement.
they're gonna try and muscle us, but we're not gonna let that happen.
if we're first contact when the feds get... here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
fbi's gotta come from trenton, so that's an hour, maybe an hour and a half with the storm.
so we just gotta fight these... guys for an hour and a half, and you're in the clear, okay?
now, you want to help, you go tell your men to get all the media outta here right now!
unless you want the 9:00 news... to give the secretary's wife and kids... a close-up look at his internal organs.
hey, if you're gonna be on tv, who better asking you the questions... than your old pal lou?
plus, i can have two grand cash in an hour and a half.
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
what about if the guy from... the commission comes in here, he wants to check your gloves.
what are you gonna do, retire and live on your savings?
he's in pretty heavy at some of the casinos, isn't he?
and some people are saying that... maybe he's looking to clean up the books a little.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last six years.
he's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters... written to various defense secretaries... expressing outrage... over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to israel.
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, i have no other information at this time.
that's all i can say until the f.b.i. joins the investigation.
you don't get out of bed unless there's an angle in it for you.

when the renville took that iraqi missile hit below decks, do you know what happened?
a hole ripped open in the bulkhead, and the sea flooded in.

you know, they say back 200,300 years ago... pirates put phoney lighthouses right out by those big rocks, right out there.

[ thunderclap ] [ woman ] good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event !
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall... before it is gutted and completely renovated... as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event.
well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight... as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel...
see, when we have these little visits, i allow you, i permit you, - [ groaning ]
- i give you the opportunity... to pay for all the extra police work that you create. - [ panting ] - [ groaning continues ]
maybe if she knew the rules, she could play the game too.
listen, if angela knew the rules, there would be no game.
someday if i manage to get my face on tv a few times, maybe i'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as i want to go.
because i was made for this sewer, baby, and i am the king !
what they came to see tonight was a professional heavyweight championship fight, and that is not what they're getting, and you better believe they are letting these fighters know it.
you know, i seriously wonder just how seriously the champ is taking this fight.
i can't see if it's opened up a cut over his eye or not.
we saw it in the holyfield-tyson match, and we see it here.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.
i get assigned, i step out of position, the secretary takes a bullet in the throat.
i'm not some beat cop that needs you to plant a piece for him.
kevin, if there's one thing i know, it's how to cover my ass.
if we're first contact when the feds get here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
[ sighs ] we just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
it's atlantic city, new jersey, and that belongs to me !
i'm acting case agent until relieved by appropriate federal authority !
now, you want to help, you go tell your men to get all the media outta here right now !
unless you want the 9:00 news to give the secretary's wife and kids... a close-up look at his internal organs.
nobody goes in or out till the main investigating party gets here.
you're the one who told them to seal the doors ?
hey, i could see why you want these other assholes outta here, but i didn't think you were talking about me too !
- you know what kind of break this is for me ?
hey, if you're gonna be on tv, who better asking you the questions... than your old pal lou, huh ?
plus, i can have two grand cash in an hour and a half.
don't pretend like you don't know who i am, girlie man.
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
in order to exit the arena, we must see an authentic picture l.d.
if you cannot produce one, you must step to the left... where the officer will take your photograph... and record your name and address.
what about if the guy from the commission comes in here, he wants to check your gloves.
what are you gonna do, retire and live on your savings, huh ?
you actually come to tell him there's a lot of action against him ?
- then you have the nerve to accuse him of what ?
the people that set this up said if i dropped this one, they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last six years.
he's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters... written to various defence secretaries expressing outrage... over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to israel.
commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please ?
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
i'm betting the redhead is the person who told tyler to throw the fight.
she's one, shooter's two, tyler's three, the drunk who shouted the signal's four, and whoever was on the other end of that radio is five.
you know, "l fly into the arms of allah," shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel, and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
so what's the problem ? the problem is that i was in too good a mood.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test... for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
- [ silenced gunshots ] i was three feet away from a known terrorist, and i had my eyes buried in some broad's tits.
well, kevin, this might not make you feel better, but don't you see ?
we go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
we gotta get our hands on the redhead or the guy that shouted the signal.
[ thunder rumbling ] [ man ] we got 1,500 cameras-- 800 on the casino side,
720 on the hotel side, quadruple redundancy on the gaming floor.
we've been getting live updates from the only reporter allowed inside the arena, a lou logan of powell pay-per-view television- **** [ hard rock ] - [ shouting, laughing ] could you hold it down in there ?
people are trying to sleep ! [ newscaster continues ] we've also learned that rabat left a suicide note... which was found on his body by police in the moments after the shooting took place. **** [ disco ] [ sighs ] ohh. **** [ disco continues ]
now, the newest missile, the airguard, i've been tracking its results... for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland... telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
the south jersey worker we are interested in tonight... is the atlantic city executioner.
[ julia ] so i decided to wait until the fight started.
i know what they're thinking-- we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
but i am telling you, you're the one that's gonna be sorry.
did it feel important when the bullet hit ? i had no choice.
i can't live with the blood of innocent soldiers on me, okay ?
- yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
production of the airguard missile system will go ahead... in accordance with secretary kirkland's wishes. -[ tv clicks off ]
when the renville took that iraqi missile hit below decks, do you know what happened ?
a hole ripped open in the bulkhead, and the sea flooded in.
don't you think angela would like a few nice things for once in her life ?
don't you think she deserves them ? [ whispers ] i never killed nobody.
you just tell me where she is... and never hear another word about her.
one million dollars. [ crowd cheering ] i know that's a whole shitload of money, but...
let's go. [ thunder continues ] [ grunts ] [ groans, coughs ]
[ metal creaking ] [ banging, whirring sound ] [ thunder continues ] [ screams ]
- well, it looks like tropical storm jezebel... - [ crackling ] just may be a hurricane after all. - [ thunderclap ] - [ electricity crackling ] [ crackling ] [ groaning, grunting ] we are live on the boardwalk.
as you can see behind me, the huge metal globe... that is the emblem of the powell millennium lies shattered.
- i am commander kevin dunne, -[ cop #1 ] i suggest you drop it now !
and this woman is a threat to the security of the united states.
oh, get them outta here ! [ male announcer ] today in brighton park, richard santoro,
atlantic city's new police hero, received a special valour award for heroism... from mayor frank sanchini.

you know, i seriously wonder just how seriously the champ is taking this fight.
the champ has shown up here tonight in the worst condition of his career.
i can't see if it's opened up a cut over his eye or not.
we saw it in the holyfield-tyson match, and we see it here.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.

we go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
we gotta get our hands on the redhead or the guy that shouted the signal.
all right, you do that while i check with security, see if they found anything.
well, i finally understand why you didn't want me to worry about your shooter.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland... telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
yesterday, i got it, and i told him that i wanted to give it to him in person.
i need you to look at the heat flashes here at the moment of impact.
- if the airguard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
- there would be one dot, but there's two every time.
the target blows up, but the airguard never gets within ten metres of it.
we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
but i am telling you, you're the one that's gonna be sorry.
i mean, we were creating a defence system that was supposed to save people's lives.
they're building the factory in a disadvantaged part of the state.
i can't get past the men at the doors by myself, but with you i'd be fine.
you get me outside, you don't have to think about me again.
you're positive he's the one you saw with rabat before the shots were fired?
- let me tell you a little something about kevin dunne.
what do you know about being a good soldier, the guy who finds an envelope full of cash in a squad car every friday?
what do you think i've been doing for the last ten years?
you know, they say back 200,300 years ago... pirates put phoney lighthouses right out by those big rocks, right out there.

don't pretend like you don't know who i am, girlie man.
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
in order to exit the arena, we must see an authentic picture l.d.
if you cannot produce one, you must step to the left... where the officer will take your photograph... and record your name and address.
what about if the guy from the commission comes in here, he wants to check your gloves.
what are you gonna do, retire and live on your savings, huh ?
you actually come to tell him there's a lot of action against him ?
- then you have the nerve to accuse him of what ?
the people that set this up said if i dropped this one, they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last six years.
he's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters... written to various defence secretaries expressing outrage... over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to israel.
commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please ?
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
i'm betting the redhead is the person who told tyler to throw the fight.
she's one, shooter's two, tyler's three, the drunk who shouted the signal's four, and whoever was on the other end of that radio is five.
you know, "l fly into the arms of allah," shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel, and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
so what's the problem ? the problem is that i was in too good a mood.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test... for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
- [ silenced gunshots ] i was three feet away from a known terrorist, and i had my eyes buried in some broad's tits.
well, kevin, this might not make you feel better, but don't you see ?
we go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
we gotta get our hands on the redhead or the guy that shouted the signal.
[ thunder rumbling ] [ man ] we got 1,500 cameras-- 800 on the casino side,
720 on the hotel side, quadruple redundancy on the gaming floor.
we've been getting live updates from the only reporter allowed inside the arena, a lou logan of powell pay-per-view television- **** [ hard rock ] - [ shouting, laughing ] could you hold it down in there ?
people are trying to sleep ! [ newscaster continues ] we've also learned that rabat left a suicide note... which was found on his body by police in the moments after the shooting took place. **** [ disco ] [ sighs ] ohh. **** [ disco continues ]
now, the newest missile, the airguard, i've been tracking its results... for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland... telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
the south jersey worker we are interested in tonight... is the atlantic city executioner.
[ julia ] so i decided to wait until the fight started.
i know what they're thinking-- we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
but i am telling you, you're the one that's gonna be sorry.
did it feel important when the bullet hit ? i had no choice.
i can't live with the blood of innocent soldiers on me, okay ?
- yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
production of the airguard missile system will go ahead... in accordance with secretary kirkland's wishes. -[ tv clicks off ]
when the renville took that iraqi missile hit below decks, do you know what happened ?
a hole ripped open in the bulkhead, and the sea flooded in.
don't you think angela would like a few nice things for once in her life ?
don't you think she deserves them ? [ whispers ] i never killed nobody.
you just tell me where she is... and never hear another word about her.
one million dollars. [ crowd cheering ] i know that's a whole shitload of money, but...
let's go. [ thunder continues ] [ grunts ] [ groans, coughs ]
[ metal creaking ] [ banging, whirring sound ] [ thunder continues ] [ screams ]
- well, it looks like tropical storm jezebel... - [ crackling ] just may be a hurricane after all. - [ thunderclap ] - [ electricity crackling ] [ crackling ] [ groaning, grunting ] we are live on the boardwalk.
as you can see behind me, the huge metal globe... that is the emblem of the powell millennium lies shattered.
- i am commander kevin dunne, -[ cop #1 ] i suggest you drop it now !
and this woman is a threat to the security of the united states.
oh, get them outta here ! [ male announcer ] today in brighton park, richard santoro,
atlantic city's new police hero, received a special valour award for heroism... from mayor frank sanchini.
** just one kiss from the shadow ** ** could be the touch of an angel **
** just one kiss is all that you need ** ** you'll never leave sin city **
the final event to be held in this storied hall before it is gutted and completely renovated as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
i'm eager to go ringside, along with 14,000 fight fans who have braved hurricane jezebel to--
we got to go live on this one, so don't screw it up.
and, ai, i think that's powell going in there with secretary kirkland.
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event.
the lucky ones are already inside at the fight, as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel lashes the boardwalk outside the grand old atlantic city arena.
i gotta put up front for the privilege of betting on a fight?
take it or leave it because i don't need the aggravation.
you see, when we have these little visits, i allow you i permit you, i give you the opportunity to pay for all the extra police work that you create!
doesn't it feel nice to contribute to society for a change?
--the olympic games, and now the distinguished secretary of defense of the united states of america, mr. charles kirkland.
and seated next to the secretary is a man who needs no introduction...
man, i'm so impressed, i want to get your autograph or something.
i can picture us like yesterday, working summers on the beach...
make a hole through there and get that crowd out of the way!
tell them to bring that ambulance right through the main entrance into the arena tunnel!
i pulled rank on the regular detail and took command of security.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation because i know the area.
if you're gonna be on tv who better asking you the questions than your old pal lou, huh?
plus i can have two grand cash in an hour and a half.
oh, yeah, and see if you can find me another shirt.
if i'm going on tv, i don't want to look like this.
lincoln, you hurt my feelings, and after i dropped 10 grand on you.
i think it would show more respect if you addressed my client as mr. tyler.
the man head-butted me, and i don't remember anything after that.
excuse me, would you drink a glass of water or something?
you wanted it to look like a knockout but when you heard the gunshot, your eyes were open.
totally understandable reaction but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
the people that set this up said if i drop this one they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog it would set me up for a rematch.
but that punk-ass son of a bitch didn't swing through the punch.
and i was so far into the act in my own head, you know by the time i realized he didn't connect i was already in the corner.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last 6 years.
he's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters written to various defense secretaries expressing outrage over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to israel.
you know, "i fly into the arms of allah" and shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
we go out there and yell conspiracy, it's like waving a lunatic flag.
we got to get our hands on the redhead or the guy that shouted the signal.
the identity of the assassin is tarik ben rabat, 37 years old.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last 6 years.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
you remember, i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
two i knew you could be bought if anything went wrong.
no offense, pal, but i never thought you'd get as far as you did.
i had to go below and give the order to dog the hatches.
that meant the 28 men that were still in the main engine space were trapped.
today in brighton park, richard santoro atlantic city's new police hero, received a special valor award for heroism from mayor frank sanchini.
the mayor extended the public's thanks to santoro for his lifesaving efforts on behalf of julia costello the powell aircraft researcher who exposed the deadly conspiracy that led to the assassination of defense secretary charles kirkland.
good evening, everyone, and welcome to a powell pay-per-view television event!
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall before it is gutted and completely renovated as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight is the swan song for this storied hall.
the final event to be held here before it is gutted..
and now, the distinguished secretary of defence of the united states of america, mr charles kirkland.
and seated next to him is a man that needs no introduction.
someday if i manage to get my face on tv a few times, maybe i'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as i want to go.
because i was made for this sewer, baby, and i am the king!
i seriously wonder just how seriously the champ is taking this fight.
the champ has shown up here tonight in the worst condition of his career.
i can't see if it's opened up a cut over his eye or not.
we saw it in the holyfield-tyson match, and we see it here.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.
i get assigned, i step out of position, the secretary takes a bullet in the throat.
i'm not some beat cop that needs you to plant a piece for him.
kevin, if there's one thing i know, it's how to cover my ass.
if we're first contact when the feds get here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
we just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
look, you don't know what this would mean to me, rick.
you think i want to do this, this pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life?
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think?
the people that set this up said if i dropped this one, they'd square everything i owed.
plus, if i lose to an underdog, it would set me up for a rematch, and the rematch is where the real money is.
i had to take a punch, fall back into the corner, let him charge in and knock me out because they wanted everybody up on their feet, distracted, giving him a clear shot right through the count.
but that punkass son of a bitch didn't sweep through the punch, and i was so far into the act in my own head, you know, by the time i realized he didn't connect, i was already in the corner.
commander, could you give us the condition of the secretary, please?
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
i'm betting the redhead is the person who told tyler to throw the fight.
she's one, shooter's two, tyler's three, the drunk who shouted the signal's four, and whoever was on the other end of that radio is five.
you know, 'l fly into the arms of allah', shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel, and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
it's light years ahead of the sea sparrows our ships have now.
i've been tracking its results for the past couple of months, and they are perfect.
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
i need you to look at the heat flashes here at the moment of impact.
if the airguard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
the airguard doesn't work, and the... but they're pushing it through anyway.
i know what they're thinking we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.

the mayor extended the public's thanks to santoro for his lifesaving efforts on behalf of julia costello, the powell aircraft researcher who exposed the deadly conspiracy that led to the assassination of defence secretary charles kirkland.
there are gonna be all sorts of indictments up and down the administration, and things have really changed.
i know you may not wanna see it right now, but it's true.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for the grand old atlantic city arena, the final event to be held in this storied hall... before it is gutted and completely renovated... as part of gilbert powell's millennium hotel and casino.
i'm eager to go ringside along with 14,000 fight fans... who have braved hurricane jezebel to--
we gotta go live on this one, so don't screw it up.
and, al, i think that's powell going in there with secretary kirkland.
well, the lucky ones are already inside at the fight... as the first taste of tropical storm jezebel... lashes the boardwalk outside the grand old atlantic city arena.
it's hard to believe, but tonight's heavyweight fight... is the swan song for this storied hall.
see, when we have these little visits, i allow you, i permit you,
- [ groaning ] - l give you the opportunity... to pay for all the extra police work that you create.
maybe if she knew the rules, she could play the game too.
listen, if angela knew the rules, there would be no game.
someday if i manage to get my face on tv a few times, maybe i'll run for mayor or something, but that's as far as i want to go.
because i was made for this sewer, baby, and i am the king !
what they came to see tonight was a professional heavyweight championship fight, and that is not what they're getting, and you better believe they are letting these fighters know it.
you know, i seriously wonder just how seriously the champ is taking this fight.
i told them the secretary would be better protected with me running the operation, because i know the area, the layout of the arena and the local law enforcement.
i get assigned, i step out of position, the secretary takes a bullet in the throat.
you followed a suspicious character, and when you got up here, you saw an assassin fire, so you took him out, end of story.
rick, leaving my post is dereliction of duty. lt's gross negligence.
if we're first contact when the feds get here, everybody writes from our report, and your story holds up because we say so.
[ sighs ] we just gotta keep all the media outta here till then.
it's atlantic city, new jersey, and that belongs to me !
i'm acting case agent until relieved by appropriate federal authority !
now, you want to help, you go tell your men to get all the media outta here right now !
unless you want the 9:00 news to give the secretary's wife and kids... a close-up look at his internal organs.
nobody goes in or out till the main investigating party gets here.
you're the one who told them to seal the doors ?
hey, i could see why you want these other assholes outta here, but i didn't think you were talking about me too !
- you know what kind of break this is for me ?
look, you don't know what this would mean to me, rick.
you think i want to do this, this pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life ?
what with us both being from the same school and both being sea devils and all.
the man head-butted me, and i don't remember anything after that.
let's keep that in mind, or this little interview that we're having here is over.
- look, the guy-- the secretary-- he's dead, isn't he ?
you wanted it to look like a knockout, but when you heard the gunshots, your eyes were open in half a second.
totally understandable reaction, but it ruined the performance, don't you think ?
in order to exit the arena, we must see an authentic picture l.d.
if you cannot produce one, you must step to the left... where the officer will take your photograph... and record your name and address.

but that punkass son of a bitch didn't sweep through the punch, and i was so far into the act in my own head, you know, by the time i realized he didn't connect, i was already in the corner.
a palestinian who's lived in the united states for the last six years.
he's believed to be linked to a series of threatening letters... written to various defence secretaries expressing outrage... over the sale of missile systems and other weaponry to israel.
he was taken to atlantic city medical center, but, uh, i have no other information at this time.
that's all i can say until the f.b.l. joins the investigation.
you know, "l fly into the arms of allah," shit like that.
he was all worked up about our missile sales to israel, and it's conceivable that he found out about the norfolk test.
that trip to norfolk was for a weapons test... for the airguard, powell's new antimissile defence system.
it's light years ahead of the sea sparrows our ships have now.
i was three feet away from a known terrorist, and i had my eyes buried in some broad's tits.
well, kevin, this might not make you feel better, but don't you see ?
[ tv newscaster ] secretary of defence charles kirkland... is in critical condition at the atlantic city medical center... after being struck by an assassin's bullet... while attending a boxing match at the atlantic city arena.
we've been getting live updates from the only reporter allowed inside the arena, a lou logan of powell pay-per-view television- ?
these tests are never perfect, so i knew something was wrong, but i didn't know who i could trust.
i sent an anonymous e-mail to secretary kirkland... telling him that i suspected that these results were doctored.
he actually wrote me back, and he told me to get him proof.
yesterday, i got it, and i told him that i wanted to give it to him in person.
[ julia ] so i decided to wait until the fight started.
and i had no idea where they were sitting, so i went up top to get a better view.
i need you to look at the heat flashes here at the moment of impact.
- lf the airguard had made full intercept like it's supposed to,
- there would be one dot, but there's two every time.
the target blows up, but the airguard never gets within ten metres of it.
the airguard doesn't work, and the company knows the system doesn't work, but they're pushing it through anyway.
i know what they're thinking-- we get it approved now, say we're sorry and fix it later.
i mean, we were creating a defence system that was supposed to save people's lives.
they're building the factory in a disadvantaged part of the state.
i can't get past the men at the doors by myself, but with you i'd be fine.
you get me outside, you don't have to think about me again.
- yeah, now that i think about it, i think i could be wrong.
um, you remember i told you that my glasses, they had fallen off, and i couldn't quite focus.
at this time i'd like to extend my deepest sympathies... to the secretary's family...
[ louder ] and to the nation... and to the people that he so faithfully and proudly served.
i want you to know that in spite of what's happened here tonight, we are not deterred.
production of the airguard missile system will go ahead... in accordance with secretary kirkland's wishes.
what do you know about being a good soldier, the guy who finds an envelope full of cash in a squad car every friday ?
what do you think i've been doing for the last ten years ?
don't try to make a hero out of me. lt won't fit.
if i hadn't put a face to you, things probably would've gone a whole lot different.
for the last few months... a northerly wind has brought foul smells to the area.
we investigated this and discovered that it began... when your factory's discharges started to discolor the canal water.
our don wanted to co-exist in peace with the other families.
i just had to make sure the plebs paid the squeeze.
bettering myself with books that no one i know can possibly appreciate.
i find myself hating them more and more until i think well, maybe it's time to run away again."
now, the good dr. wexler says that you made your pickup and then somehow you got lost between there and here.
now, i want the money and i want whoever put you up to it.
you must be referring to your people running all over town looking for poor mr. koo.
with all that concern i can only assume he suffered some misfortune?
ms. kelsky here is just worried that someone of means was pulling her bagman's strings.
we should be flattered that she thinks of me in this manner.
personally, i find it impressive how apt she is in her work.
she should do well in the world without even reading my book.
he was awfully upset about that fiasco yesterday and i know you did everything you could to make us look bad.
i just wanted to tell you that it's a great day to be me mostly because i'm not you.
he did it when you were pressuring koo to name names.
just one bullet proves their loyalty to you and wipes out the trail to the money.
if it were me, we'd have to kill you, nick and whoever was left.
if it were you, we could start pulling things back together right now.
i worry that i won't be able to rely on her.
i worry that she's trying to play me for a sucker.

and now, young warriors you have been chosen to wrest the sword from evil hands and return it to its rightful place.
i love grandpa and karate is way cool but next year i'll be 15.

i think it's time to put old grandpa on the shelf like gi joe and buzz lightyear.
i'm afraid our young ninjas have found new thresholds to cross.
if you uphold the way of the closed fist, respect courage, trust, honour, teamwork, you'll always be heroes to me.

there's one main entrance to the park, here on the north side.
the perimeter is covered with a 10-foot fence prohibiting all other access.
"b" squad will be here, at the pumping station, our point of entrance.
three roving patrols will wander through the park to take care of any troublemakers.
in any case, it's my first day on the job and i'm afraid i'm all thumbs.
what would happen if i increased raging waters' speed another 20 miles an hour?
unless you cough up the dough by 3.,00 p.m you'll be broke.

it was your idea to traipse through a dozen swamps to get to this god-forsaken place!
why couldn't you just leave your horse in a barn like a normal person?
a landslide has blocked the route that the rest of the men were to use to join us.
they'll have to take a detour and that could take a while.
would you go out there and flex a little warrior muscle, please, and maybe kill something?
we're doing all we can to avert an all-out war with the scythians.
it was your idea to traipse through a dozen swamps to get to this god-forsaken place!
why couldn't you just leave your horse in a barn like a normal person?
they thundered into town on horseback cutting down everything in their path.
i tried to stop 'em, but, of course, i was outnumbered.
we're doing all we can to avert an all-out war with the scythians.
but in the unlikely event that you will be called upon to act you'll need to use one of these.
his place is the only one in town that isn't damaged.
my guess is he's already sent out a messenger and a scythian assassin is on his way.
how did you end up out here, if you don't mind me asking?
i couldn't find a spot to settle last night so i ended up crashing on the ferry and before i knew it, she was moving and when we landed i just started roaming around the town.
i offer a quick shower, and now we' re harboring a fugitive.
fugitives who give you bread after you smash their heads in.
if you come to my house, and do what you did then you have to accept the following challenge:
delay your windy departure until this evening so that i may match this formidable feast with a modest meal of my own; the victor be determined by the eminent culinary critic alexis chandler weinberg whose impeccable taste has only grown more precise and unforgiving over the years.
those were the departing words of a unique woman of courage for whom the struggles of life had become too much to bear.
let me implore you, however amidst your sorrow to remember little lexie chandler the incarnation of pure innocence and wondrous joy bounding barefoot along the rocky shores of dark harbor.
how was i lucky enough to meet a guy like you?
well, i guess we were at the right place at the right time.
a couple years from now we'll be going to bed at 9:00.
brad has spent every available moment with samantha for the last month.
she's thinking about being in tv, she wants to see what it's like to tape a live show.
brad, do you think maybe you're moving a little fast in this relationship?
double-edged, swivel head, disposable, and a wide array of electric shavers.
but for the purist, nothing beats the cut of a straight edge.
what if they're getting married because they want to get pregnant?
she probably just wants to get a hold of the taylor fortune.
how could you even think about getting married at your age?
mom, samantha and i love each other and we want to build a life together.

and i am thrilled to get the chance to thank him personally.
general hammond, request permission to beat the crap out of this man.
as much as i don't trust maybourne, i have to admit, timothy is the best.
and he gave me his word he was gonna help teal'c.
with every passing moment, he is ceasing to be a... a jaffa.
the larva may be the only thing... ..that's holding that transformation back.
i'll remove myself when you tell me how they do tattoos like that in chulak.
the skin is cut with an orak knife... ..and molten gold is poured into the wound.
the insect's venom actually converts the body's mass into its own dna material.
but a human's - or a jaffa's - total matter... ..is far greater than one of the insects' natural mass.
so, every person who's stung could turn into about ten bugs.
now, we don't have an exact time on the incubation, but...
his pouch had started to close, but we were able to reopen it.
the goa'uld is back where it belongs, and it seems to be doing ok.
yes, he is, and he's going to get the very best help available on this planet.
but your facility is not equipped for this kind of situation, and you know it.
as much as i don't trust maybourne, i have to admit, timothy is the best.
and he gave me his word he was gonna help teal'c.
uh,... ..he told me he'd rather die than change into something else.
there has to be quicker, less painful ways to kill yourself.
the larva may be the only thing... ..that's holding that transformation back.
so by taking the worm out, he might be expediting this change?

teal'c, it doesn't seem very likely that the goa'uld are responsible for this.
i mean, what with the indigenous people of this planet being... gone.

maybourne's people can be unscrupulous, ... . . but if teal'c is to have any chance, it is with me, ...
. . and i will do the best that i can.

with the help of the drug, ... . . it appears the symbiote has stopped the metamorphosis.
we're hoping the goa'uld is able to reverse the damage already done.

i'm working on a farm now and my boss' name is hank.
he is big man, who has blond hair and moves like a bear.
it's a pretty evening in may a cow lays low in the meadow
i'm having my first love affair and feel the sparkles of her hand
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
you don't want to admit to your watcher buddies that your guy's been whacked... by some sniveling little weasel like audelius.
you make up a story that he's been aced by the greatest swordsman in rome.
if the nazis had taken england, they would have left ireland in peace.
yes, and you would have been left in a slave labor camp, if you'd been lucky.
i know you don't wanna hear this, but she may already be dead.
if he wanted her dead, he would have killed her outside the barge.
we take up a lot of coke, some kind of "pogue", something special.
let me ask you something, is getting your back broken teach you anything?
all you have to do is feed his grandiosity and and play on his horniness.
if you can bring your intellect, your emotions to that point.
you have to fall in love with him in your mind.
you have to make a man believe he fall in love with you.
we know how many times a week he takes shit, for christ sake.
but we ain't closer to pulling offer the first time you thought of it.
you now, madam rosa i think she's too involved to pull this off.
is this what the good madame thinks or that what you think?
when we began negotiations i was understood that there's to be a deadline.
that deadline having come and gone we feel that any renewed negotiation with hosaka corporation should begin from scratch.
will you finally have the edge or whatever you call that pie-shape wedge that missing from your psyche and deny you from filling complete.
yes, it's what the prospect about making up a 100 million dollars that's the deal.
there's a full-scale subterranean war been raged for every shred of information.
the corporate suits are killing each other by the thousands each year.
ok what your did, you can put in your fucking ass.
you just get the aluminium to back side elevators in 20 minutes, or we gonna have to send the russian nurses down to help you out.
you don't have to memorize a hundred handy phrases to convince him to drop everything and be with you.
all you have to keep in mind on whom have you dealing with.
in the old days, these guys will walk to the north pole behind the dogs lead.
today, it's just the same fraction of sheer human hotspur locked inside the heads of the world hottest scientists.
look, we spend an year and a ton of money pursuing this guy.
we know how many times a week he takes shit, for christ sake.
you now, madam rosa i think she's too involved to pull this off.

and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
those are people who always have that precise instant stamped on their life
and when they were kids you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough you'd already see her
even being a nobody has got to be worth more than twenty lousy bucks
it that's how things are, i suppose it's barely worth half a crown
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
can't lose no watch not even a beat-up elgin or a sorry-ass cufflink
this one they left in first class on top the piano
they are hoping some rich guy will come and stick a silver spoon in his mouth
like rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
my son grow up to be a lawyer i swear i'll kikk him myself
but the boy's name is still going to be danny boodman t.d. lemon
well, a orphanage is like a great big prison where they lock up folks that ain't got kids
so if i wasn't with you they would put you in an orphanage?
drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foudation
"yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
problem was as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
we're supposed to blow it up not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes
you're not going to blow up a goddamn thing because my best friend is on this ship
he got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of new orleans
and did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whorehouses
jelly roll morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after... going after your fame and fortune
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
i want to see it from there it's not the same thing at all
wait till we dock lean over the side take a good look it's the same thing
it's like... a big scream... telling you that life is immense
once you've heard it, then you know what you have to do to go on living
but if i get off live on land for a couple of years then i'll be normal just like the others
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
but even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine
because i've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense but are worth the effort
i left the virginian on august 21st, 1933 with my leave papers and back pay everything in order
i knew that sooner or later i'd have been through with the ocean
well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?
well, all things considered better a right arm than nothing, i suppose
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
those are people who always have that precise instant stamped on their life

he got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of new orleans

when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off down the dock and all he said was
and now that i think of it since when were records made on board steamships
if that music was played by your friend it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship!
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
we'll print millions of copies so that people all over the world can hear your wonderful music nineteen
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
i don't know who's been telling you this bullshit or if you're just making it up
i'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine and you'll tell me i shouldn't have and while you're showing me around your house shaped like a ship your wife will be cooking a turkey
and then we'll sit at the table and i'll tell her she's an excellent cook and she'll say how you talk about me all the time
how many people i have seen saying goodbye on the docks without giving a damn
but when i said goodbye to nineteen hundred, it was a real blow
a lot of time's gone by, you know who's to say he really didn't leave
maybe he actually went to the fish shop and asked for that woman
the fact is, a friend like that a real friend, you won't meet again if you decide to go on land, if you just want to feel something solid under your feet
and then you no longer hear the music of the gods around you.
the trouble is that no-one would believe a single word of my story.
it happened everytime that someone would look up and see her.
yet,there was always one, just one who would see her first.
maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
and everytime, i swear every damned time, he'd turn towards us,to the ship, towards everybody and scream...
43 00:07:15,064 -- 00:07:19,025 when you stepped on land you couldn't even piss straight in the john.
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
okay, no-one's going to remember me like buddybolden or satchmo, but even as anobody i'm worth more than 20 lousy dollars !
if you put it like that, i don't think it's worth even half a crown !
it's classy to put letters in the middle of a name.
all the fucking lawyers have got them in the middle of their names.
and that's how little nineteen hundred grew up inside that cradle as big as a ship.
danny was afraid that they'd take him away because of documents and visas, so the boy lived his early years hidden away in the belly of the virginian.
it's a big prison where they lock up folks with no kids.
so i fit wasn't forme, they'd put you in an orphanage.
if they had to call you quickly ,they've had it !
that circus of cooks, sailors, radio operators and waiters took good care of him.
and in their own way tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
even the ship's captain, in his way, ended up being part of that crazy family.
he'd seen it from the ports many times, but he never got off the ship.
the only trouble was that as far as the world knew, he didn't even exist.
however, i think the time has come to allow the boy to have a normal life.
i've written a personal note i'd like you to give to the orphanage head.
i found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
i bought them from a second-hand dealer who emptied out an old hospital ship down at plymouth.
but just three days later the ocean got tired of the festivities.
suddenly, inthe middle of the night, she went berserk and hell broke out.
now, a guy blowing a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
not playing the trumpet is all he can do not to complicate matters.
it was like the sea was rocking us and while we were floating around brushing the lamps and furniture,
i realised that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.
if i say there's a man aboard the virginian, it means there is !
we cleaned that ship from stem to stern, there's just lots of dynamite.
wast here or wasn't there an upright piano in third class ?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship ?
there must be thousands of ghosts on a hospital ship !
we played to make them dance, because when you dance you can't die.
we played ragtime, because that's the music god dances to, when nobody's watching him, assuming that god is black !
but it was in third class that nineteen hundred played his music.
he'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the normal notes and his music was made of notes that were everything but normal.
he travelled and each time he ended up in a different place :
the heart of london, on a train in the middle of the country, on the edge of a giant volcano, in the biggest church in the world staring up at the crucifixes.
you play the piano like a god, people would go crazy for you.
you could make lots of money and buy yourself a nice house.
i think you land people waste a lot of time asking yourselves why.
winter comes and you can't wait for summer and in summer you live in dread of winter.
then one day, when going through one of the many towns i never knew,
i came to a hill, i climbed to the top and i saw...
it looks like he's wearing someone else's suit by the way he wears it.
i'd say he's a stow away slipped into first class for a little amorous adventure.
he would read and,with infinite care catalogue, organise, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, dbut for almost thirty years the world had been passing on that ship.
are you the one that plays ten kinds of jazz rolled into one ?
to tell the truth i've never counted them, i'm just a piano player.
if i were you, i wouldn't be so sure he's still here.
if i know him at all, he won't be any place else.
the only reason i'm going on this crappy ship is to meet a guy they say tunes a good piano !
but i also heard that he doesn't want to set foot on land.
damn it, jelly, you were the one who invented jazz !
then i says to myself : "you can afford to buy a first class ticket !
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and went back to america.
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off the dock and all he said was :
nineteen hundred cut this recording personally which for me is one of his very best works, but to do it he didn't jump ship.
it was an extraordinary, unique event in the history of record-making.
none of us could have imagined what was smoldering beneath his happiness.
then, one evening in spring, halfway between genoa and new york, right in the middle of the ocean,
it's one of those things that it's better not to think about !
when paintings fall,when you wake up one morning and you don't love her, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and want to leave, when you look in a mirror and realise you're old,
i want to see it from there, it's not the same thing.
wait till we dock, lean over the side and take a good look.
once you've heard it, you know what you have to do to go on living.
i could stay here for years, but the sea wouldn't tell me anything.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, i'd be normal, like all the others.
then one day i'll leave, get to a coast, look up, see the ocean and i'll hear it scream.
i've seen so many people saying goodbye on the docks without caring.
but when i said goodbye to nineteen hundred, it was a real blow.
we laughed, we kept saying "see you soon", but we knew we'd never see each other again.
there was nothing we could do about it, it had to happen.
it was like the keys had been waiting for those notes.
it seemed like he'd made them up then and there, but somewhere in his head, those notes had been written all along.
nineteen hundred on that day, had decided to sit at the keyboard of his life and start playing his most absurd music.
that this music would have marked the rest of his days.
it was all very fine on that gangway and i was grand, too, in my overcoat.
i cut quite a figure and i had no doubts about getting off.
all that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends.
aren't you scared of just breaking apart just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it ?
and there were wishes here, but nevermore than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern.
you played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite.
the trouble is, nobody would believe a single word of my story.
it happened every time that someone would look up and see her.
yet, there was always one, one guy alone, who would see her first.
maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
and every time, every damned time, i swear, he'd turn to us, towards the ship, towards everybody and scream...
when you stepped on land, you couldn't even piss straight in the john.
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
okay, no-one's going to remember me like buddy bolden or satchmo, but even just being a nobody has got to be worth more than 20 lousy bucks!
if that's how things are, i suppose it's barely worth half a crown!
and in their own way, tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
also the ship's captain, oddly enough, ended up being part of that safe family.
it took him three days to go toes up, old danny.
нe let go on the sixth race in chicago, won by drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foundation.
problem was, as far as the world was concerned, he didn't even exist.
there wasn't a city, a parish, a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name anyplace.
нe didn't have a country, he didn't even a birth date, no family.
нe was eight years old, but officially he had never even been born.
нowever, i think the time has come to allow the boy to have a normal life.
i've written a personal note i'd ask you to deliver to the head of the state orphanage.
22 days later, when the virginian headed for rio de janeiro, nobody had found nineteen нundred, or had a clue as to what had happened to him.
everybody had death in their hearts because they had all gotten attached to that little boy, although no-one would say so.
he would have wanted to ask him a lot of questions at that moment.
like: "where the hell did you learn to play the piano?"
i spent a whole day trying to put the pieces together.
i found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
it felt like one big party, a huge fair, just for me.
but just three days later the ocean got tired of the festivities.
suddenly, in the middle of the night, he went berserk and all hell broke loose.
now, a guy who blows a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
the same line kept raging in my head: "нe died like a rat".
so, the last thing i wanted was to die like a rat.
i realized that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.
us and her, crazy dancers, locked in a joyful waltz on the golden parquet of night.
and in march there's always an afternoon, when you least expect it, the fog slides in, a milky barrier,
that hangs just below the street lamps and cuts everything... like a white blade.
the virginian is the only ship to have a piano in third class.
was there or wasn't there an upright piano in third class?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship?
we played to make them dance, cuz when your dancing you can't die and you feel like god!
we played ragtime, because that's the music god dances to, when nobody's watching him, assuming that god is black...
нe'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the "normal" notes.
and his music was made of notes that were everything but normal.
"under the eiffel tower, for the people who throw themselves off the top"
"and try to guess what country they're from by their screams"
places, sounds, scents, their land, their story, everything written on them.
нe would read and, with infinite care catalogue, organize, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost 30 years the world had been passing on that ship.
and for almost 30 years on that ship, he'd been spying on it and he would steal its soul.
i know the telephone doesn't always bring out the best in people...
i'll come over there and bring out the best in you!
are you the one who plays ten kinds of jazz rolled into one?
to tell the truth i've never counted them, i'm just a piano player.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and went back to america.
i remember nineteen нundred watched him as he walked off down the deserted dock
yeah, i've done a lot of stupid things in my life.
if you were to hang me upside down, nothing would fall out of my pockets.
i think it's his best work, but he didn't jump ship to do it, not even for a second.
it was an extraordinary event, if not unique, in the history of record-making.
for nineteen нundred, that night went the way it does for paintings!
they hang there for years and then, with nothing happening at all...
when paintings fall, when you wake up one morning and she doesn't love you, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and you think, i've got to leave this place,
when you look in a mirror and realize you're old, when one evening, in the middle of the ocean, nineteen нundred looks up from his plate, looks me in the eyes and...
i want to see it from there, it's not the same thing at all.
wait till we dock, lean over the side and take a good look!
i could stay here forever, but the ocean would never tell me a thing.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, then i'll be normal, like the others.
and then, maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast, look up, see the ocean and hear it scream.
i don't know who's been bullshitting you, or if you're just making it up,
it was as if the keys had been waiting for those notes forever.
it seemed like he'd made them up then and there, yet somewhere in his head, those notes had been written all along.
but you get me up on that gangway and you roll out in front of me a keyboard of millions of keys.
millions and billions of keys that never end, and that's the truth, max, that they never end...
the world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time.
and there were wishes here, but never more than could fit between the prow and the stern.
i still ask myself if i did the right thing when i abandoned his floating city
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
and if then you no loner hear the music of the gods around you
then he'd just stand there rooted to the spot, his heart racing
and every time every damn time, i swear he'd turn to us, towards the ship towards everybody and scream
it was the first year of this frigging century as defined by an unknown colored coal stoker on the virginian
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
all fucking lawyers gots initials in the middle of their names
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
he didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date.
it felt like one big party a huge bash, just for me
but just three days later, the ocean got tired of the festivities
and it's for her that i decide one day to fight against my bad luck and travel all over without a destination
and then one day when i go through one of the many towns i never see before
you can say that again, brother you can say that again
you the one that plays ten kinds ofjazz rolled into one?
jelly roll morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after... going after your fame and fortune
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
i want to see it from there it's not the same thing at all
wait till we dock lean over the side take a good look it's the same thing
it's like... a big scream... telling you that life is immense
once you've heard it, then you know what you have to do to go on living
but if i get off live on land for a couple of years then i'll be normal just like the others
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
but even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine
because i've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense but are worth the effort
i left the virginian on august 21st, 1933 with my leave papers and back pay everything in order
i knew that sooner or later i'd have been through with the ocean
well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?

this one they left in first class on top the piano
they are hoping some rich guy will come and stick a silver spoon in his mouth
like rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
my son grow up to be a lawyer i swear i'll kikk him myself
but the boy's name is still going to be danny boodman t.d. lemon
well, a orphanage is like a great big prison where they lock up folks that ain't got kids
so if i wasn't with you they would put you in an orphanage?
drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foudation
"yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
problem was as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
we're supposed to blow it up not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes
you're not going to blow up a goddamn thing because my best friend is on this ship
he got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of new orleans
and did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whorehouses
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off down the dock and all he said was
and now that i think of it since when were records made on board steamships
if that music was played by your friend it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship!
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
we'll print millions of copies so that people all over the world can hear your wonderful music nineteen
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
i don't know who's been telling you this bullshit or if you're just making it up
i'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine and you'll tell me i shouldn't have and while you're showing me around your house shaped like a ship your wife will be cooking a turkey
and then we'll sit at the table and i'll tell her she's an excellent cook and she'll say how you talk about me all the time
how many people i have seen saying goodbye on the docks without giving a damn
but when i said goodbye to nineteen hundred, it was a real blow
a lot of time's gone by, you know who's to say he really didn't leave
maybe he actually went to the fish shop and asked for that woman
the fact is, a friend like that a real friend, you won't meet again if you decide to go on land, if you just want to feel something solid under your feet
and then you no longer hear the music of the gods around you.
the trouble is that no-one would believe a single word of my story.
it happened everytime that someone would look up and see her.
yet,there was always one, just one who would see her first.
maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
and everytime, i swear every damned time, he'd turn towards us,to the ship, towards everybody and scream...
when you stepped on land you couldn't even piss straight in the john.
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
okay, no-one's going to remember me like buddybolden or satchmo, but even as anobody i'm worth more than 9 lousy dollars !
if you put it like that, i don't think it's worth even half a crown !
it's classy to put letters in the middle of a name.
all the fucking lawyers have got them in the middle of their names.
and that's how little nineteen hundred grew up inside that cradle as big as a ship.
danny was afraid that they'd take him away because of documents and visas, so the boy lived his early years hidden away in the belly of the virginian.
it's a big prison where they lock up folks with no kids.
so i fit wasn't forme, they'd put you in an orphanage.
if they had to call you quickly ,they've had it !
that circus of cooks, sailors, radio operators and waiters all looked after him.
everyone tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
even the ship's captain, in his way, ended up being part of the family.
he let go on the sixth race in chicago,won by drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foundation.
dr klausermanspizwegensdorfentage declared that if it hadn't been for the belly laughs,
the only trouble was that as far as the world knew, he didn't even exist.
there wasn't a city, a parish, a hospital, or baseball team that had his name anywhere.
nineteen hundred hadn't been found and no-one knew anything about him.
everyone had death in their hearts because they had all gotten attached to the little boy, although no-one would say so.
captain smith would have liked to ask him many questions right then.
for example : "where the hell did you learn to play the piano ?"
i spent a whole day trying to put the pieces together.
i found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
suddenly, inthe middle of the night, she went berserk and hell broke out.
now, a guy blowing a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
i realised that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.
perfect, crazy dancers, locked in a joyful waltz on the golden parquet of night.
you know, eversince l've been on board, i keep hearing about this guy with aname as long as a georgia freight train.
seems he was born on this ship and hasn't been off it since.
the virginian is the only ship to have a piano in third class.
wast here or wasn't there an upright piano in third class ?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship ?
we played so that people wouldn't feel the time passing and would forget where and who they were.
we played to make them dance, because when you dance you can't die.
winter comes and you can't wait for summer and in summer you live in dread of winter.
you're always chasing some place you aren't, where it's always summer.
until a few years ago, my field was the only thing i knew.
the world started and ended there in that piece of land.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost thirty years the world had been passing on that ship.
and for almost thirty years on that ship, he'd been spying on it and he would steal its soul.
jelly roll, what's the reason for a trip to europe on a steamer?
till now, you've only gone up and down the mississippi !
how come this guy plays so good when he doesn't even have the balls to get off the boat ?
damn it, jelly, you were the one who invented jazz !
then i says to myself : "you can afford to buy a first class ticket !
you can even buy the ship just by raising your little finger."
jelly roll morton spent the rest of that trip locked in his cabin.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and returned to america.
it was an extraordinary, unique event in the history of record-making.
you can't imagine the advantages you'll obtain if this record sells.
hey, what are you doing there all by yourself, counting the waves ?
the captain says we'll soon go through the tropic of cancer.
for nineteen hundred, that night went the way it does for paintings.
they hang there for years and then, without any warning ...
did they then decide on a date, a time, a minute, a precise instant ?
or did they both know about it from the start ?
when paintings fall,when you wake up one morning and you don't love her, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and want to leave, when you look in a mirror and realise you're old,
when one evening, in the middle of the ocean, nineteen hundred looks up from his plate, looks me in the eye and ...
i could stay here for years, but the sea wouldn't tell me anything.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, i'd be normal, like all the others.
then one day i'll leave, get to a coast, look up, see the ocean and i'll hear it scream.
i don't know who's been bullshitting you, or if you're making it up, but i think the real reason you want to leave this ship is that girl.
he looked like someone who wasn't kidding, someone who knew exactly where he was going.
like when he'd sit at the piano and start to play.
it seemed like he'd made them up then and there, but somewhere in his head, those notes had been written all along.
nineteen hundred on that day, had decided to sit at the keyboard of his life and start playing his most absurd music.
that this music would have marked the rest of his days.
look at that guy with the trumpet, he must be drunk or half crazy.
or else it kept them entertained, as they slipped away into another world.
sometimes they didn't even mind the voyage if they could listen to the music.
but you get me up on that gangway and roll out a keyboard with millions of keys, and that's the truth, there's no end to them, that keyboard is infinite.
but if that keyboard is infinite there's no music you can play.
the world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time.
and there were wishes here, but nevermore than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern.
i still ask myself if i did the right thing when i abandoned his floating city
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
and if then you no loner hear the music of the gods around you
then he'd just stand there rooted to the spot, his heart racing
and every time every damn time, i swear he'd turn to us, towards the ship towards everybody and scream
it was the first year of this frigging century as defined by an unknown colored coal stoker on the virginian
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
all fucking lawyers gots initials in the middle of their names
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
he didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date.
it felt like one big party a huge bash, just for me
but just three days later, the ocean got tired of the festivities
and it's for her that i decide one day to fight against my bad luck and travel all over without a destination
and then one day when i go through one of the many towns i never see before
you can say that again, brother you can say that again
you the one that plays ten kinds ofjazz rolled into one?
jelly roll morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after... going after your fame and fortune
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
i want to see it from there it's not the same thing at all
wait till we dock lean over the side take a good look it's the same thing
it's like... a big scream... telling you that life is immense
once you've heard it, then you know what you have to do to go on living
but if i get off live on land for a couple of years then i'll be normal just like the others
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
but even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine
because i've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense but are worth the effort
i left the virginian on august 21st, 1933 with my leave papers and back pay everything in order
i knew that sooner or later i'd have been through with the ocean
well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?
well, all things considered better a right arm than nothing, i suppose
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
those are people who always have that precise instant stamped on their life
and when they were kids you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough you'd already see her
even being a nobody has got to be worth more than twenty lousy bucks
it that's how things are, i suppose it's barely worth half a crown
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
can't lose no watch not even a beat-up elgin or a sorry-ass cufflink
this one they left in first class on top the piano
they are hoping some rich guy will come and stick a silver spoon in his mouth
like rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
my son grow up to be a lawyer i swear i'll kikk him myself
but the boy's name is still going to be danny boodman t.d. lemon
well, a orphanage is like a great big prison where they lock up folks that ain't got kids
so if i wasn't with you they would put you in an orphanage?
drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foudation

i mean, there were more than a thousand of us on that ship, traveling rich folk, immigrants, strange people and us.
yet, there was always one, just one, who would see her first.
he'd look up for a second, glance out to sea and he'd see her.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
those are people who had that precise instant stamped on their life.
and when they were kids, you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully, you'd already see her,
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
you can get off a ship all right, but off the ocean...
it's a big prison where they lock up folks with no kids.
so if it wasn't for me, they'd put you in an orphanage.
that circus of cooks, sailors, radio operators and waiters all looked after him.
everyone tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
he'd seen it from the ports many times, but he never got off the ship.
the only trouble was that as far as the world knew, he didn't even exist.
nineteen hundred hadn't been found and no-one knew anything about him.
everyone had death in their hearts because they had all gotten attached to the little boy, although no-one would say so.

suddenly, in the middle of the night, it went berserk and hell broke out.
now, a guy blowing a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
and in march there's always an afternoon, when you least expect it, a roof of fog comes down, a barrier,
that hangs just below the street lamps and cuts everything... like a white sword.
i keep hearing about this guy with a name as long as a georgia freight train.
seems he was born on this ship and hasn't been off it since.
the virginian is the only ship to have a piano in third class.
was there or wasn't there an upright piano in third class?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship?
we played to make them dance, because when you dance you can't die!
we played ragtime, because that's the music god dances to, when nobody's watching him, assuming that god is black...
he'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the "normal" notes.
and his music was made of notes that were everything but normal.
he traveled and each time he ended up in a different place:
the heart of london, on a train in the middle of the country, on the edge of a giant volcano, in the biggest church in the world counting the columns and staring up at the crucifixes.
you play the piano like a god, people would go crazy for you.
you could make lots of money and buy yourself a nice house.
i think you land people waste a lot of time asking yourselves why.
winter comes and you can't wait for summer and in summer you live in dread of winter.
then one day, when going through one of the many towns i never knew,
i came to a hill, i climbed to the top and i saw...
it looks like he's wearing someone else's suit by the way he wears it.
i'd say he's a stowaway slipped into first class for a little amorous adventure.
places, sounds, scents, their land, their story, everything written on them.
he would read and, with infinite care catalogue, organize, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost 30 years the world had been passing on that ship.
and for almost 30 years on that ship, he'd been spying on it and he would steal its soul.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and returned to america.
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off the dock and all he said was...
nineteen hundred cut this recording personally, which for me is one of his very best works, but to do it he didn't jump ship, not even a minute.
it was an extraordinary, unique event in the history of record-making.
it's one of those things that it's better not to think about.
when paintings fall, when you wake up one morning and you don't love her, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and want to leave, when you look in a mirror and realize you're old,
i want to see it from there, it's not the same thing.
wait till we dock, lean over the side and take a good look!

or else it kept them entertained, as they slipped away into another world.
sometimes they didn't even mind the voyage, if they could listen to the music.
it was all very fine on that gangway and i was grand, too, in my overcoat.
i cut quite a figure and i had no doubts about getting off.
all that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends.
aren't you scared ofjust breaking apart just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it?
and there were wishes here, but never more than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern.
you played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite.
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet

yet, there was always one, one guy alone, who would see her first.
and for a couple of seconds, a quick glance out to sea and he'd see her.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
those are people who always had that precise instant stamped on their life.
and when they were kids, you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough, you'd already see her,

oh, you can get off a ship all right, but off the ocean...
then i'll put t.d. in the middle like the rich put on their cufflinks.
it's classy to put letters in the middle of a name.
and that's how little nineteen нundred grew up inside that cradle as big as a ship.
danny was afraid that they'd take him away because of documents and visas, so the boy lived his early years always hiding, in the belly of the virginian.
and in their own way, tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
also the ship's captain, oddly enough, ended up being part of that safe family.
нe let go on the sixth race in chicago, won by drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foundation.
dr klausermanspizwegensdorfentage declared that if danny hadn't laughed so much, he probably would have recovered.
problem was, as far as the world was concerned, he didn't even exist.
there wasn't a city, a parish, a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name anyplace.
нe didn't have a country, he didn't even a birth date, no family.
нe was eight years old, but officially he had never even been born.
нowever, i think the time has come to allow the boy to have a normal life.
i've written a personal note i'd ask you to deliver to the head of the state orphanage.
22 days later, when the virginian headed for rio de janeiro, nobody had found nineteen нundred, or had a clue as to what had happened to him.
everybody had death in their hearts because they had all gotten attached to that little boy, although no-one would say so.
he would have wanted to ask him a lot of questions at that moment.
like: "where the hell did you learn to play the piano?"
i spent a whole day trying to put the pieces together.
i found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
it felt like one big party, a huge fair, just for me.
but just three days later the ocean got tired of the festivities.
suddenly, in the middle of the night, he went berserk and all hell broke loose.
now, a guy who blows a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
the same line kept raging in my head: "нe died like a rat".
so, the last thing i wanted was to die like a rat.
i realized that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.
us and her, crazy dancers, locked in a joyful waltz on the golden parquet of night.
and in march there's always an afternoon, when you least expect it, the fog slides in, a milky barrier,
that hangs just below the street lamps and cuts everything... like a white blade.
if i say there's a man aboard the virginian, it means there is!
we cleaned that ship from stem to stern, there's just lots of dynamite.
was there or wasn't there an upright piano in third class?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
we played so that people wouldn't feel the time passing and could forget where and who they were.
we played to make them dance, cuz when your dancing you can't die and you feel like god!
but it was in third class that nineteen нundred played his music.
нe'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the "normal" notes.
нe traveled and each time he ended up some place different:
in the heart of london, on a train in the middle of the country, on the edge of a giant volcano, in the biggest church in the world counting the columns and staring up at the crucifixes.
"under the eiffel tower, for the people who throw themselves off the top"
"and try to guess what country they're from by their screams"
you've really got it out for me, you son of a dusky stoker!
one of these evenings the public's not going to appreciate your antics.
i'd say he's in someone else's suit judging by the way he wears it.
i'd say he's a stowaway, slipped into first class, looking for a little amorous adventure.
нe would read and, with infinite care catalogue, organize, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost 30 years the world had been passing on that ship.
if i were you, i wouldn't be so sure he's still here.
if i know him at all, he won't be any place else.
jelly roll, what's the reason for a trip to europe on a steamer?
when you've never set foot on anything bigger than the mississippi river?
нe got his start in the famed 'tenderloin' district of new orleans,
and oh, did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whore houses.
jelly roll morton spent the rest of that trip locked in his cabin.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and went back to america.
yeah, i've done a lot of stupid things in my life.
if you were to hang me upside down, nothing would fall out of my pockets.
none of us could have imagined what was smoldering beneath his happiness.
then, one evening in spring, halfway between genoa and new york, right in the middle of the ocean, the painting fell.
for nineteen нundred, that night went the way it does for paintings!
they hang there for years and then, with nothing happening at all...
when paintings fall, when you wake up one morning and she doesn't love you, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and you think, i've got to leave this place,
when you look in a mirror and realize you're old, when one evening, in the middle of the ocean, nineteen нundred looks up from his plate, looks me in the eyes and...
i want to see it from there, it's not the same thing at all.
wait till we dock, lean over the side and take a good look!
i could stay here forever, but the ocean would never tell me a thing.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, then i'll be normal, like the others.
and then, maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast, look up, see the ocean and hear it scream.
i don't know who's been bullshitting you, or if you're just making it up,

all that world weighing down on you without even knowing when it ends.
aren't you ever just scared of breaking apart with the thought of it, the enormity of living in it?
and there were wishes here, but never more than could fit between the prow and the stern.
and you played out your happiness, but on a piano that was not infinite!
i still ask myself if i did the right thing when i abandoned his floating city
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
and if then you no loner hear the music of the gods around you
then he'd just stand there rooted to the spot, his heart racing
and every time every damn time, i swear he'd turn to us, towards the ship towards everybody and scream
it was the first year of this frigging century as defined by an unknown colored coal stoker on the virginian
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
all fucking lawyers gots initials in the middle of their names
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
he didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date.
it felt like one big party a huge bash, just for me
but just three days later, the ocean got tired of the festivities
and it's for her that i decide one day to fight against my bad luck and travel all over without a destination
and then one day when i go through one of the many towns i never see before
you can say that again, brother you can say that again
you the one that plays ten kinds ofjazz rolled into one?
jelly roll morton spend the rest of that trip locked in his cabin
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
getting off these lousy planks of wood and going after... going after your fame and fortune
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
i want to see it from there it's not the same thing at all
wait till we dock lean over the side take a good look it's the same thing
it's like... a big scream... telling you that life is immense
once you've heard it, then you know what you have to do to go on living
but if i get off live on land for a couple of years then i'll be normal just like the others
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
but even if it's not the reason that suits me just fine
because i've always wanted you to leave this ship and play for the people on land and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense but are worth the effort
i left the virginian on august 21st, 1933 with my leave papers and back pay everything in order
i knew that sooner or later i'd have been through with the ocean
well, if you take a right arm instead of a left?
well, all things considered better a right arm than nothing, i suppose
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
those are people who always have that precise instant stamped on their life
and when they were kids you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough you'd already see her
even being a nobody has got to be worth more than twenty lousy bucks
it that's how things are, i suppose it's barely worth half a crown
fucking rich-ass bastards can't lose nothing but cigarette butts and dirty-ass handkerchiefs
can't lose no watch not even a beat-up elgin or a sorry-ass cufflink
this one they left in first class on top the piano
they are hoping some rich guy will come and stick a silver spoon in his mouth
like rich folks puts that in the middle, don't you think?
that give it class, to put that in the middle, don't you think?
my son grow up to be a lawyer i swear i'll kikk him myself
but the boy's name is still going to be danny boodman t.d. lemon
well, a orphanage is like a great big prison where they lock up folks that ain't got kids
so if i wasn't with you they would put you in an orphanage?
drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foudation
"yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
problem was as far as the world was concerned he didn't even exist
there wasn't a city, a parish a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place
we're supposed to blow it up not wait for it to be eaten by the fishes
you're not going to blow up a goddamn thing because my best friend is on this ship
he got his start in the famed tenderloin districts of new orleans
and did he learn to stroke the keyboard in those whorehouses
when we got to southampton he got off the virginian and went back to america
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off down the dock and all he said was
and now that i think of it since when were records made on board steamships
if that music was played by your friend it means that at some time in his life he got off that ship!
i don't mean to butt in fellas, but with this you can have anything you want and never have to set foot off this boat
we'll print millions of copies so that people all over the world can hear your wonderful music nineteen
then maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast look up, see the ocean and hear it scream
i don't know who's been telling you this bullshit or if you're just making it up
i'll bring the dessert and a bottle of wine and you'll tell me i shouldn't have and while you're showing me around your house shaped like a ship your wife will be cooking a turkey
and then we'll sit at the table and i'll tell her she's an excellent cook and she'll say how you talk about me all the time
how many people i have seen saying goodbye on the docks without giving a damn
but when i said goodbye to nineteen hundred, it was a real blow
a lot of time's gone by, you know who's to say he really didn't leave
maybe he actually went to the fish shop and asked for that woman
i still ask myself if i did the right thing when i abandoned his floating city
and i don't mean only for the work fact is, a friend like that a real friend you won't meet one again
if you just decide to hang up your sea legs if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet

well, all things considered better a right arm than nothing, i suppose
the trouble is that no-one would believe a single word of my story.
it happened every time that someone would look up and see her.
yet, there was always one, just one, who would see her first.
maybe he was just sitting there eating or walking on the deck.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
and every time, i swear every damned time, he'd turn towards us, to the ship, towards everybody and scream...
when you stepped on land, you couldn't even piss straight in the john.
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
it's a big prison where they lock up folks with no kids.
so if it wasn't for me, they'd put you in an orphanage.
that circus of cooks, sailors, radio operators and waiters all looked after him.
everyone tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
he'd seen it from the ports many times, but he never got off the ship.
the only trouble was that as far as the world knew, he didn't even exist.
nineteen hundred hadn't been found and no-one knew anything about him.
everyone had death in their hearts because they had all gotten attached to the little boy, although no-one would say so.
captain smith would have liked to ask him many questions right then.
for example: "where the hell did you learn to play the piano?".
i spent a whole day trying to put the pieces together.
i found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
suddenly, in the middle of the night, it went berserk and hell broke out.
now, a guy blowing a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
and in march there's always an afternoon, when you least expect it, a roof of fog comes down, a barrier,
that hangs just below the street lamps and cuts everything... like a white sword.
i keep hearing about this guy with a name as long as a georgia freight train.
seems he was born on this ship and hasn't been off it since.
the virginian is the only ship to have a piano in third class.
was there or wasn't there an upright piano in third class?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship?
we played to make them dance, because when you dance you can't die!
we played ragtime, because that's the music god dances to, when nobody's watching him, assuming that god is black...
he'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the "normal" notes.
and his music was made of notes that were everything but normal.
he traveled and each time he ended up in a different place:
the heart of london, on a train in the middle of the country, on the edge of a giant volcano, in the biggest church in the world counting the columns and staring up at the crucifixes.
you play the piano like a god, people would go crazy for you.
you could make lots of money and buy yourself a nice house.
i think you land people waste a lot of time asking yourselves why.
winter comes and you can't wait for summer and in summer you live in dread of winter.
then one day, when going through one of the many towns i never knew,
i came to a hill, i climbed to the top and i saw...
it looks like he's wearing someone else's suit by the way he wears it.
i'd say he's a stowaway slipped into first class for a little amorous adventure.
places, sounds, scents, their land, their story, everything written on them.
he would read and, with infinite care catalogue, organize, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost 30 years the world had been passing on that ship.
and for almost 30 years on that ship, he'd been spying on it and he would steal its soul.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and returned to america.
i remember nineteen hundred watched him as he walked off the dock and all he said was...
nineteen hundred cut this recording personally, which for me is one of his very best works, but to do it he didn't jump ship, not even a minute.
it was an extraordinary, unique event in the history of record-making.
it's one of those things that it's better not to think about.
when paintings fall, when you wake up one morning and you don't love her, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and want to leave, when you look in a mirror and realize you're old,
i want to see it from there, it's not the same thing.
wait till we dock, lean over the side and take a good look!
once you've heard it, you know what you have to do to go on living.
i could stay here for years, but the sea wouldn't tell me anything.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, i'd be normal, like all the others.
then one day i'll leave, get to a coast, look up, see the ocean and i'll hear it scream.
it seemed like he'd made them up then and there, but somewhere in his head, those notes had been written all along.
nineteen hundred on that day had decided to sit at the keyboard of his life and start playing his most absurd music.
or else it kept them entertained, as they slipped away into another world.
sometimes they didn't even mind the voyage, if they could listen to the music.
it was all very fine on that gangway and i was grand, too, in my overcoat.
i cut quite a figure and i had no doubts about getting off.
all that world weighing down on you without you knowing where it ends.
aren't you scared ofjust breaking apart just thinking about it, the enormity of living in it?
and there were wishes here, but never more than could fit on a ship, between prow and stern.
you played out your happiness on a piano that was not infinite.
the fact is, a friend like that, a real friend, you won't meet one again if you just decide to hang up your sea legs, if you just want to feel something more solid beneath your feet
and then you no longer hear the music of the gods around you.
what i am saying is, there'd be more than a thousand of us on that ship, traveling rich folk, immigrants, and strange people and us.
yet, there was always one, one guy alone, who could see her first.
and for a couple of seconds, a quick glance out to sea and he'd see her.
then he'd just stand there, rooted to the spot, his heart racing.
those are people who always had that precise instant stamped on their life.
and when they were kids, you could look into their eyes and if you looked carefully enough, you'd already see her,
it was steady, the john i mean, but you'd keep bobbing like an idiot.
oh, you can get off a ship all right, but off the ocean...
then i'll put t.d. in the middle like them rich folks puts on their cufflinks.
that give it class to put that in the middle, don't you think ?
and that's how little nineteen нundred grew up inside that cradle as big as a ship.
danny was afraid that they'd take him away because of documents and visas, so the boy lived his early years always hiding, in the belly of the virginian.
and in their own way, tried to give him what they thought was a good education.
also the ship's captain, oddly enough, ended up being part of that safe family.
нe let go on the sixth race in chicago, won by drinkable water by two lengths over vegetable soup and five over blue foundation.
dr klausermanspizwegensdorfentage declared that if danny hadn't laughed so much, he probably would have recovered.
problem was, as far as the world was concerned, he didn't even exist.
there wasn't a city, a parish, a hospital, jail or baseball team that had his name any place.
нe didn't have a country, he didn't even have a birth date, no family.
нe was eight years old, but officially he had never even been born.
нowever, i think the time has come to allow the boy to have a normal life.
i've written a personal note i'd ask you to deliver to the head of the state orphanage.
he would have wanted to ask him a lot of questions at that moment.
like: "where the hell did you learn to play the piano?"
i spent the best part of a day putting the bits and pieces together.
found them by accident, hidden inside one of those two pianos.
it felt like one big party, a huge fair, just for me.
but just three days later the ocean got tired of the festivities.
suddenly, in the middle of the night, he went berserk and all hell broke loose.
now, a guy who blows a trumpet on a ship can't do much when there's a raging storm.
the same line kept running through my brain: "нe died like a rat".
so, the last thing i wanted was to die like a rat.
i realized that what we were really doing was dancing with the ocean.
us and her, crazy dancers, locked in a joyful waltz on the golden parquet of night.
and in march there's always an afternoon, when you least expect it, the fog slides in, a milky barrier,
that hangs just below the street lamps and cuts everything... like a white blade.
if i say there's a man aboard the virginian, it means there is!
we cleaned that ship from stem to stern, there's just lots of dynamite.
нow can you be so sure there's still a man on board?
if you've got proof, show it, because i'm the one who throws the switch.
was there or wasn't there an upright piano in third class?
there was a piano in third class, but it was horizontal.
what has any shaped piano got to do with a ghost aboard the ship?
there's thousands of poor dead souls hanging about on that hospital ship.
we played to make them dance, cuz when your dancing you can't die and you feel like god!
we played ragtime, because that's the music god dances to, when nobody's watching him, assuming that god is black...
нe'd go in the afternoons or late at night, when he didn't have to play the "normal" notes.
and his music was made of notes that were everything but normal.
and then one day, when i go through one of the many towns i never see before,
i come to a hill, and then, i see the most beautiful thing in my life.
places, sounds, scents, their land, their story, everything written on them.
нe would read and, with infinite care catalogue, organize, and make order in that immense map that he was drawing in his mind.
maybe he'd never seen the world, but for almost 30 years the world had been passing on that ship.
and for almost 30 years on that ship, he'd been spying on it and he would steal its soul.
i know the telephone doesn't always bring out the best in people...
i'll come over there and bring out the best in you!
are you the one who plays ten kinds of jazz rolled into one?
to tell the truth i've never counted them, i'm just a piano player.
when we got to southampton, he got off the ship and went back to america.
i remember nineteen нundred watched him as he walked off down the deserted dock and all he said was...
i think it's his best work, but he didn't jump ship to do it, not even for a second.
it was an extraordinary event, if not unique, in the history of record-making.
it's one of those things that it's probably better not to think about.
when paintings fall, when you wake up one morning and she doesn't love you, when you open a newspaper and read that war has broken out, when you see a train and you think, i've got to leave this place,
when you look in a mirror and realize you're old, when one evening, in the middle of the ocean, nineteen нundred looks up from his plate, looks me in the eyes and...
in three days, when we get to new york, i'm getting off this ship.
once you've finally heard it, you know what you have to do to go on living.
i could stay here forever, but the ocean would never tell me a thing.
but if i get off, live on land for a couple of years, then i'll be normal, like the others.
and then, maybe one day, i'll make it to the coast, look up, see the ocean and hear it scream.
but even if it's not the reason, that suits me just fine.
cuz i've always wanted you to get off and play for the people on land, and marry a nice woman and have children and all those things in life which are not immense
how many people i've seen saying goodbyes on the docks 986.5 02:14:16,579 -- 02:14:18,330 without giving a damn.
but when i said goodbye to nineteen нundred, it was a real blow.
we laughed, we kept saying "see you soon", but inside, we both knew we'd never see each other again.
there was nothing we could do about it, it had to happen that way.
it was as if the keys had been waiting for those notes forever.
it seemed like he'd made them up then and there, yet somewhere in his head, those notes had been written all along.
but you get me up on that gangway and you roll out in front of me a keyboard of millions of keys.
millions and billions of keys that never end, and that's the truth, max, that they never end...
the world passed me by, but two thousand people at a time.
and there were wishes here, but never more than could fit between the prow and the stern.
those who are treated with caution, the love like a légtornász, had been left in place and easily, when you think, and do not even understand.
love songs hundreds, poems, books, no longer helps us to understand my heart or yours.
three times a week theories try to ... discussed, but unfortunately quite useless, it always accepts the right would stay in bed.
rather, i do nothing, but really, at all anything, but ... it does not go.
there was once a french mathematician, pierre de fermat, who has not worked.
one day, 1637-in as a mathematical study, read, had an idea and subscription to an equation.
in contrast to the volcanic events, where it is carried out by the lava.
these gaps do not form part of the earth's natural coatings.
therefore, the magma ... and will remain in the bottom the correct form.

nevertheless, this is the english romantic literature one of the most famous creation.
when he returned home from the buksija boroválva was, but he had it.
she thought about things and i thought that ... if this is not going to help at least the science is.

and what about ... the al-papucskosbor, beautiful flowers, by the shape of wood called the queen.
in addition, quite a lot of leisure may be, is not it?
another phenomenon was observed the maine coast, recall the accident when the earth out of the underground layer cracks.
these gaps do not form part of the earth's natural coatings.

i do not know what's going on here but i feel that is lost.
you do not want to go, but ... has happened yet forced to leave.
so many people who only practice approximate love, like a tumbling and leave so easily when difficulties come, when you have to get started
centuries of love songs, poetry, literature no longer helps me to understand my heart or yours.
and then i feel so bad and stare at my toes for three days.
after that i can go to the radio and tell stories.
there was once a french mathematician, pierre de fermat, who didn't like to work.
one day, in 1637, he was reading a math book, 153 days 00:17:17,494 -- 00:17:20,672 had an idea and wrote an equation on the side of the page.
personally, i feel really allright since i understood that time i spent thinking that i'd like to meet someone ...
is much more comfortable that time i spent yore, thinking that being alone was great.
no, but i guess you can say that... it's related to it.
in a way you can say i am one... at a different scale.
another phenomenon was observed at the maine coast, when geological events makes the earth crack,
molten rock, also known as effusive rocks, fills the gaps in.
therefore, the magma ... does not get at the surface and petrify to form veins.
the spring flooding starts the slow process of erosion, shows long streams of lava prism, what's called dykes, and easy to recognized by ... their typical dark color.
they thought that would be funny to jump in the water, every puppy.

i realized once that a musician studied technique 10% of his time.
the real work is to discover the great mystery of tone.
i tried to make my fingers fit to the keyboard, but i felt disabled, i could not play anymore.

agent muider, since you weren't on time for this hearing, please step outside so that we can hear agent scuiiy's version of the facts.
it's a global conspiracy with key players in the highest levels of power.
and it reaches down into the lives of every man, woman and child on this planet.
the newspaper says fema was called out to manage an outbreak.
do you know what the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
i have to be in washington dc in 11 hours for a hearing concerning my career.
and i'm in the middle of nowhere, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
your aliens, your little green men, arrived here millions of years ago.
those that didn't leave have been lying dormant in the form of an evolved pathogen, waiting to be reconstituted by the alien race when it comes to colonize the planet, using us as hosts.
in light of your report and narrative, my official report is incomplete, pending these new facts i'm being asked to reconcile.
though it seems that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing, the other events you've laid down are too incredible on their own
leave us with no choice but to delete these references until hard evidence becomes available that could cause us to pursue an investigation.
i don't believe the fbi has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.
i'ii be a doctor, but my work is here with you now.
that virus that i was exposed to, whatever it is, it has a cure.
there's a model behavioral pattern for every case where a threat has turned up a bomb.
and if we ignore that data, as we have done the chances are great that, if there is a bomb, we might not find it.
i'm the key figure in a government plot to deny the existence of extraterrestrials.
it's a global conspiracy with key players in the highest levels of power.
spooky mulder, whose sister was abducted by aliens who chases after little green men with a badge and a gun shouting to the heavens to anyone who will listen that the sky is falling.
and when it hits, it's gonna be the shitstorm of all time.
they bombed the other building because it did have federal officers there.
the federal emergency management agency had a quarantine office there, where the bodies were found.
do you know what the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
it can suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency.
in light of your report and narrative, my official report is incomplete pending these new facts i'm being asked to reconcile.
though it seems that a federal agent may have been involved in the bombing the other events you've laid down are too incredible on their own and, quite frankly, implausible.
i realize your ordeal affected you, but the holes in your account leave us with no choice but to delete these references until hard evidence becomes available that could cause us to pursue an investigation.
i don't believe the fbi has an investigative unit qualified to pursue the evidence in hand.
you should get as far away from me as you can.
i'm not gonna watch you die because of a hollow cause of mine!
i'll be a doctor, but my work is here with you now.
that virus that i was exposed to whatever it is, it has a cure.
if you'd study the statistics, you'd find a model behavioral pattern for virtually every case... where a threat has turned up an explosive device, and if we don't act in accordance with that data, if you ignore it, as we have done,
the chances are great that, if there actually is a bomb, we might not find it.
i need this building evacuated and cleared out in ten minutes!
i want you to call the fire department and have them block off the city center in a one-mile radius around the building!
in light of waco and ruby ridge, there is a heightened need at the attorney general's office to place the responsibility as early as possible for the catastrophic destruction of public property and loss of life due to terrorist activities.
many details are still unclear, but we're under some pressure from the attorney general to give an accurate picture of what happened, so that she can issue a public statement.
i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building, that you wanted to go back in.
the plot to conceal the truth about the existence of extraterrestrials.
it's a global conspiracy, actually, with key players in the highest levels of power,
you telling me the cause of death in that report is false?
that this man didn't die from an explosion or from flying debris?
according to the newspaper, fema was called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus.
are you familiar with what the federal emergency management agency's real power is?
maybe something from the fema offices... where those bodies were found.
well, we weren't expecting to find those remains, of course, and we sent them off to washington.
i'd like you to let this person take a look at them, if you don't mind.
just let me see if i can lay my hands on what you're looking for.
something i couldn't show to anybody else, not without causing the kind of attention i'd just as soon avoid right now.
but what those men were infected with contains a protein code that i've never seen before.
that we are nothing but digestives for the creation of a new race of alien life forms?
by cooperating now, we are but beggars to our own demise.
you'd be shit out of luck if it wasn't for me.
you saw what you saw because i led you to it.
a bullet grazed your brow and glanced off your temporal plate.

if i'd stayed quiet one more second i'd need a colossal barf bag.
you see, rocky, i've had my eye on you for a while.
and, brother, did you get a raw deal from that lunkhead superman.
the real reason he stuck you here was to get rid of you.
he was jealous of your great powers and couldn't stand the competition.
such conduct is completely unbecoming to the superior beings of the fifth-dimensional land of zrfff.
if it please your honor, i present documented proof the defendant suffers from a chronic psychological fixation and should not be considered accountable for his actions.
she's quickly becoming a tradition here with her special touchdown celebration.
you know, i think her field-goal dance is better than her touchdown dance.
don't ask me why draw the ine here, but this is just too kinky.
you didn't even put the back stuff on under your eyes.
i almost needed to borrow seven more eggs but bill knocked the recipe out of my hands like this far from the stove.
so all you need is the 10 cups of sugar and the seven eggs from before?
because i was excited, when i found the honey i ripped up my receipt and just threw it into the air.
okay, i went to the game, only because they were losing and they needed me, and i went, and we won.
that's me, 49ers super fan, dharma montgomery standing here with steve young.
did you know with a career rating of 96.3 you stand as the most accurate passer in the history of the league?

the guy goes to this lab where he deposits his sperm then the doctor puts it into this machine that spins it around to get the best sample
the woman goes to another place where her doctor waits for the sample to arrive from the lab
oh, karen, i'm so glad you got will and grace this hotel room to consummate their dysfunctional relationship
well, honey, i figured since he's gay and she's a handlebar mustache away from being gay herself...
i just went to her a couple of days ago, and she knew everything about me.
she knew that i didn't get along with my mother, she knew i had relationship problems, and she knew my best friend was gay.
yeah, well, you know, i told a few people about you, and they told a few people, and
i guess a lot of folks are jonesing for an interior designer.
'cause i was up all night thinking about what my new calling in life should be
there's been quite a void since i abandoned my acting career
and you know, with everything that's been going on with me lately
stan staying in prison me all alone in a house with 16 servants, most of whom don't even jump anymore when i shoot at their feet...
before i saw you pluck your eyebrows and go to bed with moisturizing gloves
if anything, you're the one who wants to have sex with me
the woman goes to another place where her doctor waits for the sample to arrive from the lab
then the doctor inserts the sample with a syringe, and hopefully, that results in fertilization
i don't suppose there's any way you might forgive me for my highly inappropriate gaffe and allow me to buy you a drink?
well... that's very kind of you, mr. banks but i don't think that's such a good idea
feels like there's this obvious solution that's just staring us in the face
oh, karen, i'm so glad you got will and grace this hotel room to consummate their dysfunctional relationship
maybe once will's done with her he can quit comin' after me
i swear, sometimes he gives me looks like i haven't seen since i was an altar boy at saint margaret's
we'll see you later and if you need anything, just, you know... go get it.
you know, the truth is, i'm glad it's just us because there's something i've been wanting to say to you.
you know i don't like to be near you when the candy band comes on.
i think that nathan is about to say "i love you".
boy, if i'd spent two years of my life looking for my dad only to find out he's dead
i don't think there'd be a pill big enough to kill that pain.
i'm the one who cared enough about my dying grandfather to walk up a mountain every day to tend to him.
yeah, even after they took me away to be clara's companion
and just when you think you've reached the bottom level of her craziness there's a crazy underground garage.
well, yeah, somebody may have shot out her porch light but i do love her.
before i saw you pluck your eyebrows and go to bed with moisturizing gloves.
if anything, you're the one who wants to have sex with me.
i see the way you look at me when i shave my legs.
well, that's because it happens so infrequently, i have to take a minute to figure out what you're doing.
the guy goes to this lab, where he deposits his sperm, then the doctor puts it into this machine that spins it around to get the best sample.
the woman goes to another place, where her doctor waits for the sample to arrive from the lab.
oh, karen, i'm so glad you got will and grace this hotel room to consummate their dysfunctional relationship.
well, honey, i figured since he's gay and she's a handlebar mustache away from being gay herself...
come to think of it. she sent me to work today with a juice box.
i guess that means mason went to school with a thermos full of stoli.
anyway... so she decides to have some fun with the waiter.
so she says. "what are these white puffy things?" and he says "bao."
i plucked you out of a 4x4 hovel above a blinking light in times square.
and i put you in a 6x6 maid's quarters on park avenue.
i'm not gonna let you do that thing where you chip away at a guy i'm dating.
i start to question and we break up and then i'm back to flirting with the manager at blockbuster again.
which may not have quite the impact i thought it would a moment ago.
oh. yeah. you mean that chick with the macy gray hair?
that loser you got into it with last week, from the laundry room.
the one that wears the t-shirt that says, "your mom's hot."
first of all, i have been kissed like that... by my aunt honey...
and, second of all, you don't tell someone that you're about to kiss them.
i thought that it was very flattering when you first started coming to the show...
i'm wearing your dirty bath water in a vial around my neck.
she apparently has some great big surprise she wants to share.
maybe she's found a way to freeze-dry evil so that we can drink it when she's not here.
you're going to find out anyway as soon as karen gets here, so...
you know the guy from the laundry room that you were talking about...
you know, what am i supposed to say take out the garbage, do the dishes and pick up the dry cleaning for a month?
would it make you feel better if i did all that?
oh, so that's why when you disappear every night for five hours, you bring me back a little present.
you're just trying to create a diversion so i wouldn't ask you any questions.
well, forgive me if i don't leap to take advice from someone whose family portrait includes two bloodhounds and a pickup truck.
is it just me, or are the squirrels in the park sneakier?
just goes to show you how wrong those stereotypes can be.
boy, if this day gets any better, by noon i should be rolling in glass.
i know that jack and i aren't married anymore but part of me still thinks of him as family.
oh, that's sweet, honey, but you're not here to attend the party you're here to work the party.
fine, fine, but i'll tell you right now, i am not gonna whittle or tie my pants with a rope.
so, nathan, tell me, what kind of work do you do?
well, about a year ago, i took a spill on my motorbike... wheel came off, i went flying lost a spleen.
the bike company coughed up a butt-load of money and i've been living off of that ever since.
you know, when someone close to you dies it's important to remember them, drink a toast, say good-bye.
no, like i said, i don't think that's the way jack...
you're right, it's the time in my life where i should be facing up to my fears
i'm gonna swim, i'm gonna drink out a public fountain and i'm gonna read an ethan hawke novel
if i were compiling a cia file on dale and i'm not the first page would read that dale is a piano tuner with a nifty rent-controlled apartment in staten island

did you know the richmond hill landfill is the highest elevation on the eastern seaboard?
i mean, i wanna learn from someone that i know is gonna be there to pull me out of the pool
not someone that puts diving rings around his neck and pretends he's a woman from kenya
i'm going for a walk too and don't you dare take nome avenue!
because i am going there taking a left on lewiston a sharp right on richmond and then it dead ends at fiorelli's pizza
so when we leave this apartment we both make a beeline for fiorelli's
turns out it's now a burned-out building that's very important to the latin kings / yeah
so, she looks at me, i look at her the latin kings look at us
and i tuck her under my arm and off we go
it's either one of the eleven black brothers of new canaan, connecticut or paul lynde, the center square.
so i'm writing to each one of the brothers and here's what i have so far...
now, tell me again how you two didn't end up as a couple?
well... we never met at the gym and one thing didn't lead to another.
- god, i just wish that you didn't have this thing with him.
can't you at least be my friend and say you're happy for me?
oh, he's using my new chantal sauté pan with a metal-edge spatula.
there is no way a crèpe is ever gonna slide off that now.
because i'm from the south, i must be stupid and because you're gay, you must be clever.
just goes to show you how wrong those stereotypes can be.
oh, that's sweet, honey, but you're not here to attend the party you're here to work the party.
so, strip off that bug trap you call a jacket put on an apron, and shake hands with mr. clean.

and when i asked him why he said, "cause whenever i look for the can opener,
i can't find it but when i open the closet i see 37 hangers i never saw before."
he's gonna take some bones out of my hip and make my leg longer.
that way when i grow up i won't be a hunchback.
stan and gabby were on and off all through high school,
and then she went to city college and stan and i got jobs.

no, my grandmother used to have a place on the boardwalk at long beach,
and every year my sister and i would play skee ball all summer long.
at the end of every summer, there was this big pageant,
you know, at the steeplechase, where they crowned miss coney island,
- so i ended up losing 20 bucks on the video poker.
if you'd have been on time, i wouldn't have played and i wouldn't have lost,
next we got "the guy with the chip in his tooth."
"amazing nose boy he has one right in the middle of his face."

if he'd done it two years later, they would've put him in the gas chamber.
and now when i go back there, i'm gonna tell him that his cancer is back...
and that he will die if he doesn't get a bone marrow transplant.
matt has blood in his urine, his creatine levels are up...
and i'm afraid without a transplant, we have very, very little time.
well, what you can say when the local news interviews you...
is that you'd like to thank governor walker personally for everything he's done.
until he gets mccabe's bone marrow, i don't care how good he looks, he's without defenses.
he gets an infection, it could kill him in a few hours.
if you put that knife down, give my son a transplant, i will go to bat for you.
i will do everything in my power to make your life tolerable.

richter is a world unto himself, impenetrable yet radiant; a deep- water fish, blind but luminous.
that he is one of the great pianists of all time is disputed by no one.
he is indifferent to current events, politics, praise and worldly goods.
neither political regimes nor the conventions of the music world have ever got the better of his wild purity.
i performed the schumann concerto on a single piano, and it was a success.
it was on that occasion that i first decided to become a pianist.
after finishing his studies, he gave concerts, and lived for 22 years in vienna.
but he spent the summers in jitomir, and met my mother there.
although well-disposed towards me, she would scream (it sounded ghastly in german
"you're all such lazybones, but as for richter, you can actually smell it!"
i was not in great shape and had come from italy a day before the concert.
on the day of the concert, he came to see me and said bluntly:
she played liszt splendidly as she did schubert's last sonata, though everything was topsy-turvy.
she played bach during the war, the b flat minor prelude...
our party, the soviet people, all mankind, mourn for a cruel and irreplaceable loss!
today is the end of the glorious life of our master and guide of the greatest genius in human history,
the west came to discover the likes of oistrakh, gilels, rostropovich, rozhdestvensky.
richter's legend spread, but he was not allowed abroad until 1960.
that year, his first tour of the us, crowned by six recitals at carnegie hall, had the effect of a bomb.
in the meantime, his repertoire was growing to such gigantic proportions that it soon encompassed the whole of piano literature.
the final decision to let richter play abroad was made personally by khrutschev.
the first time i went to america, they gave me a "bodyguard" straight from nkvd.
tchaikovsky, trio in a minor oleg kagan, natalia gutman moscow, 1985
the audience is so fervent when the performer is an artist of natalia gutman's stature.
i was gonna make it up to her but i guess i ran out of time, you know?
you'll have to let us know if you want to be put on a ventilator.
- we need to get a sample from your bronchial tube to confirm it.
but since it's the defining illness of aids, we should do an hiv test.
if you think we should keep chase at the institute, i'll support that.
i can't guarantee that it'll make any difference but i won't give up on him.
after he was gone, my mom used to go on and on about how you can never depend on men.
now she's head over heels and i'm the one holding back.
but i want to make sure i get her the money.
it's not much, but i want to give it to her.
there's no way to say this but flat out, so here goes.
our relationship has not moved in a direction i would have liked.
i don't know what your long-term plans are and i'm not foolish enough to think that colleagues can have an involvement without entanglements.
but we have a lot of common interests and we share the same schedule.
maybe we should finish these questions here at dinner and just wrap this thing up.
get rid of hank and the audience and just, uh... discuss the rest of these on our own.
well, granted, i was sedated at the time, but there was a vibe in that room.
you know, it usually takes several years to get to that level of intimacy.
they were all great, but it looked like you and she had, like, chemistry of some kind.
well, you know, lot of that is that, uh, talk show stuff.
well, because i know you went out with her, and i don't quite understand the, uh... the circumstances.
so if that bothers you, you should tell me because i would not do anything that would upset our friendship, you know?
hey, um, seriously, and, listen, i don't mean to pry or anything, but... how you can date hank after seeing, you know... inside?
because i once saw him in a speedo, and i couldn't eat for a week.
it is always, as i think you would agree, a delight to welcome new talent to the show, and tonight we have one of the writers from the larry sanders show.
this is her first appearance here, her first appearance on network television.
i hope it's not humor, but, um, some sort of message, you know...
i'm currently in the process of suing my boss for sexual harassment.
and friendships, well... they come and go, too, but as long as you kill, everybody's happy.
wendy, there's a bottle of iced cordon rouge on your desk.

it's in keeping with the trip where i've been run down by one of your wiener carts and been strip-searched at the airport.

still, you do not just meet someone and go flitting off to vermont.
well, when you first met barry, you flitted off to vail.

smells like he went on a three day fishing trip and then ate some liquorice.
there's no way he smells, he's the only one around here with a shower in his dressing room
oh, no umm, hi, that-that, you have to put that out, 'cause i'm pregnant.
well, maybe you and your baby should go to another strip club.
i just did a scene out there, first take, i stunk the place up.

anyway, he"s got a great body and there"s a real physical attraction, so at least that"s a start.
to be honest, i feel like i could really love this guy.
okay, so i can"t remember his name right now, butat the time i felt like i really, really loved him.
they ask me if i"m a spitter or a swallower, like there"s a friggin"choice.
and then they tell me that they spit it out all the time, and guys don"t even notice.
and i did want to prove my love to what"s his name here.
and then i started thinking about this guy ned and decided it was all his fault.
and then he says to me he can"t stay, but he had a good time so he hopes i call.
then he makes a big deal about giving me his pager number, and let"s get together again.
because it"ll be depressing for him to be around his brother who"s in a good relationship with me, and dwight and diego, and robin and sarina and, you know even megan and jared...
you have to be there to remind him there are other lonely, desperate gays still around.
youre a christmas eve type person, you can never enjoy the presents after theyre open.
as soon as you find theres a living, breathing person behind the image, you lose interest.
"drop the bitch like a bad piece of meat and jump in my bed!"
as you probably guessed, i had a huge crush on sarina ever since the first moment i looked at that pretty face.
you were leaving her anyway, so what difference does it make who you"re screwing?
let me put it this way, if things didn"t work out between us, would you mind if i fucked your cute younger brother?
i don"t know why vincey brought him but iii just ask him to leave.
you dont have to reveal your hiv status to some shmo off the street.
not hard to believe if you've seen the way they drive.
those two beautíful, hivnegative bodies lay bloodied and mangled in the middle of the street
- excuse me, but every medical expert, the cdc, the nih...
we carry around dozens of harmless little retroviruses in our system, and hiv is no different, not in its makeup, not in its rna...
when you mess with your body, you get sick from a thousand things.
but the medical community lumps them together and calls it aids.
now they"re all saying you have to have a co-agent with the hiv.
now tell me, that"s sort of like admitting that hiv doesn"t cause aids.
so what is this, payback for me tellin" you not to come for dinner?
look, i know it sounds crazy at first, but we had this great, long conversation over dinner.
i want to find out what i can about this and i get intimidated.
especially when i start to bring up alternative theories or treatments, he turns into nurse ratched from "one flew over the cuckoo"s nest".
you model for some paintings, and i"ll go to the doctor with you.
but if you just listen to him, he makes a lot of sense.
i think there"s been enough death and suffering for everybody to take a little piece of blame, don"t you?
and on that cheery note, i want to remind yall, regarding javi"s condition you have to swear not to say anythin".
these gay-bashers are all whining about how they in fact are the real victims.
that the only reason they killed those gay guys is because the gay guys put the moves on them.
well darling, you may not know this, but i"m often mistaken for being straight.
you don"t know what its like being pursued by all those gorgeous homos all over town.
now don"t take that tone of voice with me, young lady.
where"s it say that two men have to settle down and register.
you know what, you guys, i know you mean well, but the world"s different for me than for people who look like you.
things come so easily to you guys, you just have no idea.
i hadn"t cooked in a while, so i wanted to cook.
except, i cannot make pancakes, so i figured i"d make omelets instead.
no, i did not meet anybody, because i was stuck talking to your church friend the whole night.
you know, the one who dresses barbie dolls like the virgin mary, and puts them in his window to guard the apartment against evil spirits.
no, no, no this is not funny, you guys, because now i am horny and lm depressed, and i might just kill somebody, and it may be just one of you two.
look, i"m sorry that none of my friends came to see you.
and then iii be a murderer, and you"ll all be accomplices.
tell me one court in this world that wouldnt put us all to death.
look, you guys, i don"t know why i didnt run away or how i got a hard-on, or what i could"ve done differently, except that what happened, happened, and lm glad that at least this time, i fought back.
all right, i should shut up but, maybe you need to talk to a counsellor.
after all, you did live together for a very long time.
god, mother, anyone else"s parents would be thrilled their daughter was out of a lesbian relationship and seeing a man.
"hi, vincey, i know you"re probably out keeping" west hollywood safe by beating" up gay-bashers right now, but when you get a minute, can you give me a call?"
hey, you better watch out, or he might come after you next.
cause iii tell you one thing you"re not gonna find out there, in cairo or anywhere else, and thats me.
it would be different if you were a scientist and wanted to explore the rainforests, or you were a businessman and wanted to open an office in beijing.
that all this shits happening to all these people, but everything that happens to me is through you and people i know.
i was having this totally fucking bizarre experience, but then i realised that i wasnt having any experience.
you cant pick up a phone and call poor robin here?
i been puttin all kinds of sick ideas in her head.
and then buzz is all, "no, no, you"re not i"m leaving."
of course neither one of them is going anywhere because they just thrive on this kind of interaction.
i try to make it up to them in some way.
you know, like, bake "em a good dessert, buy some flowers.
i had on my newest, sexiest bra which kept slipping down.
if i was going to be stalk, i ought to look my best
i just wanted you to know that, i think we, you and me, had some really, had something really good.
and i just wanted to tell you that, because life goes on and sometimes you don"t, or i dont say thank you, when i had something good.
it"s scary how we slid from dating right into domestic bliss.
when i used to dream about a relationship with someone, it was never quite like this.
dwight and diego because they are not only fabulously good-looking, but they"re amazingly spiritual at the same time.
that night at tara"s was the last time i saw my brother before he went on his trip.
we here at forefront films and sneak preview entertainment understand that some of you may have never seen homosexuals engaged in any sort of positive physical contact.
so we would like to take a moment, before we start, to acclimate you.
this is a gay man, or what some in the community might designate as a "gym queen,"
so called because of his time spent at the local gymnasium perfecting his musculature.
anyway, is been years since i've been with someone i liked.
not that i know him that well, but he reminds me of an ex.
anyway, he's got a great body and there's a real physical attraction, so at least thas a start.
to be honest, i feel like i could really love this guy.
and suddenly i remember what my friend tara once told me.
so i was brought up to be a good, obedient catholic girl, who always did what was expected.
they ask me if i'm a spitter or a swallower, like there's a friggin'choice.
and then they tell me that they spit it out all the time, and guys don't even notice.
then he makes a big deal about giving me his pager number, and les get together again.
so then i rush into my bathroom and i gargle furiously with extra-strength disinfectant mouthwash.
i'm the drama queen mother, and you're just a little princess.
i'm gonna die and i never had any of my plays produced.
well, at least i know now that i am definitely over men.
this has finally made me see that i'mjust the type of person who doesn't mate for life:
i don't want to discourage you from gettin' involved, but les be realistic.
you're a christmas eve type person, you can never enjoy the presents after they're open.
as soon as you find there's a living, breathing person behind the image, you lose interest.
ls not my fault all the guys i date turn out to be psychopaths.
vincey, don't start on one of your theories 'cause i'm not buyin' it.
the point is that this guy, buzz, seems at least not to be a bullshitter.
you suspected megan was straight and never said anything to me?
and say "sarina, i think your girlfriend wishes you had a dick."?
as you probably guessed, i had a huge crush on sarina ever since the first moment i looked at that pretty face.
but she was with megan and they were in love and had been together for like a hundred years.
the only reason i came tonight was because, you know why.
i want to remain friendly, but i don't want to be friends.
if a guy goes down on a woman, a miracle, not sex...
now, you see, i say, if i cum and i'm not alone in the room, then is sex.
not hard to believe if you'vee seen the way they drive.
those two beautiful, hivnegative bodies lay bloodied and mangled in the middle of the street.

i want to find out what i can about this and i get intimidated.
but if you just listen to him, he makes a lot of sense.
and he hasn't even gotten into his whole adjacent theory about how aids is just like vietnam in the sense that some early mistakes were made, but we sacrifice blood 'cause we can't admit the young died in vain.
and on that cheery note, i want to remind y'all, regarding javi's condition you have to swear not to say anythin'.
good night, spalding gray, is been really nice having a conversation with you.
what makes every straight guy think all these queers are after them?
well darling, you may not know this, but i'm often mistaken for being straight.
we just know a few guys you might get along with.
you know what, you guys, i know you mean well, but the worlïs different for me than for people who look like you.
except, i cannot make pancakes, so i figured i'd make omelets instead.
in the end, we compromised and we went out for breakfast.

no, no, no this is not funny, you guys, because now i am horny and i'm depressed, and i might just kill somebody, and it may be just one of you two.
god, mother, anyone else's parents would be thrilled their daughter was out of a lesbian relationship and seeing a man.
a handsome, successful, good man at that, but you two just carry on.
they can't possibly be mad at us for not reporting' vincey, can they?
my guess is that they're still wigged over the whole thing.
'cause i'll tell you one thing you're not gonna find out there, in cairo or anywhere else, and thas me.
it would be different if you were a scientist and wanted to explore the rainforests, or you were a businessman and wanted to open an office in beijing.
that all this shis happening to all these people, but everything that happens to me is through you and people i know.
i was having this totally fucking bizarre experience, but then i realised that i wasn't having any experience.
"e were driving around all night, trying to find a stupid vet.
and then when we did, they had to pump mr. mittens' stomach, and then hook him up to an i.v.
according to javi, it was more dramatic than "gone with the wind."
so, let me tell you exactly how he told me, but you have to swear not to tell anybody.
i try to make it up to them in some way.

and when i was holding him, he gasped like a tiny whimper.
i heard a nurse in the hall say that was nature's way of weeding out the weak.
but just thinking about that baby's life and how it never even got started, the strangest thought occurred to me.
i thought about how that life began with sex, and how sex sometimes leads to life, sometimes to death, sometimes to love.

no one knows where stars come from or why they shine.
few believe we will ever understand what the universe is made of-- what the true nature of matter really is.
from the moment the telescope is invented it's our window on the universe.
in the 18th and 19th centuries ever larger and more elaborate telescopes reveal ever more stars.
by the end of the 19th century telescopes are so large and reveal so many stars astronomers are working overtime just to catalogue them.
there seems little need to build even bigger instruments if all they can do is find more stars to catalogue.
with funds from the likes of steel tycoon and philanthropist andrew carnegie hale sets out in 1908 to build on mount wilson the world's largest telescope.
the instrument he envisions will be almost twice the size of any then in use.
nobody is pouring glass, molten glass the size that is going to be necessary.
nobody is creating the kinds of beams and girders and the super going to be n ecessary.
twice more they try and each time, the giant disks crack as they cool.
lacking the money to try again hale orders his opticians to grind the first in the hope its flaws aren't fatal.
it takes four years of grinding and polishing to finish the mirror...
and even longer to build t of the telescope and its dome.
the steel sections of the telescope itself are built at an east coast shipyard.
some are so big they must be shipped by boat to california.
world war i has broken out and german submarines are a constant threat.
long prone to bouts of depression hale's worries about the project begin to affect his health.
whatever it is that carries hale through on november 2, 1917, the 100-inch telescope is finished.
its 100 tons of iron and steel move with the precision of a fine watch.
it will reign for decades as the best telescope in the world and prove beyond doubt the worth of big telescopes.
to spend a night here is the dream of astronomers the world over.
in the 1920s, i would not have been allowed to work up here.
in fact, i wouldn't have been welcome even as a wife or a visitor of any of the scientists.
the closest a woman could get to the field was, at the time, at the harvard college observatory where major data-collecting projects were in progress.
hired on to help to analyze the data where major data-collecting projects were in progress.were to do all the menial tasks that were below the duties of the men.
leavitt's task is to examine plates takens and look for stars that vary in brightness.
she notices a pattern in one class of stars called "cepheids"
upon returning home, however he decides against becoming a lawyer and heads off to graduate school to take seriously a fascination with the stars that he has felt since childhood.
when hubble arrives at mount wilson in 1919 he's a smart but arrogant 29-year-old who has taken pains to adopt what he sees as the proper image of an astronomer.
he tries to lose his missouri roots because i think he's embarrassed about those things.
he sees the english gentleman as being the prototype of what he wants to become.
in time most of hubble's personality quirks are overlooked because he's an excellent astronomer with a gift for asking the right questions.
hubble wants to unlock the secrets of the nebulae-- faint, fuzzy smears of light that have puzzled astronomers for a thousand years.
even with hale's magnificent 100-inch their true nature eludes him for four long years.
finally, in october of 1923 while photographing one of the spiral arms of the great nebula in andromeda hubble catches a break.
so people had been talking about the scale of our galaxy-- 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 maybe 100,000 light-years.
what this meant was that m-31 and all those other galaxies were not part of our system;
there are, in fact, billions of galaxies each one containing hundreds of billions of stars.
hubble's discovery of the stunning size of the universe and the multitude of stars and star systems that can be found within it changes forever our picture of the cosmos.
that discovery alone would have made hubble one of the grat astronomers of the century.
but he continues to study distant galaxies and makes an even greater discovery.
after many years, hubble could sit down and look at this great quantity of information and he plotted a chart.
he plotted for the nebulae the motions against the distances and he found something truly amazing-- a straight line.
he found that the distance of a galaxy it turns out, the velocity's twice as big.
u go three times as far out it turns out, the velocity's twice as big.yo the velocity's three times as big.
his original equations for general relativity had predicted a changing cosmos.
but einstein was unable to believe his own theory so he added what he called a "cosmological constant"
at the age of 22, at the turn of the century
albert einstein is living in zurich and facing an uncertain future.
he dreams of becoming a professor of physics but he can't get a job.
he has alienated most of his college teachers and they won't give him the recommendations he needs.
and those pateed were, in my view, absolutely formative of his scientific style.
he'd sit down every day with stacks of documents and his job was to strip away all the complications...
common sense tells us that time and space are the same everywhere and for everyone.
indeed, that was isaac newton's starting point when he wrote down his laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century-- laws that seem to explain everything from the flight of an arrow to the orbits of planets.
all i have tried to do in my life is ask a few questions:
could god have created the universe any other way or had he no choice?
so we were always in the position of somebody, say, standing on the beach watching a train of waves go by.
and with any kind of wave that you've ever seen or einstein had ever seen you could always catch up w you went fast enough.
but in classical physics, you can catch up to any wave and light is a wave.
how could it be that there was a wave moving along that you couldn't catch up to?
from james clerk maxwell's equations we know that the light reflected from my face traveling toward this mirror must move at 186,000 miles per second.
"okay," einstein said rain were moving at the speed of light?"
but einstein is convinced this can't happen-- light can't stand still.
and what does it mean ifsee my reflection in the mirror?
well, from my point of view, everything is just fine but for the person standing outside of the train there's a problem.
that person sees the train moving by at 186,000 miles per second and, therefore, the light reflected from my face traveling toward the mirror must be traveling at twice that rate or 372,000 miles per second.
physicists have added speeds this way since the days of galileo.
but einstein concludes this simple adding of velocities is wrong because the speed of light never changes.
it's always 186,000 miles per second even if its source is in motion.
whether on or off the train you have to get the same measurement for the speed of light.
when not fighting the bad guys or trying to escape from some monster you're dashing around the galaxy at incredible speeds.
while you are, your clock and those back on earth are running at different speeds.
this means that energy is turning into mass and mass is turning into energy.
and einstein quickly wrote down... it's only one step-- quickly wrote down the equation that relates energy to matter and it is exactly e equals mc-squared.
so einstein sets out to extend relativity to cover accelerated motion.
it turns out to be e hardest problems any scientist has ever taken on.th
he didn't say that god was malicious teasing humans with problems that were beyond human ken.
he said god is subtle, that only if we dare to penetrate... penetrate into the essence of things then we would find the answer.
he concludes after a series of incredibly complex calculations that this is only possible if space and time are curved.
according to einstein's theory of general relativity the curvature of space is caused by the presence of massive objects.
the earth orbits the sun not because of a mysterious force but because the sun curves the space around it.
the earth is simply traveling the shortest path through curved space.
einstein's theory of general relativity perfectly describes the motions of planets, stars and galaxies both in space and in time.
suddenly physics could say something about the fate of the universe.
that's very different from my experience as i go through life and i can never go back to looking at things the way they were before i understood this theory.
in 1921, albert einstein is awarded the nobel prize for physics but it isn't for his work on relativity.
quantum mechanics comes out of the struggle to understand the structure of atoms.
what physicists in the early 20th century learn is that in the world of the very small the seemingly impossible is commonplace.
uncertainty and chance are woven into the very fabric of existence.
one of the key figures in the quantum revolution is a young dane with a tendency to mumble.
only the screams of an ardent fan snap him out of his reverie in time to stop an opposing player's potential goal.
at school, he's an excellent student though he seems to have a serious phobia about writing.
this is the courtyard at cambridge university imagine an atom this size.
if we think of that being the size of an atom then the size of the nucleus would only be one millimeter in diameter.
that's a bit smaller than this little grain of sand that i've got in my hand here.
in other words, what it means is atoms are essentially empty space.
how can we reconcile that with the fact that matter is matter and my hands don't go through one another?
that's crazy, because if it's mostly empty space they should pass right through one another.
well, what we understand now is in fact that the reason my hands don't go through one another is that while the space is empty what it's filled with is really electric fields.
when the electrons come within a very small distance of each other they begin to repel each other so we have the illusion that things are solid when actually we have this tremendous vacuum given by the fact that the atom is basically empty.
now, this means that i'm not really sitting in this chair at all.
the atoms of my body are about one angstrom hovering over the atoms of this chair.
what he proposed was that you would not allow the electrons to move in any orbit about the nucleus as you could according to classical theory but only to occupy certain very well defined orbits about the nucleus.
there would be an orbit here, an orbit here, an orbit here but there would not exist orbits between these.
heisenberg's mathematical matrices are too complex and the mysterious comings and gtrons gine.
and the mysterious comings and gtronsst too hard to ima within a year, an austrian named erwin schrodinger offers an alternative.
waves can pass through one another sometimes canceling each other sometimes making even bigger waves.
but particles, on the other hand they can't cancel each other out.
so these two pictures clashed with each other and they debated and they had arguments and they yelled and screamed at each other.
in fact, one day heisenberg was so worried that he simply came down with hives and hay fever worrying about whether or not the rival picture was correct.
though bohr was an unusually considerate and obliging person he was able in such a discussion to insist fanatically and with almost terrifying relentlessness on complete clarity in all arguments.
he would not give up, even after hours of struggling until schrodinger had admitted that his interpretation was insufficient.
still, schrodinger clings to his classical view wearily noting at one point:
"if one has to go on with these damn quantum jumps then i'm sorry i ever started to work on atomic theory."
the essence of the bohr-heisenberg picture was that the electron was a particle.
however, there was a certain amount of uncertainty with regards to where the particle was.
now, one day heisenberg was so paralyzed worrying about all these problems that he took a walk in the park.
outside his institute, there's a famous park and late at night he walked through the park wondering, "how can it be?
"how can it be that you don't quite know where the electron is?"
and then in a flash he understood because to understand where an electron is you have to look at it.
to look at it, you have to shine a light on it but when you shine a light on it that disturbs where the electron is.
so the very fact of observing an object changes its location.
and the opposite is also true-- the more you know about a particle's speed and direction the less you can know about where it is at any given time.
and when he finally had that idea he realized that he could merge the schrodinger picture with the bohr-heisenberg picture to give us the modern-day theory of the quantum principle.
in other words, the electron is a point particle but you don't know quite where it is and the probability of finding it at any given point is given by a wave-- the schrodinger wave.
so we now have this beautiful synthesis of waves and particles.
and now heisenberg's principle comes in because now you know so precisely in the horizontal direction the direction of the light is no longer determined-- according to heisenberg's principle.
and so now what you're going to see it's going to spread out in a horizontal plane and therefore what you're going to see on this projection screen it's going to get wider.
that the beam, horizontally, becomes wider and wider and wider and wider and wider and wider and wider.
now, that is very nonintuitive but it's the way the world works.
according to the quantum theory, even the most bizarre events have a probability of taking place.
there's a certain probability that i will dissolve and simply rematerialize on the other side of that brick wall.
"what is the probability that you will find yourself on the other side of a brick wall?"
now, to tell you the truth, you would have to wait longer than the lifetime of the universe for such an event to take place.
quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard but an inner voice tells me that this is not the true jacob.
the theory yields a lot, but it hardly brings us any closer to the secret of the old one.
in any case, i am convinced that he doesn't throw dice.
he couldn't believe that there were big patches of the world about which we could not know, and his idea from early on in his life all the way to the end of his life was that there ought to be
in the course of the day we would have discussions on the matter and as a rule, by suppertime we would have reached the point where niels bohr could prove to einstein that even his latest experiment failed to shake the uncertainty principle.
einstein would look a bit worried but by next morning he was ready with a new imaginary experiment more complicated than the last.
einstein, a tall majestic figure, walking quietly with a somewhat ironic smile and bohr trotting near him, very excited.
during the whole evening, bohr was extremely unhappy going from one scientist to another trying to persuade them that it couldn't be true that it would be the end of physics if einstein were right.
"god does not throw dice" was einstein's unshakable principle one that he would noybody to c hallenge...
to which bohr could only counter: "nor is it our business to prescribe to god how he should run the world."
einstein and bohr have their last battle about quantum mechanics in 1933.
by this time, both relativity and quantum theory ersally accepted by this time, both relativity anby physicistsoryst univ as the most powerful ideas they have for explaining the world.
they want to know if protons, electrons and the newly discovered neutrons make up everything in the universe or if these particles are made up of something even more fundamental.
in the process, what begins as an intellectual quest turns out to have explosive consequences.
in the early 1930s, albert einstein emigrates to america to escape the rising tide of fascism and anti-semitism in germany.
before the decade ends, many of europe's finest scientists are forced to make the same journey.
in hitler's germany two scientists have split an atom of uranium releasing in that moment some of the tremendous energy bound up in matter.
using simple equipment widely available they produce the first evidence from a controlled experiment of einstein's famous equation:
we were galvanized by the notion that the germans were ahead because they had spent a lot of money, they were very good this was discovered in germany, they had able people.
actually we didn't realize that they had lost so much by destroying the community as they had done.
yet until the very end, no one can say for sure the product of all this effort will work.
relativity, e equals mc-squared, was known but it was not known how to put it all toge so these physicists, some of the brightest minds of the world were concentrated at los alamos not to discover new physics
because that was already done by the bohrs and by the einsteins;
they were assembled to see whether or not it would actually work.
and roger warner who was in charge of that particular assembly he was calm and he said, "don't worry about it.
"you can't run very far in a millisecond anyhow so you'll never know what happens if it goes off wrongly."
but just like the opening of pandora's box perhaps humanity was not ready for cosmic fire;
perhaps humanity was nture enough to handle the power of the sun now being placed on the earth.
there's a universe up there that we can't see with our eyes even if we have something 1,000 times larger than this.
we have to turn to a different kind of telescope-- one without lenses or mirrors or any of the other things astronomers have relied upon for centuries.
one of the most surprising discoveries of post-war as is made with this device, built outside cambridge, england.
it may look like 4 1/2 acres of laundry line but it's really a radio telescope.
i just put a question mark by it and passed on.
i think mine things that it can't resolve, things that it can't cope with because this curious little signal occupied about a quarter of an inch in 400 foot.
and yet, somehow my brain stored that way, way back somewhere but it stored it.
and after it had dealt with this problem a couple of times and it faced it the third time it said, "i've seen something like this before."
she sets her instruments to record a more detailed image and discovers the signal is a string of pulses exactly one and a third seconds apart.
never before has a telescope of any kind found something like this.
what do you do if you have really picked up signals from another civilization?
do you tell the president, the press or the pope first?
she heads out to the antenna on a cold november night to check it out.
and i came out on my scooter slithering all over the place on the ice and when i got here the machinery wasn't working properly because of the cold.
and it was the right five minutes and it was the right setting so it was looking at the right bit of sky.
and in came foop, foop, foop, foop very like the first lot, but not totally the same.
a little bit different-- one and a quarter seconds instead of one and a third.
and that settles the little green men question because it's so unlikely there'll be two lots of little green men opposite sides of the sky both deciding to signal to an inconspicuous planet and using a not very intelligent way
finally, a physicist connects what bell has found with an old theory about the death throes of stars.
this theory, long assumed to be untestable, predicts that when a large enough star runs out of nuclear fuel it will collapse and crush the atoms within it.
what's left is like nothing else in the universe-- an incredibly dense object made almost entirely of neutrons.
every open space that you can think of-- between electrons in the atoms-- is squeezed out and it becomes one huge nucleus.
it's that beacon that jocelyn bell sees with her radio telescope.
theory had said that neutron stars are possible but for decades, astronomers and physicists clung to the view that they're just too weird to be real.
bell's discovery is dramatic confirmation that the universe is stranger and more fantastic than anything we experience in our corner of the cosmos.
the reality of neutron stars stirs excitement that black holes may also be real.
they are perhaps the most fantastic and unlikely prediction ever made by physicists.
world war i had just broken out when albert einstein publishes his general theory of relativity.
among those fighting on the russian front is a german astronomer and physicist named karl schwarzschild.
with the war raging around him, schwarzschild discovers that einstein's equations predict the existence of a star so unimaginably dense that even light cannot escape it.
when a star has burned up all its nuclear fuel and there is no longer heat that pushes it out the core collapses and and there is no longer heat it can form a neutron star...
t this collapse can be so strong depending upon the original mass of the star, that it overshoots and doesn't become a neutron star but become even smaller, and then it can become a black hole.
finding something that doesn't give off light-- or any other kind of radiation-- is tricky, to say the least.
it's not until the early '70s that astronomers stumble on the first indirect evidence of a black hole.
the first clue comes when x-ray telescopes reveal an area of intense violence and temperature in the constellation cygnus.
paul murdin is one of many astronomers who begin to focus on this area.
working with louise webster, he finds a supergiant star orbiting something they can't see.
logically, the supergiant must be circling a much smaller and denser star-- one so dense its gravity is sucking huge amounts of matter from its larger companion.
only this could produce the intense x rays other astronomers had detected.
further measurements reveal gravity furthemust be greaterreveal's than anything discovered before.
current theory holds that there are billions of black holes in the universe including enormous ones at the center of most galaxies.
these are so large, they must have devoured millions perhaps even billions of stars.
for most of human existence the question of how everything began is one that only religion dared to answer.
but discovery that the universe is expanding, some scientists begin to believe that they too might have something to offer.
go far enough back and evn crunched together in a point of infinite density.
our universe began, they suggest when that point exploded creating the expansion ll see today.
this vision comes to be called the big bang theory of creation.
at the start of the 1960s, scientists are equally divided between this big bang theory and a competing notion that the universe is eternal called the steady-state theory.
in the early '60s, robert dicke an astrophysicist at princeton university comes up with what he thinks is a way to test whether or not the universe started with a big bang.
he's convinced that if it happened the entire universe should be filled with radiation left from the moment of creation.
we weren't in any particular hurry because bob dicke's idea was so original.
we weren't too worried about somebody else getting there before we did.
it's philosophically satisfying because there's no end to the universe in the future.
it goes on forever in the same sort of state that it is.
wilson and penzias believe the holmdel antenna will make a great radio telescope because it's designed to reject all extraneous signals, or noise.
very first time all extraneous signals, they use itut from the extraneous noise is exactly what it seems to be picking up.
it isn't a lot of noise, but they fear it's enough to compromise some of their research.
so they decide to find out what's causing it and get rid of it.
a set of pigeons had started roosting up in the throat of the thing, and of course they'd coated it with the same white pigeon droppings that you see on statues and so forth in the city.
we got a ladder from the carpenters and a couple of push brooms and some scrub brushes and scraped off the difficult ones and swept the whole thing out.
a year of this struggle has left them convinced the antenna is fine.
the only possibility left, and it doesn't make sense is that every corner of the universe is filled with the same noise.
desperate, they begin calling other astronomers for help and one suggests calling bob dicke.
and the phone rang, and bob picked it up and it was two guys from bell labs who had a problem which at fist didn't seem to have anything to do with us.
we didn't learn very much on the telephone but they agreed to come out and see what we had done and tell us about what they had in mind.
uh, he hung up the phone and i'll never forget exactly what he said.
their annoying background noise was, in fact nothing less than a whisper from creation itself.
in the beginning, some 15 billion years ago the universe exploded from a single point.
if everything in the universe began in a single point it's hard not to wonder what it took to go from such ultimate simplicity to all of this.
many physicists believe that at the beginning of time there was only a single particle governed by a single force.
perhaps if we can work back to the moment of creation to that ultimate particle and force we'll come to understand why the universe is the way it is and even to express it in what physicists call "the final theory"
which, it's hoped, can be captured in a single equation that can fit on a t-shirt.
with each new telescope that was built you could see further out into space, gather more light resolve objects more precisely.
with each new accelerator people were able to see deeper into matter more precisely, better resolution, smaller scale.
there were hundreds and hundreds of particles which looked just as elementary as the proton.
it became clear that if elementary meant anything either there was something more elementary
by the age of 25 gell-mann is already well known in the world of physics for his encyclopedic interests and knowledge his quick and creative mind and his frequently abrasive personal style.
a colleague says of him ay has no particular talent for physicsrr but he's so smart, he's a great physicist anyway."
by looking for patterns and symmetries gell-mann finds a way to organize all the newly discovered particles into families.
then, inspired by a chance encounter during a visit to columbia university in new york he takes a giant step toward simplicity.
"isn't it possible that your theories could be explained by postulating three even more fundamental particles?"
well, eyone at that table dismissed that idea immediately and they p to this physicist what was wrong.
but over the months that follow gell-mann grows to love the idea of this deeper level of reality.
the fact no one's ever seen particles this bizarre he decides isn't his problem.
weltal friends are making a search for them in all sorts of places.
one atomic spectroscopist friend of mine calls me up sometimes at midnight his p rogress in a search for quarks in seawater.
everywhere we looked we could not find any physical evidence for the quarks and in fact, some physicists even began to doubt the correctness of the theory.
however, over the years indirect evidence began to trickle in confirming this theory.
and now when experimenters take a hard look at the proton they see strong evidence of the quarks inside.
for starters, they're so small it's hard to apply to them our normal notions of size.
well, in a way you can look at that as you take a quark and it's spinning, and it has a...
it's spherical, if you like and it has mass and charge and spin and all these other properties that we like to measure about it but in front of your eyes, it's shrinking and finally, it... poof!
instead of hundreds of fundamental particles in nature now there are simply three:
electrons, quarks and neutrinos, tiny particles with almost no mass that rarely interact with the stuff we're made of.
the search for a single fundamental particle is matched byr a single forc e that governs the behavior of everything.
this was albert einstein's great quest for the last 25 years of his life.
the nucleus is full of protons, which all have positive charges.
and if there was nothing to hold them together the electric forces would make them fly apart because equal charges are repelled.
like a lot of other physicists, i got started with chemistry.
i had a hand-me-down chemistry set that was given to me by an older cousin.
first i just liked to play with the powders and the liquids and make colored smoke and things like that and gradually, just reading about it
i became aware that what went on inside an atom was something that couldn't be explained in terms of ordinary things that i knew about in everyday life.
i realized, my goodness, this kind of mathematical idea although it's a complete loser as far as the strong forces are concerned is just what we need to make a theory of the weak force.
and to my surprise, although certainly not my disappointment what came out at the end was not just the theory of the weak forces but, inevitably, a unified theory of weak and electromagnetic forces.

string theory, quite simply is the most exciting idea to hit physics since the days of einstein and bohr.
it may well be the final theory-- the one that explains absolutely everything.
that the harmonies on a violin string-- which they worked out for the first time in history-- were the harmonies of the universe.
and they thought that all around us, surrounding us was music-- the music of the spheres.
unfortunately, that idea never got anywhere because that couldn't explain the elements.
now we think that if i have a super-powerful microscope and could peer into an electron

so, the camera was 60 metres in the air and looked down on, like, 300 people creating an "l" and then "o" and then "l" and then "a" and all this.
and later we went onto the domino compositor station and put it all together, which took a lot of time.
so, this is the first time animation appears in this movie.
it's kind of very, very long time that you sit down to put this together.
and in the end it still looked too clean to me, the whole image, so we put this dirt film on top of it.
well, it was one of the big acting events in this movie because we have two characters being established in a very, very short time.
they don't have a lot of time to really show details of their character.
but still, it was very important that you get close to them as soon as possible, because i really wanted people to care for lola and manni and for their fate immediately.
so, i was really happy to have two actors who are not too much suffering from the fact they are only...
well, because when you see manni in the picture, we shot a whole day of manni, like, moritz, in the phone booth.
remember that you put me a whole day in this kind of sound tent.
nobody recognised him because he was playing the bum and he was really, really looking very, very real, realistic, i think.
i always thought he looked like as if he smelt bad.
so the idea was to have, you know, for every level of the film to have a certain aesthetics.
that means, when we go into flashbacks, it was always meant to be black and white.
when we go into actions that are not in the presence of manni and lola, so the whole world next to them, which they always were...
in a way changed, so that's why we felt it was kind of artificial, was shot on video.
so, franka, in the first place, i very much remember her saying to me,
"well, how do you think the scream is supposed to be?"
so the big problem, of course, was to get it all into sync and to really prepare the right animation for the tv,
because, of course, when we shot this scene with the mother, the animation had to be there.
so, we had to be decided while we were shooting already about all the animation details.
and, of course, we had to know in which house and which building we're gonna shoot this.
so, you would have to imagine how could a staircase look that fits to this kind of building.
so, maybe, franka, you should tell us something about what you're doing there.
actually, you know, there was just this cut that, you know, how i...
i live around this area today, and now i realise what i didn't realise then, that it's really, you know, far apart.
well, i remember, especially this scene here under the bridge, that was really exhausting.
and i remember that you guys, you built this kind of camera car that looked like a big lawnmower type of vehicle.
this guy really had to run, and he was really exhausted.
that was heavy, because i never had to run that fast.
in fact, i wanted them really to look like real setups, real locations, you know.
and, of course, you have to get the actors, you have to find the right location, do the costume and everything, and the make-up.
sometimes people don't get it when my father says, "mr meyer's going to pick me up."
this is actually the guy who's on his way to pick my dad up from the office, where he is with his mistress.
i would like to mention at this point that, you know, talking of running, that, of course, i always had to run even when you don't see me running in the picture.
when lola enters the room or comes through the door breathlessly,
this is the first time that we see that there is this strange combination.
"this is her father and he has a girlfriend, so what about the mother?"
actually, these scenes, or this scene, is very important for my character because now i can show emotions.
you know, how you saw me running all the time before, which was basically action, and now i get to talk and the whole thing here will get really emotional.
which it does also because we establish, like, at least 100% action
before this scene, and now, finally, she bumps into her dad and things don't work out that well.
- i always wonder if cuckoo's egg, if that's a saying that people understand here.
the guy who fathered you didn't live to see your birth.
this in fact always bothers me, this shot, because you suddenly have so many tears in your eyes.
but you know how we worked with this kind of stuff that we put under my eye, and it's really hard to work with that because you can't really control the tears.
this is, again, frank griebe, the cameraman, in 60 metres height on his favourite position with his camera on a crane.
so, poor moritz, still standing in the phone booth, but finally he's allowed to get out of it.
"and then see what happens when we just make them shorter and shorter and shorter."
so, this is how it happened to be so repetitive, because he says every sentence twice or three times.
at least if the theatre is packed, people get to scream about it.
a lot of people think that i shot in his eye.
so, we had to really find something that works with it as well as this one.
so, i was so glad that frank had the idea to take this song, because it fits also quite good.
under my shirt, they put this little bag with blood in it and lot of cables.
i think, in fact, we were prepared to only be able to do it, like, two times, because it would mess up everything and we didn't have so much time.
so before we shot this scene, probably 10 people came to me and tried to explain how i had to die.
and men would come, telling me how people do it in western films and all this.
having a camera very close with them, putting some red light on them, and just shooting these dialogues, which is amazing.
when you have a shoot like run, lola, run where you have all these setups, all these very complex shots with lots of technology, with lots of cranes and dollies and thousands of people really working all the time,
so, the amazing effect of it was that while we were shooting it...
i'm really amazed of the acting, what you do there, and i really like the way that you get so close and so intimate
at the end of the day, i met up with frank, the cameraman, and we looked at each other and we realised,
"this was really the heart of the movie that we're shooting now.
because the first script i read, it wasn't in there, i think.
no, it was just the structure of the repetition, and then we realised something still was missing.
especially producers stefan arndt and maria köpf came to me and said,
"listen, we have to find out something in this movie that's still..."
and what was amazing for me when i read it is that...
i mean, you wrote not only the man's part, but you also wrote the woman's part, and even though i really, very often, like to change my text and everything,
it shows an energetic body, and it shows movement, and emotion, in one picture.
and i think that's what cinema, for me, always seems to be about, that we see dynamics and feelings, and can follow them.
then very soon after that, there was the title of the movie, which i really liked immediately.
so i found out i just have to build a story around this so it might be an interesting movie.
and i thought we should really try to make a movie that shows this idea to the max.
and also, in terms of how we handled time, trying to make a film that not, as usually what films do,
one second he did something different that didn't make the accident happen.
and that's how he came up with the idea of the film.
and we met some person, and we got married, and had children, and everything, and just from one slightly different decision, this wouldn't have happened.
we wouldn't have gone to the party, and our life would have taken a complete different turn.
because he was friends with the casting director, who casted me for something totally different.
and i think this is the film that you saw, and you kept me in mind for this part, right?
this is really a short version of that story, but i guess that's pretty much it.
actually it's kind of scary how you can really tell this in 10 seconds.
and i remember that i started getting really angry at myself because i was so unhappy.
and you know how sometimes you haven't found this particular, little tiny thing that makes the scene special.
because it had so weird, different directions that this whole story goes.
and people in other countries might not know, but most of the supporting cast of this film is quite famous actors in germany.
so, as it's obvious, this movie sometimes needed a break, apart from the red scenes when lola and manni are lying in bed.
so, i always thought this could be a good moment to have at least a little sequence of silence.
because there's also some strong emotional problem, of course, in that situation, because the daughter is robbing the bank where the father is working, so...
so, what the actor, lars rudolph, did, in fact, he had the idea that this guy, how he thought of him, he brings a little bit more money than he needs to fill up the 100,000 marks,
this is a shot that i always wanted to do, the one when she runs into the camera.
and i wanted it to look like in the first raiders of the lost ark movie when indiana jones loses marion.
okay, let me give you some information about the music, how we came to do the music the way it is now.
i always work with two guys who are called johnny klimek and reinhold heil.
that was really, really a nerve-wracking day, because, finally, we could at least, after 10 takes, we could destroy this piece of glass.
and of course, we were very afraid that something would happen to anybody.
the whole glass was not broken by the car itself, in fact.
so, if you look at the film, frame by frame, you will see that one frame before the car hits the glass, there's an explosion in the glass itself.
so, that was done with a very small piece of dynamite.
so, it was crashed before, so the car only pushes away the small pieces of the glass.
and in the end, the craziest thing about the whole glass scene was that we had only two pieces of it, and in the end, we only needed one to be destroyed.
so we ended up having another one when we already wrapped.
and the closer we got to a rhythm in the editing, we grow with the layouts of the music.
so, in the end, we went back and forth between music studio and editing studio to really make music and film become one unit, to get it completely intertwined with each other.
it's a combination of two images, and it was also done on a domino compositor.
so, we first shot the car, and then manni lying on the street, and combined the two images.
the shot from the front of the car, where the guy is hit, there's one very, very short shot where you can see it's a stuntman.
and all those, of course, are the real moritz bleibtreu, the real actor.
so, the music and editing process took really a long time because i absolutely wanted, especially in this case, but generally,
i like when films have a very musical appearance and when they really give you the impression of being very rhythmical and very much atmospheric, also, because of the sound, the whole sound elements.
actually, we were recording the whole music part in the us, in santa barbara,
where the studio is located, where reinhold heil, one of our three band, has set up a studio.
and i wanted very much that people relate to this relationship as being not something like romeo and juliet.
as much as i wanted lola to be a character not completely invented, but, in fact, very much down to earth, very much believable, and not this idea of having a tank girl or lara croft identity.
she didn't even quit smoking during the shooting, even not in those shooting days, when we were shooting the running scenes.
so, that made me nervous on the one hand, but on the other hand, i liked very much that it made her become a real, very complete, normal, believable character, and not something that is completely
people from the team would always come up to me, having pity on me.
because then, i guess, that's when you start yourself to have a pity on you.
that means we shot 20 times as much as you see in the movie.
so, more or less, you can imagine franka was running 20 times more than what we see on screen, in fact.
so, this was the third episode, which always worried me that people would say, "okay, i've seen all of this."
and i really wanted to come as soon as possible to this situation here, now, when you realise, "now we're following this man,
sebastian schipper is the actor who plays this guy here, the guy with the bike.
he's now becoming a director, and he just finished his first feature film.
it's not that i did all of them by myself, but...
of course we had to take care of my legs and everything, but i remember
all the voice stuff, the female voice stuff, apart from one song, is franka potente in this film.
the whole music element was growing and growing throughout the work on the movie.
and in the end, the idea to take franka's voice, to take your voice, was coming out of another idea that we had first had,
because in the script it was written that, while lola is running, we listen to all the thoughts that are crazily bumping into her mind,
so, we decided not to take it as a narrative off-voice, but make it become a song and a singing part.
i thought that was very convincing, even though i never pictured myself as a singer.
so in the end, he also gets punished for setting all this off.
but this is something that people only discovered after seeing it five times or so.
because you just see him very, very shortly in a flashback.
oh, see, i remember shooting this scene, because i had to run with my eyes shut.
and very close-ups of all this, together with a small crew and frank griebe, the cameraman.
we both sit down and storyboard all of it very closely, and then we sit down and shoot it in a separate day, in a small room, sit there for, like, 20 hours and...
and i just remember this shot was really exhausting to do, because it was a very long track for the dolly and frank was sitting on it, in fact, and we were moving and i didn't want the extras to move,
but the camera, of course, was very close to their heads and they had, like, an 18-hour day.
alexander, he said, "i don't have a nice picture for this."
so, in the end i said, "okay, we have 15 minutes.
so we ended up having the back side of kim novak in this image.
and i love it because, of course, there's, again, the spiral sign which reappears in the movie all the time, like the spiral symbol is a very strong symbol for the whole film.
so, this is one of those silent connections between the three episodes that i wanted to make them, in a way, secretly bound with each other,
or more intertwined with each other, and to have them have this strong connection is somehow irritating
act in a way that it looks like she really knows what happened during the whole film
because i very much wanted the film to feel like one voyage and not three of them.
you died for him, he died for you, everything happened, and there's such a...
i really appreciate that you acted like that, because it makes us much more feel close to your character, because we don't feel like it was all just an experimental movie.
and the movie always goes backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards, so, i thought, "let's put the letters in this contradictious way."
so, now we can see all those people that we missed to talk about during the movie, all those incredible persons who really had a long, long seven-week shoot, and long, long overnights...
especially the whole grip department, always trying to find things that keep up with a person running, which is amazingly fast, you know.
you cannot find any dolly that can really keep up with a running person.
so, you have to invent all kinds of vehicles, or build them, or create them, combine them with cranes and all this, so that's really a lot of...
of course, it's also a lot of fun doing this kind of stuff.
the stunt department had some interesting tasks, but definitely the one with the big piece of glass was something we were most worried about because no one of us and them had done this before, in this size.
and it seemed kind of dangerous because glass is very unpredictable, where it goes.
and it's really hard to get your way through there anyhow.
so, if you want to block a street, they go crazy because the whole...
no, they had to discuss it intensely and solve all these problems, because you have this director sitting there and saying, "oh, i don't care, i just want this street now.
"so, i don't care how you do it, just do it!"
and i'm pretty impressed how they did it, and how they managed to get us in all those streets, which are...
you know, usually you can't really shoot there because they're so important not to be blocked.
okay, we have the music credits here, which just brings me to the important matter that there's, of course, the soundtrack of the movie on cd.
and for me it was the first cd of a soundtrack that really worked also in the charts, and it was very exciting
to be even in the top 10 for such a long time in germany.
and franka, and the guy we did this song which is now running with, he's called thomas d, he's a big star in germany, too, a german rapper.
i couldn 't even call a taxi, so i walked to the subway station
on the train, there was this bum who somehow fell down.
you said, "love can do everything." so find 100.000 marks in 20 minutes!
at 12 by the water tower around the corner, ronnie said.
and you can tell him how tough things are for you that you have to look after yourself and you don't know what'll happen...
then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me off your list.
i got waved across the border, and then they dropped me off out there.
then i went to see that cyclops, and he was finished in no time.
we shall not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring
will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.
an answer that will give rise to a new question andthenextanswerwill give rise to the next question and so on andsoon .
but, in the end, isn 't it always the same question?
and you can tell him how tough things are for you that you have to look after yourself and you don't know what'll happen

then i went to see that cyclops, and he was finished in no time.
and everybody's real compassionate, and everything's so incredibly sad, and everyone feels sorry for you.
you can show everyone how strong you are. "what a great woman," they'll say.
and you can tell him how tough things are for you, and that you have to look after yourself and don't know what's gonna happen, and blah, blah, blah.
then you'd hop onto his lap and cross me off your list.
"at the summit, face to face, two leaders who direct the destiny of one out of three persons on the earth.
the gate to friendly contact, says chou en-lai, has finally been opened."
and so of course the ideal of communism gradually entered my spirit.
the americans were devastated to lose china, their best friend in asia.
oh, we felt that they had betrayed all of our high hopes and our expectations of them.
we had become emotionally involved with them, and then they had done this to us - they'd gone off and become communists."
at that time there was the attitude everywhere that moscow and the chinese communists were tightly linked, hand in hand.
this was perceived by many to be part of a worldwide conspiracy and hence was, was somewhat frightening.
mao gratefully accepted the help of soviet experts in rebuilding chinese industry.
we had come from the soviet union, where the basis of the state economy was the plan.
so we explained to our chinese comrades that the plan was the absolute basis of everything.
the development of the country, the economy, and not only the economy but of other branches of knowledge."
in june 1950, north korea, with soviet and chinese backing, attacked south korea.
"the sudden attack by the north koreans dealt the slender forces below the 38th parallel a mortal blow.
he prompt arrival on the scene of u.s. soldiers gave marshal stalin and his cold-eyed strategists a rude shock."
forces under united nations command pushed the invaders back to the chinese border.
more than one million chinese troops would cross the border into korea.
the korean war lasted for three years and cost more than half a million chinese lives.
in china, cinema audiences watched films of bumper harvests and new industrial records.
there was a song we used to sing at the time.
the size and power of the communist bloc made the new american administration increasingly anxious.
we can see that china is the basic cause of all of our troubles in asia.
if china had not gone communist, we would not have had a war in korea.
if china were not communist there would be no war in indochina, there would be no war in malaya.
to prevent china attacking the chinese nationalist stronghold of formosa or taiwan, the united states financed a military build-up on the island.
"generalissimo chiang kai shek, along with his american advisers, reviews free chinese nationalist forces in an independence day parade.
more than a half million soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have as their ultimate aim and living goal the return to china's mainland."
the nationalist government was determined to defend two small islands off the china coast, quemoy and matsu.
chinese nationalists looked on them as symbols as to what... the united states would do in helping them.
furthermore, chiang kai shek had put an enormous proportion of his army on these little islands.
"almost immediately, the major units of the 7th fleet are shifted to formosa to augment the united states and nationalist patrols in the strait and along the mainland.
the action upholds the united states pledge to meet the common danger, communism."
the american show of strength failed to stop the chinese communist challenge.
the allied nations possess together plenty of power in the area.
mao's provocation and america's response concerned khrushchev, whose nuclear bombs guaranteed china's security.
khrushchev told the chinese that war with imperialism was no longer inevitable.
for the 40th anniversary of the soviet revolution mao went to moscow.
he used the occasion to put himself forward as the new leader of world revolution.
this was a clear sign that the soviets wanted to control china.
mao's understanding was that the soviet union was trying to control china in the same way as it controlled countries in eastern europe.
so he got angry with khrushchev and said, 'if you want it,
i'll give you the whole coastline and i'll go back to the mountains.'
we had already given them the blueprints and practically all the assistance necessary for making the atomic bomb.
when khrushchev next visited beijing, he'd just been president eisenhower's guest in the united states.
the struggle for pre-eminence in the communist world was now out in the open.
here were two despots, each used to having his own way they couldn't cooperate.
land was taken over by the state the family unit was to disappear people were organized into huge communes.
a utopian world of plenty would come from sheer force of will.
mao wanted to change the face of china in the shortest time possible.
the slogan was 'struggle hard for three years, change the face of china, catch up with britain, catch up with america.' it was completely unrealistic.
because steel remained a key symbol of national vitality, the entire country reverted to pre-industrial backyard furnaces.
people worked day and night to produce massive amounts of useless metal.
anybody who did not speak in falsehoods was demoted or expelled from their jobs.
from the time of the great leap forward, all chinese people learned to tell lies.
the big three representatives, dean rusk, andrei gromyko and lord home sign for the u.s., russia and britain.
most other nations of the world, with the notable exception of france, communist china and cuba are to sign later.
"the chinese communist nuclear detonation is a reflection of policies which do not serve the cause of peace.
but there is no reason to fear that it will lead to immediate dangers of war.
president johnson was determined to prevent communist north vietnam and its allies in the south gaining power.
in china, the masses were mobilized to support neighboring north vietnam.
it is a nation which is helping the forces of violence in almost every continent.
the contest in vietnam is part... of a wider pattern of aggressive purposes."
their idealism was exploited to create mayhem and to destroy every vestige of the past.
"chairman mao says: 'marxism consists of thousands of truths but they all boil down to one phrase it's right to rebel!
the proletarian revolutionary rebels hold high the great red banner of mao tse-tung's thought through big character boosters and great debates.
they argue things out, expose, criticize and repudiate thoroughly and launch fierce attacks on all kinds of representatives of the bourgeoisie."
when it began to get dark, they took them down and started a huge bonfire at the entrance of the embassy and burned the dummies.
the red guards and the young people gathered around the fire and danced and yelled anti-soviet slogans.
from midnight to 6 a.m. it was time for chinese torture.
for 15 minutes they would stop and we would start falling asleep, exhausted by the noise.
images of aggressive chinese at the border fueled soviet fears of an invasion.
siberia and the far east were sparsely populated, so what if the chinese millions began pouring in?
the soviet union had a nuclear arsenal and 1 million troops along the border between the soviet union and china.
north of beijing were flat plains, and if the soviet union were to attack china, within a week they would be in beijing with their tanks.
our cia estimated the chances... of an iron bomb attack by the soviet union on china was one in three, ...to show you how real that fear was.
and meanwhile, by 1969, the chinese were building, at a furious rate, these great huge underground shelters in their cities.
so there was a real fear of war that was building up.
the vast network of shelters tunneled underground was meant to withstand nuclear attack.
but there were people i met in diplomatic circles who said to me it wouldn't be a bad thing to hit the chinese with a missile.
soviet premier kosygin visited beijing in october 1969 to stop a potential war and restore relations.
when chou en-lai met kosygin at beijing airport, he said to him,
'if you attack our nuclear installations with atomic weapons, that counts as war,
mao, fearful of moscow's belligerence, had already decided he wanted better relations with america.
america's new president, richard nixon, although a lifelong anti-communist, came to a similar conclusion.
it began to dawn on us after we'd been in office for a while, that... there were genuine tensions between russia and china, and that probably the soviet union was the cause of the tensions and not china, which was... the opposite of the idea with which we entered.
the first sign of a thaw from beijing came during a table tennis match.
in 1971, while playing in japan, the american team was suddenly invited to china.
i think it's a wonderful opportunity to go to china because not very many people get there and i feel it's a great opportunity to play against the top players and be able take some of this knowledge home.
and i think it's also a step in our political relations with china.
the team's home movies offered the first glimpse of china to most americans for 20 years.
and a chinese giant, you know, taking care of him and so forth, you know.
and so meanwhile, you know, everybody's smiling and being nice to us and so on, right?
in july 1971, henry kissinger went on a tour of asia.
his most important mission was kept secret a visit to beijing to prepare the way for a rapprochement with china.
as the plane was getting close to the chinese border, we were all aware of the fact that no american official had been in china since 1949, 22 years.
i decided i'd like to be first, and so while kissinger was sitting in the back of the plane,
i went to the front of the plane, so as the plane went over the chinese border
i was the first american official into china in 22 years.
henry never forgave me for that, elbowed me aside and got off the plane first.
i didn't put my foot down and say, 'now i have just made history and this will never be forgotten.'
and therefore he found it very, very painful, in fact he found it to all practical purposes impossible to tell a bureaucracy,
'i disagree with you and you will do it my way.'
nixon's trip to beijing changed the balance of the cold war.
his chinese triumph also stole the headlines from the increasingly grim events in vietnam.
i knew that mao didn't have very long to live, and i thought that he'd at last made a good decision.
i also believed that only mao could make that decision, but whoever succeeded him wouldn't have the courage to make such a decision.
premier chou en-lai moves forward to greet the first american president to set foot on chinese soil.
east meet west as a handshake bridges 16,000 miles and 22 years of hostility.
dealers sell out, as readers follow day by day the president's activities."
today the president walks among priceless treasures from china's golden age.
i didn't put my foot down and say, 'now i have just made history.'
on the way back from beijing i knew that we had made history.
the more you drool over her, the less she's gonna want you.
that may apply to your freaky model chicks, but not my courtney.
i'm gonna sneak into his office and take the picture just so we can figure this thing out.
oh, good idea, because nothing cheers my dad up faster than stealing his stuff.
finch, i need baxter the intern to run a little errand for me.
last time he ran a little errand for you, he spent six months in a mexican jail.
i pretended i was asleep because i didn't wanna have to say goodbye.
i remember going to the window, watching him get into a cab, and then he was gone.
yeah, oh, i just loved hearing how they were taking the world by storm.
well, a few years ago, dave died, but jack, mike, and earl still came.
i'm gonna sneak into his office and take the picture just so we can figure this thing out.
oh, good idea, because nothing cheers my dad up faster than stealing his stuff.

well, then what about all the phone messages and the "see you on saturday," and the four seasons?
oh, well, the suite at the four seasons was for earl.
your dad and his three best friends wanted to do something special for their high school graduation, and so they walked across the brooklyn bridge.
oh, i can still picture them coming in, all proud in their varsity jackets.
i use it because my back goes out, and i rest my head on it and it makes me feel better.
so if you'li just give it to me, i'li be very obliged.

there can be only one wizard at this court, and it is i, merlin!
i want your people to stop threatening me with fiaying and chaining.
i want to talk to the knights of the round table and your people, and i want him gone.
well, then, i'li just leave these coins here because i don't want them any more, and i don't care about them.
but if you'd have your daughter drop some vegetables off, say, every couple of days at the castle - just ask for sir boss - i'd really be grateful.
the king has gone hunting with that woman he has knighted.
it demeans every knight and brings shame upon the round table.
but what's making me crazy is i cannot figure out how i miscalculated this thing.
rumour has it that merlin had something to do with it.
now, i made a couple of these in case merlin gives us any trouble.
but i've come up with a really good idea that i think will freak out that faker.
i would have vengeance on that biack-hearted devil who repaid my family's loyalty so.
i came to camelot so one day i couid be a knight and have the right to challenge him.
what do you mean, "for what crime?" he killed ciarence's entire family!
first, it is a noble knight's word against that of a common freeman.
do you remember horace, your loyal gamekeeper who you murdered 13 years ago?
his wife, their infant son, my sister and her husband, all of whom you slaughtered that night?
now the moment has come, i find justice sweeter than revenge.
let him be tried by his former peers of the round table, whose honour he has so sullied.
i think i've been making a iot of mistakes, because i'm trying to do things too fast without knowing enough about where i am.
so i'd iike to get outside the gates of camelot and meet the people - with your permission.
and if the king's very life hangs by a thread, as you say, how do we know it is not her doing?
how do we know you have not come to lure great lanceiot to his death so that none may oppose her in her ambitions?
it was sir boss who showed me that we must all turn our thoughts to the suffering of our people who look to us each and every day in the hope that their burden might be eased.
if we could do but this, what a kingdom cameiot would be.
this lad is a page at court in the service of sir boss.
though he be common-born, he hath a prince's bearing and a lion's heart and a son's loyalty.
under extreme energy conditions, the gravity wave will act like a graviton particle.
so if i don't do the big kabiooey now, it's never gonna happen.
look, i am a citizen of the united states of america.
i iive in west cornwall, connecticut, and i am demanding that you release me.
and quit all that bowing' and scrapin' i don't like it.
i trust your magics, amulets and charms are unharmed and potent as before, sir boss.
but this is a room for a noble lady, not a slave.
i need nothing more for sleeping than a corner in the kitchen behind the stove.
but i have learned through you, sir boss, that to be free is to be seen, heard, spoken to as no slave is.
it would seem to me that to be iii-used thus, as a freeman, is no better than being property.
from that day to this, i have dreamt of the day
i would have vengeance on that biack-hearted devil who repaid my family's loyalty so.
his wife, their infant son, my sister and her husband, all of whom you slaughtered that night?
i am the son who escaped into the dark, and tonight i will have my vengeance, though i pay for it with my iife!
like love and honour and loyalty and forgiveness, they can make their lives better.
this concept came from a place called cameiot, of which you were the architect.
- this sorceress you serve has brought nothing but trouble to camelot from the dark day she arrived.
and if the king's very life hangs by a thread, as you say, how do we know it is not her doing?
how do we know you have not come to lure great lanceiot to his death so that none may oppose her in her ambitions?
i swear to you, your highness, every word i speak is simple truth!
and what if the king they rescue is no ionger the man we both love?
you speak of love, but i fear it may not be love for your king which speaks the loudest.
though he be common-born, he hath a prince's bearing and a lion's heart and a son's loyalty.
if i had a son of my own, i couid not love him more than i iove thee.
my source at manhattan magazine just faxed me a sneak preview of their power 100 list.
oh, who cares who they think the most powerful people in new york are?
and obviously you're a big fan, and, hey, that's just great.
but, see, i'm with an old friend here and, well, and his grandmother just died.
you know, i have lots of ideas, but i never say them.
because i'm always afraid that some people might think they're silly.
so, maybe we could just walk around the office and be seen together.
or maybe i could say something and you could laugh like it's funny.
"a recent review of the blush covers from the past years reminds us
"of the enormous influence elliott dimauro wields in the world of fashion."
and obviously you're a big fan, and, hey, that's just great.

i mean, in the grand scheme of things, it means nothing.
so, the best way to convince him of this is just to go about our day like it's no big deal.
if their armies entrench themselves here, they'll be here for years.
and your people will be enslaved forced to feed an army of occupation.
he wrote to me telling me there was no glory no honor just a monster that needed to be fed.
and now i finally have him back the monster's followed him home.
no matter what happens on the line you'll be able to sweep through these woods and flank pompey.
there's another part of my plan that i'd like you to put into action.
and still keep caesar and pompey from taking control of their armies?
it won't be easy but there's something else another part of caesar's plan.

nikita khrushchev and gamal abdel nasser change the face of egypt.
after the west had refused a loan for a dam across the nile, the soviet union took over.
to be rather crude, in those areas where there was still prey.
that was the third world and each side tried not to miss a chance.
he was able to understand the global strategy and now, we can benefit from the disagreement between the
soviet union and between the united states and the west, and make benefit of this situation to
our weapons turned out to be less effective than we calculated.
we felt that it was our duty to compensate, to supply more arms,
i'm not ready to capitulate or to surrender one inch or a bit of sand.
at the moscow summit of 1972 the super- powers agreed on a code of conduct - détente.
this angered sadat because he felt that they were giving priority to détente with the americans, rather than helping egypt wage a war.
but détente didn't stop american efforts extend its influence in the middle east at moscow's expense.
our policy in '72 was really to try to minimize and reduce the role -
i'll go further - to keep the soviets out of the situation.
in egypt, as in many other developing nations, the soviet presence was huge.
in july 1972, sadat told the 15,000 advisers and their families to pack up and go.
four thousand egyptian troops and tanks surged over the suez canal.
we'd been waiting for this moment for five years, the moment of crossing the canal.
the united states began to understand that we were in a serious situation when we suddenly changed our tune from this very blithe, typically israeli self-confidence
to a report that, as a result of what happened, we were losing our life-blood.
in washington, president nixon ended the delay over the arms shipments.
nixon said when the option was brought to him to send two or three american planes, said "let's send a lot, because we are going to be criticized anyhow and we will be criticized for whatever we do,
the soviets and henry kissinger rapidly agreed proposals for a cease-fire.
as kissinger arrived in israel to break the news to the israelis, the superpowers' ability to restrain their allies would be tested.
"if you won't do it, we will have to consider unilateral action."
the soviet leaders had every reason to look at this as if there had been some sort of a plot and they reacted very violently and they sent us an extremely tough note saying that they wanted joint american-soviet intervention,
determined to forestall any soviet intervention in the middle east, he placed american nuclear forces on heightened alert.
the basic purpose was to generate a lot of traffic that the soviet union would pick up before they received our reply, to know that this was getting serious.
when bill colby the cia director went to brief the national security council in the white house the first time on this his briefing was literally:
"gentlemen, this is a map of africa, and here is angola.
now in angola we have 3 factions, there's the mpla they're the bad guys.
the fnla they're the good guys and there's unita and jonas savimbi we don't know too well."
the popular movement for the liberation of angola - the mpla, the largest group - was left wing.
based in and around the capital, luanda, its multi-ethnic membership was led by agostinho nets and ludo lara.
in the 1960s it had received training from cuba and arms from moscow.
the national front for the liberation of angola, the fnla, operated largely in the north of the country.
unita, led by jonas savimbi, was based in the south of angola.
a charismatic leader, savimbi decided that american backing was the key to power.
although it was done secretly, it was good for south africa to be co operating with a big force like the usa, even though it was clandestine.
there were many people in policy-making positions in the department of state who were essentially willing to... to have a funny, ambiguous relationship with south africa.
our government in washington perceived fidel castro as a soviet proxy.
we thought with respect to angola, that if the soviet union could intervene at such distances from areas that were far from the traditional russian security concerns,
and when cuban forces could be introduced into distant trouble spots, and if the west could not find a counter to that, that then the whole international system could be destabilized.
it was a question of globalizing our struggle, vis-a-vis the globalized pressures and harassment of the us.
i mean, they were really getting on with it now - they were out of those vehicles and into... into assault formations.
we'd shoot the hell out of these people, you see, and then they would pack up and move, because they didn't expect us.
the south africans were helping unita and zaire was supporting the fnla.
so it was only fair that the mpla asked the cubans to come and support us in the struggle against the invasions.
once we started sending things to angola - we were soon in over our heads- even though it wasn't in our plans to go there.
moscow began shipping hundreds of tons of arms, tanks and missiles direct to luanda.
as the mpla began rehearsals for independence day, battles were still raging just miles from the capital.
in spite of that, it was important for us to proclaim independence- and we did so.
its fight against south african troops gave the mpla political credibility.
south of luanda the cubans prepared to end the south african advance.
it was a decisive battle because if they broke our defense it would be very difficult then to stop them getting to luanda.
there were roads going to the north, roads going to the centre - many roads, which would have made their advance very powerful and fast.
i just saw these lorries with blood dripping out of it, and it wasn't very nice to...
and then to go and investigate, and for the first time you see that actually your own troops are...
we kept it propped up for a while, but opposition was mounting.
still shocked by events in vietnam, the congress out off additional cia funds for angola.
the civil war outlasted the cold war itself, leaving thousands maimed, dead or homeless.
in 1977 the great powers' attention shifted to the horn of africa.
as regimes changed, so did alliances - the soviet union and the united states switched sides easily.
in ethiopia the emperor had been ousted and replaced by marxists.
brzezinski felt that the american presence was legitimate everywhere, but the soviet presence wasn't.
anti-soviet demonstrations in somalia greeted the government's decision to send the russian advisers and their families back to moscow.
the home of africa was not important to america as of itself, but it was important as a measure and a test of how the soviets were interpreting détente.
quarrels about the third world were getting blown out of all proportion.
the feeling was very strong in washington that the soviets were pursuing a policy of expansion into the third world and our objective was to prevent that. narration:

soviet union and between the united states and the west, and make benefit of this situation to
in 1948, the soviet union had supported the creation of the state of israel on arab lands.
by 1967, israel's two and half million jews were surrounded by 90 million hostile arabs.
our weapons turned out to be less effective than we calculated.
we felt that it was our duty to compensate, to supply more arms,
the mourners were uneasy, as were the russians - who could follow nasser?
i shall do my best to follow the policy of my late president, my dearest friend president gamal.
our policy in '72 was really to try to minimize and reduce the role -
i'll go further - to keep the soviets out of the situation.
sadat's move boosted his popularity and showed how little control the russians really had.
by october '72, they decided to come back to the support of egypt.
narration: in washington, president nixon ended the delay over the arms shipments.
nixon said when the option was brought to him to send two or three american planes, said "let's send a lot, because we are going to be criticized anyhow and we will be criticized for whatever we do,
they realized that the greater the military victory on the part of the israelis, the greater defeat of soviet supply and a general weakening of the soviet position in the entire region.
the soviets and henry kissinger rapidly agreed proposals for a cease-fire.
as kissinger arrived in israel to break the news to the israelis, the superpowers' ability to restrain their allies would be tested.
he had made commitments which some of our leaders, especially golda meir, our prime minister, believed to have been rather rash.

the national front for the liberation of angola, the fnla, operated largely in the north of the country.
its leader, holden roberto - a strident anti-communist had close links with neighboring zaire, which supplied him with outdated american arms.
washington ruled out intervention in angola with american troops - instead it turned, secretly, to south africa.
the united states, at the highest level, requested assistance, or rather requests south africa to go in and assist unita.
although it was done secretly, it was good for south africa to be co operating with a big force like the usa, even though it was clandestine.
there were many people in policy-making positions in the department of state who were essentially willing to... to have a funny, ambiguous relationship with south africa.
i mean, obviously we... we had no desire to see fidel castro extend his... his influence in the african continent.
our government in washington perceived fidel castro as a soviet proxy.

we actually had a celebration party in the cia headquarters in washington.
we expected the news by the end of the day that we would have captured luanda.

we kept it propped up for a while, but opposition was mounting.
in 1977 the great powers' attention shifted to the horn of africa.
as regimes changed, so did alliances - the soviet union and the united states switched sides easily.
in washington, some saw the victory as proof that the soviets were abusing détente.
the home of africa was not important to america as of itself, but it was important as a measure and a test of how the soviets were interpreting détente.
it's obvious that i consider myself extremely honored to be an honorary doctor here and professor there and get the legion of honor.
i chartered a plane from munich to paris, arrived bang on time to that ceremony, which in itself was extremely solemn and splendid, and afterwards, you see, the plane had to land in munich before 1 0:00 in the evening
i took ingrid by the hand and we got a lift
in one of the president's cars with flags on it and two motorcycles in front and behind.
so they drove between 50 and 60 miles an hour, those policemen with " blenders" and sirens going.
you know, straight through, and all the cars yielded way as we came racing.
" nobody today knows the names of those who built chartres cathedral."
i think there's great joy in working anonymously as an artist.
more often than not, he's a strange figure for me, someone i'm not very closely acquainted with.
i have nothing against him, but he's nobody especially well known.
his brother dag, later a diplomat, was four years older, his sister margereta four years younger.
ingmar spent his childhood in stockholm, in dalarna, but also in uppsala.
i had a similar upbringing in one way, almost exactly the same upbringing as my brother,
but i managed to come out of it better than he did, because he reacted to this upbringing by being aggressive and trying to defend himself.
so obviously i regarded myself as a real shit and a scoundrel.
but on the other hand, it was a good way of protecting myself.
as i imagined when i was subjected to it at that time.
they did it out of horror at the way their children, especially their boys, behaved themselves.
but you must have had a fantastic feeling of freedom when you left home.
yes, but by then i was already badly injured and it lasted a very long time, and i noticed also
we were able to have our friends there and there was theater.
so i mean, when father was in one of his good moods and not so--
he was in fact very manic-depressive and made awful demands on himself.
when father was happy, there was nobody who could be happier.
sympathetic and clear-sighted, so i think they did as well as they could.
my parents were people of good will, but the upbringing we had, especially my brother and i,
and i also had some music lessons, which, because of idleness, i didn't make proper use of.
but that we played theater, that i had my puppet theater, that was encouraged.
when i want to put myself to sleep in the evening,
i can go through my maternal grandmother's apartment, room by room and remember in the smallest detail, where different things were, how they looked, what color they were.
it was a flat that had been furnished before the turn of the century, and there really was an enormous amount of objects.
for that was the bourgeois style then-- not a single millimeter could remain uncovered.
supposing we go back in time to your tumultuous time, as you call it, your background.
for you lived a more or less bohemian life, despite all the planning, up until a certain point in time.
i went from film to film, from film to play, from play to play, uninterruptedly, year in, year out.
there really wasn't so very much time left over for tumult.
so on the midsummer holiday of 1 967, i moved in on fårö.
since then i've never written anything in any other place than on fårö.
acts of political treachery have followed one another in close succession.
the political nomenclature came from the academic world and lost that contact with sweden the founding politicians used to have.
do you see that as a social democratic plot, or was it the bureaucracy?
no, i see that as an excrescence on the new social democracy's reckless pretensions to power.
the only problem with him was that he kept his patients for 1 8 or 20 years.
could you ever have thought in your wildest imagination that you would undergo some kind of psychoanalysis in any other way than through writing?
that was in connection with that tax business, when i was in the nuthouse for three weeks.
because i wanted nothing else and nothing more than to jump off the balcony.
but i thought too that that was a poor solution, so i agreed to be locked in, and also it was because i was subjected to incredibly heavy medication.
and though it certainly took away the torment itself and the suffering, that medication
and then if we take this further, you know it was quite simply my aggressiveness that saved me.
because when the tax authorities didn't find anything through the ways they started, they began to push with new methods and with blackmail and anything they could think of.
i was completely wild with fury and i got well through it.
but you didn't have any other period of sinking into illness?
my sorrow has never been associated with any rage or bitterness or cynicism or anything like that.
i hid myself in my sorrow like in a room, and felt myself maimed, but i get through.
we went up in the evening, up to fårö, and sat on the steps and looked at the lilac hedge that was in full bloom.
we sat on the steps in the twilight in the warm night, the mild, light, summer night.
then the next day we went down again and on to munich.
i was abroad for eight years and didn't work in sweden again for a long time.
it was a fantastic feeling to come home and work in swedish again.
it was an incredible feeling to be able to use the swedish language again.
ingmar bergman has written the original manuscripts for all of his almost 50 films for the cinema and tv, and for seven films directed by others.
in addition, he has directed theater and opera for 60 years, altogether over 120 stage productions, his own plays and documentary films.
in films you have here and there, fairly often, in fact, been considerably more experimental than in the theater.
the films have required their form, and the theater productions have required their form.
i have a certain type of writing pad that i write on.
they had them when i was a script hack in svensk filmindustri, employed as a scriptwriter, 1942.
we got a kind of yellow-lined pad that was about this big.
they always wrote by hand with a fountain pen with a broad nib.
you see, now i write with a ballpoint pen, but not just any old ballpoint pen.
it has to be a very special pen with a very large ball.
there can't be any things lying around all over the desk.
i'm maniacally pedantic when it comes to how my desk should look if i'm to be able to sit there and work.
when i've been writing for 45 minutes, i take a rest.
by then my back aches, so i get up and walk around my 54-meter-long house, or go and look at the sea or something for a quarter of an hour.
showing you directing in the theater or film studio, you appear to be in a good mood.
i think it's part of a director's duties to be in a good mood while working.
i dragged in the devils of my private life and my hangovers and my women problems and my shortcomings and my stupidities.
i dragged them with me into the studio or onto the stage, and carried on like a devil, and by doing this,
we're joking and telling funny stories and relaxing and so on, they still feel that they are in a situation of life and death.
and when i say life and death, i mean just that.
generally speaking, chatter is an abomination, because there are two or three or four maybe who are involved while a great crowd of people stand around and fidget and think that it's terribly boring.
i think that all such discussion of different kinds-- the same applies to the theater, even more in the theater-- should take place away from rehearsals and away from studios.
they should stand at attention and on parade so that i can convey to the actors
how suspicion and how hypochondria works in gestures or in tones of voice or in movement.
and i go out through the studio door, or even earlier, or when the rehearsal is over, or the production is over for the day, then i no longer have any control over the demons.
then it's no longer my universe, so to speak, the often unpredictable universe
ingmar's 60th birthday, 1978 they lived together for 24 years until her death in 1995.
i can't stop thinking about the fact that not only your films but you yourself have been surrounded to an unusual extent by sickness and death.
i could sit for hours at my desk, and nothing got written.
but, you see, it's another thing to sit alone and write.
and afterwards, i was gradually able to trick myself back into the story itself, but that took a hell of a long time.
so i did five, eight, ten pages a day on all sorts of things.
but now more than previously, so i won't go to pieces.
is this the reason why you really don't want to meet others?
you can have a great joy in being good friends on the telephone.
but i live now for the most part alone, quite alone.
" chief nourisher in life's feast, the welcome death of each day's life."
i take a sleeping pill in the evening, and then i can sleep six hours.
i think it's a bergman quotation that i remember, whether from a script or whatever:
" what's scary about death is that you don't know what happens afterwards."
they had a terrible difficulty in getting me back to life.
the interesting thing was that for me those eight hours were no hours at all, not a minute, not a second.
so that was eight hours that were completely gone from my life.
and that felt extraordinarily comforting when i thought that such is death.
therefore, two modes of thought have come into violent conflict with one another.
i've tried to write about it, but i can't do it yet, and it may be a while.
but i know that, in some way, she's quite close to me.
whether it's a projection from inside myself or a reality, that really doesn't matter.
when you live very much alone, you start to talk to yourself.
i have conversations with ingrid, and it seems to me that she answers me, and sometimes i think she comes with good advice and opinions about what i'm doing and not doing.
i have a whole lot of ideas about other realities that surround me.
i also have the feeling sometimes that we're part of an infinitely large pattern
it says, " i'm now on my way out of everything, without bitterness and with a great feeling of satisfaction.
now it's simply a matter of organizing the epilogue so that it's reasonably pleasant.
one absolutely must have something other than theater, between oneself and death."
and then, in the last ten years, you have produced a large number of books, scripts,
film work is so trying, and when that strain fell away,
i had a whole lot of time left-- a whole lot of strength left, and desire.
i just wonder if it got easier or harder with the years.
when you think of the fact that when you made fanny and alexander, you'd been making films for almost, what is it, about 40 years, yes, something like that, if you include crisis.
is it antonioni who said that each camera adjustment is a moral issue?
when you're young and you make films, and you know that very well yourself, you know that when you see the rushes, you take them and you're happy, just because the actors move and it's more or less all right.
but when you get older and have been at it for a long time, then you know that, in fact, for this particular scene, there's only one solution, and i sincerely hope i've hit on that solution.
what would you like to imagine people will say about bergman in 20 years?
and the fear i have is preceded by a sleepless night and great fear,
and it's no good my trying to tell myself that i've already done it and that it was successful.
that is the only thing i'm afraid of, and god knows that i'm terribly afraid of it, and that is that suddenly the ability to make something living
and moving-- that that will be taken away from me or that i will lose it.
that the anguish will continue until i go in to the rehearsal, and after five minutes, it's gone.
but i know that before this the fear will be total,
maybe you don't believe all this is true, but it really is so.
i mean, any filming day in my life, any rehearsal day in my life,
i've had-- naturally more or less, but always a fear-- this anxiety that--
i can't express it in any other way than this anxiety that what i do won't live.
you know, i don't have so many nightmares, but it's my recurring nightmare
that i do things that are stone-dead-- that i can't put my life into what i do.
in the first place, i'm a craftsman and i make a good product.
i make a product that's to be used, and i'll be terribly upset if it suddenly turns out that nobody wants to use my product.
i think that the only really unfortunate thing is when something i have done is not used.
and i can be terribly proud, professionally proud, of having done a good job.
charlie tyner shacked up with your wife at the starlight motel.
as soon as you got the chance, you made him pay.
you destroyed my whole life because i wouldn't tell you what you wanted to hear.
for an ounce of coke, you took away my little girl!
a week before that piece of garbage got what he deserved.

judge denham suppressed pacheco's gun and dismissed the charges against him.
the shooter walks, and we have murder one against the girl who was raped.
by the next day we'd have people from the inspector general's office, from the bureau of criminal investigations swarming all over the place.
mr. atwood, if you reported the rape to your captain, wouldn't you be afraid of retaliation by your colleagues?
abbie, i'm not suggesting we water down the cross, but you heard what i heard.
is it really that hard for you to put yourself in alice's shoes?
one day, he took me in a closet, and i let him.
i just closed my eyes, and i let him do it.
no, look, apparently she's supposed to be very good and... and her friend said she could help me, i don't know, to be a better fighter.
boy, this business with the thieves really smacked your pride around, didn't it?
look, uh... do you think we can keep this whole thing to ourselves?
i really don't want to get into it with kung lao again.
whatever it is, we can't let it loose in zhu zin.
kung lao, he just said he was here to kill you.
last night was the night before the full moon, known as... ..the night before the full moon.
so, the legend that werewolves only prowl during a full moon might be erroneous?
i wanna show you what to do if you are attacked from behind.
in this situation, bend forward,... ..using your back and shoulders to flip the assailant over to the ground.
first they tell me i can't hunt an elephant for its ivory.
now i've gotta deal with people for the ethical treatment of werewolves!
believe me, i'm gonna give that wolfie somethin' to howl about.
but while we're doing nothing, there's a human werewolf out there, making fun of us.
it used to be easy to tell if a boy liked you.
he'd punch you on the arm and then run back to his friends.
if it weren't for you, people'd be lined up to get buried.
willow would be robbie the robot's love slave, i wouldn't have a head and... ..theresa's a vampire.
a full moon like tonight tends to bring out the crazies.
but with some simple basics of self-defence,... ..each of you can learn how to protect yourself.
i'm the one with the gun, which means i get to do the interviewing.
hey, before we get all chummy here, how about we do something about this net?
i'd really love to stay and chat, but i'm on a tight schedule.
any idea where else the boys and girls get together around here?
if none of that works, i think i may have an alternative.
yeah, me and the werewolf alone in a cage for three minutes.
nowhere in any of the reports did it say anything about her being mauled.
they were linked to the animal attacks, so we assumed werewolf.

the title held by me mib means what you think you saw you did not see
so don't blink be what was there is now gone the black suits with the black ray bans on
walk in shadow move in silence guard against extra terrestrial violence
but yo we ain't on no government list we straight don't exist no names and no fingerprints
on the horizon bright light enters sight tight camaras zoom on the impending doom
but then like boom black suits fill the room up with the quickness talk with the witnesses
we're your first last and only line of defense against the worst scum of the universe
so don't fear us cheer us if you ever get near us don't jeer us we're fearless
here come the men in black men in black galaxy defenders ohh ooohh
here come the men in black men in black they wont let you remember oh nohh
- they won't let you remember - won't let you remember
- here come the men in black - ohh here they come
i just wanted you to know that i understand his reasons.
you were the correct, logical choice, and i support his decision.
i was going to tell you your ship just arrived, but you can see that for yourself.
would you like me to tell you what i see, mr. allan?
where that is impractical, we will put you in contact with their ambassadors here.
it is a condition of membership that medical information be made available to you.
he burst in on a meeting and attempted to assault my guest.
captain, your guest got inside mr. garibaldi's head reprogrammed him, messed up his life.
the reports do a very good job of putting across his side, and yours.
now, would you like to hear my side or continue shouting?
whatever past relationship you and garibaldi have with him i have to behave according to what he does on my watch.
if i judged everyone according to what was reported to me by others i'd have concluded that you were a traitor to earth during the war and shot you on sight, sir.
i give you my word, if he breaks the rules an inch, he's out of here.
but until then, i have got to do this my way.
it looks like the bomb was hooked into the ship's navigational system.
it was programmed to explode when the nav system was set for a particular destination.
you just don't walk into somebody's office and start a fight unless invited to do so.
this is the most amazing base i've ever been posted to.
everybody here's either trying to kill each other or pound each other into a pulp.
i don't know what kind of way that is to run a...
i was wrong to bring them here wrong to trust in others.
and perhaps i was most wrong of all to hold out the possibility of hope to them, to myself and to you.
i believe you would protect me until the stars themselves went cold and dead.
but my people need me, and i must go to them.
they should have them in hand by the end of the day.
any response from earth on delaying turning over the prisoners to bester?
they've kept their noses so clean you could eat off them.
not an image i wanted this early in the morning, but thank you.
it's not a big problem yet but alien biologies range all over the place.
there's not much common ground but it's been known to happen.
i was thinking about what you said the other day about wanting to serve the alliance more than you do which is already considerable.
as you may know the cruiser that was going to take londo back to centauri prime was sabotaged and destroyed.
dr. franklin just hit me with the paperwork a couple of hours ago.
"no interstellar traveler who's been in unknown space shall be allowed within earth-controlled space until after a 60-day quarantine period."
you were the correct, logical choice, and i support his decision.
i appreciate that, ambassador but since others might not be quite so understanding i would really prefer to keep this between the two...
i don't know why, or how, or where, but i can feel it to the very core of my being, mr. allan.
this is where it begins to go badly for all of us.
it remained there by the river, long after i had gone to dust.
if there was a straight answer buried in there somewhere, i sure didn't see it.
escort mr. garibaldi here to the brig and do not cut him loose until i say so.
for the record, gentlemen, you are now five seconds away from a court-martial, so make the best of them.
now we want to send you out to member worlds to do firsthand research.
where that is impractical, we will put you in contact with their ambassadors here.
many of the other races want to keep their medical histories confidential.
but we'd love to have you take on the job, if you're willing.
now, would you like to hear my side or continue shouting?
if the latter please let me know so i can sit down and get comfortable.
now, you and delenn said very specifically the interstellar alliance grants sovereignty to each world to govern its people the way it sees fit.
since earthgov is part of the alliance, you have to respect their policies.
i can't ignore him or throw him out until he breaks the rules.
whatever past relationship you and garibaldi have with him i have to behave according to what he does on my watch.
if i judged everyone according to what was reported to me by others i'd have concluded that you were a traitor to earth during the war and shot you on sight, sir.
i give you my word, if he breaks the rules an inch, he's out of here.
if i contravene our policies for my own convenience it'll give our enemies something to point to and say we're hypocrites.
if i violate my promise to the telepaths, our enemies will latch on to that as well.
we found trace of a chemical explosive material and a detonator.
it looks like the bomb was hooked into the ship's navigational system.
it was programmed to explode when the nav system was set for a particular destination.
they programmed a series of jumps that would take them to the centauri transit beacon when the explosion hit.
the chemical composition of that explosive was centauri so it was definitely planted there.
- well, we were the liner's last stop so if the bomb was programmed to go off when the beacon was set for the return voyage then the target has to be someone getting on board here.
this is the most amazing base i've ever been posted to.
everybody here's either trying to kill each other or pound each other into a pulp.
someone he didn't have to worry about sandbagging him or stabbing in the back when he wasn't looking.
someone who'd argue with him when necessary but would back him when he was right.
we hit it off fell crazy in love, got married realized we'd made a terrible mistake, fell crazy out of love, and split up.
you see, in a relationship, you gotta take turns being in charge but we both wanted to be in charge all the time.
he's not carrying a torch for me, i'm not carrying one for him.
but the bottom line is he knows he can trust me and i know i can trust him.
and we finally got the cargo lifts operating at 100 percent capacity.
ms. connelly expects the backlog should be cleared in a couple of hours.
we figure there's maybe a half dozen left, plus the leader.
they should have them in hand by the end of the day.
these telepaths have been traveling around for upwards of three, four years.
they've been in and out of every federation in the cluster.
"no interstellar traveler who's been in unknown space shall be allowed within earth-controlled space until after a 60-day quarantine period."
i have to follow the rules, mr. bester, same as you.
now that i've promised him that you or your people will not leave the station i, too, am stuck with that promise, and so are you.
get on over to medlab and have dr. franklin have a look at you.
if you're on the seventh floor of a burning building, you can die or jump out the window.
once you're out the window, you're alive for another two seconds during which time you figure out the solution to the next problem.
i just wanted you to know that i understand his reasons.

if you're on the seventh floor of a burning building, you can die or jump out the window.
once you're out the window, you're alive for another two seconds during which time you figure out the solution to the next problem.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
after i flunked out of school, well, it was either construction or the army.
when i first met celine, i was 20 foot up on a scaffold.
and i suppose you just happened to be in the neighborhood, right?
you know, it's always nice to liaison with the locals when you can.
how i do appreciate the feeling... of a powerful stallion beneath my loins.
aye, and one that likes to be ridden long and hard?
there once was a young man with a film roll... who befriended a lass named cole-- reagan cole.
you wouldn't happen to know anybody named reagan cole, would you, mr. macleod?
if i were to punch you in the heart i'd break my fist.
and, to think i used to serve you in the old ways.
i called her auntie a, but she was really a mother to me.
have you ever noticed, when you're miserable, time seems to slow to a crawl?
i have to mix your blood with the mortar for the castle.
this old fool tells me it's the only way to make the building stand.
the cup our lord, jesus christ, used at the holy supper.
it has the power to feed the hungry and heal the sick.
she has been a friend of mine... since before the dawn of time.
if i can remember that... it means that i'm an old man.
i will restore your beauty if you take merlin to a place that i have created for you.
you can live with him there until the end of your days.
a dream of a dream... the skies parted and i saw the dream come alive, before my eyes.
that was someday, they'll describe me, arthur, guinevere, and camelot as a dream.
and so, the years rolled on... one year merging into another... and another.
if you five gentlemen don't stop trembling, i might miss, and kill you all.
i'm leaving you with your misery, and pain... but... with no more magic powers!
now... you will wander through the world ugly and alone... just as if you were human.
you left me alone for years, did you not think of me?
what of my honour, finding out my husband had a child by a
my lords, this is a time when we should temper justice with mercy.
let he who is not guilty of sin cast the first stone.
i was trying to smile but it was the smile of... desolation.
inside i felt only the pity and the terror and the waste of it all.
and the cycle of death and darkness ended... and so does my story.
now, if my story entertained, or enchanted... you may show you appreciaton in any way you see fit...
i am not feeling any love in this room at this time.
correct me if i'm wrong, stella, but this is your treat because you know my money is too funny.
then what you doing sitting there when you know you need some sun?
all it takes is one phone call and you're on your way to the most beautiful place on earth where the water caresses you by day and sings you a lullaby at night.
i just got my degree in biology, but i don't know what to do with it.
so i'm here trying to land a summer job, possibly learn to be a chef.
i heard you was down here on the island looking for some real love.
if that rumor's true, i'm here to put the "p" in paradise for you.
how can i be late to something i never said i was coming to?
i've been waiting for you to walk through that door since a quarter to 10.
before you get too pissed, they're about to cut off my cable and take back my nordstrom's card.
because you know chantel's daddy is late again with the check.
don't forget, i got over 3000 in my bank savings if you need it.
thank you, baby, but your mom put away something for a rainy day.
it would be as if someone just took away his identity.
so don't try and pretend like it's not a big deal because i know that it is.
i won't waste this expensive phone call talking about me, miss thing.
for a girl who lost her job, you sound awfully chipper.
but what would make you think that i was ready to meet your parents?
i wanted them to know how important you are to me.
two years ago, when i got that big irs refund check....
that is too long for a girl to go without feeling the rush of a shopping spree.
i'd get up there to the refrigerator, there'd be nothing left.
i had to suck her ass out of there like a hoover.
and now, we'll have a few closing remarks from delilah's dear friend, ms. stella payne.
d would tell me to make it quick don't get all mushy on her.
but i'm mad at you, d for finally doing what you've never been able to do keep a secret.
who's gonna be my best friend now, is what i want to know.
she'll be near a bid whist game or cooking greens and ham hocks.
i hope you guys are half as blessed as i was to have a friend as cool as funny smart and as crazy as she.
and how many times must i tell you to take out the trash?
or if you see the car's on e, put a little gas in it.
but you knew what we were dealing with before i came.
so if you can't handle it or if it's too much for you to deal with all of a sudden then maybe we should just forget this whole thing, okay?
what we're trying to say is that in your absence it's become quite clear to us how important you are to the company.
merger or no merger, we're creating a spot for you, stell.
you can come back in here, start making things, start having fun again.
sweetie, i cannot sit in here and be demi moore in dappled light.
and you can start by checking the want ads for a maid, and stop being so damn cheap.
no one knows how to clean my house better than i do.
i am not feeling any love in this room at this time.
correct me if i'm wrong, stella, but this is your treat, 'cause you know my money is too funny.
i'm here staying with a friend of mine... who works at the resort.
i just got my degree in biology, but i don't know what to do with it, so i'm here trying to land a summer job... possibly learn to be a chef.
how can i be late to something i never said i was coming to?
well, i been waiting for you to walk through that door since a quarter to 10:00.
i postponed medical school, and, needless to say, my father was a bit upset at first.
yes... but then he realized that it was your life, and he told you to take all the time you needed, right?
and i would sit, and i'd play in my pajamas until daylight.
sometimes you don't know what your life is going to turn out like...
i had a little baby accident in your car, but it wasn't my fault, stella!
stella, this woman came out of nowhere making a left turn out of the right lane.
all i've got to say is thank god it was just a little fling, and you're not seeing him again.
and you should be ashamed of yourself for being so desperate.
you need to take your pregnant behind home right now, because you could spoil a wet dream.
for your information, i'm not completely stupid, nor have i committed any crime.
too busy making sure your spot didn't become one of theirs.
don't forget, i got over 3,000 in my bank savings if you need it.
so, when we just left off, you were getting into how much you missed me.
i, i wrote you a letter, but i was a little afraid to send it.
let me think about it, and i'll call you back with the details.
stella, when you come, could you bring me some junk food?
i mean, if my father couldn't practice medicine anymore, boy, the man would not know what to do with himself.
it would be as if someone just took away his... his identity.
i wanted them to know how important you are to me.
but you could have asked me how i felt about it.
i'd get up there to the refrigerator, there's be nothing left but a dollop.
i had to suck her ass outta there like a hoover.
and forgive me, but it was a hot pink polyester jump-suit that you were wearing, which i distinctly remember telling you was a bad fashion statement.
i never wore a hot pink jump-suit in my life, bitch.
and now, we'll have a few closing remarks from delilah's dear friend ms. stella payne.
d would tell me to make it quick, don't get all mushy on her, so i'll try.
i guess it really shouldn't matter that she didn't tell me right off that she was sick.
that i'm mad at you, d, for finally doing what you've never been able to do... keep a secret.
you're the one who has to have everything your way or no way.
you're the one who always has to be in control, or you don't know what to do with yourself.
i can't change that, and you can't change your age, either.
but you knew what we were dealing with before i came.
what we're trying to say is that in your absence it's become quite clear to us how important you are to the company.
merger or no merger, we're creating a spot for you, stella.
you can come back in here and make things and start having fun again.
sweetie, listen, i cannot sit in here and be demi moore in dappled light.
the kind you deserve, would be making things a bit easier for you.
winston, you're not adding to my troubles, if that's what you're thinking.
actually, i meant more like screwing in an airplane bathroom... kind of fantasies.
the closest charlotte had ever come to getting screwed on a plane... was the time she lost all her luggage on a flight to palm beach.
isn't it weird that you're thinking of sleeping with someone you don't know... to get closer to jack?
how well do we ever know the people we sleep with?
so, the four of us get into a cab, only they won't let me sit in back with them.
they make me ride in front with the driver, who's the original chris... from the partridge family.
once upon a time, in a magical land called manhattan, a young woman fell in love.
charlotte and jack locked eyes at a black tie benefit for epstein/barr.
i'd love to own my own gallery, and maybe a little cottage in maine.
well, actually i meant more like screwing in an airplane bathroom kind of fantasies.
i was drunk, and i woke up in someone else's bra.
only do a threesome as the guest star - the girl the couple gets to come in, screw, and leave.
so the four of us get into a cab, only they won't let me sit with them.
they make me sit with the driver, who's like chris from the partridge family.
what mr big didn't realise was the past was sleeping right next to me.
the next day the flesh and blood barbara asked me to lunch.

if you really want to help me, help me figure out what the problem is with don.
oh, i'll tell you how to solve any kind of love problem.
big explosion, chunks of debris, things flying every which way, then a second explosion, not quite as huge as the first one, but still very big and sparkly, something to see.
only, of course, you wouldn't because you'd have been vaporized in the first one.
nevertheless, i'm going to do something that i hoped i wouldn't have to do.
well, we can't have you blabbing about this to everyone, can we?
so i'm going to smooth over your memory traces, you see?
now, this device is very, very efficient, but it does melt about half a human brain.
gentlemen, revolutionary education requires a different attitude from everyone,... starting with respect for the comrade teacher felipa,... who abandoned everything she had in her homeland... to come to progreso to give her all for you.
don't make me use repressive methods of the bourgeois schools themselves,... like sticks, for example.
maybe you can explain it aloud to all of us, rafael.
it has to be pushed into the female flower, mistress,... by a flying willy.
and a very special applause for those who i was told have made this day... an ineffable and historic journey,... to land, or rather to land on water, the first airplane to reach yucatan,... these gentlemen, these german pilots present here.
and now with you, from the steppes of hungary... undefiled heir of gypsy blood... who has astonished demanding audiences... across europe, asia, and the middle east,... the prince of the air, rey reyes.
i know you're the boss, but please, fabian, you have to go to bed.
i don't want the children to see you drunk like this again.
i say we have to give them their machine,... and if they want to strike, we do so as well.
and when our strikes were suppressed, what did our comrade farmers do?
"the commitments of my art oblige me to bring the joy of the circus to other places.
"i will keep in my heart forever the hospitality of the zapata home.
if that rey hadn't arrived at the chinaman's shop just then... your father never would have met him and magda would be sleeping in your house right now.
the same goes for me, if i hadn't given the basket to donkey.
that was why rafael caught you screwing dona lanchita,... and you won't have other choice but going back to her.
she already bewitched you, nothing will go right in your life anymore.
i talked to your dad, don fabian,... whom i've known for many years.
i see you're fortunate that when you're older, you'll inherit his position.
no matter where you hide, here i am, and here i'll continue to be!
and you, bootlicking comrades, go ask your boss if he can hear me... and tell him to go hide in that whale who bore him.
why don't you tell us how big a bribe the city council chairmanship will cost you, lucio?
but general cardenas will be coming here,... and i personally am going to tell him about all your abuse!
just in case the fruits of the revolution would take too long to show.
i always felt that the ear wasn't the only thing that was missing.
i don't much like or have any interest in teacher felipa... but she's our only chance.
you have no right to treat her like that on account of the poor money you bring in.
the brothers' brothers international circus, welcomes you to this, their home,... and i want you to enjoy your stay here with us.
please sit at your assigned seats or chose the seats that suit you best.
too bad the eve of a holiday display is overshadowed by our mourning.
a comrade of ours is gone,... but he left us his the goal of his struggle.
in other circumstances we would pay him tribute,... but for now i don't think there is greater recognition... than to continue with the activities of the union,... which his courage helped shape.
although general lazaro cardenas doesn't generally announce his travel plans,... we know that his arrival is imminent.
i demonstrate the enormous satisfaction that overwhelms me... to meet you in the land of felipe carrillo puerto.
conscientiousness men lead with a high moral example... to work in service not only of personal interest... but to enhance the homeland.
to you, fellow farmers, in which noble profession is the salvation of the country,...
i come to announce the start of urgent land tenancy reform.
the bounty of the land will accrue to those who work on it.
men, women, and children, i wish you good health and prosperity for mexico.
i come to see your husband so he could heal me.
he won, but it exhausted him to the point of death.
with apologies, comrade lucio, but we didn't institute unions to behave like this.
~ the gentleman has every right to carry his own bag.
come meet my good friend, rey reyes, the best aerialist in the world.
he doesn't dress like a man, but that's because he is a performer.
you'll leave me here alone, waiting for you like your fool until you get horny again.
for a woman like you. it has to be easy to get a man if you try, right?
if we hand over the machine to you, where's our leverage?
what good is it to send us sisal if we don't have the equipment to extract the fibers?
and you, what do you want to be when you grow up?
my dad wants me to inherit his position and home,... and to study, and be a leader.
my friend rafael has an uncle in the sporting club of merida.
at the end of the school term he'll hire us for the team.
go tell them i'll warn them when the next piece is ready to go.
"the commitments of my art oblige me to bring the joy of the circus to other places.
well, it all depends on how well or poorly she gets along with rey.
but the truth is that when someone leaves something very important somewhere,... eventually they return.
you've turned thirteen, and... unintentionally i've overheard some things you and your friends say, and... the truth, these things are no longer of childish matters.
what i mean is that it was not easy for me to make this decision,... but i think about what your father would have done.
besides, your mother, i love her like a mother, and you like a brother.
you also have to think about her and her needs as she think of yours.
not even if he were the last man on the planet.
but don't you think that he'd treat you much better than that sailor?
let's see, explain to me who's been inventing the story that your teacher felipa indulges in witchcraft.
she really made eliseo bring her a sock from the sailor, now you see the consequences.
well, eliseo saw her rub the sailor's photo with a sock to make him come back... and it worked.
i warned you, kauich, you've got an f. now sit down.
now i can start saving for when i get married and have little donkeys.
you should begin to do the same,... out of respect for the mother of your children.
let this, then, be our painful farewell to a pure soul still in its childhood,... a holy example of light, nemesio kauich,... an outstanding student and beloved classmate.
known affectionately as "donkey",... he lost his life in unfortunate and unfair circumstances.
it's you lot who get me angry, you feeble, you lukewarm-balls!
why don't you tell us how big a bribe the city council chairmanship will cost you, lucio?
he saved his little capital, what the government gave him for his ear, and he didn't spend it.
just in case the fruits of the revolution would take too long to show.
i always felt that the ear wasn't the only thing that was missing.
with what the inn brought me, i'll be able to support the school,... a school where real teaching is not forbidden, for girls as well as boys.
how come you don't realize that everything that we negotiated with the powers-that-be has been to get what little we have today?
or how do you think we got you your pension after the accident?
to repay to your family what you and your son drink.
look at him, figure out how much that suit cost him.
a comrade of ours is gone,... but he left us his the goal of his struggle.
in other circumstances we would pay him tribute,... but for now i don't think there is greater recognition... than to continue with the activities of the union,... which his courage helped shape.
although general lázaro cárdenas doesn't generally announce his travel plans,... we know that his arrival is imminent.
so now what we came here for, foremost: we have the opening of his will,... comrade fabián zapata, may you rest in peace.
conscientiousness men lead with a high moral example... to work in service not only of personal interest... but to enhance the homeland.
to you, fellow farmers, in which noble profession is the salvation of the country,...
i come to announce the start of urgent land tenancy reform.

and he told me in passing that the accountant had bought a pair of ferengi rain slippers.
and if there was a drought, he wouldn't need rain slippers.
- and i love her, but i can't go with you.
i'm married, i have responsibilities, and they don't want me to die.
i guess we're not cut out to be heroes after all.
and to think, just a few short days ago i was sitting on top of the world.
and he told me in passing that the accountant had bought himself a very nice pair of ferengi rain slippers.
and if there was a drought, he wouldn't need rain slippers.
i have responsibilities and my responsibilities don't want me to die.
i don't want to die either, so let's just concentrate on the reward the nagus is offering.
for one thing, it's a confined area with only two ways in or out-- this one, and that one over there.
secondly, it's near the airlock which gives us access to our ship and third, it's on the promenade where the prisoner exchange will take place.
after what is surely going to be a most unpleasant debriefing.
i'm sorry to hear about that, but it's not my problem.

not that we give them but that's how ready she is.
problem is, we inherited black projects and research programs that he started but he never told anybody about.
for six months, i've been tracking them down and finding out what's involved.
i know you two kids could talk shop until dawn but we've got a little talking of our own to do.
so i suggest you let the captain get back to work.
well, these days only a nut and a control freak would completely fund research into pure science.
he didn't do it to advance science or serve the commonwealth.
anyway that has nothing to do with why i wanted to see you.

but there are dozens of alien life forms that can live double, even triple that.

you may have found something new and i understand you want time to investigate.
that doesn't cover the data you've gathered for the last three years.
you can at least give me that information so i can better evaluate this new finding.
captain, before i go when you got your headache earlier, i said i might have something for it.
most headaches are caused by stress and since this has really worked for me i thought i'd pick you one up as well.

dr. bryson, i want you to listen to me very carefully.
thousands of years ago, ralga was a distant world whose name had been forgotten by all but our order.
they were an advanced people who chose not to leave their planet and go beyond the stars.
an exquisite race of poets and dreamers and philosophers and leaders.
a race wise beyond their time and soon to die before their time.
then it was decided to place the ralga vessel of souls in one of our whisper galleries where they would never be alone.
where they might talk to each other, there in the great gallery.
all we know for sure is that dr. bryson has gone underground taking the stolen object with him.
this is a big place, but if he's still here, and our visitor seems confident that he is then we can and will find him.
now, we don't know if he's armed, but he should still be considered dangerous.
i want reports on anything strange that happens here tonight no matter how irrelevant it may seem.
if mr. garibaldi's wrong and there is a heaven you're committing a crime beyond description by taking these souls instead of allowing them to move on.
but if he and we are correct, and there is nothing beyond wouldn't you want to be continued?
the mad ones saw an opportunity to take revenge on one of our captors.
now, we tried to interfere, but they got ahead of us.
when you jumped in front of the other, we were able to adjust the power in the nanoseconds between the time it left the wall and struck you.
just enough time to stop your heart for a second so that we could talk.
failing to understand the nobility of our mission we assume everyone would rather see us dead.
but you have changed all that now at least for me.
since we are rarely invited or welcome in those places that we must go in order to perform our work we have perfected our own means of entry.
all of our ships are made to attach themselves to any other ship and burn through.
when our order is united and determined there is no one that can stop us.
only the minbari succeeded, when we came for their leader, dukhat.
we know from the vorlons and others that when a race evolves beyond a certain point they no longer need a physical body.
they evolve past that point and become beings of pure energy.
we've got half a billion souls crying out for revenge someplace in here.
the last thing we need is to show them some more targets.
if they've got control of the power supply, they control the enhanced-fusion reactor.
we got a lot of soul hunter ships outside and inside, a group that will die to strike back.
for a spokesperson, they could have picked any image from the holobrothel.
but they chose the one they knew would draw my attention.
forgive me, friends, but in my order i am considered quite young, only 4000 years old and as such, i am also considered quite naive.
i am obliged to tell you that if the vessel of souls is not returned to our order within 20 of your time minutes they will attack.
they're able to do this because bryson is a conduit to the outside world.
if i can get through to him, appeal to his humanity maybe we can shut them down that way.
there may still be a way to bridge the two sides.
listen, they were powerful enough to draw you into their vessel which proves beyond a doubt that they are highly advanced.
at first, for brief times, of course as you have achieved here through the holograms.
and then later, we can invite others to come and allow you to express yourselves through them.
and until that time i offer myself freely as a symbol of our sincerity.
you have the power to take me inside and prove to all that you are highly developed, living souls who were cut off at the moment of your supreme evolution.
and once my soul joins yours you will know instantly that i am telling the truth and you will have good reason to trust us.
i beg you give us this opportunity to correct our mistake.
let my soul be a bridge between us until that day when you shall be released.
let the death of this body be your only remaining vengeance and let my soul be a doorway of hope.
make sure the promise he made on your behalf is kept or i promise you, the hunters will become the hunted.
i'll do whatever it takes to make sure that his sacrifice was not in vain.
not that he was stable to begin with, but they think he'll be all right.
you know, the amazing thing is, after all this he still wants to search for the secret of life eternal with or without financing.
- depositions by all those involved supporting my use of force and the nature of the combat.
further, since all prior charges were centered around the condition of the "entertainment center" and the ability of said business to operate freely the destruction of your client's office makes this discussion moot.
i believe only in what i can see and hear and touch.
if i believed in souls, i couldn't exactly do this for a living.
dr. wolfgang pauli was a physicist on earth during the late 20th century.
whenever he stepped inside the physics lab, something would go wrong or break down, usually a very expensive piece of equipment.
so for the first time, they had some proof that the pauli effect wasn't real.
until they found out that at the exact moment the equipment exploded he was on a train passing by right in front of the place.
oh, before i forget, you know how to use one of those?
there's one in your room and in case you need instructions, i don't want any problems.
as you know, when i married lise i took over the day-to-day operation of her late husband's corporation.
problem is, we inherited black projects and research programs that he started but he never told anybody about.
i picked this as a midway point to meet a researcher who's been doing these things for a couple of years.
we'll get together he'll tell me why he needs the money, i'll listen, go back to mars.
you're the first person i've met outside the field who knows what it is.
there's only a dozen of us back on earth who specialize in it.
but he was willing to fund my program and for that alone i will always consider him a good man.
anyway that has nothing to do with why i wanted to see you.
- at the height of our medical expertise we can extend human life to 110, maybe 115 years.
but there are dozens of alien life forms that can live double, even triple that.
you may have found something new and i understand you want time to investigate.
that doesn't cover the data you've gathered for the last three years.
or on the other hand, if you're here for a fight, i can get into that too.
you think you can just come in here and intimidate me into leaving, think again.
it could be a form of telepathic communication or something more elemental.
i'm going to try increasing the power to see if that helps.
if i take away your memories the sum and substance of all that you have seen, done, known are you still you anymore?
and by taking these things away, do i now own you?
all i know is, the only time they show up is when someone's about to die.
i just have a dry spot in my throat from the air conditioning.
and what was taken from us, what is ours were among the rarest of the rare.
thousands of years ago, ralga was a distant world whose name had been forgotten by all but our order.
they were an advanced people who chose not to leave their planet and go beyond the stars.
an exquisite race of poets and dreamers and philosophers and leaders.
the passing of the physical form is like a beacon to us.
and we came at once, because we could feel the passing of a billion minds.
only three times in our history have we done such a thing.
then it was decided to place the ralga vessel of souls in one of our whisper galleries where they would never be alone.
where they might talk to each other, there in the great gallery.
we were certain that no one else was aware of the location.
there is strength enough in one mind, one soul, to change the universe.
can you imagine how much strength there would be in 1 billion souls all focused on escape?
they would have to find someone they could influence and direct.
someone with the knowledge and the resources to do physically what they cannot do.
this is a big place, but if he's still here, and our visitor seems confident that he is then we can and will find him.
i want an organized search of every level, starting with the empty quarters.
if you hadn't noticed, we're in the middle of a situation so why don't you go chase an ambulance and let me get back to my business.
i was hoping we could work this out amicably but apparently you prefer a long, drawn-out court fight which is fine with me, since you'll be liable for all the court costs in addition to statutory and punitive damages.
they were taking me to a place i did not wish to go so i made them sleep.
i went off on my own and my wandering brought me here.
there's this place in downbelow that makes the best barbecued beef burgers.
not that i have the slightest delusion that this is beef but if it tastes great, you learn not to ask questions.
well, mr. garibaldi's feelings about heaven notwithstanding i think you've just described hell as well as anything i've ever heard.
you don't understand because you are trapped in a prison of your own flesh.
if these souls were valuable it's because of what they did or the way they saw the world.
what you describe is an existence without the possibility of any change.
now, we tried to interfere, but they got ahead of us.
when you jumped in front of the other, we were able to adjust the power in the nanoseconds between the time it left the wall and struck you.
if you have this much control over the outside why not just have bryson or someone else destroy the globe that keeps you prisoner?
it seems even death would have to be better than this.
i came to see how you were doing and to thank you.
no one has ever done for one of us what you have done for me.
all of our ships are made to attach themselves to any other ship and burn through.
when our order is united and determined there is no one that can stop us.
look at the sheer power they've been demonstrating from the start.
these aren't your ordinary souls that you're used to dealing with.
they evolve past that point and become beings of pure energy.
your people were drawn to ralga because you felt the imminent passing of their physical bodies.
and just as it happened, just as they became transcendent you took them.
you took them and you stuck them inside a piece of glass for 10,000 years.
we got a lot of soul hunter ships outside and inside, a group that will die to strike back.
so you blow up the station, you take out the soul hunters.
- but they suspect that this is part of an elaborate scheme on your part to prevent us from taking back the vessel of souls so you can keep it for yourselves.
forgive me, friends, but in my order i am considered quite young, only 4000 years old and as such, i am also considered quite naive.
listen, captain, before you open fire, let me try and talk to him.
they're able to do this because bryson is a conduit to the outside world.
you dedicated your life to preserving, to finding a means of immortality.
you can't let whatever's inside that thing kill a quarter million people on this station.
