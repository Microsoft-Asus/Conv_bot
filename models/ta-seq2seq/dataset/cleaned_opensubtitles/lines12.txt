"that's the evil part of you - with a smile, as you leave."
you are a murderer and i can only pray to god that you watch and you listen very carefully to this.
i'm the old lady whose head you stove in with a wardrobe in the middle of the night, remember?
i'm the boy whose face you stabbed off in panic when i found you robbing my house, remember?
the hope is we'll benefit from a number of european projects.

we used to come here with knives and slash them in the guts but we got bored after that, after about two weeks,
i just eat my cake now and wash it down with a cup of coff.

hey, aren't you supposed to be home watching some musical on pbs?
and shouldn't you be using your unemployment cheque to buy raising jack?
i am not going anywhere until you find hilda and let her decide.
there was one time when a guy who works for my dad--
i wish you would learn that it's never a good idea to turn yourself into a boy.
just be stuck with some car that travels on the ground?
surely one of these beasts is monster enough to get me that lightning cruiser.
there we were, in the middle of a raging inferno, barely hanging on.
fire and smoke were everywhere but we couldn't leave our post.
for a long time, i was walking along a path... and someone was following me, following me, he was.
finally, i turned around... and asked him why he was following me.
when you were born, it was very cold and clear weather.
they told me it meant that the baby... would be clever but heartless.

many people have a reason and reach a great age with it... and nothing happens.
but the main thing is that you please try... not to be capricious or to weevil me, mother!
the super did tell the both of us that it was a two-man job because someone needs to open the window while the other person holds.
yeah, that's why i don't think you need to open the window or remove the air conditioner.
you see, i had some problems i really want to talk about, and i was afraid that if i did other things, other things would come up, and i'd forget to talk about the things
i really wanted to talk about, that the other things would cancel it out.
no, don't come by without the day planner, that's my point.
dad, you know, in biblical times, a day was actually, like, over 3,000 years long.
finally, i got her to go to a baseball game with me.
you know, i like to have a hot dog at the baseball game, but she wouldn't leave me alone.
they're good, that's enough, except for that white ball... you know that thing?
you know when you bite into a hot dog, there's that white ball kinda staring at you?
and it depends on the sauce, kind of, for me, 'cause i don't like the heavy cat sauces.
i tell her i wouldn't eat my cat, and then i knew it was over.
if a cat is my pet, and i love her, and she's sucking up to me.
these cows don't want me to eat them, let them stop by with a gift.
i think women, they're smarter than men, really, is the gist...
i don't know if they're smarter, but they have a better organization, you know?
i guess, we didn't think we needed a plan, because our demands are pretty simple.
we only have two demands, as far as i can tell, which are sex, and don't bug us.
i need to find my day planner, i left it either in the...
what do you call it when you've ruled out certain areas of the apartment, you know, because i've already searched them?
i never got lucky with girls either when i was a kid.
i had a date with one girl, i waited two hours at the corner.
you're still haunted by the rejection you got as a young man from women.
that still is something that weighs heavily on you, and you feel like you...
i need it, and i need it in a hurry, so please...
what's so important about the book you need it right now, dad?
well, maybe it would be worth our while to retrace your steps.
right, actually, it won't be that tricky, dad, because i didn't take many steps today.
well, what i did was, because there was a space, on the left side, it was sagging.
so what i did was, i just put a book, it was, like, a leather-bound thing, and i put it right under the...
and now, people come to me with their girlfriend problems, and i'm just like,
"did she shoot you or just point the gun at you?"
if you want to freak your mom out now, you've got to get a lip or a nostril or eyebrow piercing.
have you seen that eyebrow, where it's like a shower curtain going across there
if there is a name, i don't want to know, because that is just...
that'd be like one step closer to getting it, you know?
this way, i can't get drunk and accidentally order it 'cause that would be the worst hangover ever.
you wake up the next... "jeethus, what the hell did we do last night?
an actual reproduction of the possible murder weapon that was never found.
here you go, little lady, the perfect souvenir for the occasion.
and i will not have that cheapened by this kind of behavior.
any more of this, the execution will take place behind locked doors!
it has nothing to do with the reason i ordered this.
if justice is to mean anything, the people must see it in action.
you and i have plenty of time to talk about it but meleager's not that lucky.
besides, i can't help wandering if you're more angry at him or yourself.
it was last winter, when gabrielle was at the athens academy.
on the road outside quellmire, i saw this kalaman attacking an unarmed man.
his horse must have headed instinctively back to the stable where meleager and the witness lady crossed paths with him.
i was at the stable earlier and i noticed some dried blood on a saddle, but i didn't think anything about it until you told your story.
well, if you don't, some innocent people are going to die.
i thought you were taking me to athens or someplace to testify.
ligurias that had the 100, all in the course of, uh, defending innocent lives-- naturally.
the point being that this is a very good man-- and a hero.
the people just wanted to tear him apart, but arbus insisted on a fair trial with lawful evidence.
from what i've hear, he's not someone who rushes to judgment.
if justice is to mean anything, the people must see it in action.
i missed the trial, but i have heard of meleager's reputation.
you and i have plenty of time to talk about it, but meleager's not that lucky.
besides, i can't help wandering if you're more angry at him or yourself.

if you don't leave me alone i'm going to start screaming.
as the hooker once said, "if they pay you for it, it's not love."
broad street, wall street, change here for... take a look at copper cathodes.
the thing was locked and i thought i could get out.
and i plan on writing a letter... to somebody that's going to... look, you know, you're not supposed to sleep here, right?
it started when i found out why jean never showed up.
her boyfriend and some of his buddies explained it to me.
why you think you're black when you know your moms is hindu?
you never get no girls, so stop drinking and fantasizing, b.
we've had this thing... going for a little bit of time now, you know?
and i think that maybe, you know, we should... have a conversation, you know?
the stolen painting by rembrandt van rijn... newly discovered only last week... continues to elude police.
a massive manhunt has been mounted... for the murderer of noted japanese art collector tumado agachi.
study of aileen, mid 19th century... permanent collection, cambridge institute of fine arts.
the flowered mine, privately owned... on permanent loan to the bergen national gallery.
ah, now... the prado, in my opinion... is maybe... the greatest art gallery in the world.
all the world goes to madrid to see the prado... and the only way you're gonna hang in that place... is if you're dead.
and another dutch painter who had died penniless... said you left him staggering.
vincent said you must have died several times to paint like that.
like an autobiography, they tell a wordless story... a story of genius and sorrow.
now, one of rembrandt's most famous sketches... is of an old man who appears to be blind.
it's been speculated he did it in preparation for a full oil portrait... and that portrait has never been found.
it may not even exist... but according to the inventory at his bankruptcy...
the man with the golden helmet... is just a cheap fake.
i'm sure you know that in 1930... there were over 800 supposed rembrandts.
and now we're down to 241... thanks to you and your friends... and dropping... so bully for you.
every school kid's favorite picture is now junk... 'cause some self-important windbag has said so.
and you'd rob fort knox for 100 million... and still bend over to pick up a quarter... which is dangerously dumb, and i hate working with the dumb.
the only reason you won't sign it is because until you do... you've committed no crime.
i wouldn't want to go on record... until i'd seen the results of chemical analysis and x-ray testing and...
we asked you here for your considered artistic opinion... based on your connoisseurship.
he just used that line to steal the painting away from the spaniards.
and the only reason he's got you all here... is to make him look honest.
now, i'm going to sell that painting... because as far as the world's concerned, it's a rembrandt.
and the only person who thinks that it's not is you.
rembrandt is priceless, donovan is worthless... that's not art... that's autographs.
it has been known for a gallery... to arrange to have a picture stolen from themselves.
there's evidence that donovan and van den broeck... may have known each other previously.
at least as far back as a month ago in paris.
professor van den broeck said she was unconvinced... of the painting's authenticity.
inspector, if it weren't absolutely genuine... then why would they steal it?
and it's going to take a lifetime to clear your name... 'cause i'll tell them that you were in it with me from the beginning.
i swear to god, i'll turn your precious little reputation into dog shit.
we will prove... that the defendant mr. harold donovan... attempted to participate... in the brokerage of a dutch master portrait...
that when he realized... he would be excluded from the transaction... he became enraged... that when he realized he'd be left with nothing... he stole the masterpiece... using violence... robbery.
i would like to admit this note into court... written to the defendant... and signed by the witness.
professor van den broeck, would you be so kind... as to read that note aloud... to the court?
professor, i submit that your evidence is worthless... and your credibility highly questionable.
is my learned friend cross-examining... or is he making a speech?
if you take a look at the x-rays, you'll be able to see that.
sir... have you any idea how many men step forward each year... to claim credit for hamlet... or beethoven's ninth symphony?
well, not enough to pay for it... but then, it's all a pile of shit anyway, isn't it?
and as for the public... well, you see, they're told what's art... by me.
when this yen-soaked tycoon... couldn't wait to throw his money away... it was because i said the painting was a steal... at 5 million.
so... what in the world were you thinking... when you took my rembrandt?
so van gogh sat in a room in a mental hospital... painting sunflowers.
you can cut off both your ears... but unless i say you're a genius... you're just another lunatic.
milord, we have just heard... from 5 scientists and other experts.
having the defendant now here in court paint... wouldn't be evidence of anything.
mr. donovan can support his claim to authorship of the disputed...
milord, even if he reproduced whistler's mother here in court... would that make him whistler?
it took him a whole month to paint it... under perfect conditions.
the best he's going to come up with now is a sketch.
i understand that you have been placed under arrest... by the police.
you will be taken from this building in their custody... and in my view, you should be held without bail... until your trial.
um, as our great good friends of many years... have seen us through some difficult times... we'd like to invite you all in a few weeks... to the opening of our exciting new gallery in tokyo!
um, of course... we seem to have run out of rembrandts... but there's still a lot of fabulous paintings to buy... so enjoy yourselves.
the stolen painting by rembrandt van rijn... newly discovered only last week... continues to elude police.
a massive manhunt has been mounted... for the murderer of noted \japanese art collector tumado agachi.
mr. donovan is said to have seized the painting... in an argument with mr. agachi...
who was then shot and killed... as mr. donovan escaped with the priceless work of art.
the flowered mine' privately owned... on permanent loan to the bergen national gallery.
boulevard of peasants' late 19th century... and' uh' the ice cream man.
ah' now... the prado' in my opinion... is maybe... the greatest art gallery in the world.
all the world goes to madrid to see the prado... and the only way you're gonna hang in that place... is if you're dead.
all right' what i'm trying to say is-- l don't know.
the point is that harry donovan should have gone to italy... and he should have looked at da vinci.
the greatest genius ever to put brush to canvas' they called you.
but by the age of reason' they considered you an outcast... your promise unfulfilled.
it's been speculated he did it in preparation for a full oil portrait... and that portrait has never been found.
it may not even ecist... but according to the inventory at his bankruptcy...
the man with the golden helmet... is just a cheap fake.
i'm sure you know that in 1930... there were over 800 supposed rembrandts.
and now we're down to 241... thanks to you and your friends... and dropping... so bully for you.
every school kid's favorite picture is now junk... 'cause some self-important windbag has said so.
so 350 years later... we pick up the trail of rembrandt's lost masterpiece.
now' the boat sailed from rotterdam to san sebastian' spain... so we're within a 40-mile radius... of where the trail might have gone cold.
rembrandt usually did 3 versions of the same painting... one on top of the other.
that'll show up on the c-rays... which is exactly what they ecpect to find... exactly what they're dying to find.
i mean' the signature alone is worth 5 million if the painting's any good.
and you'd rob fort knoc for 100 million... and still bend over to pick up a quarter... which is dangerously dumb' and i hate working with the dumb.
well' let's see what our london ecperts say first' shall we?
if it passes muster with them' you'll be paid in full.
(all talking at once) we asked you here for your considered artistic opinion... based on your connoisseurship.
we'll be pleased to provide you with all the data you desire.
he just used that line to steal the painting away from the spaniards.
and the only reason he's got you all here... is to make him look honest.
now' l'm going to sell that painting... bexause as far as the world's concerned' it's a rembrandt.
and the only person who thinks that it's not is you.
if justice ran its course... van gogh wouldn't have died broken in a nut house... while lrises sold for 50 million to some insurance goon.
oh' so van gogh gives you the right... to steal this picture and sell it.
rembrandt is priceless' donovan is worthless... that's not art... that's autographs.
it has been known for a gallery... to arrange to have a picture stolen from themselves.
there's evidence that donovan and van den broeck... may have known each other previously.
at least as far back as a month ago in paris.
don't you see' by calling the painting a fake... i'd have to sell it pennies in the pound... then they'd turn around and sell it at full price.
and failing that' donovan simply stole it and-- murdered tom in cold blood.
you've come to the right place for a phone... i'll tell you that.
we have here the original restored phone boc... used by lord mountbatten to call winston churchill... on the very night that field marshal montgomery... received his command.
and it's going to take a lifetime to clear your name... 'cause i'll tell them that you were in it with me from the beginning.
i swear to god' l'll turn your precious little reputation into dog shit.
do you think the garbageman ain't in it for the paycheck?
'cause he sure as hell ain't in it for the garbage.
i'll tell you what' i'd rather burn it' you son of a bitch!
if i get caught' i want you to mail this for me.
we will prove... that the defendant mr. harold donovan... attempted to participate... in the brokerage of a dutch master portrait--
that when he realized... he would be eccluded from the transaction... he bexame enraged... that when he realized he'd be left with nothing... he stole the masterpiece... using violence-- robbery.
professor' l submit that your evidence is worthless... and your credibility highly questionable.
is my learned friend cross-examining... or is he making a speech?
i painted it over and over in the same way that rembrandt would've.
if you take a look at the c-rays' you'll be able to see that.
sir... have you any idea how many men step forward each year... to claim credit for hamlet... or beethoven's ninth symphony?
do you know how many people are convinced... that they are the czar's long-lost nephew...
i do hope you know... how much i truly admire your work.
well' not enough to pay for it... but then' it's all a pile of shit anyway' isn't it?
so... what in the world were you thinking... when you took my rembrandt?
you could've had half a million... and a towel on the beach.
milord' we have just heard... from 5 scientists and other ecperts.
having the defendant now here in court paint... wouldn't be evidence of anything.
mr. donovan can support his claim to authorship of the disputed--
milord' even if he reproduced whistler's mother here in court... would that make him whistler?
now get up there... and try not to make too big a fool of yourself.
mr. lll' will you tell us' please' in your own words... what happened on the night in question?
alistair davies' i understand that you have been placed under arrest... by the police.
you will be taken from this building in their custody... and in my view' you should be held without bail... until your trial.
um' it gives me great joy... to welcome you all here on this wonderful evening.
um' as our great good friends of many years... have seen us through some difficult times... we'd like to invite you all in a few weeks... to the opening of our ecciting new gallery in tokyo!
i'm gonna close this deal the same way i always do.
a cup of coffee, a slice of pie and a handshake.
i can see you get your sense of humor from your daddy.
he gets his sense of humor from both his parents, thank you very much.
i thought you were a real texan, like that thatherton fellow from the coffee shop.
i'm only not wearing the hat because of my solemn vow...
look, peggy, being a salesman is a little like being an actor.
i'm just playing a role, you know... like that fella at the dinner theater you liked so much.
when i get home tonight, we'll sit down... and go over anything you might have taken out of context.
oh, i am so sorry mrs. holloway didn't feel well enough to join us.
'cause i was suppose to help bobby, and instead... we're going to jug store cowboys... as part of my work-required sales excursion.
that, as i said, keeps you in pretty dresses like that one.
soon, i'll have enough to stay home with my granddaughter and her baby.
i should be home, too... helping my boy with his sunday-school report.
when i talked to her, i got the feeling she's into some other guy.
see, that's actually what i wanted to talk to you about.
i'm having a late meal with her after an early one with casey.
the craziest thing is, i just ate a whole pizza myself.
when i talked to her, i got the feeling she's into some other guy.
see, that's actually what i wanted to talk to you about.
it bad enough that i'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend.
every time we're in the same room, there's weird energy between us.
you are the one who told me how important it is to spend time alone.
i can't just go out with that guy when i have plans with myself.

y'know, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems.
we broke down on the parkway, so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid.
and hey, listen could you please tell kathy that i'll be there as soon as i can.
see but, pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music.
y'know my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then i...
well, i thought that would be the best thing to do.
but hey, listen just so you know, you might have you're work cut out for you.
it bad enough that i'm in love with my roommate's girlfriend.
every time we're in the same room, there's weird energy between us.

and now, dear morris family, you will be given the chance of opening one... of two-oo-oo doors.
we can deluge you with a thousand channels or expand one single image to crystal clarity... ..and beyond.
we can shape your vision to anything our imagination can conceive.
for the next hour, we will control all that you see and hear.
you are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the deepest inner mind to the outer limits.
(narrator) events in our past seem to slip further away with time.
but what happens when they circle back and meet us head on in the present?
living as long as i have, i've seen the potential for greatness in a man.
daniel's a football star now, but he's gonna become something much more.
but first, listen to your father and i, both of you.
if you care about me, if you've ever cared about me, hear us out.
the fbi found jade in too many records as too many people.
but then when they compared pictures 50 years apart, they sent her to me.
i've helped men become kings, but i can never stay very long.
it doesn't take them much time to realise that i haven't aged.
come on, chakotay, there must be some talent you have that people would enjoy.
maybe i couid stand with an apple on my head and you could phaser it off.
if you're going to emit that tachyon burst, you'd better do it now.
in a couple of minutes, those ships'ii be right on top of us.
we were on our way to the second planet of a binary system...
to collect some nitrogenase compound, but we encountered a storm and we crashed.
and then we were attacked by the vidiians, but we managed to escape and get back here.
you and the commander were checked by the doctor who treated your injuries and you proceeded here to the bridge.
it would be wrong to subject you to such a prolonged and painful death.
the crew would also be adversely affected if that were to happen.
i'ii admit, i was surprised when i found they were true.
if you stayed with me after you died, you should be able to tell me what happened then.
you were so grief stricken, you fell into a terrible depression.
you spent months in bed sleeping away your days, rather than confronting your feelings.
i'm not sure what would have happened if your sister hadn't forced you into the real world again.
if you are an hallucination, a part of me, you'd know those things.
i began to have faith in myself and when she died, the first thing i thought was that i couldn't do this without her, that i needed her too badiy-- her strength and her compassion, but then i realized
that the gift that she gave me-- and gave a iot of us here-- was the knowledge that we are better and stronger than we think.
i know captain janeway wouldn't want us to be sitting around moping.
she'd want us to be cheering each other up, remembering the good times, iike the away mission when we found all those bushes of overripe fruit.
the only thing that keeps you is your refusal to leave.
you may be right in everything you've said to me, but i'm not ready to accept it.
the doctor just arrived on a shuttle with tuvok and began treating you.
as he was doing so, we detected an alien presence within your cerebral cortex.
i'm going back to see if i can get an energy signature from the burns.
chakotay, the homing signal-- we might be telling someone just where to find us.
send a subspace message that we won't be landing on the planet.
tell them that we'll be looking for evidence of temporal anomalies.
to collect some nitrogenase compound, but we encountered a storm and we crashed.
and then we were attacked by the vidiians, but we managed to escape and get back here.
it may be that the virus was transferred in that way.
but we've encountered vidiians like that before and had physical contact with them.
there is often concomitant stress to the thalamus in the early stages of the disease.
it is known to cause a kind of dementia that produces hallucinations.
maybe it was nothing, but i had the strongest feeling that the captain was there in the corridor with me.
it is possible that in your distress over the captain's death, you imagined that you were aware of her.
we all heard the stories and thought they were the product of vivid imaginations or self-induced hysteria.
i'll admit, i was surprised when i found they were true.
if you stayed with me after you died, you should be able to tell me what happened then.
you were so grief stricken, you fell into a terrible depression.

kathryn, remember-- several times after i died, you woke up thinking i was in the room with you.
we've been trying for three days without success, nor have lieutenant torres and ensign kim found any indication that the captain is alive.
there is a point at which we must accept the inevitability of her death.
my attempt to help kes detect the captain's presence has ended in failure.
i am forced to conclude that we have, in fact, lost kathryn janeway.
i began to have faith in myself and when she died, the first thing i thought was that i couldn't do this without her, that i needed her too badly-- her strength and her compassion, but then i realized

tell them that we'ii be looking for evidence of temporal anomalies.
to collect some nitrogenase compound, but we encountered a storm and we crashed.
and then we were attacked by the vidiians, but we managed to escape and get back here.
it may be that the virus was transferred in that way.
but we've encountered vidiians like that before and had physical contact with them.
there is often concomitant stress to the thalamus in the early stages of the disease.
it is known to cause a kind of dementia that produces hallucinations.
maybe it was nothing, but i had the strongest feeling that the captain was there in the corridor with me.
it is possible that in your distress over the captain's death, you imagined that you were aware of her.
we all heard the stories and thought they were the product of vivid imaginations or seif-induced hysteria.
i'ii admit, i was surprised when i found they were true.
if you stayed with me after you died, you should be able to tell me what happened then.
you were so grief stricken, you fell into a terrible depression.
you spent months in bed sleeping away your days, rather than confronting your feelings.
i'm not sure what would have happened if your sister hadn't forced you into the real world again.
if you are an hallucination, a part of me, you'd know those things.
kathryn, remember-- several times after i died, you woke up thinking i was in the room with you.
we've been trying for three days without success, nor have lieutenant torres and ensign kim found any indication that the captain is alive.
there is a point at which we must accept the inevitability of her death.
when i came to this ship, i resented the fact that captain janeway was responsible for our being stranded here in the delta quadrant.
i didn't think that she made the right decision and i certainly didn't want to serve under her command.
she saw a worthwhile person where i saw a lost and hostile misfit, and because she had faith in me,
i began to have faith in myself and when she died, the first thing i thought was that i couldn't do this without her, that i needed her too badiy-- her strength and her compassion, but then i realized
my hands and mouth were all purple and the captain... the captain came and sat down next to me, and her mouth was all stained, too.
she put her arm around my shoulder... and she said... she said...
ensign kim was right when he said the captain wouldn't want us to be sad.
neeiix has prepared some food and it wouid be nice if we could all get together and share the good times we had with captain janeway.
as time wears on, you begin to see how potent, how destructive loneliness is.
you'ii see the people you love going on with their lives, doing all the things you used to share with them, but you won't be a part of it anymore.
i have to know what's going to happen to them-- to see kes continue to grow and learn... to know if tom and b'eianna will ever stop sparring with each other and develop a real friendship.
you can only be an observer of their lives, never a participant.
and you don't strike me as any kind of good samaritan.
you're more like a vulture, preying on people at the moment of their death when they're most vulnerable.
he was like the spider who has to lure a fly into his web.
do you think it's possible that each of the near-death experiences we've heard about are the result of an alien inhabitation?
come on, chakotay, there must be some talent you have that people would enjoy.
maybe i couid stand with an apple on my head and you could phaser it off.
if you're going to emit that tachyon burst, you'd better do it now.
in a couple of minutes, those ships'ii be right on top of us.
we were on our way to the second planet of a binary system...
to collect some nitrogenase compound, but we encountered a storm and we crashed.
and then we were attacked by the vidiians, but we managed to escape and get back here.
you and the commander were checked by the doctor who treated your injuries and you proceeded here to the bridge.
it would be wrong to subject you to such a prolonged and painful death.
the crew would also be adversely affected if that were to happen.
i'ii admit, i was surprised when i found they were true.
if you stayed with me after you died, you should be able to tell me what happened then.
you were so grief stricken, you fell into a terrible depression.
you spent months in bed sleeping away your days, rather than confronting your feelings.
i'm not sure what would have happened if your sister hadn't forced you into the real world again.
if you are an hallucination, a part of me, you'd know those things.
i began to have faith in myself and when she died, the first thing i thought was that i couldn't do this without her, that i needed her too badiy-- her strength and her compassion, but then i realized
that the gift that she gave me-- and gave a iot of us here-- was the knowledge that we are better and stronger than we think.
i know captain janeway wouldn't want us to be sitting around moping.
she'd want us to be cheering each other up, remembering the good times, iike the away mission when we found all those bushes of overripe fruit.
the only thing that keeps you is your refusal to leave.
you may be right in everything you've said to me, but i'm not ready to accept it.
the doctor just arrived on a shuttle with tuvok and began treating you.
as he was doing so, we detected an alien presence within your cerebral cortex.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
makes it easier to pretend that i'm not stuck here with you.
look, we can spend all day trading insults, or you can drop the act.
okay, i'm no monk, but that doesn't make me a killer.
if that's true, you could've stood up for yourself in court.
i never even had a chance to say good-bye before a bandit slit her throat.
she died alone because of people like that monster in there.
i came back because a dying man deserves to have his last words heard.
and it looks like i'm the only one who will listen to yours.
i know how easy it is to hate at a time like this.
i also know that hate can make you do things you'll regret.
we live forever in the hearts of the people we leave behind.
your son may never forgive you, but he doesn't have to remember you as a coward.
if he was thrown from that jet ski, horatio, to have an impact injury this severe, he must have been hauling ass.
there's an awful lot of blood on that jet ski, alexx.
well, if he was involved in drugs, maybe his death wasn't an accident.
why don't we call the feds and see if they can shine a little light on his past?
look, this piece of slate you're talking about wasn't found in my yard.
if you weren't so busy being all chummy with bryan's mom... maybe you'd grill him about that instead of me, huh?
what you're telling me is the bag was refilled with speed without your knowledge?
what i'm saying is that druggies reuse bags all the time.
you'll probably find a hundred of them with my mitts on them.
look, i know you're trying to solve a murder here, lieutenant.
and right now, all of the evidence is pointing them directly to bryan woods.
now, maybe in the backs of their minds they're hoping it's not you, for my sake.
but once you get in front of that jury there won't be any hope.
those 12 people won't know me, they won't know you, and they definitely won't know that you're covering for someone you think is your friend.
baby, you don't give your word to drug pushers and murderers.
you save it for the people that care about you-- that you care about.
you busted him with ammo gr45s, but there was a lot more than that, wasn't there?
you pocketed the rest and he threatened to expose you if you didn't get them back.
no one in the park is gonna be able to see it from there.
well, why don't we just put a monitor in the skybox?
well, i couldn't finish watching it, so i want you to read this.
"i, cosmo kramer having just seen the movie the other side of darkness and not wanting to be in a coma like that lady in the movie hereby want jerry seinfeld to remove my life support feeding machine, lung blower, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera."
i never knew what i was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book anyway.
i don't know why i let you talk me into that corned beef at snitzers.
this is so nice of you to take us all out to dinner, george.
well, as much as i enjoy all the good-natured ribbing nothing really makes me happier than spending money on the people i care about.
i never knew what i was peddling with those stupid cartoons and that paper book anyway.
i don't know why i let you talk me into that corned beef at snitzers.
based on the information we've gathered from the contents of the purse,
i've put together a composite drawing of the woman you love.
i ought to replace it right now with a chinese cartoon where the robots turn into blingwads!
but i'm a lazy, lazy man, roger so i'll give you one more chance.
it is so simple, you egghead writers would've never thought of it.
what we need is a new character, one that today's kids can relate to.
the rest of you, start thinking up a name for this funky dog.
i don't know, something along the lines of, say, poochie only more proactive.
in episode 2f09 when itchy plays scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone he strikes the same rib twice in succession yet he produces two clearly different tones.
i mean, what are we to believe, that this is some sort of a...?
kindly make one out to me and three out to my friend of the same name.
i'm so glad you could join us for homer's big premiere.
all that matters is that the fans of the show liked it.
last night's itchy scratchy was, without a doubt the worst episode ever.
rest assured that i was on the internet within minutes registering disgust throughout the world.
i know it wasn't great, but what right do you have to complain?
it looks like the beginning of the end for the venerable itchy scratchy program.
for years, tv critics such as yours truly, kent brockman have waited impatiently for cracks to appear in the show's hilarious facade.
yesterday our prayers were finally answered when poochie the dog made his howlingly unfunny debut.
far be it from me to gloat at another's downfall but i have a feeling no children are gonna be crying when this puppy is put to sleep.
"one, poochie needs to be louder, angrier and have access to a time machine.
two, whenever poochie's not on screen all the other characters should be asking, 'where's poochie?
now, kids, we all know that sometimes when cartoon characters die they're back again the very next week.
that's why i'm presenting this sworn affidavit that poochie will never, ever, ever return.
in episode 2f09, when itchy plays scratchy's skeleton like a xylophone... he strikes the same rib twice in succession... yet he produces two clearly different tones.
i mean, what are we- to believe that this is some sort of a-
kindly make one out to me... and three out to my friend of the same name.
[marge] i'm so glad you couldjoin us for homer's big premiere.
it's just that poochie was a soulless by-product of committee thinking.
you can't be cool just by spouting a bunch of worn-out buzzwords.

you know, i've always thought of models as, i don't know, the enemy,
but it must be a really hard thing, schlepping to all these magazines, being put under such heavy scrutiny, always being judged, hoping someone will hire you.
i can put it in the back and use the front for some fashion stuff.
and after i did that, it just, like, everything fell into place.
i said i'd put out this damn magazine, and that's what i'm gonna do.
sure, you're gonna run off like a bunch of frightened little ants, but you know what that would make you?
bet you didn't know there were gonna be four of them.
i was gonna be dará, the ángel with expertise in explosives, nunchucks, and esp.
but it must be a really hard thing, schlepping to all these magazines, being put under such heavy scrutiny, always being judged, hoping someone will hire you.
i mean, there have been times when i didn't know if i could make the rent, so i think i know what you must be going through.

but it must be a really hard thing, schlepping to all these magazines, being put under such heavy scrutiny, always being judged, hoping someone will hire you.
i don't have to put the "ask miss pretty" column up front.
i can put it in the back and use the front for some fashion stuff.
maybe i didn't graduate from exterminator u, but when i see 100 cobras squirming up a stairwell,
i don't hike up my skirt and run away like a little sissy.
no, because t does them more pain if they know t.
if you tell to your partner t, clamour there then immediately but n therapeut.
perhaps tony, however, not the man is for he who you keep him.
you imply n set the scene of him score, and that is not how he is real.
every kruimeltje respect that i gave you ever... all term that i produced ever for you at your affairs and vluggertjes... is now gone.
you are this way flatlied refuse frightened for only that to be you now everything are lost.
- he came to me and we made love all night.
in the morning i woke up alone and i've never seen him since.
- i'm just an assistant, the boss will take you more seriously.
and he might also think that i'm involved with him if i push him like that.
said she loved me madly, but she had to leave me.
she had a rectal tumour and didn't want me to be there when she was dying.
- i'll put my head in your lap and i'll caress you all over your body.
then when i feel you opening to me, i'll lay you down...
during sexual excitement the amount of blood flowing to these areas rises significantly and at the same time its outflow is prevented.
as the penis grows erect, the foreskin is pulled back, so the head can be stimulated leading to orgasm...
like i had to fight for you - a matter of life or death...
you know how many people are looking for love, but we have it.
the biological clock that counts down my time as a free man...
- more like counting down the number of girls in your bed!
and she had to - like me - place the family above everything else.
every thought i think, every move i make belongs to you.
a month later she wrote to me that she loved me but we had to break up.
she had a rectal tumor and didn't want me to see her dying.
don't forget that every love is threatened by sin, and he who denies it, denies himself.
without virtue there can be no love, and without love there is no life.
he wrote that he loved me but that he had to break up with me.
he had a rectal tumor and didn't want me to see him dying, you see, teddy bear?
that is why it is right that you should receive this prize.
i must add that with diane clovier's help, though her help is not always conventional...
when you're 20, you cry for love, because you think it's the last.
when you're 40, you cry because it really is the last.
marguerite lepluche, learning of her divorce... or rather, when he broke the news, he broke the mad pact she had lovingly, obsessively constructed.
when love turns tragic, murder, suicide or survival are the only solutions.
i must add that with diane clovier's help, though her help is not always conventional...
but without diane we shouldn't be here tonight, it was she who...
when you're 20, you cry for love, because you think it's the last.
when you're 40, you cry because it really is the last.

why didn't you go to stockholm with clark to cover the ceremony?
well, you know, clark is so much closer to superman than i am.
i have spent millions of dollars rehabilitating my image building shelters for the homeless, feeding the poor, stuff like that.
so don't tell me that i can't buy this peace prize.
actually, ms. lane, i had no idea that i was gonna win the prize.
what kind of welcome home did you have in mind, exactly?
after weeks of stalled talks leaders of eastern european nations latislan and podansk arrived in metropolis today in an attempt to diffuse escalating tensions.
the break came when the united nations asked superman fresh from winning the international peace prize, to mediate the talks.
it is only because of you, the shining symbol of truth and justice that my people are even willing to discuss peace even though we have suffered far too long at the hands of our enemies.
you have suffered because of the brutality you perpetrated against my people, kasparov.
lois lane has had virtually every exclusive with superman since he flew in four years ago.
are you saying that superman's knocking red boots with a married woman?
because, i was thinking if he's not that maybe you could do a girlfriend a favor and introduce me.
course, i don't even know if he dates outside his own species.
now, the daily planet has yet to take an official position but i can't sit on my hands much longer.
the fellas upstairs are breathing down my neck to clean up this mess.
it's uncredited, which is suspicious considering all the notoriety it's gotten.
you'd think this photographer would be all over the tv circuit by now...
i guess it's just the price we pay for being in the public eye.
you know, every once in a while, somebody's gonna take a potshot at us.
it seems lois lane isn't the only woman superman has been seeing.
meet the twins who claim superman's cape has hung on their bed knob a time or two.
if it makes you feel any better, they're not too crazy about their hero either.
the ladies in the steno pool are using a picture of superman as a dart board.
so whoever faked the photos had to go through one of those labs, right?
- i'll have a list by the end of the day.
and you are not gonna get what you're digging for here, vulture-boy.
i'm not gonna give you some sound bite that you can twist and turn.
tomorrow at noon, i'll hold a press conference and all your questions will be answered.
then we can meet here afterward, and if you're satisfied, we can talk peace.
the man of steel will have gotten a non-stick teflon coating and i'll never be man of the year!
i've come up with a plan that will guarantee the peace talks fail and make superman responsible for it.
if i don't, war will break out and a lot of people are gonna die.
so i've decided that the only way to clear all this up...
what makes you think the world is gonna start trusting superman again when they find out that he's been lying to them all along about who he really is?
clark, there's a greater truth to protect here and that's the idea of who superman is.
it looks like they created a texture map from these photos.
they applied the texture to wire-framed models designate the area to be scanned.
when the clock strikes 12 in just a few short minutes we will finally know what the world wants to know:
does the man of steel have a naughty little secret, or doesn't he?
it's our moral compass, the only thing that stands between right and wrong.
everything that i am, everything that i do, is a reflection of that truth.
i have proof that shows it's all part of a very, very carefully orchestrated smear campaign.
if nothing's going on, then how come clark kent isn't here?
he used to come every day after school for extra help.
we spent the whole year reciting romeo and juliet to each other.
gay, straight, red, green, if you rob a bank, if you kill someone.
if you get drunk, climb a clock tower and take out the town.
because let us remember, a marriage is truly a blessed event.
it must be a union based on deepest love, total kinship, and absolute honesty.
i, i, i highlighted my hair because you said i needed shimmer!
i, i loved you and believed you and pretended not to notice the streisand thing.
i thought you could just change my life and show me the whole world and teach me about art and life and magic.
and i thought you could make me feel like a beautiful woman,
so what you're saying then is since mr. brackett's gay, that he's going to, like, send out some kind of voodoo vibes or, uh, gay microwaves and, uh, make everybody else gay?
well, in a, in a, in a crude manner of speaking.
i'd like to thank uh, a great director, an incredible cast, my agent and my new agent, but i'm just an actor playing someone.
this really belongs to all the gay soldiers and sailors and other guys and women who defend this country to keep us free, but can't date.
howard, we want you to know you're our son, and we'll always love you.
gay, straight, red, green, if you rob a bank, if you kill someone.
howard, i'd be less than honest if i didn't tell you that i've gotten some calls from...
from parents, uh, wondering if in fact you were a ho...
howard, everyone surprised me once i let them, once i trusted them.
you know, sometimes the worst thing you think can happen turns out to be the best thing.
i thought you were the most wonderful man who ever lived.
i thought you could just change my life and show me the whole world and teach me about art and life and magic.
for once, we're going to think about something besides our careers and our hair.
we're going to help mr. brackett, if i can find him.
oh, okay, so, all right, so, um, stay with me here, then.
so what you're saying then is since mr. brackett's gay, that he's going to, like, send out some kind of voodoo vibes or, uh, gay microwaves and, uh, make everybody else gay?

dearly, dearly beloved we are gathered here to join this wonderful couple in the state of holiest matrimony before the eyes of god.
before we begin the vows is there anyone present who knows of a reason why this couple should not be joined in holy wedlock?
i thought you were the most wonderful man who ever lived.
i thought you could just change my life and show me the whole world and teach me about art and life and magic.
just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart.

dearly, dearly beloved we are gathered here to join this wonderful couple in the state of holiest matrimony before the eyes of god.
before we begin the vows is there anyone present who knows of a reason why this couple should not be joined in holy wedlock?
i thought you were the most wonderful man who ever lived.
i thought you could just change my life and show me the whole world and teach me about art and life and magic.
there were all kinds of guys there that looked like they were going to get stronger from here on, after all!
i have to train more and more, or i'll be overtaken by those little guys in no time, you know?
i don't want to be down here in this boiler room

this massage chair is so amazing other massage chairs sit in it when they want to relax.
some people say the swedish ecstasy 5000 is almost as good as sex.
to get the golf clubs, we had to get that push-up bra.
to get the push-up bra, we had to give them the kayak and that apology for the detour through the fitting room.

dick, i didn't realize you and don were such good friends.
well, you know how it is-- the college professor and police officer, it's a scheduling nightmare, but when we do find the time,

well, you didn't have to tie me down and do me execution-style.

bottom line me, park, because i'm getting a little annoyed with your charlie chan shit.
i need a list of properties we're gonna offer, along with an overall strategy for rolling this out by launch meeting.
marketing will want final copy and art for radio, web, lifestyle, retail, p.o.p., print and direct mail outlets to we make sure we've got this thing surrounded.
and you might want to consider reaching out directly to the artists so they don't try to beat us up for money.
you might want to prepare a variance in mechanicals versus straight sales for finance, and breakout costs for digitizing our entire catalog.
there are some very interesting facts from the crime reconstruction report.
you see, it seems that the shooter and axel were only 8'-10' apart.
i'm asking you to protect me from the guys that have broken from tradition, guys who rob and kill their own.
i'm asking you to protect me from the fucking guy who takes our own little girls against their wills and pimps them out.
it would be like apple releasing their new iphone without telling anyone when they're releasing it.

also call al whitter in marketing, joe hammons in publishing, get them both together to meet with ben and i later today.
finet's dirty, and i can use the wife to leverage his statement... conspiracy, extortion, maybe a double homicide.
you're dipping in some real shit here, so before you step in it and track it all over the department, throwing accusations of major crime involving one of my lieutenants and his wife, you better show me some hard evidence.
you gotta bring the a.d.a. in on this, let her decide.
oh, i sure as shit ain't taking this upstairs until i see some long pretty legs on it.
this is ben's m.o... he meets you, falls in love with you, promises you the world, and there is nothing better than being the center of ben cendars's attention.
but then his a.d.d. kicks in and he's on to next month's flavor.
from what i can put together it happened to that crazy old doctor and now it's happening to you.
i wish i could help you but you're under contract with ben.
i'd like the both of you to really listen to one another before you react to your own thoughts and emotions.
don't finish each other's sentences, jump ahead of one another, but really focus on what the other person is saying.
i know my wife is being questioned as a suspect in my shooting.
i'm sure it's just standard police business but it's pretty unnerving.
i still need to find out who killed those two bangers.
i could have closed them, but that crazy son of a bitch almost jeopardized everything.
he knows something, and i'm gonna get it out of park.
so, everything i've heard... roughing up the e.m.t.'s father, threatening to kill him,
i need you out here where you can be my eyes and ears for everything.
i mean, she's my daughter and i love her, but her first order of business is to give me the bum rush out of here.
and like any good student of power-mongering, she's looking for my weakest link, and she thinks it's you.
so she would come to you and offer you a deal.
if there's anything i can do to help, just let me know.
you're my father, and i love you, as regan loved king lear.
you said so yourself... and i don't want to get caught up in accusations and emotion.
you want to put me in front of some stranger, two against one, and talk about how i mistreated you?
fine, but no one can know that we're seeing a shrink, okay?
well, i'm willing to go through behavioral sciences at the department.
my client is highly regarded in the korean community, and the line of people waiting to testify on his behalf will be a testament to that.
yeah, until they find out what he did to that little girl.
you have no idea what his people suffer to get here.
unlike my people, who came over in chains on a ship.
you know how you always want answers and you're always breaking my balls,
paco here has the smarts enough to keep his mouth shut.
my husband hates me so much that he either committed suicide or faked his death to get away from me.
and my father tells me his life is meaningless because i don't know how to be happy.
your hands got dirty the minute you took me into that girl's hospital room.
and your family's already in danger and so is ji sun.
i'm supposed to give you some magic answer, the phantom holy grail?
now these ladies, they used to be exotic stripper dancers, and they gyrated for free while excited men stuck dollars in their panties just to keep them dancing... anything to keep them dancing.
when radiohead released their new album on the net, 75% of the people who downloaded the songs paid for them.
that's because the people who listen to radiohead are guilty white liberals.
well, it appears you're not up to date with current events.
see, last time i checked the beatles were still broken up,
that's even more reason you shouldn't be talking on the phone.
i just found out we're having a boy and so i wanted to call him and tell him.
- just some aches in my neck, a little tingling in my extremities, a little jaw pain.
hurry and check his blood for bullshit, because it's reaching lethal proportions.
i've always dreamt of taking my boy to a baseball game, eating hot dogs.
let's only hope i live long enough to see that day.
i'm just saying that even a hint of fame can make a statue spread its legs.
and i want you to go in there and i want you to close this show.
look, i did a lot of fucked-up shit when i was younger and i had my fun.
you know, i took this job to get away from all the shit in the hood.
so... how about we get it on not as panic and justice, but as anthony and denise?
nah, you know, you remind me too much of my cousin.
and the only thing i kept on thinking about was you.
it took something this big to make me realize things, but i did realize them.
all right, i think i got a buddy who might be able to help.
i can't promise you anything yet, but i'll put in a call, okay?
let's talk about how we can get you back into your family.
when i get back from dinner and the movies with the girls
i don't know what kind of shit's between you and ben, but i really believe he's turning over a new leaf.
maybe i'm not as bad as you like to make me out to be.
but the economy the way it is, people don't even need a reason to say no anymore.
do you have any suggestions at all where i might look for work?
i wanted it so much... clean my record, get into med school.
i was willing to do anything in order to get my criminal record expunged.
your fucking girlfriend took out five credit cards in my name, all of which have been maxed out, and drained 20 gs from our savings account.
don't know how she did it, but she must have gotten my social security number.
and if he did contact me, you don't think i would report it?
i'm hoping not to put you in that position again, officer.
i spoke with assistant district attorney jutamonte about this just a little while ago.
she mentioned that you had given some additional information to a detective cooper with some sort of an i.a. case.
anything you say or do can and will be held against you in the court of law.
don't forget the best part. "if you can't afford a lawyer," dot dot dot.
it comes out of a stereo and floats away into space.
and now i'm floating away, anthony, and i've left nothing behind.
you use that on one of them and the rest will kill you.
they say you guatemalans either steal food on your way through or you stay and steal some every day.
you and i both know that the church has had its problems over the years.
a little self-release might have been a good thing for a few people.
she puts a line in the sand, you better not cross it.
i think my wife would be a great frontierswoman, you know?
and i'm sorry, but i did not fall in love with that girl.
it was just sex in a fuckin' car and that's it.
i should have been soliciting his guidance these past few years.
but i've been using the doctor and his pharmacy as a kind of band-aid.
you know, out of all the shit he saw in japan, the thing he was most excited about was their toilets.
let's move off bathrooms and toilets because that's where the doctor first started stalking me.
you'll just abandon him like you've abandoned everybody else in your life.
ben, you're going to kill anthony just like you killed me.
but you keep going and pounding and pounding on it until it breaks.
only then do you remember what the concrete was there for in the first place.
since then, mom passed and me and my brother never been close.
while i was in there i realized that i was killing myself just by how i was thinking.
and you think a major bathroom remodel's gonna make him love you?
you're better off knocking those houses down and building a golf course.
here in the antelope valley, just north of los angeles, a wildfire continues to rage out of control.
this blaze started last night around 11:00 near a subdivision of new homes just nearing completion.
look, the guy at immigration is working on it, right, but they gotta pull 60 pages of paperwork, check it for errors of fact.
and then they send it to the regional office, and if it's approved, they put it up to washington.
i had no idea what you firefighters are up against till last night.
can't say how grateful i am to you guys for all your efforts.
yeah, i wanted to talk to you about your sister-in-law inez.
i understand that her husband gustav is in a bit of a bind with immigration.
god, these people go to these lengths to fuck you up at work, you think they're gonna stop there, that they won't take this personal?
your wife, your home, and your family... think about that, maybe even before you unzip your prick next time.
so your business manager said we should get out of here before the coroner's men arrive.
we should take a pool cabana at the beverly hills hotel.
we gotta tell the concierge about our bereavement because we don't want to be mobbed by a bunch of whores.
i can't stand their distasteful sentimentality, especially at a time like this, when the grief is real.
yeah, well, pali gauril and florica all say you threatened gustav, stalked his wife, and pressed her for sexual favors.
yeah, well, i'll get inez to make a statement refuting that.
yeah, you want to put in fake reports about me, it's your right to do so, just as it's my right to make sure you're arrested for it.
and when the captain's bowling trophy goes missing, all bets are off.
there was once a filthy carp who swam around his tank until it got so dirty and dark it made him sick.
and since he couldn't see, he lay on his belly on the gravel and tried to die.
these good fish, they cleaned up the carp and his little tank, and for the first time, he saw the gravel on the bottom was pink and green, and there was a mermaid with bubbles coming out of her head,
and there was a thermometer that was close, and it gave the local weather.
"in the clearest stream, lives a fish found nowhere else... the golden trout.
and this marvelous fish will come and will live with you and teach you to live clean."
so, the golden trout came to stay with the carp, and taught the carp every day.
now, they call the carp a coarse fish, how fairly i can't really say, though for sure it's true that carp do live the best they can.
i mean, you sit before me without glory, no speckled bust pallas athena, but as a private road map to death.

why don't you ask his license and registration, fucking speeding through like that?
crowded streets, you're not even paying attention, you fucking cops do what the fuck you want, don't you?
an area that was set aside... was in venice, italy, for the jews, because their christian neighbors despised them, so they were forced to live apart.
but they educated their young, they took care of their poor, they maintained public safety.
i'm just trying to get to know you better, you know?
look, i know you're a big music producer and all, and i respect the work you've done, but all you need to know is i got my license, i keep my mouth shut and i got my mapquest here, all right?
i don't want it buried in the mass grave of hip hop.
so if you think that when you're stopped at a stop light, that you can slip in your mix tape for me to hear, uh-uh.
one day you'll come in here and you'll find me either missing or dead.
there are numbers under this phone over here and i want you to call them first before you call the press.
i understand the speech of the dumb and i hear the voiceless.
the smell has come to my sense of the hard-shelled tortoise boiling and bubbling with a lamb's flesh in a bronze pot:
forget that you just insulted me in front of one of my closest colleagues?
i am trying to mentor the kid, to show him how one conducts oneself in the world of business, how one negotiates fairly, how to capitalize on relationships that one has spent a lifetime materializing.
i have a friend in i.c.e. who will put them somewhere safe.
they want park for human trafficking and are willing to foot the bill.
i remember you wouldn't order your food until i figured out what i wanted first, just like a good dong seng, huh?

♪ you can wave a diamond, but they're not gonna let you inside ♪
♪ well, they ain't never gonna let you in there ♪
♪ yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah ♪
so you led park to believe you made good on the contract?
i figured if i got him on tape paying me off that will seal the case.
maybe, but you still should not have proceeded on your own.
captain, i don't want to piss in the well and i'm not sure of anything, but...
then i suggest you get the fuck out of my bathroom.
so that either makes you stupid or playing at being stupid, and you'd better hope it's the former because a stupid man can be forgiven.
i am an open-minded man, but it does not stop me from being your father.

west-coast guy if you ask him to use his car, it's like you asked him if it's okay to fuck his dog.
well, i think you're too lazy to clean your fucking toaster.
i wasn't trying to get back at finet by telling her.
i was willing to accept what had happened, but i couldn't let park stay out.
i mean, it's raw, but i tell you, this kid's got some talent.
you want me to put the entire c.m.g. machine behind your limo driver?
you think i should put on a happy face and forget my blues?

i see you again, motherfucker, i'm gonna shove my foot up your ass.
i've never had a problem with you all the years i've been patrolling that area.
it's a shame to lose it all because you won't give me the name of the shithead who took a shot at me.
he put a bullet in my back, man, while there were kids around.
i'll bet you even cut some of their hair or their fuckin' folks at least.
we're so lucky that those kids ain't in a casket now.
i mean, thank god we're not burying a child today, rodger.
yeah, and i'm gonna deal with him on my own terms.
i don't need the police in the middle making it worse.
that crazy motherfucker is your best chance at staying as far away from here as possible.
now we lucky we all didn't killed by that goddamn fool.
i'm sorry your car got damaged in the line of police duty.
if it was police duty, the city would pay me off and you'd have nothing to worry about.
i hear you, but i thought you said hip hop was dead.
it's a fucking zombie, and you can't kill a zombie, as much as i'd like to bury it next to chubby checker.
that way his nurse isodelle won't have to get him in and out of the tub.
you know, overhead rain showers are big now, so we should probably put one in.
it should be here, right where the dining room is, in the middle of everything.
it's crazy... you buy a house, spend a fortune decorating your living room and then when you have people over they always end up in the kitchen.
- hey, listen, renovation's harder on a marriage than an affair.
i guess i should just feel free to cheat on my husband.
now, it's abstract, and it won't make any sense, but to me, this is what you mean.
at the end of the day, you want your house to feel like this.
i just figured it'd probably help if i ran it a couple of times.
the transmission of ideas in verse form lends itself to a natural rhythm.
now it's pure body congestion, a bonanza of moveable stains, leaving their mark wherever they go.
it's too bad there's no disinfectant to wipe out the detritus on these streets and in our homes.
he's asking for your services, so you walk in there like a star.

when hunger and the imagination collide it can be a thing of beauty... scrambled eggs, over easy, poached, huevos rancheros.

just like at the end of endless marketing meetings we still have air supply.
sure, you can say they're like the beatles, but when you start with an egg you can clothe it any way you want, season it any way you want... at the end of it you still have a fucking egg!
meaning that this is not the time to be pissing away money.
so when you spend money it's investing, and when i do it's pissing?
you'll run around driving old people to dialysis and i'll catch bad guys.
no reason for us to stop doing what we love 'cause two pieces of shit got what they deserved.
i was walking around with a needle in my arm, if i remember correctly, and i genuinely do not remember.
but you and i both know that your love was unrequited.
i'm sorry, but i did not fall in love with that girl.
it was just sex in a fucking car and that's it.
it's been a week since amy got back and kicked you out.
we're in each other's faces 24 hours a day... partners, roommates... it's too much.
i'll make you a copy from my statement from our file, save you the trouble of having to type it up.
that's kind of you, but i already have a copy of your statement.
i've read it so many times i could probably recite it from memory.
and i've read most of your cases from the past year too.
there are guys with 4.0 gpas getting rejected, and they don't have an aggravated assault conviction on their application.
i got word from the district attorney's office that they are going to oppose any move to expunge.
the police department believe that you're still involved with gang activity.
emt work full time, classes at night, community service any free minute i get... all documented.
sam phillips came by one time and he said sun records was like a mansion in comparison.
a part of me wishes i was back in that office.
for the purposes of this conversation, let me give you the highlights.
given your position, the trajectory of the bullet and the size of the wound, the boys determined that the shooter was between eight and 10 feet from you.
maybe not, but i do know that you are a homicide detective investigating the murder of a korean shop owner who was paying for protection from mr. park.
and i do know that a couple of days later you find two gangbangers very much dead.
everyone in koreatown knows their fate was their own doing and the message was very clear.
you don't fuck with anyone under mr. chun soo park's umbrella.
but you've had a fairy tale of a childhood, not like this poor kid here.
he's probably never seen 12 years of private school in another country, or, when the holidays hit, winter camp.
well, that's very funny, since you no longer hold a majority stake in cmg.
actually, i just purchased 51% of the shares of the common stock.
now this is the same david fingerling who controls the class b stock and the board of directors.
and that's the same david fingerling that i just happen to control now.
i'm not having my name attached as ceo when this place goes down because of you.
hey, i'm just here to make all the creative decisions, you know, and hire and fire people.
look, i don't know what kind of shit's between you and ben, but i really believe he's turning over a new leaf.
he just lost a friend and he made a commitment to stay clean.
i don't know what you're trying to say here, but these pictures mean nothing.
he could have been talking to these men about a case.
so if he raises his voice even a little too loudly,
i might consider that a disturbance, and that would be the end of our working relationship.
you see, the beauty of the art of lap dancing is that happens on a lap, right?

becker's never gonna be the best, and you won't settle for anything less.
with your gas tank and your guts, you could own the three-mile... make it your goddamn plaything.
but what he didn't realize was that... his lying... it hurt a hundred times worse.
you don't have to sneak around on me anymore, mr. big shot.
less than a year later, when he found out that i was...
i was gonna get married in portland... he called my mother and said that i couldn't get married... because he was still planning on marrying me someday.
i met a runner who had to hock his trophies to pay for his plane ticket.
you'd think they'd at least put guys up once they got here.
gotta save back some of those millions you got in the treasury... so you can send over 100 officials to munich in style.
luckily for you, your opinions on that... were overlooked by the selection committee this year.
pre, the experts say you're just a 21-year-old, inexperienced kid... who's never faced the top european runners.
hey, pre, how do you expect to beat the best in the world on their turf?
but when i make my move with a mile to go... it's gonna be "whoosh"!
and those guy's will feel like they hit a stone wall.
bedford'll go out fast, and you'll stay right on his butt.
by the time you get ready to take over, viren's legs will be crap.
the guerillas are demanding the release... of 250 arabs held prisoner in israel... and have set noon as the deadline for their release.
they had set a deadline of noon... saying that they were going to kill all of their hostages at that time.
a crowd estimated at 75,000 to 80,000 people... has gathered, awaiting the outcome of this.
here are the men with what appear to be, i suppose, submachine guns.
i've just been told that the german police... thought they had the arabs isolated... opened fire on them, whereupon, reportedly... the arabs threw a hand grenade into the helicopter...
- ohhh. - blowing up the helicopter and killing all the hostages.
but what will happen to the games of the 20th olympiad?
none of us know what will happen to the course of world history.
now, maybe viren's a sensitive humanitarian back in finland... but right now i'll bet there's a little voice in his head, saying...
"hey, i just got an extra day's rest for the 5,000. "
one day away from the biggest race in your life... what's going through your mind?
i just want to run my race and get it over with.
make sure your numbers are clearly visible on front of jersey and right hip of shorts.

this unquestionably, i would say, erich... is the quality field of the olympics.
there are, perhaps, seven, eight, nine or ten men in this field... that could easily take the gold medal.
prefontaine told me the other night, or about a week ago...
"what i'm gonna try to do is work it out so it'll be a pure guts race at the end... and if it is, i'm the only one who can win. "
i think he will break the world's record at 5,000 meters... but i think he will have to do it in montreal.
because today, steve prefontaine, 21 years old... is running up against the very big boys.
that man is one of the world's greatest runners in a long time.
at the age of 23, lasse viren, the policeman from finland, has won it.
i thought, if he hadn't have done all that... then we would've just stayed in coos bay and lived happily ever after.
but then i watched your olympic race on tv... and i realized... it's really what you love.
why don't you guys go buy somebody else for a change?
are you anxious to get back to europe this summer and get another crack at viren?
the only way i'm gonna get near viren is if he takes his summer vacation here.
personally, i'd like to give viren a 5,000-meter tour of hayward field.
i just turned down a lot of money to chase the gold in montreal... and, uh, and all i want... all we want... is a fighting chance to fulfill our dreams.
this meet is just one small attempt by us... the athletes, to take control of our own destinies.

you don't have to sneak around on me anymore, mr. big shot.
that little kid would have remembered the day steve prefontaine let him win.
oh, you can't let a losing mentality creep in here... ever.
i met a runner last night who had to hawk his trophies just to pay for his plane ticket.
you'd think they'd at least put guys up once they got here.
but when i make my move with a mile to go, it's gonna be "whoosh"!
and those guy's will feel like they hit a stone wall.
bedford'll go out fast and you'll stay right on his butt.
by the time you get ready to take over, viren's legs will be crap.
it's 23 minutes past seven in the evening, and inside that little block are ten israelis;
one of them believed dead, the other nine said to be standing in a circle, hands tied behind their back and lashed to each other... come on, pre.
but what will happen to the games of the 20th olympiad?
none of us know what will happen to the course of world history.
now, maybe viren's a sensitive humanitarian back in finland, but right now i'll bet there's a little voice in his head, saying,
"hey, i just got an extra day's rest for the 5,000."
things continue to go downhill for the united states in munich.
all competitors for the 5,000 meter race, your event is next.
make sure your numbers are visible on the front of jersey and right hip of shorts.
make sure your numbers are clearly visible on front of jersey and right hip of shorts.
officials will check your number at the entrance to the stadium.
this unquestionable, i would say, erich, is the quality field of the olympics.
prefontaine told me the other night, or about a week ago,
"what i'm gonna try to do is work it out so it'll be a pure guts race at the end.
that man is one of the world's greatest runners in a long time.
at the age of 23, lasse viren, the policeman from finland, has won it.
i thought, if he hadn't have done all that, then we would've just stayed in coos bay and lived happily ever after.
but then i watched your olympic race on tv, and i realized...
a representative of the new professional track league has recently approached me."
i'm prepared to offer you more than i paid keno, ryun, seagren and lee evans combined.
i want to turn pro not for the money, but so i'll never have to face viren again.
didn't you say once that when a guy gives you his best shot...
are you anxious to get back to europe this summer and get another crack at viren?
the only way i'm gonna get near viren is if he takes his summer vacation here.
i just turned down a lot of money to chase the gold in montreal, and, uh, and all i want... all we want... is a fighting chance to fulfill our dreams.
this meet is just one small attempt by us, the athletes, to take control of our own destinies.
curtis cunningham will have a field day with this in the press.
the son of a bitch will rub my nose in it.
i looked at him at that party that night, and i thought, he's gonna make a great husband, father.
the best time in my life was my time with him.
[ man ] pre turned distance running into a blood sport.
you want to know what he meant to folks around here ?
[ man ] we raised steve the way most folks in coos bay raised their kids.
we just tried to give him the kind of life that we never had growing up.
[ tv announcer ] here is jim ryun, beginning to move up now,
this is the race he's been preparing for since he was a high school sophomore.
the only way i'm getting to munich is if i buy a plane ticket.
[ crowd ] hey, hey, u.s.a., how many kids did you kill today ?
becker's never gonna be the best, and you won't settle for anything less.
with your gas tank and your guts, you could own the three-mile,
as far as he was concerned, it was like no one else on the team existed.
[ announcer ] in the discus circle, oregon sophomore mac wilkins.
but did it stop him from running three victory laps ?
or hogging the headlines in the papers the next day ?
i met a runner last night who had to hawk his trophies just to pay for his plane ticket.
you'd think they'd at least put guys up once they got here.
gotta save back some of those millions you got in the treasury,
so you can send over 100 officials to munich in style.
bythetimeyou get ready to take over, viren's legs will be crap.
the only kick he'll have left is the one you give him in the ass on your way by.
how many jewish athletes do we have on the team ?
[ newscaster ] this is happening now, if you can possibly believe that.
but what will happen to the games of the 20th olympiad ?
none of us know what will happen to the course of world history.
make sure your numbers are clearly visible on front of jersey and right hip of shorts.
officials will check your number at the entrance to the stadium.
"what i'm gonna try to do is work it out so it'll be a pure guts race at the end.
and if it is, i'm the only one who can win."
[ jim mckay ] this is when viren makes his long drive.
[ erich segal ] this could be the break from the other group.
[ jim mckay ] that man is one of the world's greatest runners in a long time.
at the age of 23, lasse viren, the policeman from finland, has won it.
a representative of the new professional track league has recently approached me."
i'm prepared to offer you more than i paid keno, ryun,
if i don't run their bullshit tv money meets in russia, cunningham says...
they're gonna suspend me from any international competition for a whole goddamn year.
why don't you guys go buy somebody else for a change ?
are you anxious to get back to europe this summer and get another crack at viren ?
the only way i'm gonna get near viren is if he takes his summer vacation here.
personally, i'd like to give viren a 5,000-meter tour of hayward field.
curtis cunningham will have a field day with this in the press.
the son of a bitch will rub my nose in it.
the rod up that mars butt must have a rod up its butt.
superintendent chalmers, can i offer you a cup of coffee-flavored bevarine?
but first, before skinner shows up, i have a secret announcement.
in honor of seymour's 20th year as principal... we've decided to hold a surprise tribute friday night.
"and he survived to make it back to springfield... where he became the fine educator we salute tonight."
when i grow up, i wanna be a principal or a caterpillar.
what a wonderful night... to share with the people and the town that i love.
i have never been happier or prouder to be seymour skinner.
anyhow, the u.n. shut the factory down last week... and the embassy shipped me home, and here i am.
so what's your story, seymour, if that is your real name?
the way i was headed, it was just a matter of time...
- [siren wailing] before i wound up in front of a judge.
jail, the army, or apologizing to the judge and the old lady.
of course, if i'd known there was a war going on, i probably would've apologized.
some people might call that a pretty corny dream, uh, sergeant.
well, there's nothing corny about fresh-faced youngsters skipping to school... scraping knees and spelling bees... and pies cooling softly on the windowsill. [chuckles]
i came to think ofhim as the big brother i never had.
he made me believe i might have a future after all.
[skinner narrating] as strange as it sounds... deep down, i think she knew i wasrt her son... but the lie made us both happier than the truth ever could have.
you can have some lima beans as soon as you've cleaned your room.
well, that's very concise... but it's an insult to everything i suffered for.
now, take a seat, junior, and listen to someone... who gave their youth in service of their country.
- and i further decree... that everything will be just like it was... before all this happened.
and no one will ever mention it again... under penalty of torture.
i've never been happier or prouder to be seymour skinner.... but these last few days as that hotheaded rogue armin tamzarian... have taught me a thing or two.
you know, maybe i've been a little too uptight in the past.

i will go back to my father we need to go back..
do you think that it is not up to you to decide?
but that kiss has melted the snow so i hope that you see... the same rainbow as me.
do not want me if you like, but i realized that i love you.
i will go back to my father we need to go back..

do not want me if you like, but i realized that i love you.
we just need to postpone for a month, then we'll have the perfect presentation.
we can't afford a postponement, so i'd like to introduce you to someone.
i'm believe that with her education, mrs. rieger, can handle more responsibilities than any normal assistant.
i'll need to talk to her personally about being my assistant.
i can understand that she's blinded by routine after all this time.
but, i can't watch as she screws up our most important project.
then we should continue our chat with mr. grosser when i get back.
when you recruited me you told me that i'd be mrs. nordberg's coworker.
i was inexperienced, but very proud to be in an executive position.
the company was already headed for bankruptcy, but i didn't know that.
what should i think when i hear nothing, except a short message about staying longer?
have often have you extended your trips by days or a week?
first prize is 1,000 bucks, and your picture goes on the cover of chiller magazine.
chiller magazine-- and what kind of pictures are they looking for, as if i have to ask.
nothing's gonna happen my aunt and uncle are going out on another shoot tonight.
i'll wait until they're gone, meet up with beavis and butt-head, take a couple pictures, and be back before any werewolves even know i'm there.
the doc gave me a lecture but he said that my signature would be fine just this once.
he said that last time too, but i'm taking a guy with me just in case.
my dad thinks he understands young people, but he's a clod.
he says that those old guys can get out of control once they snap, so i should be careful.
i got 50,000 yen for two girls from an ikebukuro agency.
then i went to shinjuku, and found a girl who was okay.
i became a talent scout to meet you, i realize that now.
i've been waiting for 20 years for you to come along, i'm serious.
just today someone called "miss!" and i turned around and this guy said "how old are you?"
"seventeen" i said, and he said "oh, sorry to bother you" and just walked away!
guys who adult women won't touch, so they go after kids!
when they were kids, all they did was study or jerk off!
i'm looking for someone to spend time with me twice a month.
hello, i'm looking for a girl, i'll pay 100,000 yen just to go out for dinner.
how much time a soldier had with a woman was fixed for officers, nco's and other ranks.
we had to grade the women so different prices could be set.
250 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 work.
so now i don't buy things like clothes or carpets without wondering if children are being victimized.

the columbia l know... is the birthplace for father 'garcia' and 'kamilo'
there was a 'street keeper' in columbia lf there was a drug related problem they find out the dealers shoot them in the head 7 times

so come on down to south park and meet some friends of mine
to show that we're not just some pissant, white-bread mountain town!
better yet, it's a chance for you to get some publicity.
have you forgotten about all the pain and suffering that kathie lee gifford caused you?
mr hat, that was a long time ago, and i was only a child.
we don't believe for a minute that you won that contest fairly, fat boy!
hey, stop defending your little girlfriend for writing about some stupid fish.
seriously, just face it, i wrote a better paper than you.
it just so happens that i have your paper and i know why you won!
just two hummingbirds moaning and groaning and letting their bodies caress and touch each other in ecstasy.
oh, kathie lee how i'd love to lay you down and lick every inch of your body with my tongue
is there somewhere in town where i can get a good clear shot or view of kathie lee?
you know, i think the book depository would be a good bet.
you're lucky you missed kathie lee gifford and that nobody got hurt.
we hope you can come back to school real soon, mr garrison.
how do you create a show like south park and remain pure and wholesome?
everyone thinks that to do south park, we must be wild rock stars but we're wholesome middle american guys.
well, you'll be minding your business and they'll come marching in and crawl up your leg and bite the inside of your ass.
and you'll be all like, "hey, get out of my ass, you stupid rainbows!"
the pioneers met with the indians and negotiated for their fertile lands.
we cannot have our children beating each other in front of kathie lee!
mr. hat, old kathie lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow.
she beat us in the talent show all those years ago.
like the song of the hummingbird as it gets ready to find that female hummingbird and make sweet love to it all night long.

children, remember the save our fragile planet essay contest that you worked so hard on last month?
one of our very own south park students has won the national prize.
have you forgotten the pain and suffering kathie lee caused you?
mr. hat, that was a long time ago, and i was only a child.
when i wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them i lived alone in the woods on the shore of..."
mr. hat, old kathie lee really will be surprised when she gets here tomorrow.
it is with great pride and honor that i'd like to welcome mrs. kathie lee gifford to south park!
and now our very own south park elementary chef will sing a special song in honor of mrs. lee gifford!
we grew up in colorado, where black bear hunting is illegal.
a few years ago, a man shot a bear and her cubs out of a tree.
he lives alone on this mountain and weaves baskets and other crafts.
they say that on quiet nights, you can hear him weaving his baskets.
as we near the top of the mountain the chances of our encountering some lava becomes great.
i have special-ordered this training film to assist us in volcano safety.
now these humble people can rejoice and celebrate their victory over nature.
i'm getting word that the school's chef wants to sing a song about this struggle of humanity.
this episode is called "weight gain 4000." it's our favorite episode.
kathie lee gifford comes to south park and eric cartman beefs himself up for the big day.
everyone thinks that to do south park, we must be wild rock stars but we're wholesome middle american guys.
we enjoy soda pop, baseball and beating up old people as much as anybody.

in three years' time, a pair of incredibly terrifying, murderous machines will appear.
the warriors each resolve to train themselves anew on the word of the young man who came from the future.
boy, that vegeta is one guy who sure likes to do crazy things.
not only is he crazy to be training under 300g of gravity, but he keeps ordering new gadgets to train with, and then breaks them right away.
but vegeta-chan has this well-moderated, stoic sense about him that i can't pass up.
not to mention that wide forehead of his is so individualistic and cute!
as soon as we saiyans are born, our abilities as warriors are investigated.
the ones with the lower readings are sent off to planets where they will not face great opponents.
three years remain until the fearsome artificial humans who would plunge the earth into the depths of terror are to appear.
what kind of battle awaits goku and the others in the future?

do you know how a rich man's house can be recognized?
when he throws a party and there's a bee-line of cars outside.
and the gate of our bungalow should be of mere bars.
so that one who can't come in, can see it from outside.
'when he throws a party and there's a bee-line of cars outside'.

this is the lady whose pictures are pasted in sir's room.

he didn't give her your letter of success but burnt it.
forced her to marry by showing her your letter of failure.
i also have a right to lead life the way i want.
but because of you too my life has become a hell!
we'll drop you at a cinema to see one of the space movies you like.
when it's over, buy yourself a sandwich and wait for us.
i know it isn't your day, but i can't have him today.
i've changed hairdresser's and it's going fine, but i've got loads of things to do and he makes it all harder.
i try to hide it, but every day i'm more afraid of what lies ahead.
the idea of taking in one of the war orphans from bosnia was my niece's.
we thought that while i had him in the house no one would dare evict me, and we could look for a solution.
but it all went wrong, and now i've got even more worries.
i studied this case with evidence and documents supplied by my client, and it seemed clear.
your relative, however, wouldn't speak to me, and never appeared at the hearing.
she managed to rear her brothers and give them all a trade.
she worked day and night for years until the men got married and gradually left home.
she pushed him to do it, and then followed his steps from a distance through the long letters they exchanged regularly.
some men, like colo, the carpenter, came back over the years.
after some time, the man came back, and set up his business near here, in the capital.
a few years later, he was widowed, and came back into my aunt's life.
things were explained, and from then on they couldn't bear to be separated, even for a few hours.
that was when he learned about the debts, and the mortgage on the old house.
i want you to take the initiative, but i always race ahead, as if i were in a hurry.
between the jokes, i try to work out what you're thinking.
you mean none of you got a look at those men's faces?
no one remembers if they were blonde, dark, bald, tall, small?
either they share it out between them, or one guy takes control.
they contact other mafias to get someone to shift the stuff and to organize things so they can launder the money.
what's to stop us taking the money and killing him once we get the stuff?
he'll have thought of something, a plan to get away with the money and cheat us.
you know that this house is mine, it's always been mine.
and if i was ever about to lose it, your father made sure it didn't happen.
colo says that it'll soon be fixed and then i can move back in.
after the fright, your son disappeared, and i think there'll be no further contact between us.
if anything happens to me, he's got clementina, valerio and colo.
colo told me the house is mine until i go to join you.
the weather is still the same as ever and life, as you used to say, is a great complication which each person resolves in his own way.
mine is to let it go by, hoping it behaves well, and doesn't sweep away too quickly the little strength i have left.

but the three of us do nothing but defense work for car manufacturers.
in fact, over the last few years, while you've been doing other things, letting this particular file collect dust, we've been handling only automobile product liability cases, specializing in fact, in the sport trucks that catch fire
by law, we are ruired to start certain procedures which involve you being questioned.
we are concerned that your responses, rather than making things better, might...
now would these be the atlantic salmon raised in pens in the pacific ocean, the ones who periodically escape?
well, i can assure you, the ones we're serving didn't escape.
six years ago, denny, you threw me a tiny little case to cut my teeth on.
since then, i have moved on to much bigger and more lucrative matters.
he broke into a song from "the music man" over a fish.
while you're here, there are six associates in the conference room helping denise prep for her trial.
and if ever during the course of this trial we come across as trying to trivialize the plaintiff's pain, well, let me apologize for that right now.
their suffering is a given, and we all wish we could bring kevin parkinson back, but lawsuits unfortunately do not do that.
and the truth is, i can tolerate most of his nonsense.
but whereas five years ago, it was flirtatious, now it's lascivious.
alan shore sexually objectifies every woman he meets, and i mean every woman.
at least with him, you could say he's an equal-opportunity offender.
let me begin by saying that a terrible human tragedy has occurred here, and of course nothing that happens in this courtroom will bring elena pitino back.
lawsuits, you see, are ultimately about money, putting a dollar figure on suffering.
admittedly, there is some question as to how much elena even suffered in the fire.
also admittedly, elena was in the final stages of ovarian cancer.
she never got that last opportunity to sit with her grandchildren.
jose was never able to hold his wife of 37 years in his arms.
this is a very popular sport truck made by a major manufacturer of sport trucks, and they're catching fire.
the defendant has recently recalled almost a million of their vehicles because of this malfunction.
and i did grow up to be her, or so i thought.
i haven't been feeling very secure lately, denny, either in mind or body.
knew i had a mole on my back, even though i was wearin' a coat.
yeah, but you know, maybe it was easier to believe back then.
oh, i keep waking up... with this, like, warm, peaceful feeling,
and then i realize who i am and where i am and it all runs away.
every time i leave there and i come back, i get the feeling... that i'm comin' back to somethin' that i haven't discovered anywhere else.
it's, uh, it's kind of hard to explain in words, really.
- well, most people who go there... would probably just see the mini-malls, the potholes in the streets and a lot of lawns that need watering', but the really cool stuff's hidin' out.
i mean, you really have to know where to look for it.
well, let's just say that there really wasn't any reason for me to go.
i guess you're really worried about your business, being out of the country and all.
well, i like to keep up with the way the world runs.
my work is kind of about money and greed and ambition and success.
i seem to be gaining a whole new perspective on the rococo.
did, uh, did we, uh, just blow right past the flirting portion of the evening?
would you just gobble it down right there and then... or would you maybe wait a little bit, you know?
find a perfect place, light a candle, put on some music...
but before they could be married, she became ill, and she died... and all he was left with was this window.
he must have spent every waking hour for years... carving it for her.
the men especially... we dream about women, or, to be more specific, we dream about... our true love.
dad dreamt about mom... right after he wrecked his motorcycle somewhere down on southwest military.
it was the same thing with granddaddy and with his father too.
i mean, not the part about wrecking things and smacking your head up, but the vision.
she think's she's hard-boiled, but she has a real soft center.
folks, ida has a little number she's gonna do with the band, something she's arranged.
well, just ask any tourist who's ever been to san antonio...
they all say, "that guy with the puppets on alamo plaza, he is the best i've ever seen. "
oh, it does cause quite a fuss, that combination... smart and beautiful... but it's mostly in your own gut.
see, the problem is... you stop believing... that he could be out there waiting for you.
well, believing doesn't make it true, and believing in me doesn't make me worth believing in.
how can you be that dead inside that you can't see it... and you can't feel it?
and i said, "why wouldn't you give me his name, you moron?"
well, i don't know who this fletcher guy is, but, um, ...at least, you know, from what you said, he... seemed nice.
there are two things i always wanted to believe in... but didn't dare.
one is that there is one man, somewhere, who was made just for me.
that is not the way it works... in any love film i've ever seen.
i mean, the clouds part, the birds are singin', the toes are curling' up on these people.
each passing year has seen our estimate of the probability of life in space increase along with our capabilities of detecting it.
scientists feel that contact with other civilisations is no longer beyond our dreams but is a natural event in the history of mankind that will perhaps occur within the lifetime of many of us.
as i am a medical doctor with a background in hard science my job was to provide an analytical perspective on the work of special agent fox mulder whose investigations into the paranormal were fuelled by a personal belief that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12.
i come here today, four years later to report on the illegitimacy of agent mulder's work.
it is my scientific opinion that he became, over the course of these years a victim.
a victim of his own false hopes and of his belief in the biggest of lies.
in his intense desire to believe agent mulder was duped by this man.
he was fooled by an act of scientific sleight of hand calculated to perpetuate false truths.
but at a time of personal crisis, a threat to your health turning back to your faith is important and essential.
father mccue i appreciate my mother's concern, and yours but i'm being treated for my cancer, and i'm taking every precaution.
- the area where he was found is in the moraine of a glacier which has since receded.
200 years ago, the area where he was frozen was within the tree line.
we can do a good enough examination of the body here, to remove any doubt.
we won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating.
that's a heavily trafficked stairwell so we went back to the bio lab, where we found an anomalous set of latents.
we found a partial matching in the stairwell, four centimetres from one of yours.
there are some small eruptions on the surface of the skin mostly likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice.
otherwise there appears to be no scarring and no identifying marks.
the tissue underneath seems to be semigelatinous with a fine network of veins running throughout.
examination of the chest confirms the presence of what appears to be a cardiopulmonary system.
we'd be wise to run a gas chromatograph, and that carbon dating.
but, if this isn't alien, i don't know what it is.
i had reached agent mulder in a warehouse, just outside of washington in sethsburg.
they had managed the frozen corpse by helicopter down the side of the mountain and across the canadian border in a refrigerated truck.
after conducting a limited physical examination agent mulder was ready to believe that the body was that of an extraterrestrial biological entity.
that he had finally found the proof which had eluded him which would confirm not only the existence of alien life but of his sister samantha's abduction.
frozen into place over the course of a year using materials that would bear out its age poured through a small channel drilled in the rock above.
they would've known the body would be carbon-dated, that it would be proved a fake.
what the hell did that guy say to you that you believe his story?
he said that the men behind this hoax behind these lies gave me this disease to make you believe.
what we generally mean is intelligent life something resembling our noble selves.
it is highly probable that there are such intelligent forms of life in other galaxies in the universe.
and it is even more probable that many of these forms are vastly more intelligent than we.
i think there's no question but that we live in an inhabited universe that has life all over it.
by finding out what the other planets are like by finding out whether there are civilisations on planets of other stars we re-establish a meaningful context for ourselves.
i don't think we should wait until the encounter occurs but that we should do all in our power to prepare ourselves for it.
as i am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective... on the work of special agent fox mulder... whose investigations into the paranormal... were fueled by a personal belief... that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12.
i come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of agent mulder's work.
agent scully, i presume you have a basis... for this break from agent mulder.
recent events have shed new light... that would serve to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life, which is the foundation of agent mulder's consuming devotion to his work.
he was fooled by an act of scientific sleight of hand... calculated to perpetuate false truths, the larger lie.
i am here today to expose this lie, to show the mechanism of deception... that drew him and me into it... and to expose agent mulder's work for what it is.
he's a forensics anthropologist that i've been in contact with over the past four years.
several years ago he was involved in a u.f.o. photo enhancement scandal, but he continues to profess his innocence.
- the area where he was found... is in the terminal moraine of a glacier which has since receded.
two hundred years ago, the area where he was frozen was within the tree line.
- if you're gonna go, why not go all the way?
- i'm circumspect myself, but the ice core samples i took can't be faked.
you go public with this, and nobody is going to believe you.
you also risk never knowing because the same people who buried the truth so assiduously...
mom tells me that you've gotten worse, that your cancer's gone into your bloodstream.
what are you doing at work, getting knocked down and beaten up?
- we have a responsibility, not just to ourselves, but to the people in our lives!
just because i haven't bared my soul to you or to father mccue or to god... doesn't mean that i'm not responsible to what's important to me.
the piltdown man hoax wasn't uncovered for 40 years... until it failed the carbon dating test, and that wasn't even very good.
if this were hoax, would we have six dead men up on that mountain?
there are some small eruptions on the surface of the skin, mostly likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice.
otherwise there appears to be no scarring and no identifying marks.
the tissue underneath... with a fine network of veins running throughout.
examination of the chest cavity confirms the presence... of what appears to be a cardiopulmonary system... heart, lungs, all identifiable... within a mass of white string like tissue... that doesn't appear to correspond... to human physiology.
there's tissue culturing to be done, dna sequence and an analysis.
we'd be wise to run a gas chromatograph and that carbon dating you suggested.

derma is hairless, gray with an elephantine texture, with no odor.

and how i, as his partner, had been led down the same path,

you go public with this, and nobody's going to believe you.
you also risk never knowing for sure, because the same people who buried the truth so assiduously will be in charge of its authentication.
what i couldn't tell agent mulder, what i had only just learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized.
and the doctors told me, short of a miracle, it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day towards the inevitable.
there's a tight matrix of crystals at about proximal center, suggesting the quick-freezing scenario you mentioned.
here at the terminus, you've got some particulate hydrocarbons-- jet fuel pollutants found just about everywhere in the world.
mom tells me that you've gotten worse-- that your cancer's gone into your bloodstream.
what are you doing at work getting knocked down and beaten up?
we have a responsibility not just to ourselves, but to the people in our lives.
hey, look, just-just because i haven't bared my soul to you or to father mccue or to god, it doesn't mean that i'm not responsible to what's important to me.
the piltdown man hoax wasn't uncovered for 40 years, until it failed a carbon-dating test, and that wasn't even very good.
if this were a hoax, would we have six dead men up on that mountain?
so we went back to the bio-lab where we found an anomalous set of latents.
found a partial matching in the stairwell four centimeters from one of yours.
derma is hairless, gray with an elephantine texture, with no odor.
there are some small eruptions on the surface of the skin, most likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice.
the eyes are lidless, black... covered by what appears to be a thin membrane which i am now... removing.
the tissue underneath... seems to be semi-gelatinous with a... fine network of veins running throughout.
if the ice hasn't been tampered with, how could the body within be a fake?
cellular material found in the ice core samples were a direct match for what this man kritschgau described.
mulder, everything this man described-- you can't just guess at these details.
i'm sorry, but the facts here completely overwhelm any argument against them.
he said that the men behind this hoax, behind these lies, gave me this disease to make you believe.
...what we generally mean is, of course, intelligent life, something resembling our noble selves.
it is highly probable that there are such intelligent forms of life in other galaxies in the universe.
and it is even more probable that many of these forms are vastly more intelligent than we.
i think there's no question but that we live in an inhabited universe that has life all over it.
by finding out what the other planets are like, by finding out whether there are civilizations on planets of other stars, we reestablish a meaningful context for ourselves.
i don't think we should wait until the encounter occurs, but that we should do all in our power to prepare ourselves for it.
i can conceive of no nightmare as terrifying as establishing such communication with a so-called superior or, if you wish, advance technology in outer space.
as i am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective... on the work of special agent fox mulder... whose investigations into the paranormal... were fueled by a personal belief... that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12.
i come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of agent mulder's work.
in his intense desire to believe, agent mulder was duped by this man.
he was fooled by an act of scientific sleight of hand... calculated to perpetuate false truths, the larger lie.
i am here today to expose this lie, to show the mechanism of deception... that drew him and me into it... and to expose agent mulder's work for what it is.
and grabbing him by the knees, then him falling backwards, tumbling over me and down the stairs.
i know it's been some time since we've spoken ourselves, since you drifted from the church.
father mccue... but at a time of personal crisis, a threat to your health, turning back to your faith is important and essential.
he's a forensics anthropologist that i've been in contact with over the past four years.
several years ago he was involved in a u.f.o. photo enhancement scandal, but he continues to profess his innocence.
the area where he was found... is in the terminal moraine of a glacier which has since receded.
two hundred years ago, the area where he was frozen was within the tree line.
we should be able to do a good enough examination of the body right here to remove any doubt.
we won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating test.
as you can imagine, that's a heavily trafficked stairwell, so we went back to the bio lab where we found an anomalous set of latents.
we found a partial matching in the stairwell four centimeters from one of yours.
derma is hairless gray with an elephantine texture with no odor.
there are some small eruptions on the surface of the skin, mostly likely due to the presence of iron phosphate in the ice.
the eyes are lidless black... covered by what appears to be a thin membrane, which i am now removing.
the tissue underneath... seems to be semigelatinous... with a fine network of veins running throughout.
there's tissue culturing to be done, dna sequence and an analysis.
we'd be wise to run a gas chromatograph and that carbon dating you suggested.
i had reached agent mulder in a warehouse... just outside of washington in sethburg, virginia.
they had managed the frozen corpse by helicopter... down the side of the mountain... and across the canadian border in a refrigerated truck.
he told me a story, which detailed point by point... the systematic way in which agent mulder had been deceived and used, and how i, as his partner, had been led down the same path,
losing a family member due to my allegiance... and contracting a fatal disease, which i was being told was engineered... by the men who are responsible for agent mulder's deception.
what the hell did that guy say to you that you believe his story?
he said that the men behind this hoax... behind these lies... gave me this disease to make you believe.
what we generally mean is intelligent life, something resembling our noble selves.
it is highly probable... that there are such intelligent forms of life... in other galaxies in the universe, and it is even more probable... that many of these forms are vastly more intelligent than we.

the detective asked me... he needed me to identify a body.
agent scully... agent mulder died late last night... from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
section chief blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the x-files.
as i am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective... on the work of special agent fox mulder... whose investigations into the paranormal... were fueled by a personal belief... that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12.
i come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of agent mulder's work.
it is my scientific opinion... that he became, over the course of these years, a victim-- a victim of his own false hopes... and of his belief... in the biggest of lies.
he's a forensics anthropologist that i've been in contact with over the past four years.
several years ago he was involved in a u.f.o. photo enhancement scandal, but he continues to profess his innocence.
- the area where he was found... is in the terminal moraine of a glacier which has since receded.
two hundred years ago, the area where he was frozen was within the tree line.

were you able to convince agent mulder of these facts ?
i was only able to convince him to meet me... so that he might hear the story the way i had.
if the ice hasn't been tampered with, how could the body within be a fake ?

someone who drinks campari and soda and wears orange crotchless panties, someone who thinks deelyboppers are funny, someone who says "sumfink" instead of "something"
and laughs like a freshly-wounded moose strapped to a cement mixer.
i don't suppose you've read my proposal for a new space corps salute?
it's just, i'm trying to get the support of the officers.
sirs, ma'am, we've scarcely two hours before the dimensional tear self-repairs and we lose the linkway.
i suggest we might spend some of that time exchanging supplies and information.
we could update your hydrogen ram-drive to a tachyon-powered engine core.
and in return, maybe we can unscrew all those old pickle jars you can't open.
oh, and if you're a guy, never chop up hot chillies then go for a leak without washing your hands first.
it feels like a bomb's just gone off in your pants.
i think that's why i spent most of my early life drifting, you know?
i didn't have anything to live up to 'cause i didn't know who i was, where i came from, just those two names they couldn't decide on calling me
you were put here to create a paradox, an unbreakable circle.
with us going round and round in time, the human race can never become extinct.

it's a power surge causing a major disturbance in the fabric of space-time.
it's also causing a major disturbance in the fabric of my pants!
we seem to be through the worst of it... but i'm picking up an energy disturbance down on the engineering deck.
according to the psi-scan, the membrane between two realities has temporarily collapsed.
you should apply to a superior officer before you get shore leave, lister.
look, since kochanski split up with me, i've needed time on my own.
so report it, get me put into stasis for six months.
don't you know how dangerous it is to smuggle in an unquarantined animal?
you were put here to create a paradox, an unbreakable circle.
with us going round and round in time, the human race can never become extinct.
it is my perception that a true friend never relies on another's dream.
a person with the potential to be my true friend must be able to find his reason for life without my help.
and, he would have to put his heart and soul into protecting his dream.
he would never hesitate to fight for his dream, even against me.
despite that fact, you gave a present to that man of humble origins.
when you talk to that man, concern yourself with what others might think.
what outrageous conduct would lead a woman like you to step into our sanctuary?
i, the leader of the blue whale super strong heavy assault knights lord adon, will teach you a lesson for this!
if you will be an obedient captive, i will not kill you here.
being a captive means that you may serve as a prostitute for my army, of course.
can you defend against my special strike that can even crush marble to pieces?
this is the spearmanship that has been passed down through the coborlwitz family for 140 years.
we did this sort of thing once, it's no big deal!
what the hell, with that fever of hers she still thinks she can fight?
it is outrageous to use the soldiers who have been gifted to you by the king to perform a search in the midst of battle just to ensure the safety of a mere troop commander.
besides, it is a result of them recklessly entering into single combat.
those who dedicate their lives to another inevitably shed their own blood.
those who sacrifice themselves for hopeless love cannot help shedding tears.
after the enemy had been killed, he had turned into a raging monster.
at the same time, many villagers had gone missing or been found dead.
blessed among women and blessed the fruit of thy loins, jesus who shed his blood for us.
holy mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners now and in the hour of our death.
"his legacy will carry on through all the ages of the world."
"wars will be started in his name and the warriors' souls will be cursed."
"like the sacrificial lamb, his human shell will fall away" "and his true face, in his father's name, will conquer death."
"he will lead the way for him and lead his army."
he always said, "if i get rich, i'll buy a merc and we'll pick up chicks."
that was at the same time as all of those bombings.
superstition was bruited in the village because a few days before a soldier returned to the village he was confused and reported from the front in russia the foe turned into a wrenching monster after he was shot to pieces... at the same time denizens of the village disappeared or where found dead
and only a few days later their graves were empty yeah!
is that the way a lady with style should be treated?
you can perform such courtship display in front of your loamhut with your african hussies
i know the meaning of intelligence, i know what is beautiful
and he is just too stupid to wipe his ass, i have to say.
moses got his attmitance to paradise refused after he adopted the teachings of premutos in his sixth book.
god´s son jesus revived from the dead through his power, too.
just like at the slaughter of a lamb - his human wrapper will be taken away
and his true form will overcome death in the name of his father
come on, let´s show up shortly so that they can see we´re back.
you´re lucky that i could wash it off the dress, i´ll substract it from your income hugo.
he got his collection of weapons here he showed me from time to time
do you nail up the rest of the doors with edith?
yes, but this was also the time when all those bombing attacks happened
and there was a little boy that called: have a shoeshine, have a shoeshine!
and jürgen, i didn´t want to, but jürgen gone there and the boy opened the box and suddenly i saw those wires the thing exploded and jürgen was thrown all over the place.
i ran to him and he lied on the ground in a pool of blood and he screamed and screamed and his guts came out of his and he screamed:
you fell from the sky, refulgent son of dawn you blared to the ground, you conqueror of peoples
but lucifer wasn't the first fallen angel a long time before, jonas was overtaken by the same fate and before again it was premutos that had to give way from the side of god premutos is the oldest of his kind, the ruler over life and death
he was confused and reported from the front in russia the foe turned into a wrenching monster after he was shot to pieces... at the same time denizens of the village disappeared or where found dead
and only a few days later their graves were empty yeah!
a long time before, jonas was overtaken by the same fate.
and before again it was premutos that had to give way from the side of god.
how god himself so does premutos sacrifice the flesh of his own child to step into the world
just like at the slaughter of a lamb - his human wrapper will be taken away
and his true form will overcome death in the name of his father
he will prepare him his way and will lead his army.
it has been said that you blacks have some extra big candybars.
i once had a friend on the swiss residential school and she had a black boyfriend.
and there was a little boy that called: have a shoeshine, have a shoeshine!
and jürgen, i didn´t want to, but jürgen gone there and the boy opened the box and suddenly i saw those wires the thing exploded and jürgen was thrown all over the place.
gas off, water off, the only thing that's missing is sod off.
you know, this used to be a nice street once, before they started knocking it to pieces.
the grover house was broken into and the little boy injected.
sydney is pathological, he's inadequate, but he is not a killer.
supposing one of the children woke and made a noise and he had to put a pillow over their face.
supposing the mother came in and he had to murder her too.
according to the night security guard, the two carpetfitters were there from half past eight 'till almost two this morning.
they had no way of getting out because the main security door was locked.
if he'd done it he wouldn't try to hide the crime by bringing the body here, he'd just panic and run away.
look, why don't we go back to cresswell street and review the evidence?
well, i suppose you'll read about it in the papers tomorrow.
i was the one that let the man go who they think murdered those kids.
i am detaining you in connection with the deaths of nancy, dennis and linda grover.
you do not have to say anything but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.
you say here you broke in about one thirty and committed murder.
but i know that mrs. grover's body was on the railway about an hour earlier.
well, it's always a good idea to visit the scene of the crime again in case anything has been missed.
for example, how could a murder have been committed in a room like this without leaving a single trace?
i know it's supposed to be confidential, but, i mean, after all your patient is dead and so are both her children.
it's just that i'm working on a very sensitive murder hunt.
her husband was at work all day and went to the pub at night.
she was left trapped inside the house with two undisciplined children and another one on the way.
i mean it was so sweet we thought we'd have a meal at a country pub first.
oh, salmon fish cakes, chips and peas, washed down with a fizzy drink?
anyway after the meal i drove the van, parked it in a side lane.
lemmy put on the waterboard jacket, went up the track to the house.
i reckoned he'd either been nicked or struck gold at this place and done a runner.
so you decided to get even by using his credit card?
we've got him in the house, his blood stains are on the back door.
what are you saying, he just happened to break in in the middle of someone else's murder?
no, what i'm saying is that you haven't got a motive, you haven't got a weapon, you haven't even got a time.
i mean you've got nancy grover on the railway track at about midnight and you've got sydney snell in the house at half past one.
they said all right, he's got a bit of a bad marriage, but he loved his children.
go on, get your notebook out and let's go through it again.
yes, it might be mark grover just look at the evidence.
sydney snell did break into the grover's house and he did inject those children.
i have to check every floor at half hour intervals and click a key in the security locks.
they couldn't get out of the place while you were doing that?
there, it was wasted on the floor in there, wasn't it?
right, nip back to the car, get hold of collier and tell him to come and collect it.
so when they dropped her onto the roof of the train they threw the carpet on afterwards hoping it would be carried miles away from here, but fortunately for us, it dropped off in the tunnel.
well, i suppose we'd better go and have a talk with mark grover.
well that night, we got the rush job at bonley's, and it all started again.
and then she said, if you go out and leave me alone again,
he wrapped the body in the carpet, then they dumped the body onto the rail track to make it look like suicide.
and it was collard who found grover some clean clothes and burnt the others.
but it suits us to say we're sisters rather than lovers.
they're good people in this village, but they're not overly liberal.
julie was sleeping in the small bedroom because it was cooler.
she heard him go into the bathroom and then into the bedroom.
this may be hard for you to understand inspector, but two years ago,
i fell in love for the first time ever, with julie.
i knew that if we reported this attack, all of that would have to come out.
so the longer the body lay undiscovered, the more you put it to the back of your mind.
his uncle used to be a gp and left him his medical bag.
and for some unknown reason, he used to like to stick needles into plump little bottoms, or fat little arms.
you know, this used to be a nice street once, before they started knocking it to pieces.
anyway, that's where sydney snell used to live, there, number 44.
she told them she'd never go while she was still alive.
so when she died, before the funeral, they told me, they were going to knock our house down.
i want you to promise me that you'll never be a bad boy again.
go on i want you to swear it, on the bible.
so we, well worked like the clappers and got done around quarter to two.
i drove mark back here, dropped him at the door then i went home to bed.
i heard someone running down the street round about one thirty, that's what woke me up.
i couldn't get back to sleep, so i took the dog out.
snell breaks into people's houses and injects young children out of some misguided idea of helping them.
the grover house was broken into and the little boy injected.
i'd say it was more likely she jumped from the parapet
ianded on the roof of a train and got carried in.
now we've got witnesses stating they heard a row around midnight.
she must have been pretty light of bloody foot to get here to be hit by the 1205 or the 1240 come to that.
look, why don't we go back to cresswell street and review the evidence?
i mean if he'd done it, why isn't the house full of blood stains?
so it would be best if i was a good boy and cooperated with the police.
yes, but good boys don't cooperate with the police by telling them porkies, do they?
go out and kill a couple of kids and their mother just to spite that silly old sod frost, who should have had you banged up in the first place.
he told me to look after children while they were sleeping.
what are you saying, he just happened to break in in the middle of someone else's murder?
no, what i'm saying is that you haven't got a motive, you haven't got a weapon, you haven't even got a time.
i mean you've got nancy grover on the railway track at about midnight and you've got sydney snell in the house at half past one.
yeah, and all you've got is a hunch that sydney's a nice boy who wouldn't do a thing like that.
that means that actually he could be anywhere, 'cos a mobile is, well it's mobile.
he told me he was here and he was here when i arrived an hour later.
now then, just a couple of points you can clear up for me, mr. milton.
you said mr. grover arrived at bonley's about eight and didn't leave 'till half past one in the morning.
oh yes, so you lost your temper, you picked up your carpet knife and you stabbed her with it.
the kids were screaming so you've got to shut them up too.
so i went back into the lounge and she was laughing at me.
and i had the carpet knife in my hand and i...
it was collard, the workmate, who figured out how to conceal the crime.
he wrapped the body in the carpet, then they dumped the body onto the rail track to make it look like suicide.
sorry to bother you again, miss fleming, it's just that we've got one or two loose ends that we need to tie up.
you didn't tell us you used to live at woodside farm cottages.
we have a witness that said mr. hoxton was on his way to this cottage the day that he died.
now we haven't been able to trace mr. hoxton to anywhere else so with your permission
they're good people in this village, but they're not overly liberal.
we came here for a quiet life, so we play things on their terms.
when i was tidying up in the kitchen, he slipped upstairs.
julie was sleeping in the small bedroom because it was cooler.
so the longer the body lay undiscovered, the more you put it to the back of your mind.
there isn't a day goes by when i don't feel guilty about what happened.
but i do really regret putting in that report about you.
i mean, i still think you were way out of line over snell but, if you hadn't have gone with your instincts the wrong man would have gone to jail for murder.
in maybe 15, 20 years, when my rep for being a sissy man finally fades.
a black eye heals, buffy, but cowardice has an unlimited shelf life.
he has to wait for his dad before he can take the car?
i think his parents have been dead for a couple of hundred years.
you're trying to scare me off cos you're afraid of the competition.
you may be hot stuff when it comes to demonology,... ..but when it comes to dating, i'm the slayer.

if we could go deep enough, we'd all be surprised at the creatures down there.
well, could such a creature destroy a ship or drag it under?
i understand that your destination is the orient and that you've been delayed.
what would you say if we could get you there, but by a roundabout route, a cruise of three or four months through the south seas?
i can see no reason why you and your apprentice shouldn't consider yourselves guests of the united states government until we can set you ashore at saigon, do you?
may i ask, uh, why have you honored the professor this way?
they represent an accurate record of 31/2 months cruising under steam in search of a sea monster.
in my considered opinion, no such monster exists or ever did.
if we've gained nothing else, we can at least give the lie to those rumors and make the newspapers retract their exaggerations.
it doesn't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other, captain.
i know you had visions of that monster mounted in the national museum.
# got a whale of a tale to tell you, lads #
you have carried your work as far as terrestrial science permits.
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off... wonders that defy my powers of description...
and until i make up my mind, you should find ample diversion here.
you have literature, art treasures, my collections, and even music if you so desire.
i could only marvel at his ingenuity and envy him his rule over this forgotten reach of nature.
here, in abundance, were various substances necessary to sustain life... an underwater larder filled to overflowing, and all captain nemo's for the taking.
the greatest treasures of all, mr. land, are a sound mind and a full belly.
henceforth, when you're sent for food, don't stoop to pick up pennies.
you are going to get us all killed if you keep on antagonizing him.
look at the trouble you got into wandering off that way.
captain nemo held the key to the future of the world.
as i studied him, i became aware that powerful forces were at work within this strange man.
and when that ship takes it home, the world will die a little more.
i was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there.
they're dedicated men with a plan for living, but also a plan for dying.
we seized one of their ships and fled beyond maps... a place known to me simply as vulcania.
well, now i'll tell you what i had on my mind.
this may be old stuff, tossing' messages off in bottles and setting' 'em adrift, but i've heard of it workin'.
here, hold this, lad... this chap i knew got shipwrecked in the bahamas... him and a lady passenger alone on an island.
well, they had plenty of time on their hands, so they began writing' notes, puttin' 'em in old rum bottles, and setting' 'em adrift.
captain, i-i wondered, as long as the professor is not going ashore, if i could go in his place.
i-i'd like to collect some specimens and... and take some notes.
a mild charge of electricity, mr. land... not very hospitable, but harmless.
and speaking of hospitality, may i say that you have abused mine for the last time?
according to you, mr. land is a hero in the best tradition of cheap fiction.
that can only be true if you consider your life cheap, captain.
i know you were deeply touched by ned's gesture, but you are ashamed to admit it.
you cannot tolerate the faith in humanity, because if you do, all this... the structure of your very existence, which you built on hate and vengeance... all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life.
the world is more complex than that, and good must not be measured on a scale as small as mr. land's brash heroics.
what he would do one day, he would gladly undo the next.
if men and nations had this goodness that i speak of,
i would be willing to share all this... my records, everything.
if we could go deep enough, we'd all be surprised at the creatures down there.
well, could such a creature destroy a ship or drag it under?
as the foremost authority on the sea and its mysteries, you can be an excellent observer.
your observations will greatly influence public opinion, and we can either confirm or deny certain rumors.
they represent an accurate record of 31/2 months cruising under steam in search of a sea monster.
in my considered opinion, no such monster exists or ever did.
if we've gained nothing else, we can at least give the lie to those rumors and make the newspapers retract their exaggerations.
it doesn't seem to me we have proved anything one way or the other, captain.
- [bell rings] - # met her on the coast of java #
- # ooh, ooh, ooh # - # when we kissed, i... #
the real story of the ocean depths begins where you left off... wonders that defy my powers of description...
the secrets that are mine alone... but which i would be willing to share with you.
and until i make up my mind, you should find ample diversion here.
you have literature, art treasures, my collections, and even music if you so desire.
there were hunters and farmers from the submarine, gathering a harvest at the bottom of the sea.
i could only marvel at his ingenuity and envy him his rule over this forgotten reach of nature.
you are going to get us all killed if you keep on antagonizing him.
look at the trouble you got into wandering off that way.
imagine what would happen if they controlled machines such as a submarine boat.
far better that they think there's a monster and hunt me with harpoons.
but when one day he asked me to go ashore with him,
i felt, at long last, i was to have my answer.
and when that ship takes it home, the world will die a little more.
i was once one of those pitiful wretches you see down there.
well, now i'll tell you what i had on my mind.
this may be old stuff, tossing' messages off in bottles and setting' 'em adrift, but i've heard of it workin'.
a mild charge of electricity, mr. land... not very hospitable, but harmless.
and speaking of hospitality, may i say that you have abused mine for the last time?
according to you, mr. land is a hero in the best tradition of cheap fiction.
that can only be true if you consider your life cheap, captain.
i know you were deeply touched by ned's gesture, but you are ashamed to admit it.
you cannot tolerate the faith in humanity, because if you do, all this... the structure of your very existence, which you built on hate and vengeance... all this will collapse around the naked lie of your life.
the world is more complex than that, and good must not be measured on a scale as small as mr. land's brash heroics.
what he would do one day, he would gladly undo the next.
there is, naturally, color and size to take into consideration, but, uh, quality, as well.
for instance, this stone, four carats, only a very slight occlusion.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
i am a watcher, part of a secret society of men and women... who observe and record, but never interfere.
you would be if you saw him at his labors, cutting up corpses, up to his elbows in rotting flesh and maggoty entrails.
there are some questions about life that only the dead can answer.
this band which, bound by yellow hair, is thine, sweet girl, thy pledge of love.
it claims my warmest, dearest care, like relics left of saints above.
in tasting grief, in tasting fear, is that not the time we truly live?
and so, fair muse, what ghosts have you to share tonight?
- i wonder who's the more unhappy, those who die, or-- or those who live.
perhaps, dear mary, death is not truly journey's end, but just another turn in the road.
"she walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies."
"and all that's best of dark and bright meet in the aspect of her eyes."
do you want a tombstone that says, "he lived for centuries,"
or do you want one that says, "for centuries he was alive"?
and you have to learn how to control all the muscles in your mouth.
that's right, and you also have to learn new ways to make sounds.
we have given you every punishment in the book, and there's only one left.
and it's really too bad, because we know you both wanted to go to camp this summer.
[ daniel ] yeah, but, uh, hey, don't forget to trim around the trees.
you'll have to get down on your hands and knees and use the shears.
um, well, maybe next time you could come over to my house.
as a matter of fact, we thought we'd send trina and daniel to spend christmas with you.
we can confirm now that president clark took his own life at 2:53 a.m. est rather than face trial for his actions.
the body has been left in place for examination and documentation by the justice department.
after the battle, sheridan surrendered to earthforce authorities who will now decide whether or not charges will be pressed for his actions taken during and preceding the battle.
despite sheridan's current high standing in public-opinion polls his decision to act against his fellow officers must be explained and justified.
in an impromptu press conference this morning acting president susanna luchenko of the russian consortium urged the public to remain calm.
we realize that many of you want revenge against those who caused such great pain and suffering.
we ask that you listen to the better angels of your nature.
give the courts and the legal system time to locate and prosecute those responsible.
only a sane and careful study of the facts will allow us to separate those who were willing partners in president clark's reign of terror from those who cooperated only in fear of their lives.
our thoughts especially go out to sheridan's second-in-command, susan ivanova critically injured when clark's forces attempted to ambush the multi-planetary fleet.
look, after we gained custody of the alien healing device sheridan and i decided it was too dangerous to let others know about it, so i coded all my log entries.
he must have hacked his way through a dozen security overrides.
i was just lying there, and i was feeling myself letting go of my body.
and i remember the last thing that i thought was i'm going to die now.
and then i felt myself being pulled down, and i got heavy so heavy, you know, tired and it was...
i forced my eyes open and there he was next to me.
he just wanted a kind word or a smile and all i ever gave him in two years was grief.
and it's because i think i saw what i wanted and i was afraid.
i mean, hell, it's not like i was doing anything else.
well, i guess that's one way to deal with unrequited love, huh?
as for the rest it's mr. garibaldi's word against mine unless you'd like to bring in a telepath to scan him, prove that what he's saying is true.
of course, to be admissible in an earth court the teep would have to be a member of the psi corps.
because if she was and if she was killed because of it you have to understand that you will not leave this room alive.
i find it amazing that you think that threats still mean anything to me.
i can have half a dozen sharpshooters cover this building at every exit.
as soon as you poke your head outside, they'll put a bullet through it.
you know what the difference is between you and me, bester?
you use people because you like it and if someone gets hurt in the process, well, that's life.
using telepaths to take over ships from the other side was the hardest decision i ever made.
i had franklin go through their files, pick out the ones that were single no families, who were almost certainly incurable.
i know what it's like to lose someone only to find her, then lose her a second time.
i wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even you, as much as i might want to.
once it's done, i imagine he'll turn his attention to you.
and to tell you the god's honest truth i'd rather face those sharpshooters of yours than what he'll do when he finds you.
as a politician, you learn how to compromise which by all rights means i should give you the medal of honor then have you shot.
i confess the idea had a certain appeal when i mentioned it to the joint chiefs a few hours ago.
many of us wanted to move against him, but the time was never right.
with all due respect, ma'am while you were waiting, innocent civilians were dying.
he would have known instantly if we were up to something.
ironically, by breaking away, you were the only one who could move against him without his knowing what you were up to.
you will explain that you did what you did for the good of earth but your conscience does not permit you to remain in earthforce any longer.
you'll tender your immediate resignation and i'll see to it you will retain your military pension with full honors.
perhaps saving lvanova was the only way he could find peace.
delenn did they tell you what lvanova said at the end?
continuing our coverage of breaking events in the fall of president clark's regime we go now to the presidential suite in earth dome.
fellow citizens of earth honored guests i have come before you today to commemorate those who have taken part in this recent struggle.
follow the orders of your superior officer in acts that violate your conscience or rise up in opposition.
both sides have risked much and suffered greatly but in the end, the battle they fought was the same.
to protect and preserve an earth they could proudly call home.
caught in the center of this particular whirlwind was a man of great integrity honor and courage.
but his task was a difficult one but he executed it with care to preserve the lives of his fellow officers.
despite what you may have heard in his heart, he never left us.
as a young man i joined earthforce because i wanted to be part of something bigger than i was something that i could believe in.
and that belief carried me through the mars riots, the minbari war and the battles that have brought us here today.
everything i did i did out of love of earth and love of duty.
but what happens when those two are no longer the same thing?
now, the time i spent on babylon 5 i learned about choices and consequences and responsibility.
i learned that we all have choices, even when we don't recognize them and that those choices have consequences not just for ourselves, but for others.
and now for my love of earth i find i must walk away from my love of duty.
my presence would be a constant reminder of what has divided us instead of that which brings us together.
and for that reason and president luchenko's generous offer of amnesty for all those who served under me i'm announcing my resignation from earthforce.
i do this in the hope that those who fought on both sides will put aside their disagreements and come together in a new spirit of cooperation.
for many years all of us here have prized our good relations with earth.
you have shown through your example that strength comes from a multitude of voices brought together in common cause.
they will help protect you from raiders and invasion by other races.
they will work with your military to strengthen your borders but understand that they will do so equally and fairly.
if you plan a war of aggression against your neighbors the rangers will hear about it, and so will your neighbors.
if other worlds in the alliance choose to intervene on behalf of those being attacked the rangers will provide the information but will not intervene directly.
their goal is to create the peace, not enforce the peace.
this is a political and economic alliance not one based on military strength.
the gains you will achieve by working peacefully with other races far outweigh anything you might achieve by force.
the alliance recognizes your sovereign right to govern your own people by your own will but membership in the alliance means that you will honor a code of conduct in your relations with other worlds or risk losing all the things we stand to give you.
finally, each member race will be able to contribute volunteers to join the rangers thereby assuring their independence and fairness.
all of us have agreed to recognize the independent authority of the rangers.
in the past, we have kept many of our technological advances to ourselves.
in a gesture of good faith we will show you how to use energy fields to create gravity in your ships eliminating the need to manufacture slower, less-efficient ships that rotate to create gravity.
i guess the war finally taught them that we are better together than apart.
we've been building this thing up for months, bit by bit making them rely more and more on the rangers and each other.
as soon as you got out, they started being real nice to me all of a sudden.
they figured out they were on the wrong side, and there'd be hell to pay.
we begin our broadcast tonight with a special report providing continuing coverage on the unfolding babylon 5 story.
president susanna luchenko met today with representatives of the newly formed interstellar alliance.
in a historic move, earth has agreed to join forces with the new alliance.
in the same press conference the newly elected president of the interstellar alliance, john sheridan had this surprising revelation.
now, in order to join the alliance the rights of the colony worlds must be respected.
if a majority of their population votes for independence, they must be freed.
citing the death of a close friend and personal reasons captain ivanova has asked for and received a transfer to one of the new warlock-class destroyers for a one-year shakedown cruise.
in a statement issued a few hours ago, captain ivanova said only:
"i need to decide where my heart belongs before the rest of me can follow. "
after the press conference in earth dome this morning sheridan and delenn left for babylon 5.
it's rumored that they were married in a private ceremony aboard one of the white star ships.
sources tell isn they will head up the newly formed alliance from babylon 5 until more permanent facilities can be located in tuzanor on the minbari homeworld.
g'kar, the artificial eye that dr. franklin gave you where is it?
it was the end of the earth year 2261 and it was the dawn of a new age, for all of us.
it was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
the next 20 years would see great changes great joy and great sorrow.
the body has been left in place for examination and documentation by the justice department.
after the battle, sheridan surrendered to earthforce authorities who will now decide whether or not charges will be pressed for his actions taken during and preceding the battle.
despite sheridan's current high standing in public-opinion polls his decision to act against his fellow officers must be explained and justified.
in an impromptu press conference this morning acting president susanna luchenko of the russian consortium urged the public to remain calm.

give the courts and the legal system time to locate and prosecute those responsible.
only a sane and careful study of the facts will allow us to separate those who were willing partners in president clark's reign of terror from those who cooperated only in fear of their lives.
and how the hell did he find out about that machine?
look, after we gained custody of the alien healing device sheridan and i decided it was too dangerous to let others know about it, so i coded all my log entries.
i mean he really did have an english accent, just like in all those old movies.
and then i felt myself being pulled down, and i got heavy so heavy, you know, tired and it was...
i forced my eyes open and there he was next to me.
and we were hooked into that damn machine and i tried to pull it apart, stephen.
and he gave so much, and he wanted so little in return.
he just wanted a kind word or a smile and all i ever gave him in two years was grief.
they say the regent will leave us early in the coming year.
when that happens, the royal court has decided that we need your voice to guide us.
this will let us speak privately for a few minutes before they decide it's more than ordinary interference.
you never come at anyone straight out, do you, mr. bester?
i want to know if my lover was one of the telepaths you used to disable the fleet in your little war.
because if she was and if she was killed because of it you have to understand that you will not leave this room alive.
as soon as you poke your head outside, they'll put a bullet through it.
you know what the difference is between you and me, bester?
you use people because you like it and if someone gets hurt in the process, well, that's life.
using telepaths to take over ships from the other side was the hardest decision i ever made.
i wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even you, as much as i might want to.
now, we selected 30 telepaths for that job, 30 out of 100.
even with clark gone, you'll keep moving your telepaths into positions of power.
and then when the time is right, you'll try and take over the government.
see, mr. garibaldi is finishing up some personal business on mars.
once it's done, i imagine he'll turn his attention to you.
and to tell you the god's honest truth i'd rather face those sharpshooters of yours than what he'll do when he finds you.
i don't know exactly how he plans to settle the score, but i...
you'll tender your immediate resignation and i'll see to it you will retain your military pension with full honors.
and i'll guarantee amnesty for your officers and crew who served under you during this crisis.
and i'll make sure that the military tribunal is stacked with generals from the "shoot him" category.
don't make the mistake of assuming that this is a conversation.
his life before he came to the rangers was not a happy one.
he blamed himself for the death of his brother, so many others.
both sides have risked much and suffered greatly but in the end, the battle they fought was the same.
to protect and preserve an earth they could proudly call home.
caught in the center of this particular whirlwind was a man of great integrity honor and courage.
but his task was a difficult one but he executed it with care to preserve the lives of his fellow officers.
and that belief carried me through the mars riots, the minbari war and the battles that have brought us here today.
everything i did i did out of love of earth and love of duty.
but what happens when those two are no longer the same thing?

my presence would be a constant reminder of what has divided us instead of that which brings us together.
and for that reason and president luchenko's generous offer of amnesty for all those who served under me i'm announcing my resignation from earthforce.
in that spirit, we have voted to dissolve the league of non-aligned worlds and create a new alliance based on mutual cooperation and respect.
an alliance born in the diverse voices of many worlds joined by their desire to build a better future and their decision to voluntarily recognize a common authority.
central to this process is a group of humans and minbari trained to work together and dedicated to the higher principles of duty, honor and peace.
they have been entrusted with the most advanced fleet of ships in existence now that the first ones have left us.
they come in peace, and will stay only where they are invited to stay.
they will help protect you from raiders and invasion by other races.
they will work with your military to strengthen your borders but understand that they will do so equally and fairly.
if you plan a war of aggression against your neighbors the rangers will hear about it, and so will your neighbors.
if other worlds in the alliance choose to intervene on behalf of those being attacked the rangers will provide the information but will not intervene directly.
their goal is to create the peace, not enforce the peace.
this is a political and economic alliance not one based on military strength.
the gains you will achieve by working peacefully with other races far outweigh anything you might achieve by force.
the alliance recognizes your sovereign right to govern your own people by your own will but membership in the alliance means that you will honor a code of conduct in your relations with other worlds or risk losing all the things we stand to give you.
finally, each member race will be able to contribute volunteers to join the rangers thereby assuring their independence and fairness.
all of us have agreed to recognize the independent authority of the rangers.
madam president, honored guests i now invite you to join the new alliance.
if you accept we believe it will signal a new age of peace and prosperity.
the invitation to join your new alliance is tempting, ambassador but many of our generals are skeptical about your claims to neutrality.
in a gesture of good faith we will show you how to use energy fields to create gravity in your ships eliminating the need to manufacture slower, less-efficient ships that rotate to create gravity.
as a space-faring race dependent upon trade with other worlds i'm sure you see the advantage in this.
as for the new job, well i was hoping the league worlds would pull it together, but you never know.
i guess the war finally taught them that we are better together than apart.
we've been building this thing up for months, bit by bit making them rely more and more on the rangers and each other.
but if they decided against the alliance or if they wanted somebody else, well, i was fine with that too.
president susanna luchenko met today with representatives of the newly formed interstellar alliance.
in a historic move, earth has agreed to join forces with the new alliance.
in the same press conference the newly elected president of the interstellar alliance, john sheridan had this surprising revelation.
now, in order to join the alliance the rights of the colony worlds must be respected.
if a majority of their population votes for independence, they must be freed.
later this afternoon, president luchenko will sign an executive order declaring mars a free and independent world.
you know, i'm gonna need someone to help me run edgars industries.
oh, boy, we do that they're gonna say that i married you for your money.
in related babylon 5 news, in one of his last acts as an officer in earthforce captain john sheridan promoted susan ivanova to the rank of full captain.
citing the death of a close friend and personal reasons captain ivanova has asked for and received a transfer to one of the new warlock-class destroyers for a one-year shakedown cruise.
in a statement issued a few hours ago, captain ivanova said only:
"i need to decide where my heart belongs before the rest of me can follow."
after the press conference in earth dome this morning sheridan and delenn left for babylon 5.

in the same press conference the newly elected president of the interstellar alliance, john sheridan had this surprising revelation.
now, in order to join the alliance the rights of the colony worlds must be respected.
if a majority of their population votes for independence, they must be freed.
citing the death of a close friend and personal reasons captain ivanova has asked for and received a transfer to one of the new warlock-class destroyers for a one-year shakedown cruise.
in a statement issued a few hours ago, captain ivanova said only:
"i need to decide where my heart belongs before the rest of me can follow."
after the press conference in earth dome this morning sheridan and delenn left for babylon 5.
it's rumored that they were married in a private ceremony aboard one of the white star ships.
sources tell isn they will head up the newly formed alliance from babylon 5 until more permanent facilities can be located in tuzanor on the minbari homeworld.
g'kar, the artificial eye that dr. franklin gave you where is it?
it was the end of the earth year 2261 and it was the dawn of a new age, for all of us.
it was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
the next 20 years would see great changes great joy and great sorrow.
the body has been left in place for examination and documentation by the justice department.
after the battle, sheridan surrendered to earthforce authorities who will now decide whether or not charges will be pressed for his actions taken during and preceding the battle.
despite sheridan's current high standing in public-opinion polls his decision to act against his fellow officers must be explained and justified.
in an impromptu press conference this morning acting president susanna luchenko of the russian consortium urged the public to remain calm.
we realize that many of you want revenge against those who caused such great pain and suffering.
we ask that you listen to the better angels of your nature.
give the courts and the legal system time to locate and prosecute those responsible.
only a sane and careful study of the facts will allow us to separate those who were willing partners in president clark's reign of terror from those who cooperated only in fear of their lives.
and how the hell did he find out about that machine?
look, after we gained custody of the alien healing device sheridan and i decided it was too dangerous to let others know about it, so i coded all my log entries.
i mean he really did have an english accent, just like in all those old movies.
and then i felt myself being pulled down, and i got heavy so heavy, you know, tired and it was...
i forced my eyes open and there he was next to me.
and we were hooked into that damn machine and i tried to pull it apart, stephen.
and he gave so much, and he wanted so little in return.
he just wanted a kind word or a smile and all i ever gave him in two years was grief.
they say the regent will leave us early in the coming year.
when that happens, the royal court has decided that we need your voice to guide us.
this will let us speak privately for a few minutes before they decide it's more than ordinary interference.
you never come at anyone straight out, do you, mr. bester?
i want to know if my lover was one of the telepaths you used to disable the fleet in your little war.
because if she was and if she was killed because of it you have to understand that you will not leave this room alive.
as soon as you poke your head outside, they'll put a bullet through it.
you know what the difference is between you and me, bester?
you use people because you like it and if someone gets hurt in the process, well, that's life.
using telepaths to take over ships from the other side was the hardest decision i ever made.
i wouldn't wish that on anyone, not even you, as much as i might want to.
now, we selected 30 telepaths for that job, 30 out of 100.
even with clark gone, you'll keep moving your telepaths into positions of power.
and then when the time is right, you'll try and take over the government.
see, mr. garibaldi is finishing up some personal business on mars.
once it's done, i imagine he'll turn his attention to you.
and to tell you the god's honest truth i'd rather face those sharpshooters of yours than what he'll do when he finds you.
i don't know exactly how he plans to settle the score, but i...
you'll tender your immediate resignation and i'll see to it you will retain your military pension with full honors.
and i'll guarantee amnesty for your officers and crew who served under you during this crisis.
and i'll make sure that the military tribunal is stacked with generals from the "shoot him" category.
don't make the mistake of assuming that this is a conversation.
his life before he came to the rangers was not a happy one.
he blamed himself for the death of his brother, so many others.
both sides have risked much and suffered greatly but in the end, the battle they fought was the same.
to protect and preserve an earth they could proudly call home.
caught in the center of this particular whirlwind was a man of great integrity honor and courage.
but his task was a difficult one but he executed it with care to preserve the lives of his fellow officers.
and that belief carried me through the mars riots, the minbari war and the battles that have brought us here today.
everything i did i did out of love of earth and love of duty.
but what happens when those two are no longer the same thing?
now, the time i spent on babylon 5 i learned about choices and consequences and responsibility.
my presence would be a constant reminder of what has divided us instead of that which brings us together.
and for that reason and president luchenko's generous offer of amnesty for all those who served under me i'm announcing my resignation from earthforce.
in that spirit, we have voted to dissolve the league of non-aligned worlds and create a new alliance based on mutual cooperation and respect.
an alliance born in the diverse voices of many worlds joined by their desire to build a better future and their decision to voluntarily recognize a common authority.
central to this process is a group of humans and minbari trained to work together and dedicated to the higher principles of duty, honor and peace.
they have been entrusted with the most advanced fleet of ships in existence now that the first ones have left us.
they come in peace, and will stay only where they are invited to stay.
they will help protect you from raiders and invasion by other races.
they will work with your military to strengthen your borders but understand that they will do so equally and fairly.
if you plan a war of aggression against your neighbors the rangers will hear about it, and so will your neighbors.
if other worlds in the alliance choose to intervene on behalf of those being attacked the rangers will provide the information but will not intervene directly.
their goal is to create the peace, not enforce the peace.
this is a political and economic alliance not one based on military strength.
the gains you will achieve by working peacefully with other races far outweigh anything you might achieve by force.
the alliance recognizes your sovereign right to govern your own people by your own will but membership in the alliance means that you will honor a code of conduct in your relations with other worlds or risk losing all the things we stand to give you.
finally, each member race will be able to contribute volunteers to join the rangers thereby assuring their independence and fairness.
all of us have agreed to recognize the independent authority of the rangers.
madam president, honored guests i now invite you to join the new alliance.
if you accept we believe it will signal a new age of peace and prosperity.
the invitation to join your new alliance is tempting, ambassador but many of our generals are skeptical about your claims to neutrality.
in a gesture of good faith we will show you how to use energy fields to create gravity in your ships eliminating the need to manufacture slower, less-efficient ships that rotate to create gravity.
as a space-faring race dependent upon trade with other worlds i'm sure you see the advantage in this.
as for the new job, well i was hoping the league worlds would pull it together, but you never know.
i guess the war finally taught them that we are better together than apart.
we've been building this thing up for months, bit by bit making them rely more and more on the rangers and each other.
but if they decided against the alliance or if they wanted somebody else, well, i was fine with that too.

"i need to decide where my heart belongs before the rest of me can follow."
it's rumored that they were married in a private ceremony... aboard one of the white star ships.
sources tell isn they will head up the newly formed alliance from babylon 5... until more permanent facilities can be located in tuzanor... on the minbari homeworld.
g'kar, the artificial eye that dr. franklin gave you... where is it?
it was the end of the earth year 2261... and it was the dawn of a new age, for all of us.
it was the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.
the next 20 years would see great changes... great joy and great sorrow.
i didn't know pascoe had enough friends left to spare three.
he says he would've arrived last night but you kept him late. 'true.'
"horas non numero nisi serenas." i number only the happy hours.
if this were your case, what's the first question you'd ask?
..and police continue looking for the blue jeep and the fourth friend, who may be armed and dangerous.
we have heard all three deceased were killed by a 12-bore shotgun.
you know how it is in a village - we're not too official.
so, if letters come for the village, we just take them.
good to see you again, mr pascoe, despite the sad occasion.
congratulations on your wife - an intellectual pearl in the constabulary crown, i must say.
there must be a few cracks in the old boy network.
put it like this - whoever settles that estate won't be paying out much.
last week, i saw they pulled out of land-based exploration completely.
i take my risks nearer home, where the heavy mob is.
there once was a lad called sturgeon who put a bit aside for a rainy day.
he met another fellow called lewis, who told him how to make a fortune.
sturgeon trusted him because they both belonged to the liberal club.
lewis tells him there's oil in the glens, near his cottage in lochart.
so sturgie goes to scotland and stays at the lochart hotel.
and who does he meet but a mr archie selkirk... who has a farm to sell.
he tries to contact lewis, but he won't answer his calls.
he looks for selkirk, but nobody seems ever to have heard of him.
'90s britain is one hell of a place to be poor in!
oh, you're gonna be a burden on the whole bloody force!
but i've pissed behind too many doors to get any further.
if your man toned down, i could be "sir-ing" him soon.
last time i was here i didn't pay it enough attention.
i wonder if i could take a look at it now.
"horas non numero nisi serenas." i number only the happy hours.
if this were your case, what's the first question you'd ask?
but there is also a common time of death - between 8pm and 11pm.
i express my sympathy to mr pascoe and, i presume, mrs pascoe, who found the tragic victims.
you know how it is in a village - we're not too official.
so, if letters come for the village, we just take them.
having commended into the hands of god our sister departed, we now commit her body to be cremated.
ashes to ashes, dust to dust, putting our whole trust in the mercy of our heavenly father, and in the victory of his son, jesus christ, our lord, who died, was buried and rose again for us and is alive

meaning he has to be more like you meaning there's a bad outbreak of heart in the place.
i wonder if i could take a look at it now.
he says that on the night of the murders he brought you a french figurine.
let's say the suspect tells us that, he tried to shoot you with the gun.
but it only made a click, and no bullets came out.
when i went home on my first rr, the local baker's wife said,
"turn a new leaf and work hard." she thought i'd been in jail.
if your cult was ever in danger, your guru used to say that... he'd roar like a lion for all the world to hear.
now you get caught, and not a peep out of him.
in the same spirit, there's something i want you to think over.
your mother and wife have been coming everyday asking to see you.
face it, two people died - it won't be 5 or 6 years.
not even sure your mother will be alive when you get out.
i'd been a fan of yours ever since my days as a prosecutor.
i saw you play a teen prostitute when you were about 21, and knew then that here was a star in the making.
but it only made a click, and no bullets came out.
this is a fact that only you and he would know.

it's my job to keep the police from going after our people.
remember last year, while the guru was eating at the steak house...
let's say the suspect tells us that, he tried to shoot you with the gun.
but it only made a click, and no bullets came out.
not even sure your mother will be alive when you get out.
don't you think you should talk with her while you can?
i feel silly, you being an actress, but i'll play the role of the defense lawyer.
at the same time, you saw the face of the murderer.

he believes that as a mosquito is born just to suck blood,
a fly has been created to sit on dung and spread diseases
to stop my daughter from marrying any tom, dick or harry
if it happens, i would have no choice but to commit suicide
why don't you ask your son not to hang around with raja?
i have left no stone unturned, ...yet i fail every time
how do you plan to get his signature on the marriage certificate?
i am more clever than him i am not his father for nothing
you moron, we fired you so that you could own this garage
just sign this contract... and you'll be the new owner of this 25 million worth garage
kajal, this is not a flower, it's symbolizes my true feelings for you
daddy, she's not an enemy but a future daughter-in-law for you
are times so bad that you have to make do with unbranded liquor?
today i can at least drink this... but tomorrow i will not be able to drink even country liquor
now i have only... one ambition in my life, to finish those two and be hanged myself
and i don't care if it takes my last penny to do this
you dog, you wretch, you made off with my last thousand!
if i get my hands on you i will kill you
a man whose daughter runs away from home, does not have the right raise his voice
and do you remember what you had said the other day?
and when there is still a little life left in you,
i will place you on a funeral pyre ...and then i will light the pyre
harbu, i have done everything after a great deal of thinking
the sight of your son's blood must have made you soft
the way in which you have picked a husband off the roadside
in the same way find a father to give you away in marriage
come, my love, let us make merry, for spring is here
come, my love, do not tarry, lest this spring is wasted
you were looking out for a very rich girl for your son, weren't you?
but now i hear you have accepted the daughter of some clerk
come on, open your mouth, old man or i will spill the beans
give him water, some one give him water he is fit to drown with shame
friends, a while ago mr. malhotra asked me why i had changed my mind
why i had not got my son married to my friend's daughter
i want to tell you all... that ajay and his friend raja have to be given credit for that
it is indeed their friendship and love that changed my thinking
these are your friend's doings which i am showing to you
i always told you that these poor people are blood-sucking leeches
they are parasites which gobble up your wealth, and they rob you of your good name
these, these... see, see how your fiancée has been having an affair with your friend
yes, and listen, send that son-of-a-bitch along with his lady love, on the evening passenger ship going to lagos, nigeria
and if you ever see them again in this town, shoot them
i am ready to die if necessary to prove my innocence
if you are thinking of dying, why did you save me then?
and when he was consoling that terrified girl like a brother ...these photographs were taken, which were presented in a totally different context by your father
raja kept screaming that he was innocent but you didn't believe him
so to prove his innocence, raja re-enacted this scene last night
he carried off madhu in the same way and you too saved madhu in the same way
and when you were consoling this terrified girl these photographs were taken at that time by us so that you can see the truth for yourself
and if you still have doubts, then ask this scoundrel who is an equal partner in your father's conspiracy
all that i said in the party that day, it was all untrue
your father had paid me 200, 000 rupees to say all that
leave me, i will kill him, he has ruined my life
you are a criminal, i will not spare you i will kill you
but this man has treated his own son worse than an animal
madhu, he cannot be my father, he cannot be my father
it is time to ask forgiveness of those whose life has been turned into a hell because of us
yes, ajay we will go to them and will beg for their forgiveness
the individual living in this house, is of a weird type.
he thinks, just as a mosquito was born to suck human blood or a fly, which was born to sit on filth spread disease...
the poor too are born to suck blood of the rich and spread diseases among them.
that's why this richie-rich has an utter hatred for the poor!
a poor touched you, and you had to use dettol and cologne.
even this food you're eating is prepared by a poor man.
you got her married you didn't inform me, your elder brother?
they were in love, so i had to get them married.
god forbid, you may see this day because you have a daughter too!
god forbid, you'll see this day because you have a daughter too.
but your father phoned and ordered me, not to pass any cheque of yours.
and i can't disobey him, since my bank runs because of him.
- my only child and i had phoned to freeze his account?
for whose birth i asked for a boon from both the houses in parliament.
do you think i'll give such lucrative land to these vermins?
and do you think i'll sign those mouldy papers of yours?
you gave away land worth rs.2 million and attained joys worth rs.100 million?
now our kids will not even think of anybody else, let alone marry!
you sign this and you become the owner of this garage.
- but remember this would be a surety that you'll not glance at madhu.
kill them in such a way, that it scares all those who love!
"who's the one who makes me restless... you are the one"
so i want to show you all, that the onus of this change is with my son, and his friend.
their love and friendship is what made me change my thoughts.
and when you were consoling this poor, cringing girl i took these photos, so that you'll come to know the truth.
if you still doubt me, then ask this rascal, who is with your father in this!
why did you phone and delay this ship by 1/2 hour?
had this ship left, then in the eyes of our children we'd have fallen forever!
do you remember the jokes that were flying around when he was first caught?
serial killers were all threatening to sue on the ground that his law degree was ruining their reputation.
i have enjoined the experimental drug therapy with the hope of being released.
i want this penitentiary to be a place of... genuine penitence... change.
you don't have a clue what is he going to do next.
james pike is probable the most intelligent person i've ever known.
the images on his wall, his resurrection, this ritualized killing - he is acting on something i don't yet understand.
but the only way we gonna stop him is to find out what it is.
i know well the effect of... the cage upon both the captive and the captor.
you have a grave responsibility of which you equate yourself well, i trust.
do you think it's because his cvi is imploding and burning out?
he knows the things and da'an's willing to risk his life to find out how he knows.
trying to guess his mind is like staring in a painting by bosch.
he draws you into his world and then you can't figure out how much of it is real and how much of it is just demonic.
they look like those balloons you get when your tits are too small.
if you use the biggest, you'll get all the lovers you want, mom says!
everyone will know, but we must not show, 'cause christian will flirt, with klara in her skirt.
i can show nothing, and that's the worst part, 'cause when we dance, ida's my sweetheart.
this time next week, these lights will be flashing all across russia.
this room will be alive again with happy voices and the patter of little feet.
i should've gone into the bathroom and flushed her and everything else.
i'm just gonna recycle her now, and we'll go from there, okay?
you know i'm helping you out, but i'm not a completely good guy.
there's something i want, and you're gonna have to let me do it.
and if it ends here with the police i don't think he's gonna be happy.
but i think we can offer you a more rewarding scenario than the police could provide.
do you think we could smoke them over here where i am at the grand plaza london?
because it's already 10:30 and i really would like to smoke them on my day.

there's a bunch of guys with flat noses that would like to get their hands on you.
diggs and his best friend, jimmy rayford, owned a little air cargo company in arkansas.

the truth is we might be the only friends that you have left.
now you're not doin' eugene any favors by lying' to us.
got his butt whipped, but, uh, he saved eugene from a lot worse.
i can't tell you how many times i've heard that story.
i went up into the cockpit to call in a report.
next thing i know, cabin pressure's gone... and garrison's layin'there all cut up.
what's important is eugene is here, and he's still your witness.
now, tomorrow morning, we get on that plane, and we take down the cartel.
both of these witnesses should have been taken care ofby now.
my client is pleased aboutjimmy rayford... but diggs was never supposed to be brought in alive.
jarod has expressed his inability... to complete the simulation without another pretender.
as a result, i've convinced a colleague to establish new parameters... for the pretender program.

following the instructions of your parents, you're going to spend three weeks here with your family in this house.
you'll spend the first week with uncle juan, and marisa, your aunt.
we thought it convenient, that rather than to go to a new school, with the implications that this entails, it is better that i give you classes to learn new subjects, and, above all, you do not forget what you have learned.

it is also said of crowing and not putting the egg out which means: who hard presses little covers.
fuensanta stared at me, she had changed too she was now staring at me very seriously
perhaps we'll never see each other again but one thing was certain: if my parents had not been to get me
now that you're married, you still need me to take care of you?
honey, a man like me needs lots of taking care of.
♫ i'm looking over a four leaf clover that i overlooked before. ♫
♫ i'm looking over a four leaf clover that i overlooked before. ♫
my ears are burning, i'm sure your family's talking about me right now.
well, the men are... the men are talking about farmers are always talking about... the weather
ya know, as much as i love clover, i want you two to love each other.
we will, i promise we will, i promise i'll be a good mother to that child.
he swelled-up like a football lunch when he was a kid,
so, grandma wouldn't let him work the orchard for the rest of the summer.
you want to celebrate your father's life, you father's gone to god.
at the service, when the reverend asks you to pay your last respects,
and i have been a very good mother to clover since florinda passed on.
and to tell the truth, reverend, i couldn't bear to lose clover so soon after losing gaten.
if you leave a message, i'll get back to you as soon as i can.
clover, i thought we agreed, you were supposed to start back at the peach shed this morning.
if i'm not mistaken, that's a brand new bicycle stuck in the back of your truck.
now, what that child needs now is an abundance of love, and the security that comes with hard, honest work, not some white woman's expensive toys.
it would've all been much, much easier if you had brought home that bicycle instead of me.
but the only thing clover and i have in common is that we both wish that i had died in that crash instead of you.
you left her in the house by herself, and that woman's in mourning?
well, it won't go on long, mourning for them is short.
oh, uh, sara kate, clover's gonna be staying here tonight... that is if it's okay with you.
no, no, that's all right, she has plenty of clothes here.
you oughta put it down before you go to church next time.
now, remember, we never repeat the things we talk about here.
you've been with me all summer, have you seen one sign that i'm even gifted or talented?
uh... well... it will all seem better when you get some new clothes for school.
some of the back of your house is gettin' out of control and
i had some time this mornin', so, i brought my riding' mower.
you wanted me to have a new mother, and now i've got one.
and she' gonna go away with my new father and they're gonna take me with them.
my father and my brothers are in real estate, they think just like you.
i mean, of course, with them it's, "watch out for the blacks".
and, by the way, the reason i encourage chase to come by?
it's because he is the only one who ever came to visit me.
mary ellen thinks she pretty uppity-crusty now that she married herself some money.
a year ago just to pay the rent, she worked as hard as a damned nigger woman.
when she ran away from your house, she ran to me.
of course she did, with you buyin' her buying bicycles, all the time.
she's a kid, she's supposed to play once in a while.
you have her down here working all day long and i don't even get a chance to see her.
how could you believe that i would do anything to keep that child out of school?
well, it doesn't help with you practicing that voodoo against me.
there are a lot of cookbooks out there, if you can read, you can cook.
have you been reading anything interesting in school these days, clover?
and if you need any help with the rain gutters, you know i can always help out.
i haven't seen much of you at the peach shed, clover, what've you been doing with yourself after school?
and she's gonna marry a white guy who's got a jock for a daughter, and she's gonna forget my father.
i'm gonna be the only one who remembers him, and everybody goes on like nothing happened, and everything that was supposed to happen, didn't, and everything that wasn't supposed to happen, did!
go ahead, say it, say it and have done with it.
i don't mind, who should have died in that car accident?
my mother and i are here now, because we're recording this message.
but, maybe if we don't pick up when you call, then we're probably out.
in his study, the first in the world conceived for the cinema,
méliès, the magician, explored since 1897, all the options of the camera.
in 16 years more than 500 works of the studies of méliès appeared,
which were exhibited all over the world and astonished the public ...
he wanted to withdraw from the business and distribute it among his three children.
but i did not want to continue in the footwear business.
the robert-houdin theater was in the 8th of the boulevard of the italians,
right in the middle of what is now the crossroads ...
i was his last director, i directed him for more than 30 years.
when i bought it, the theater had spent two difficult years.
the glory of the méliès filmmaker has hidden the méliès magician,
but he was one of the great creators of magic of his century.
when he took over the theater, méliès knew he must be ...
at the height of the prestigious past of a stage on which ...
a set of hands that sometimes lasted only tenths of a second.
i did not like to explain my tricks, and i would have refused to participate ...
that's why he was forced to look for a projector for his films.
méliès acts as in the previous occasion, that is to say,
the 4 of september of 1896, méliès, next to its partners ...
lucien korsten and lucien reulos, applied for a patent to claim,
the projector that had been operating since april at the robert-houdin theater.
it is a very strange patent, as it repeats point by point ...
but i was not long in leaving aside these simple subjects,
and i specialized in interesting topics because of the difficulty ...
at the same level as the wooden floor of the workshop.
the area of ​​performances was orientated so that it received ...
i fixed the camera to one of the catwalks located ...
on the stage and made a take on the set lying down ...
but it would be more accurate to call them "fantastic shots."
these shots were performed through a series of processes that, together,
in my opinion there is a very direct relationship between ...
the art of illusionism and the cinema of the first period.
the effort of the illusionists focuses on making the trick invisible.
so there is an obvious relationship with what they were doing ...
and placed in the same place that occupied the black cloth.
once the overprint is made, the black velvet of the picture ...
then the teacher draws a note to which he places two eyes,
nose and mouth, indicating that he has just drawn his own head.
he grabs his head in his hands and separates it from his shoulders.
the gluing, in this case at the bottom of the image,
and when he spoke to someone who had not yet met him,
my grandmother, who was not very kind, said: "look, he is strutting."
sometimes he went to the comic opera at the folies-bergère, or the châtelet.
at first the fate of the films of méliès was its theater,
of 40 meters and 2,000 frames, i have colored image by image.
that has allowed me to understand how they worked at that time.
came to the minister of the army, saw in him ...
to the providential man with whom the revenge could be taken ...
there, in december 1861, the third son of méliès, georges, was born.
his life took place in the same district in which he was born.
he was a manual and intellectual worker at the same time.
that's why i loved with passion that art that encompassed almost everything,
the person responsible for this publicity came one day to ask me ...
whether it would be possible to make claim movies with the cinema.
a great show with 12 scenes and 15 minutes of projection.
the special effects that most encouraged me to make the film,
what they invented was the perfection to synthesize a culture ...
of 200 or 300 years old and the new way of presenting it ...
the brand of méliès, shines in the highest of the sky.
without rival in europe, it still does not fear the north american competition.
it can not be reproduced as if it were a photocopy.
you can play the technique, but it can not be played ... the spirit.
i have the impression of seeing the movie for the first time.
why do i always have the impression of finishing discovering ...
but that meant that we had to produce ... 300 meters of film per week, something that georges méliès did not like,
who was forced to build a second studio on his property,
to which he did and that began to take force and implanted ... between years and
it is clear that méliès tried to adapt to the market,
but méliès was not prepared for this new type of exploitation.
in 1909 he filmed some ten films, among them the devilish tenant.
in july 1912, he embarked on a mad voyage to the south seas.
in 1912 he was 60 years old, and left the united states ...
a bunch of radishes, a lettuce leaf, or a leg of chicken will do.
come and discover the animated scenes by the king of spectacular special effects.
but tonight you're here to see some of melies' films, films which were shot between 1898 and 1909.
so i ask you to make a great leap backwards in time
you are here in the grevin museum in the 1900s, and you're here for a cinematography presentation.
there were always three people present in the cinema since they were silent movies, but they were never quiet.
first, there was the barker, that's me, who told the stories and who announced the titles of the films.
there was a second person, the projectionist, who turned the crank, and counted, because the films were shown at eighteen frames per second.
and there was a third person, very important, who was the pianist.
the pianist with us tonight is the composer and improviser eric le guen.
and we're going to start the first part of our screening with a film which melies himself appears in, because he acted in all his films.
he was producer, distributor, lead actor, scriptwriter, special effects man ... and gag writer.
it only lasts for 50 seconds, but for us, for you, it's 50 seconds of bliss.
now we will accompany melies on his immortal trip to the moon from 1902.
we have the privilege of attending tonight a special meeting of the members of the institute of incoherent astronomy.
scholars from all over the world, here for the conference, are waiting impatiently for a speech by the famous professor barbenfouillis.
professor barbenfouillis presents to his honourable colleagues his bold plan to make a trip to the moon
with the help of a shell fired from a giant cannon.
melies used this idea to make a film called the infernal cake-walk and himself played the role of the devil, and danced the cake-walk in the middle of the film after coming out of a giant cake.
in 1905, the prefect of the police lepin had outlawed a number of gaming clubs in paris.
melies was a magician, an illusionist, and a very skilful conjuror.
in the living playing cards, he begins with a magic trick which i saw him perform:
the ever growing cards, and then, of course, he continues with cinematographic special effects.
you have just seen eight short films by melies and you now know what an extraordinary, extravagant person he was.
in his films, there's a sense of gaiety, good humour and jubilation.
we get the impression that he had a lot of fun.
he worked hard, but he also loved creating these films which intrigued parents and amused their children.
he made 503 films during his career, which stretched from 1896 to 1912.
he was also one of the inventors of advertising films, the short commercials which you can now see on television.
you saw that when he was not wearing a wig, he was bald.
well, he made a commercial for pilocarpin which was a hair restorer.
so in the film, he introduced himself and took a bottle of pilocarpin out of his pocket.
he covered his head with pilocarpin and grew a magnificent head of hair which reached his shoulders.
he splashed a few drops of pilocarpin on his shoes, and his shoes sprouted hair too.
he shot around 20 very funny little films, which were shown on the mezzanine floor of the robert-houdin theatre and which the public could watch from the boulevard des italiens.
they were such a success that two police constables were brought in.
the police officers enjoyed themselves so much, that they joined the robert-houdin theatre and became magicians.
we will begin this second part with a film called billboards on a spree.
and melies puts up a poster for the parisiana music hall, which is putting on a revue entitled love on credit.
in 1909, a devilish tenant, a colour film in which each frame was hand coloured at the time.
i know it doesn't seem like it, but he's trying to help.
then he should be looking for the man who died... instead of questioning whether or not it ever happened.
i know that you don't want her to see the things that you've seen.
we don't want her to live in a world where those things exist, but she does.
hair and fiber is consistent with a room used by many people.
some latent bloodstains, but that's hardly unusual in a medical setting.
i got drawn into these trials because i wanted to find out something.
a few weeks ago, when helen was abducted, something happened that made me wonder if jordan has this thing that i have.
i know it doesn't seem like it, but he's trying to help.
then he should be looking for the man who died... instead of questioning whether or not it ever happened.
one night when my wife was out, i was taking care of her.

we don't want her to live in a world where those things exist, but she does.

closer to home, no rain is expected in this small iowa river town but residents spent their weekend sandbagging the levee in hopes of avoiding the heavy flooding which their neighbours to the north have been battling for the last week.
this is the worst flooding the midwest has seen in over 50 years and right now the national guard is spread so thin that the governor has asked for our help.
this is a perfect opportunity for us to show what this programme and our men are about.
you can be sure they won't allow their kid to get caught a second time.
it's different for these inmates and the last thing they need is somebody telling them their race is an excuse.
a staggering amount of the midwest is underwater tonight as the deadly mississippi continues to rush southward destroying everything in its path.
it's official, folks, this is the worst flood to hit the midwest in 100 years.
listen, ma'am, why can't my son ever get a hold of you?
and why can't he go to the library and get some books?
they don't want you to open the door for them, messenger for them, pour their watery-ass coffee for them, nothin'.
that's why i ain't gonna drag my ass down to no motherfucking job interview and ask them for some bullshit they ain't never gonna give me.
put some papers in your pocket, me and you can go out and kick it.
i gotta tell you, don't look like you had yourself no fun in a long goddamn time.
ain't nobody gonna hire me unless i tell 'em i been to college or...
i know guys never been to prison and still can't get a job.
throwing sandbags on that levee was the best job i've ever had.
i mean, the people there... they made us feel like we had a purpose.
this ass, he tried to go over to the vice lords but we got the bitch back.
been breaking him off a little something for two days now.
you did what you did and now you got to pay.
you think you can do whatever you want and get away with it?
redneck ku klux klan motherfuckers tell you to eat your own shit, you got to do it.
shit, dog, i don't know if i wanna become the type of nigger i gotta be to try to survive up in this bitch for five years.
and believe me, we know how to deal with convicts here.
this programme exists solely to make room in our overcrowded prison system and to save taxpayers' dollars.
i have no feeling in these fingers from the handcuffs when i got arrested.
you're not gonna get out of work detail cos of that.
these kids are not from your neighbourhood, they're not going back to your neighbourhood.
how about you help the ones you can help... and i'll work with the ones you can't.
you think if you keep cryin', i'll send you home to your mama and daddy?
you quit and i'm gonna ship your butt right back to prison today.
closer to home, no rain is expected in this small iowa river town but residents spent their weekend sandbagging the levee in hopes of avoiding the heavy flooding which their neighbours to the north have been battling for the last week.
this is the worst flooding the midwest has seen in over 50 years and right now the national guard is spread so thin that the governor has asked for our help.
those white kids you're talking about, they got nice homes and nice parents.
you can be sure they won't allow their kid to get caught a second time.
when white people look at me, it kills me that they see you cos there ain't but one nigger in this here closet.
you been here this long and you gonna try to run a game on me?
it's official, folks, this is the worst flood to hit the midwest in 100 years.
as one exhausted volunteer put it, all you can do is hope for the best.
if you don't want it, i might as well help myself.
you're insulting these people who made this meal with your lack of manners.
i know you have your agenda, and i respect that, but you go too far.
one more time and i will see to it that you are suspended.
and when you leave here, you may run into some setbacks.
but no matter what these setbacks are, no matter how difficult it is...
and why can't he go to the library and get some books?
he likes to read and he wants to do some job research.
tell you what, let me know when you wanna work just one day.
put some papers in your pocket, me and you can go out and kick it.
now... you're gonna go down there to them employment people again.
you're gonna look them in the eye... and you're gonna tell them the truth.
i know that may sound like a nightmare to you but...
throwing sandbags on that levee was the best job i've ever had.
making $3 an hour would be a very big accomplishment for me.
so, ma'am, i'm just asking you, please, could you look for anything?
like, if i'm eating something, and there's a hair in it, i'm gonna stop.
i'm gonna go, "ew," but she's sitting there, just going to town on this thing.
um, i need some equipment for setting up a home studio.
you're gonna need one of everything, and the latest, i think...
my kids are in a private school, and i don't know...
all the schools my kids have been in, most of the parents are out-of-work sitcom actors, you know?
my mother-in-law, well, actually, she's a very nice woman, and i had to have her cremated, and i cannot tell you...
i flew all the way over to england, 'cause they were english, and i had her cremated, and i was coming back on the plane, and then it hit me...
i just go in there, i don't even take anesthetic anymore.
the only trouble is, you know, sometimes, they can pull you too tight.
i never get in a bathing suit, 'cause i get in the bathing suit, i walk around, my thighs go, "good for us, good for us, good for us."
i was on a game show in australia, where i represented the united states, and i felt like i did a pretty good job.
then we'll instal a fridge in the nightstand and you won't need legs at all.
you know, if body parts fell off because of lack of use you'd be a ken doll.
you know, bud, next time she gets a job like this maybe it could be as a bonbon girl.
there won't be a next time because another agent has called me from the almost artists agency.
after this commercial, she's gonna feed them diet pills for breakfast.
you know, those diet pills saved us a fortune in school lunches.
yeah, someday the girl will get married, the boy will move out.
peg won't be able to mak e it up the stairs if i loosen a few floorboards.
but until then, we'll continue listening to the ticking of the clock and counting ourwrinkles.
this is linda lapa and the "makeup" crew wishing you an excellent evening.
an italian, an american and a portuguese are on an island. ...
a genie pops out of a bottle, and says "you've got three wishes."
and me, i hearthe unbearable alarm of my clock, and the only wish i can think of, is for a second life for one of my friends, who's going to die.
this is linda lapa and the "makeup" and the "makeup" crew wishing you an excellent evening.

people of my kind... we don't know whether we can survive tomorrow
we risk our lives to make a living, a woman of us will be a burden
grandma, why should i tie a red thread when seeing the boy for the first time?
when i saw your grandpa for the first time, my sisters told me, if you tie the red thread tight just for once, the love of you two will grow
tam see and yang shuang will meet at ching lien court tonight, for what happen in club spring last night
the commissioner said, he will kill tam by this chance, get ready now

boys were tried to be integrated into the society already in 70's
now they are in the ministry of labour's job training experiment
the previous place, ponso's sawmill, burnt - and the owners got nothing from their insurance
i am sure that we will never get out of here

i'm able to get together the whole sum - in just a few days
i would like to continue a journey with a good beginning
(song: dark eyes, brown hair, one time i get to lapse...)
listen hey, i would like to stay very much - but highway is hot.

last night, a masked gunman broke into a house in a remote coastal area... and shot to death, in front of his family... a man believed to be a republican sympathizer.
this is the latest in the new outbreak of killings... following the breakdown of peace talks... between unionists and nationalists.
while the ira denounced the attack as an unlawful and murderous operation... the army put full responsibility on the ira and said it had no choice... but to respond to the latest outbursts of violence.
although both sides said that this only made the search for peace more urgent... authorities say the casualties sustained... cast further doubts on the future on any peace initiatives.

i'd be embarrassed to show maestro leonardo something like this, but... i get a great deal of pleasure in working the clay... in creating something.
but why here, in this simulation among these archaic objects and this disorganized environment?
frankly, it's refreshing to take myself out of the 24th century every now and then.
and a little disorganization can be very encouraging to the imagination.
while in our space, your vessel will not exceed warp 3 and your weapon systems will remain off- line.
you will avoid unnecessary scans and you will not conduct surveys of any kind.
then you proceed to unleash some sort of rogue borg and now you want us to help you get it back.
i apologize for what's happened here, but we certainly didn't "unleash" anyone.
we can resolve this situation quickly, gentlemen, if we work together.
captain janeway, after what i've seen here, i question your competence.
i've assembled a team to analyze every square meter of the cargo bay.
this has essentially been her quarters for the past two months.
this graphic represents the matter conversion data from seven of nine's last transport.
if you'll notice, there's a high concentration of borg organelles in the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue.
the dormant nanoprobes in seven of nine's cells have reasserted themselves.
taken over blood cell production, and they're growing new borg implants.
the doctor's genetic resequencer should keep her sedated until you get back to the ship.
once you've penetrated the perimeter, there will be no further communication with voyager.
no offense, but you don't stand a chance if she decides to put up a fight.
it's my hope that the element of surprise will work in my favor.
she describes her daily routines the number of hours spent regenerating, that sort of thing.
there were some personal log entries, mostly observations about the crew's behavior.
i mean you can't concern yourself with making a mistake, or whether the image you had in your mind is what's taking form in front of you.
you just have to let your hands-- and the clay-- do the work.
it helps my own efficiency to forget about voyager for awhile.

it's a way of exploring aspects of yourself that probably didn't fit into your life as a borg-- imagination... creativity... fantasy... i am uncertain why these things are necessary.
well, they aren't necessary, seven, but they're an important part of one's life because imagination frees the mind, it inspires ideas and solutions and it can provide a great deal of pleasure.

i'm determined to find something here that might shed some light on seven of nine's actions.
even if seven did want to stay on voyager, her borg nature may have won out.
we can remove implant after implant, but maybe at her core, she'll always be part of the collective.
we've found no evidence of borg ships, so she can't be trying to rejoin the collective.

for the boss' sake, for rie's sake... and for my own sake, too.
but why did the boss keep me in the dark about all of this?
i want to stop time because i know that if you keep on going, then you're gonna get to the bad part.
but i know that if we stop time, then we're gonna be together for the rest of our lives.
i wanted to be the last one to kiss you before i kiss you again.
cory, honey, i know how hard this must seem right now, but sometimes we have to believe that things happen for a reason and that life works out for the best.
for as long as i've known you, whenever you've been faced with adversity, you have always risen to the occasion.
now, i have no reason to believe that you won't again.
i believe that you and miss lawrence have something that you won't allow yourselves to lose.
and if you search your heart and listen to its instruction, you won't go wrong.
look, i know we'll struggle at first, but all couples struggle at first.
but i figure we get a couple of part-time jobs, cut back on expenses and find an abandoned home in an upscale neighborhood.
drove there, met a couple of girls, told them i drove all the way from philly, they called me a moron and here i am.
look, i was gonna go out, i don't know, get a pizza, rent some movies.
i just cannot believe that they moved us to this lousy table.
yeah, i can see the ice in the urinals, for crying out loud.
sally, why don't you show them how many little debbies you can shove into your mouth at one time?
oh, yeah, why don't you let 'em take a picture of you in the kitchen, burning our dinner?
uh, tommy, maybe we should get out of here and maybe go grab a rusty burger or something.
oh, well, i thought you didn't want to be seen with me 'cause sally was so famous.
come with me to old downtown rutherford, where you will be seen with her in a crowded restaurant.
she then gets to pummel you and become a media sweetheart.

honey, what i was saying was i'm not just a working stiff anymore,

"the best laid schemes of mice and men most often go astray."
that was written by mr. robert burns way the fuck back in 1 785 and it still is news.
in oz, we got all sorts of schemes to change our lousy, lonely lives.
but no matter how much we plot and plan, something outside our control always comes along and fucks things up.
he was working on a way to bring the brothers together, to fight the injustices we endure in the name of justice.
he was working it and working it, till a heart attack worked him over.
so i guess i'm gonna have to keep my fist clenched

that's when i move in i throw that silly ho in a headlock i muffle her grill so her screams stop i whisper to her, "your man ain't here to protect you, baby"

i toss her in the back seat i cover her head with a black sheet
put the still to her grill piece be like, "lf you don't shut up, i'm gonna lit two shots off ln your dome piece"
i take her to my hideout in the low-income houses down the street i replace her joan and davids with purple reeboks on her feet i give her four hungry kids, no job, no ambition
no family support and a last welfare check i give her crappy-ass medicaid and an ill type of growth
growing out the side of her neck i tell her, "fend for yourself, keep you and them shorties in proper health"
then after sufficient time on that hype, i'll introduce her to the crack pipe
i ask the question in the hope that you, the press, can find out.
because we prisoners of oz, i believe, will sit here waiting for answers that never come.
the fbi investigation into the deaths at oswald state penitentiary is ongoing.
we're not about to rush it just to satisfy the media or the inmates.
don't you be smug with me, you son of a bitch.
from the first day you got here, you have tried to destroy everything that i built and everything that i stand for.
we will stand up, look in the mirror, and say, like solomon:
i am black, but i am comely, o ye daughters of jerusalem.
groves, you have been condemned to die for the murder of officer smith.
the state gives you the right to choose any method you wish to die.
but knowing lawrence, i don't think that he would want his death to bring about more pain, more suffering.
i think that he would want his death to bring about peace.
it is with enormous sadness and respect that i present to loretta smith the fleishman medal of honour in memory of her son,
officer lawrence smith, who died in the service of this great state.
i wanna thank you gentlemen for volunteering to serve on the firing squad.
since we announced to the press that groves chose this method, we've been swamped with phone calls from sharpshooters all over the country wanting to sign up.
now, many people will tell you that firing squads are barbaric.
but in fact, it's a lot more humane than the electric chair.
in any case, the protocol for a successful execution is proper lighting, proper distance.
but you must prepare yourself for the emotional burden of actually pulling the trigger.
if you listen to the poets, they'll tell you that a big bad event in someone's life changes them.
if you lose the woman you love or your legs, you suddenly find a kind of beauty inside yourself.
turned me into jolly fucking roger, only i'm not feeling real jolly right now.
well, dr. nathan says that there's a chance they can still save your eye.
you eggheads think the world really is the way you see it.
and then when you finally figure out that it's not, that you weren't even close, then you get a little bitter.
that was written by mr. robert burns way the fuck back in 1 785 and it still is news.
in oz, we got all sorts of schemes to change our lousy, lonely lives.
six months ago, if you'd asked him where he planned to be today, he'd have said at his daughter's 4th birthday party.
instead, he's howling at the moon thanks to some bad angel dust.
black muslim leader kareem said remains in critical condition at oswald state penitentiary after a heart attack last thursday.

so i guess i'm gonna have to keep my fist clenched
walk around d. c. in the rain till my wares is drenched
i take her to my hideout in the low-income houses down the street
i replace her joan and davids with purple reeboks on her feet
i tell her, "fend for yourself, keep you and them shorties in proper health"

only maybe i didn't kill him, because they put blanks in one of the rifles so maybe-
- i mean, i can never know for sure if i killed him or not.
could it have to do with teaching biology as opposed to, say, latin?
oh, if i were teaching latin, they'd be looking up the dirty words.
and the only reason you're playing is 'cause i passed your finals for you last year.
are you going to hold that over my head forever or what?
you're a human copy machine... duplicating the ideas and thoughts of the nearest reproducing mammal.
now, i accept the fact that you have no individuality... but is it too much to ask for you to bring your own book?
you are superior... to all of these pathetic slackers around you.
but remember, the nobles are only pretending... to buy into caesar's colossal ego.
so, we've got basketball practice after school, and we'll be in the gym.
but all you do is go to mr. griffin's when he's getting ready to leave and ask to talk a minute.
but you got to keep him there till at least 5:30.
then we'll grab him by his car in the parking lot.
he didn't just walk through the motions, and he didn't want us to do that either.
not many people really understood mr. griffin... and i'm not sure i did either... but i think what he wanted was for us to feel something... connect with the world... not just wander through it... consuming.
mrs. griffin was one of my favorite teachers... and i can't believe i lied to her today.
i stood there and tried to make her think that her husband was cheating on her.
a week from today, he's going to be student body president... and my boy has got the world by its tail.
it's bad luck to brag until you close the deal, dad.
as long as i know how to love i know i'll be alive
i've got all my life to live i got all my love to give
crichton police are dragging unity lake... in an effort to find john griffin's vehicle.
at present, there are no suspects... although police have a witness who says they saw the car in question... heading up to the lake on wednesday.
[mr. bontley clears throat] counseling is available all day... for those students who need help dealing with their grief.
mr. griffin was a dedicated teacher who believed in the process of education.
so we must continue about our business, i suppose, difficult as it is.
let me introduce our first candidate for student body president, mark kinney.
i want to be your student body president because i get you.
i know what you want, and i can get us there.
she's been real paranoid lately... and if she thinks i asked you to come here early...
i'll get her in the den, you sneak out and come back in with dave.
so i just kept telling myself that nothing bad would happen.
but you can't negotiate good and bad... or right and wrong.
bernice is going to reveal her secret today, and, well, when duckman finds out...
it'll make bosnia look like a foot rub from perry como.

but i also saw how strong she is and how brave and how much she believes in me.
i know none of you think the wedding coordinator matters but i'm telling you, it does!
a successful affair has got to have a concept-- an overriding theme-- the ties, the decor the food, the clothes, the entire experience into a cohesive whole.
i've been looking for this kind of love ever since beatrice died.
this is my chance to be happy and you're not going to take that away!
would you tell them that i just dropped by to steal a peek at little andy?
my wife would kill me if i came all the way from denver and didn't say hello.
maybe you and your boys can handle traffic out on the street.
a lot of people are gonna be concerned about this one when they hear about it, buck.
if this killer turns up in my jurisdiction, don't expect a courtesy call.
if he's in your jurisdiction, jack, he's safe as a church-mouse.
but after a while, you know, your tastes change, you get tired of looking at the same old faces and all.
when i ran out of room to put up new ones, i had to sell her.
these days, you can't be too careful who you let in your car.
you know, if you'd just let me out at this place we're coming up on, that'd be great.
look, i'm not calling your friend or anyone else a liar.
all i'm saying is i wouldn't have done that to anybody.
he said we're leading mcginnis 2 to 1 out his way.
did you end up calling in the fed boys on those motel killings?
well, buck, come to see how a real operation is done?
i declare, jack, you must have calluses from patting yourself on the back so much.
2 assaults with a knife, armed robbery, conviction of second-degree murder in oklahoma, and now caught in possession of a murder victim's wallet and car.
all you've got on him is possession of a stolen vehicle.
he didn't know about the wallet till i showed it to him.
i bet he didn't even know there was a body in the car.
well, i have my problems with jack myself, but, you know, there for a brief moment,
i found myself thinking he was making a lot more sense than you.
you've got the nerve, doc, and i've seen it up close.
if you really were a quitter, you would have stood around like the rest of us.
we're going to pull the last 24 hours and cross-check that with stolen vehicles.
well, frank, it looks like you may have just gotten your first big break.
now, i know you don't give a tinker's damn about that, but i've been working hard in this office for 15 years, and if jack mcginnis wins,
buck olmstead ain't the only one who's gonna lose out around here.
you know, a storm like this can drop 11/2 to 2 feet in these passes.
somebody's got to clear 'em up so the freight can get through.
suspect in custody in connection with the shooting in a local apartment complex early this morning.
sources close to the investigation say the suspect may have some connection with the 2 brutal murders at a local motel and a third body discovered at the apartment complex.
well, at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
thanks... but i'd better hit the road while i got the chance.
well, i guess we can just consider this my last official act.
colorado state patrol says they've got roadblocks set up in a 200-mile radius.
we still got roadblocks up on routes 10, 160, and out on 350.
if he wanted to get out of this valley, he'd have to pass through one of them.
frigid temperatures continue to blow in from the northwest, and it looks like we won't even reach the 32-degree mark until sometime this weekend.
at cherry creek dodge, we've been steering you right with great deals for 16 years.
i knew it wasn't on the up and up because of the price.
what did you expect me to do, ask him for a receipt?
in amarillo today, police officials have announced that the key suspect has been booked for the murders of 3 people there friday.
amarillo city police chief jack mcginnis praised investigators for the arrest of hector saldez.
mr. saldez has been wanted in new mexico and oklahoma on assault charges.
now, both of these states have waived extradition so that we may proceed with the prosecution.
would you tell them that i just dropped by to steal a peek at little andy?

all i'm saying is i wouldn't have done that to anybody.
he said we're leading mcginnis 2 to 1 out his way.
did you end up calling in the fed boys on those motel killings?
i know this killer, sheriff, and when he kills, he moves fast, and the only chance you have of catching him is to find out what he's driving or to be incredibly lucky.
do you mind if i call you by your first name, frank?
well, buck, come to see how a real operation is done?
i declare, jack, you must have calluses from patting yourself on the back so much.
all you've got on him is possession of a stolen vehicle.
he didn't know about the wallet till i showed it to him.
i have the suspect in custody, and as soon as i get the green light from the d.a.,
i'm going to announce that saldez is being charged with the murders of those 3 people.
first of all, i've seen a hell of a lot more murders than he has, and these just don't seem to fit that man he's got in lockup.
secondly... maybe you haven't noticed, but chief mcginnis and i are engaged in an election battle for my office which he desperately wants, and which i...
you've got the nerve, doc, and i've seen it up close.
if you really were a quitter, you would have stood around like the rest of us.
we're going to pull the last 24 hours and cross-check that with stolen vehicles.

buck olmstead ain't the only one who's gonna lose out around here.
right now, the only thing that you'd better deal with is keeping that man in your sight till i get there.
now, if that's too much to ask i can have a u.s. marshal in your office in 5 minutes who can handle that kind of responsibility.
outside of boston, we had roadblocks set up within 20 minutes of a murder there, and he slipped through them.
everybody felt it was just a matter of time before we nailed that guy.
2 weeks later, they found this man at a motel in wisconsin.
his prints matched those found on my door, and with his body, we found detailed notes about the victims.
oh, well, he calls and tells me he can't make it in.
i told him, even braddock's across the street is closed, but does he tell me to lock up and go home before i get stuck?
well, at least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
thanks... but i'd better hit the road while i got the chance.
don't even think about trying to pull some local strings here, sheriff.
i consider what you did to be a serious obstruction of justice, and i'm gonna make sure you remember this stay.
at cherry creek dodge, we've been steering you right with great deals for 16 years.
now we've put special anniversary sale prices on every car, truck, and van...
i got off a train and bought it off a fella for 500 bucks!
i knew it wasn't on the up and up because of the price.
in amarillo today, police officials have announced that the key suspect has been booked for the murders of 3 people there friday.
amarillo city police chief jack mcginnis praised investigators for the arrest of hector saldez.
we're pulling the 4 hours surrounding the time of the murders.
buck, we don't know if he even came in here... or who we're looking for.
a lot of people are gonna be concerned about this one when they hear about it, buck.
if this killer turns up in my jurisdiction, don't expect a courtesy call.
uh, i need to get a little further up the road before dark.
well, just don't get stuck out here if this storm hits.
when i ran out of room to put up new ones, i had to sell her.
man, i had a heck of a time trying to get rid of her.
well, buck, come to see how a real operation is done?

i want to thank the combined efforts of the city police and forensic departments for the arrest of this killer.

chief, do these murders have anything to do with the murder in colorado yesterday?
most guys who ask me on a date are usually trying to get me into bed.
that must be really terrible for a girl when that happens.
and the more i like a girl, the more nervous i get.
and if you go now and something happens to you, then i'd blame myself for the rest of my life because i'd blown my chance to help.
the moment i saw you on the tower, i was so moved by your sadness.
i swore to myself i would try to help, whatever it takes.
it only keeps alive the weak, the stupid, the lazy, who breed and multiply, weakening the human race.
all my men, i have chosen... for their loyalty, their dedication to the coming age.
even the hearts my mother smuggled from the hospital were from the dead.
two months ago, he was sure he had discovered... a serum to suppress my lycanthropic cycle.
every man on the planet... must take every opportunity to show his gratitude.

you think the federation would mind if we turned it into an extra large asteroid belt?
wish i could help, but i've got a crisis of my own.
i just scarfed down a handful of klingon souvlaki and i got to run to the little commander's room to give new meaning to the term "captain's log"
simply ask for anything of a pleasurable nature and it's our pleasure.
kids, you can stuff the prime directive where the solar system don't shine.
as your commanding officer-- and for purposes of emmy consideration lead actor in a prime-time animated series, thank you--
i order you to blow bozo the clone here to kingdom crumbs, then start blasting the hell out of everyone else you can.
i am the real duckman, but i insist you not shoot the impostor.
he's still one of god's creatures and we must treat him with respect, considerat... (death ray zapping)
for decades, my people have observed you primitives, battling each other across the vast expanse of the galaxy and, frankly, we're sick of it.
plus, i got khan at 20 to one, so i stand to make a mint.
very well, khan... you force me to resort to an ancient technique-- the wedgie!
now, while you're busy pulling your underoos out of your colon,
some common quartz... powdered manganese... a little crushed basil... one whole egg... half a cup of baking soda... some k-y jelly... and a quart of brake fluid... shake, don't stir...
so, duckman... how sweet it will be to end this centuries-old conflict.
yes-- he is evil and i am good, but... goodness calls for something we... primitive humans are quite familiar with-- compassion.
the compassion to spare his life, because it is the just thing, the good thing, the human thing to do.
to the pleasures of the eyes contemplating the plastic beauties of the island,
and the pleasure of hearing, rocked by the soft murmur of the fugitive lymph.
miramar, it's interesting to observe that in this verse there's not a single comma interrupting the fluency of the verses, accompanying the ambience of serenity and paradise that the poet so calmly debouched.
well, miramar, this little lesson helps realize that we are never good critics of ourselves.
the sun, the moon and the stars will continue their unperturbed gravitation in the sky.
the world agonizes and bears in it, readable, the sign of its destruction.
we're not exactly living up to your expectations of us, are we?
you see, teal'c, we've been living alone in our little corner of the galaxy for awhile and
i think the people i work for, just need to get to know you a little better.
i mean your knowledge of the goa'uld alone makes them a little curious.
on those worlds the people are abandoned and left to fend for themselves.
is there a leadership or government with which we could negotiate a peace?
i know that many of you have served with major kawalsky... so please forgive me if what i am about to suggest appears in any way callous.
but i believe surgical removal of the parasite may be a mistake.
general, this is a waste of time kawalsky does not have.
dr warner, what are major kawalsky's chances of surviving this procedure?
with respect general, i feel i should take this to my superiors.
me, i'll probably just call the president and get approval right from the horse's mouth.
listen, in case the colonel can't talk him out of it,
i'd like a minute alone with teal'c before they ship him out.
hopefully, that will make the goa'uld think twice before attacking earth in the future.
but we don't know if we're gonna be able to ever use those weapons again.
that cargo ship was modified using the knowledge of the ancients.
there is no guarantee that anyone will ever be able to figure out how it was done.
based on how long it took the ship to get from taonas to earth,
i'm estimating our trip to othala will take roughly ten days.
and if it does, it may well burn out the engines.
the ship was never meant to fly at that speed, so if we don't find the asgard, we'll be stranded.
it's just, as you know, it's not easy saying goodbye to someone you care about when you think there's a chance you may never see them again.
i know that's a risk we take every time we step through the stargate, but...
we should get them to meet us at a neutral location, a planet of our choosing.
send a team, check them out, make sure they're unarmed, then escort them back.
now that anubis has gone, you think the balance of power has shifted back to yu.
on the bright side, yu has been the most cooperative in the past.
i must wait here until i am certain the replicators have been destroyed.
you may have noticed hala's sun has collapsed into a black hole.
baal got there first and programmed the soldiers to serve him.
with those orak at his command, baal has tipped the balance of power in his favour.
we could not help but notice that the asgard did not come to your aid when anubis threatened your planet.
in fact, we've heard nothing from the asgard for quite some time now.
he is convinced that the asgard can no longer exercise power in this galaxy.
he intends to take the planets protected under the goa'uld-asgard treaty.
we won't fight your battles for you in exchange for a few hyperdrive engines that may or may not do us any good in the long run.
and especially since we already have that technology at our disposal.
we are too late to stop them from reaching the new asgard home world.
i guess you did learn something from your father's poker games.
either way, we may actually have to use that weapon again to defend this planet.
we don't know if there's enough power to fire a shot.
the ships can destroy the replicators before they raise their shields?
they will only be defenceless for a few moments, but if my calculations are accurate, that should be sufficient.
i regret to report that the debris from the replicator ship could not be contained.
we were unable to prevent replicator blocks from raining down on orilla.
when orilla was finally found, we were able to place those minds into cloned bodies so that we could build our new colony.
the replicators have already infected systems needed to save those minds.
you cannot begin to comprehend the extent of what was unfolding in o'neill's mind.
our scientists long ago extracted parts of the ancient library of knowledge and learned much from it.
anubis was overconfident and needed most of his armada to keep the system lords at bay.
the fleet he used to attack earth was small compared to baal's fleet, should he defeat the system lords.
it seems we haven't had much success interrogating goa'ulds in the past.
it was made apparent to me you're more useful to us fighting baal.
why do you think i hated you so much for what you did to me?
from the first moment we met, when you let me inside your mind...
if we can use this one to tap into their network, we will be able to see what any of the replicators can see.
and if he wakes up, is this pod gonna hold him?
i would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
no matter what you feel for me, i will never love you back.
reports from the colony say all remaining replicators have been neutralised.
while the ship did escape, at least we have an effective means of fighting them now.
the president has asked me to supervise the research at the ancient outpost.
it'll be a delicate situation, given all the international claims already being made.
if baal is about to dominate the system lords, we face a formidable challenge.
(sam) plus, who knows where and when the replicators will turn up?
i will remember every one of you, and i thank you all for your hard work.
i'm not one for long goodbyes, so, without further ado, it is with great pleasure i introduce you to your new commanding officer,
i wish i could say i didn't owe anything to anyone.
but the truth is, i wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for the courage and support of each and every one of you.
the other reason i took this job was so i could do really cool stuff like this.
it is with great pride that my first order of business as commander of this base is the announcement of the promotion of major samantha carter to lieutenant colonel.
the president of the united states has placed special trust and confidence in the patriotism, integrity, and abilities of major samantha carter.
major samantha carter is promoted to the grade of lieutenant colonel, united states air force.
we're not exactly living up to your expectations of us, are we?
you see, teal'c, we've been living alone in our little corner of the galaxy for awhile and
i think the people i work for, just need to get to know you a little better.
i mean your knowledge of the goa'uld alone makes them a little curious.
on those worlds the people are abandoned and left to fend for themselves.
is there a leadership or government with which we could negotiate a peace?
but i believe surgical removal of the parasite may be a mistake.
general, this is a waste of time kawalsky does not have.
what if we just faced up to the fact that major kawalsky's slim chances of survival and realise that the greatest enemy mankind may ever face has just been delivered right to our doorstep.
even if we let it return through the stargate as a gesture of good faith.
with respect general, i feel i should take this to my superiors.
me, i'll probably just call the president and get approval right from the horse's mouth.
listen, in case the colonel can't talk him out of it,
i'd like a minute alone with teal'c before they ship him out.
oh anytime sir, you just come on down, we'd be glad to have you.
well hell sir, he's right here, why don't you tell him yourself.
once they realize our gate's impenetrable, they should just give up.
part of me just wants to let 'em through; give 'em the fight they're lookin' for.
i'd like to know the answers to those questions too, sir.
but after they're done asking them-- there's gonna be more questions.
we're not exactly living up to your expectations of us, are we ?
see, teal'c, we've been living alone in our little corner of the galaxy... for quite a while, and i think... the people i work for just need to get to know you a little better.
in that moment, i learned everything i needed to know to trust you.
if i had killed you then, i would not be here now.
have a lot of questions to ask, so if there are no objections ?
what can you tell us about the power source the goa'ulds use... to power their weapons, ships ?
but there are many more worlds that the goa'ulds have no use for.
on those worlds, the people are abandoned, and left to fend for themselves.
is there a leadership or government with which we could negotiate a peace ?
some, like apophis, are great kings, and rule over many worlds as their gods.
if you will leave this man's body, we will allow you to live, and send you back... through the stargate in your natural fo-- this body is mine !
if you're unwilling to leave, we will be forced to surgically--
general, this is a waste of time kawalsky does not have.
doctor warner, what are major kawalsky's chances of surviving the procedure ?
- as long as there is a snowball's chance in hell... that my officer will come out of this procedure alive, we'll go ahead with it.
with respect, general, i feel i should take this to my superiors.
- unfortunately, teal'c... is now carrying the only living goa'uld available for study.
and we do need to study it, sir, make no mistake on that.
well there have got to be worse ways to go, i suppose.
you don't think the goa'uld's are sending people through, do you?
you see, teal'c, we've been living alone in our little corner of the galaxy for awhile and
i think the people i work for, just need to get to know you a little better.
i'm just not sure that's ever going to be enough for them to trust you.
to be honest with you, i think they're scared of you.
i have a lot of questions to ask so if there are no objections....
what can you tell us about the power source the goa'uld use to power their weapons, ships?
i told teal'c how we all respect a persons rights in this country.
i assure you, there is nothing untoward taking place here, colonel.
but there are many more worlds the goa'ulds have no use for.
on those worlds the people are abandoned and left to fend for themselves.
is there a leadership or government with which we could negotiate a peace?

these aliens are possibly the greatest threat this country has ever known.

well hell sir, he's right here, why don't you tell him yourself.

dr. warner, what are major kawalsky's chances of surviving the procedure?
what if we faced up to the fact of major kawalsky's slim chances of survival and realised that the greatest enemy mankind may ever face has just been delivered right to our doorstep?
even if we let it return through the stargate as a gesture of good faith...
but the scale of anubis' attack makes covering it up tenuous at best.
to keep the world from finding out all about the stargate, we need the full cooperation of every government aware of what's going on.
o'neill used his knowledge to modify the goa'uld vessel in our possession.
according to your report, that ship is capable of flying faster and farther
o'neill fended off anubis' fleet using the weapons from the ancient outpost.
hopefully, that will make the goa'uld think twice before attacking earth in the future.
but we don't know if we're gonna be able to ever use those weapons again.
if we can't, we're gonna need a new tactical advantage over the goa'uld.
there is no guarantee that anyone will ever be able to figure out how it was done.
and as the most likely person on the planet to figure it out, are you saying if i don't let you attempt to contact the asgard, you won't even try?
even with the modifications, there's no guarantee it'll get us there.
and if it does, it may well burn out the engines.
i'll see if i can get a little more out of the sublight engines.
the president has authorised me to pursue negotiations with the goa'uld.
he fell out of favour when the other lords accepted anubis back and he used his power to become the leader.
now that anubis has gone, you think the balance of power has shifted back to yu.
as you said, he is being preserved in stasis at the moment.
i will be glad to return with you to earth when my mission here is completed.
but a number of replicators have managed to come together in a coherent mass that has yet to pass the event horizon.
even if they withstand the force without being torn apart, there's no way...
baal got there first and programmed the soldiers to serve him.
with those orak at his command, baal has tipped the balance of power in his favour.
he intends to take the planets protected under the goa'uld-asgard treaty.
if you do not help us stop him, millions of humans will die.
- before you destroyed them, the replicators managed to access the ship's computer.
they learned the location of orilla, where we are trying to rebuild our civilisation.
my job has usually been to get people to recognise the truth.
if they get a hint that we can't use the ancient weapons for defence, trust me, this game is over.
we appreciate this information, but it doesn't change the fact that we can't get involved in any internal goa'uld dispute.
if baal tries to attack any of the protected planets, he'll suffer the consequences.
your offer is very generous, but i'm afraid we're gonna have to decline.
you would be able to uphold the treaty with or without the aid of the asgard.
i think the real question is, how many ships do you have?
to enforce this treaty ourselves, we need to build enough ships to match any fleet that would oppose us.
if you try to revive jack without the asgard, it'll kill him.
in fact, he'll probably die before he can do anything to help us.
i regret to report that the debris from the replicator ship could not be contained.
we were unable to prevent replicator blocks from raining down on orilla.

it seems we haven't had much success interrogating goa'ulds in the past.
it was made apparent to me you're more useful to us fighting baal.
those infesting the colony are behaving in an organised fashion, unlike any replicators we have encountered before.
perhaps they are controlled by a human-form leader, who has yet to reveal itself.
why do you think i hated you so much for what you did to me?
from the first moment we met, when you let me inside your mind...
i would rather be dead than be trapped like this forever.
no matter what you feel for me, i will never love you back.

now, this can do what, andy, about a billion operations per second?
now, what do you need a stolen prototype computer like this for?
you're not going anywhere, and neither am i, so why don't we just end this here before it gets real ugly?
drop the gun, put your hands in the air very slowly.
you expect us to believe somebody broke in here, left your tv and your stereo but stole a piece of plastic, huh?
yeah, well, that little piece of plastic could get somebody close to a lot of valuables.
yeah, well, your lack of sprinkler system is a violation of city fire codes, too.
now, you see, we're not here on a police matter, and fire and health regulations are not protected by diplomatic immunity.
we have reason to believe that your government is the target of a robbery attempt.
we think they're after a big shipment of gold or silver.
if you ever want to see her again, shut your mouth.
now, once we've patched into the security circuits, you'll be able to override the entire system using the source code you rewrote.
man, just one of these things could pay for my son's college education.
yeah, but then some poor bastard in singapore wouldn't have his commemorative coin.

the results from your equivalency test were passed along to me.
kids... it seems we have somewhat of a prodigy on our hands.
oh, i've been waiting on that stupid planet for you guys to call me forever!
amphibitor will place this device on earth to close the wormhole.
zordon said someone would take his place but we didn't know what to expect.
would you be surprised to learn that there are many unexpected events in your future, rangers?
i want to see y'all down at my club... the gold tooth... the place to be on saturday night with dr. d.
coming up next, we're going to give you... the 411 from mtv vj idalis, so stay where you're at.
hey, georgia, this is idalis from mtv... with a hot tip from you southern gals.
heavy d is looking for one special girl who can dance... has a great spirit, and loves to travel... to be the video dance girl of the world for his new video.
i am a dancer, and i'll be dancin' my butt off... for some $10,000.
now, if i get this job, mick... we're going to have more than enough money... for the salon and the restaurant.
ali, i guess i'm tired... of hearing about all your pipe dreams.
if you really cared about me... you would get rid of that tired perm...
uh, uh, that was good... but you might want to go on home now 'cause i'm here.
no, stay, 'cause we're going to need a few extras in the video.
you can just relax, you know, freshen up a little bit.
just make yourself at home, then we'll meet again shortly... to go over the terms of your contract.
i can't tell you how happy i am to have you in my home.
the first years of my life were touched by the magic of lily.
i ain't used pork since thelma was on good times... about to marry ebay the african prince, 'cause he didn't eat pork in his food and i said no, no, no.
i'm waiting on my african prince... to be my baby's daddy, so i stopped using pork... because i started using chicken broth.
ladies, i want you to continue to cook... whatever you think is going to make my uncle happy.
and if there's anything else you need from the store... well, i'm sure that manley will be more than delighted to go get it for you.
i guess once he got the photos he needed... this girls were no longer of any value to him.
he claims you befriended two girls from the ghetto... after you caught them trying to break into your home.
i want to see y'all down at my club... the gold tooth... the place to be on saturday night with dr. d.
coming up next, we're going to give you... the 411 from mtv vj ldalis, so stay where you're at.
hey, georgia, this is ldalis from mtv... with a hot tip for you southern gals.
heavy d is looking for one special girl who can dance... has a great spirit, and loves to travel... to be the video dance girl of the world... for his new video.
i am a dancer, and i'll be dancin' my butt off... for some $10,000.

ali, i guess i'm tired... of hearing about all your pipe dreams.
if you really cared about me... you would get rid of that tired perm...
shoot, you said you wanted these pompoms, so you got 'em.
girl, we need to move on... and we need to get us some new jobs.
can't you see i'm trying to read up on our manners?
i know, but we're going to need more than manners... 'cause right here it says... that the rich and famous people... hang out at the polo lounge.
uh, uh, that was good... but you might want to go on home now... 'cause i'm here.
no, stay, 'cause we're going to need... a few extras in the video.
come on, let's just find a hotel... so we can get out of here in the morning.
where are we going to find a taxi around here anyway?
you can just relax, you know, freshen up a little bit.
just make yourself at home, then we'll meet again shortly... to go over the terms of your contract.
they got to feel like they got a choice... in everything they do.
now, that one right there... look like it's for number one...
you know how much your grandmother loved him... so, you show up here... out of the goodness of your heart.
you just do anything and everything that you can... to make sure that his final days... are filled with-- with kindness and love.
i know you think he's just hired help... but it's all an act.
well, if he's so rich... why did he have to come all the way to america... to find his wife?
i guess once he got the photos he needed... the girls were no longer of any value to him.
he claims you befriended two girls from the ghetto... after you caught them trying to break into your home.
why--why should you have to wear your sunday clothes... on--on wednesday?
now, look, girl... don't think--don't think the brother a punk... because he crying like a little girl, but...
i wish i had good news for you but i don't think he's going to make it.
dimitria, i don't know how to say how sorry we are.
my parents went on a cruise to barbados, but i told them, no, i wanted to spend christmas with cory.
hey, why don't we toast topanga's first matthews christmas with some of my special eggnog?
it's just that cider on christmas is, like, my family's one tradition.
well, that and we go to our favorite evergreen tree farm.
this is about the power struggle between men and women since the creation of man over 300 years ago.
wait till you guys see what i have to put on top of that tree.
you're right, you know, we're two different people, and we're not gonna change that.
boy, you're with somebody for 32 years, you think you know them.
you know, i was gonna give her this ring, shawn, you know?
i was gonna give her this ring that meant that we're gonna be together forever.
what kind of human being puts grapefruit juice in orange juice?
cory, i am but a simple idiot, but the one thing i do know is that you and topanga are just like grapefruit juice and orange juice.
i'm sorry that my family's traditions are different than your family's.
i'll just be waiting for you back at your house whenever you want to come home.
perhaps he never ran out of the house like a coward.
perhaps he realized that the spirit of love brings compromise, that when two people grow together, they start their own traditions.
and the next year, maybe we can have it my way.
and the year after, we can have a combination of both of our ways, with the emphasis on your way.
i lured pokémon trainers to my island fortress to create a powerful new breed of pokémon and wreak vengeance on humans.
i seized their pokémon and cloned them, as i had been cloned from mew.
now i am forgotten by all but the one who created me the one whose desire to control me still burns.
these are live satellite pictures of a remote area of the johto region.
so we must live as outcasts if we are to live at all.
we shall stay here, far from the world far from man.
according to the guidebook, ''the unique geologic formations... ''...and atmospheric conditions at purity canyon... ''...create severe and unpredictable weather.
''because blizzards, thunderstorms and typhoons are likely... ''...we advise tourists to avoid this area.''
the only ones that live up there are some wild pokémon types that can thrive in the extreme conditions.
well, if there are pokémon up there, i say we go.
i said ''good morning'' 'cause even though it's after midnight if i said ''good night'' you might go to bed.
we hate to bother you, but we've been exploring and we need a place to stay.
please, let's find a quiet spot to line up and find out if we're a match.
haven't you learned by now that you shouldn't play if you can't win?
if you launch that rocket, we might never see you again.
finally, a man with intelligence, intensity and ruggedly attractive stubble cares about me passionately.
but, within the elite ranks of team rocket, i have an identity that is known to all.
my fellow agents know me as 009, domino but my adversaries know me as simply the black tulip.
it said, ''lf we don't get out of here... ''...they're gonna catch us and use us in pokémon cloning experiments.
''just because we're clones don't mean they can treat us any way they want.
here i can use my powers to protect them from harm.
but do i have the right to keep them from living as they choose?
it could be the source of a new way to bring health and happiness to the world.
we may be standing on the edge of the most important discovery in medical history.
lf, someday, you hear my voice, know that it is my spirit calling across time and space to yours.
luna called and said you might need a ride back to the city...
if so, i may finally have the dna i need to create a pokémon powerful enough to survive the cloning process.
perhaps then i can unlock the secret to restoring life itself.
maybe it makes a difference to you if you're a pokémon or a person, but not to me.
if you're in this place, i guess you must be the same as all of us are.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
well, mac, i got watchers turning' down vacation to check on ahriman.
i really think if there's anything that can kill it, we're gonna find it.
maguire still owes you $30 from that last game of poker you played, doesn't he?
and stacey rosenthal's been trying to get up the courage... to invite you to dinner for the last three years.
because he was a murderer too, you know, and a rapist-- and a defiler of your holy places.
and then one day, he became a priest, and he whitewashed his evil soul.
do you remember thousands screaming your name as you scored yet another touchdown?
do you remember what it was like to wrap your legs around a beautiful woman?
like i told you, you don't know what you're talking about.
and it would be best for you to keep what you don't know to yourself.
you send someone in there right now, or you're gonna lose the kid.
all right, look, i am a doctor, but i'm not affiliated with this hospital.
didn't you just hear me tell him it's time to go?
marcus, what happened the last time you left here with your brother?
i... what i'm saying is, maybe i'm just postponing the inevitable.
or it's the paper telling me that it's up to me to save marcus.
well, anyway, uh, what time you think you'll be done with that?
'cause, uh, i got some things i need to do, and i'm going to need your help.
i think you have a little more faith than i do.
well, uh... well, it looks like we're about to find out.
like i told you, you don't know what you're talking about.
and it would be best for you to keep what you don't know to yourself.
that's what it'll do-- wear you down and make you mean.
i remember when karim was just a good kid with a few rough edges.
listen, he just came out of a coma this morning, but he's not gonna make it.
you send someone in there right now, or you're gonna lose the kid.
for we all shared with jojo responsibility for his life-- those of us who led him down the wrong path and those of us who failed to lead him down the right, and perhaps, worst of all,
those of us who promised to illuminate his path and then failed to provide enough light.
look, it didn't even appear until after sister mary alice was driving away.
so, you're saying that sister mary alice will be responsible for marcus's death?
well, anyway, uh, what time you think you'll be done with that?
'cause, uh, i got some things i need to do, and i'm going to need your help.
i think you have a little more faith than i do.
well, uh... well, it looks like we're about to find out.
i don't know about you, but when i think about spending 70 years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache.
i get the impression a iot of the crew agrees with me--
i assure you, commander, i have made thorough preparations for the captain's safety during her away mission.
you, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as first officer.
you can be put off the ship with your superiors, or you can do what neeiix and some of your other crew members have already done, and join me.
if you do, you'ii be part of a crew that's going to do whatever it takes to get us home as fast as possible.
under my command, we won't let almighty federation principles get in the way of opportunities, the way janeway did when she destroyed the array that could've gotten us home.
and we won't be wasting precious time, stopping to investigate every insignificant anomaly that we come across.
are you in the habit of just walking in on people's private hoiodeck time?
well, it's not as if i caught you dancing the rumba with a naked boiian.
i was doing a routine purge of the database-- you know, taking out old files that were taking up space-- and i found this hoionovei.
it's a kind of "what if" story, all about a maquis mutiny.
i've got to be back on duty in less than an hour.
besides, isn't half the fun of a hoionovei having someone to talk it over with?
i assure you, commander, i have made thorough preparations for the captain's safety during her away mission.
you, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as first officer.
under the circumstances, i believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the captain has placed in you.
i appreciate your concern for my safety, mr. chakotay, but tuvok's right.
ensign, iet's shut down the transporters and start that diagnostic we've been putting off.
sir, are you sure we shouldn't wait for the captain to get back?
...he was so suspicious of my motives that he assigned me to lubricate the warp plasma manifolds.
you should've tried going along with the mutiny from the beginning.
i tried sending an encoded message to captain janeway's shuttle, to warn her about the mutiny, but chakotay caught me, phasered me, and the program reset.
next time, i'm going to pretend to go along with the conspirators, and then stage a counterstrike.
it's going to be a little difficult without warp engines, isn't it?
our warp drive may be temporarily off-iine, but our weapon systems are fully operational.
well, if that takes care of our official agenda, there's another matter i'd iike to discuss.
commander chakotay informs me there's a new hoionovei that's become quite popular among the crew.
since we're not exactly privy to every new piece of music or hoionovei that's written back home,
i think it's only natural that we should start creating our own.
by t'hain of vulcan, a character's actions must flow inexorably from his or her established traits.
well, i don't know anything about t'hain, but i do know what makes an interesting story, and that's unexpected plot twists.
he would never betray the captain the way he does in that story.
no offense, mr. vuican, but i don't think you understand my character very well.
in addition, i'm prepared to offer my expertise in the creation of holographic mise-en-scene.
computer, override the emh program's autonomous controls, and transfer him back to sick bay.
your friends will find it very difficult to get you out of here.
and the safety protocols are off, which means, if i shoot you-- and i am going to shoot you-- you'ii die.
the safest course of action is to avoid participation of any kind.
eventually, the real captain will discover our predicament, and shut down the program from the outside.
you don't want to end up like your captain, do you?
you programmed all this-- the malfunctioning phaser, a version of chakotay who's attracted to you...
according to the backup computer logs, she got into tuvok's scenario on stardate 4867 1, about a month before she left the ship.
she programmed it to cause all of these shutdowns the next time tuvok reopened the narrative parameters file, which he didn't do until today.
otherwise, tom and tuvok aren't going to make it out of there alive.
it looks like chakotay's taking them to the holographic cargo bay.
mr. neeiix, if mr. paris and i do create another work of hoiofiction,
i assure you, we will choose a subject much less close to home.
i don't know about you, but when i think about spending 70 years on the same ship with that guy, it gives me a headache.
i get the impression a iot of the crew agrees with me--
i assure you, commander, i have made thorough preparations for the captain's safety during her away mission.
you, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as first officer.
you can be put off the ship with your superiors, or you can do what neeiix and some of your other crew members have already done, and join me.
if you do, you'ii be part of a crew that's going to do whatever it takes to get us home as fast as possible.
under my command, we won't let almighty federation principles get in the way of opportunities, the way janeway did when she destroyed the array that could've gotten us home.
and we won't be wasting precious time, stopping to investigate every insignificant anomaly that we come across.
are you in the habit of just walking in on people's private hoiodeck time?
well, it's not as if i caught you dancing the rumba with a naked boiian.
i was doing a routine purge of the database-- you know, taking out old files that were taking up space-- and i found this hoionovei.
it's a kind of "what if" story, all about a maquis mutiny.
i've got to be back on duty in less than an hour.
besides, isn't half the fun of a hoionovei having someone to talk it over with?
i assure you, commander, i have made thorough preparations for the captain's safety during her away mission.
you, on the other hand, are still adapting to your duties as first officer.
under the circumstances, i believe my time will be better spent assisting you in your effort to justify the trust the captain has placed in you.
i appreciate your concern for my safety, mr. chakotay, but tuvok's right.
ensign, iet's shut down the transporters and start that diagnostic we've been putting off.
sir, are you sure we shouldn't wait for the captain to get back?
...he was so suspicious of my motives that he assigned me to lubricate the warp plasma manifolds.
you should've tried going along with the mutiny from the beginning.

i'm not going to waste my time trying to disembowel a bunch of holographic monsters.
i only came down here because you tricked me into that stupid bet.
there's nothing to indicate that any other ships have been in this area for weeks and the nearest inhabited world is over ten iight-years away.
whoever or whatever did this had to leave some kind of energy trace.
in the iast three hours, we've lost 22 of our people.
according to the nyrians, they've all shown up on their colony as though we're switching places.
i went over our navigational charts with dammar, but he's completely unfamiliar with this part of space.
for all we know, that colony could be thousands of iight-years away.
harry and i detected a surge of polaron particles right before he disappeared.
they created a spatial distortion field around him, but it collapsed as soon as he vanished.
there has been a consistent interval of nine minutes and 20 seconds between these exchanges.
at that rate, our entire crew will be gone in 18 hours.
a nyrian astrophysicist who arrived about an hour ago told me about some strange graviton fluctuations they detected at their colony.
i ran some scans on this end and found the same thing.
and if i'm right, one end is opening intermittently inside voyager
we could have passed through it while it was forming and snagged on it somehow.
the nyrians may be trying to take control of the ship.
everyone get to the bridge or main engineering and secure them against possible intruders.
the food dispensers have been programmed with selections from your own computer files.
we have even downloaded literature and entertainment from your cultural database.
um, would you be interested in trading for some of these?
the last inhabitants of this environment had no concept of a barter system, but you strike me as a much more, uh... sophisticated group.
perhaps if you stopped to analyze the root cause, you might...
if you find it so difficult to be my friend, then why keep trying?
the closest i ever came was finding the portal between our two environments.
i-i don't mean to be pessimistic, but i don't think there is a way out.
i can bring up information, but i can't understand what it says.
if the nyrians downloaded voyager's cultural database, you may be able to tap into the translation algorithm.
this transiocator is what the nyrians used to get on our ship.
then we should be able to use the same method to return to voyager
their method has the added advantage of appearing innocent, at ieast in the beginning.
i can't find the command pathways to get the system operative and i don't imagine we have much longer before they find us.
i've got the basic operation down, but i can't quite figure out how to lock on to a target.
can you access anything that might function like our targeting scanners?
we'ii find you a nice, warm habitat where you'ii be comfortable while we contact the native worlds of your prisoners and arrange for their return.
and once we've disabled your transiocator... you'ii be free to go.

i wanted everyone to wake up the next morning talking about me, howard stern.
that's the kind of thinking, though, that usually gets me into trouble.
i just realized, uh... that makes no sense what i just said.
i just told you i went there as a kid, and now the grand opening...
i'm a disc jockey who makes $250 a week, and i just want to do the right thing here on the air.
i don't want to get fired, so, uh, i guess i lied to you, but, uh, i'll never let that happen again.
i remember how embarrassing it was because nobody knew who i was.
i'm escorting this woman around, and none of these people know who i am.
it's the fifth-largest market in the united states, and they want me to start tomorrow, which is a good sign, i think.
that means they're, you know, they're really desperate for me, which i like.
would call in and tell me how bad i sucked on a regular basis.
although, i did manage to convince one of them to be my weather lady.
in a way that i gotta figure out what i'm gonna be.
i mean, i don't want to be one of these disc jockeys that runs around the country, you know, looking for work all the time.
in fact, i haven't gotten laid in a really long time.
now, give me a call here at dc 101 if you have the same kind of problem.
and the point of this whole thing is that i think a kill is a kill is a kill, and killing a kid should be just as good as killing an adult.
well, i suppose even if you're killing children, they should count them.
first of all, what kind of radio are you listening to us on?
you have a transistor radio, or you have one of those big sound systems?
i told them i wanted to talk to you off the air.
but, honey, you're in the middle of interrupting a beautiful, sexy moment.
and in a couple of months, we're gonna try to have a baby again, and everything's gonna go great.
you're gonna be totally confident that everything's going good because you know your body would reject it if it wasn't going right... you know?
i didn't want to tell you this, but i took a polaroid of the toilet.
and we can just mail them a picture of that, and they can walk around florida, you know, and say it was our grandchild, and your mother will be so happy.
and then you look at him, and he's in the formaldehyde jar.
and i said to my wife, "honey, don't be upset that howard jr.'s in a formaldehyde jar.
when he shares our most personal details of our life together with, you know, millions of listeners, it's...
i wish that there were more things that could be just ours.
let me ride herd on him, and i'll mold that son of a bitch into another don imus.
when i'm through whipping him, that boy will be asking permission to wipe his ass.
and the first thing you've gotta do is say the call letters properly, ok?
now, i'm gonna teach you how to say them, all right?
i'm very, very honored right now to introduce to all of you a very special man.
he's come all the way to our show for the first time.
i know you're very, very proud of your summer stock experience.
when you went on stage the very first time, did you ever get nervous?
when you were in the theater, did you ever work with a kielbasa?
what he did to me today was the most unprofessional and insulting experience of my life.
i have a theory that he is the one who cut the brakes on the car.
now, i could be crazy, but i figure a guy who's been married as long as prince reindeer is ready for a new wife.
jesus christ, who i love so much, more than anything in the whole world,
i am begging you, please... send a hit man to the united states of america to kill pig vomit finally.
yeah, i had everything i ever wanted in life, you know.
you know, i have to admit that i'm really not a very big fan of yours, but, in fact, i...
so occasionally i make a fool of myself in public, and the fcc wants me off the air, and every fundamentalist group in this country hates my guts, and, yeah, most of the things i do are misunderstood.
hey, after all, being misunderstood is the fate of all true geniuses, is it not?
i've been pissing off every publicist, burning every freakin' bridge in the industry,
and y-y-you'd figure howard would pay me back by putting me in his movie!
i've been in here for 8 years, cutting' his friggin' potato!
i've been smacked around by morton downey, punched in the nose by raquel welch, and what do i get?
i wanted everyone to wake up the next morning talking about me, howard stern.
that's the kind of thinking, though, that usually gets me into trouble.
to be quite honest, i didn't really want to be a programmer.
but at $250 a week, i could marry alison, and we'd get a real place together.
if i make less money, we wouldn't even be able to afford this apartment.
well, we can't really afford the apartment now, so it doesn't quite matter, really.
my parents would take me through there, and we just had a great time.
and we could walk out with tons of stuff even though my parents didn't make a lot of money.
was it the chinese guy calling in for the doobie brothers tickets?
you know when you did that ad, when you were just being yourself?
while i'm interviewing her, she actually invites me to go to a premiere for her movie.
i remember how embarrassing it was because nobody knew who i was.
that means they're, you know, they're really desperate for me, which i like.
and they say they're gonna move the building to the best part of the city, which i think is good, too...
i had, like, no listeners, and the couple of listeners i did have
would call in and tell me how bad i sucked on a regular basis.
uh, i know i shouldn't be interrupting in the middle of a song, but i got to tell you something.
i know a lot of you out there really love this music, but i just don't get it.
i was in a gook village, and i come upon a schoolhouse.
so i grab one of my grenades off my belt, and i throw it right into the schoolhouse.
i knew i was going to get in trouble if i did.
but he was really onto something, and i knew that there was something going on there... and i just went for it.
well, i've got blond hair, and i've got blue eyes, and my measurements are about 38-24-34.
some people tell me i look a lot like farrah fawcett.
hey, god, me and my wife are trying to have another baby.
a real man would have done it right the first time.
and i said to my wife, "honey, don't be upset that howard jr.'s in a formaldehyde jar.
we're gonna take him out of this office, we'll bring him home, and next week we'll bring him to the zoo in a stroller."
i wish that there were more things that could be just ours.
but i think it's right that i go crazy, you know?
howard... the way we work here at nbc... is a more professional manner than you're probably used to.
now, see, i don't care about what you did down in washington, 'cause that's chickenshit radio.
now, i'm gonna teach you how to say them, all right?
and you know, i hope you can get them, because, see, you don't have a real good voice like imus or captain frank or nothing, so we're gonna have to practice it.
you fucking waltz in here, and you think you know everything, don't you?
well, i fucking worked my fucking ass off to get to new york city, and you sure as fuck are not gonna fucking blow it for me!
i want to beat these guys, stomp them into the ground.
the only way to do that is to stay on the air.
i wouldn't even be doing bits like that if robin was with me.
i never would have even called his wife on the air if i had robin sitting there.
well, this is an exciting day for us here in the studio because we have a stage star with us.
this is donna porter with us on the show, and she's here to talk about life in the theater, and, donna, i don't know if you know this, but our own news guy ross buckingham
right now, you're getting a look at a live broadcast of the howard stern show.
that's about 13 inches, and you're licking whipped cream off a kielbasa, and you're putting it in your mouth, and you're jamming the kielbasa all the way down your throat.
ross buckingham, have you ever seen a woman swallow an entire 13-inch kielbasa?
when you were in the theater, did you ever work with a kielbasa?
mandy has agreed to actually get on the floor with me and give me a massage while she is nude.
what does a massage have to do with making it into history?
all the management at nbc... bunch of creeps, and i'm not afraid to say it right now, and, you know, it's funny, because i know you feel the same exact way i do about nbc
because you told me on the phone personally last week that you feel the same way.
i've been getting up at 5:00 every morning to work for howard.
i've been pissing off every publicist, burning every freakin' bridge in the industry,
i mean, the way they were screaming, at first i really thought i'd won them over.
i thought i was the beatles on ed sullivan or something.
by the powers vested in me by the federal communications commission,
i command you to get on the microphone in a serious manner and continue this broadcast.
i finally got up the courage to go down to the college radio station and get myself on the air.
and my name is howard stern on the howard stern experience, and if you love music, you'll love deep purple on tbu.
to be quite honest, i didn't really want to be a programmer.
but at $250 a week, i could marry alison, and we'd get a real place together.
i just realized, uh... that makes no sense what i just said.

love him or hate him, unconventional disc jockey howard stern jumped to the top of the ratings today, making him number one in greater washington.
i took a dump of a radio station and returned it to glory.
and in a couple of months, we're gonna try to have a baby again, and everything's gonna go great.
you're gonna be totally confident that everything's going good because you know your body would reject it if it wasn't going right... you know?

i just told you i went there as a kid, and now the grand opening...
i'm a disc jockey who makes $250 a week, and i just want to do the right thing here on the air.
i don't want to get fired, so, uh, i guess i lied to you, but, uh, i'll never let that happen again.
i remember how embarrassing it was because nobody knew who i was.
i'm escorting this woman around, and none of these people know who i am.
it's the fifth-largest market in the united states, and they want me to start tomorrow, which is a good sign, i think.
that means they're, you know, they're really desperate for me, which i like.
would call in and tell me how bad i sucked on a regular basis.
although, i did manage to convince one of them to be my weather lady.
in a way that i gotta figure out what i'm gonna be.
i mean, i don't want to be one of these disc jockeys that runs around the country, you know, looking for work all the time.
in fact, i haven't gotten laid in a really long time.
now, give me a call here at dc 101 if you have the same kind of problem.
and the point of this whole thing is that i think a kill is a kill is a kill, and killing a kid should be just as good as killing an adult.
well, i suppose even if you're killing children, they should count them.
first of all, what kind of radio are you listening to us on?
you have a transistor radio, or you have one of those big sound systems?
i told them i wanted to talk to you off the air.
but, honey, you're in the middle of interrupting a beautiful, sexy moment.
and in a couple of months, we're gonna try to have a baby again, and everything's gonna go great.
you're gonna be totally confident that everything's going good because you know your body would reject it if it wasn't going right... you know?
i didn't want to tell you this, but i took a polaroid of the toilet.
and we can just mail them a picture of that, and they can walk around florida, you know, and say it was our grandchild, and your mother will be so happy.
and then you look at him, and he's in the formaldehyde jar.
and i said to my wife, "honey, don't be upset that howard jr.'s in a formaldehyde jar.
when he shares our most personal details of our life together with, you know, millions of listeners, it's...
i wish that there were more things that could be just ours.
let me ride herd on him, and i'll mold that son of a bitch into another don imus.
when i'm through whipping him, that boy will be asking permission to wipe his ass.
and the first thing you've gotta do is say the call letters properly, ok?
now, i'm gonna teach you how to say them, all right?
i'm very, very honored right now to introduce to all of you a very special man.
he's come all the way to our show for the first time.
i know you're very, very proud of your summer stock experience.
when you went on stage the very first time, did you ever get nervous?
when you were in the theater, did you ever work with a kielbasa?
what he did to me today was the most unprofessional and insulting experience of my life.
i have a theory that he is the one who cut the brakes on the car.
now, i could be crazy, but i figure a guy who's been married as long as prince reindeer is ready for a new wife.
jesus christ, who i love so much, more than anything in the whole world,
i am begging you, please... send a hit man to the united states of america to kill pig vomit finally.
yeah, i had everything i ever wanted in life, you know.
you know, i have to admit that i'm really not a very big fan of yours, but, in fact, i...
so occasionally i make a fool of myself in public, and the fcc wants me off the air, and every fundamentalist group in this country hates my guts, and, yeah, most of the things i do are misunderstood.
hey, after all, being misunderstood is the fate of all true geniuses, is it not?
i've been pissing off every publicist, burning every freakin' bridge in the industry,
and y-y-you'd figure howard would pay me back by putting me in his movie!
i've been in here for 8 years, cutting' his friggin' potato!
i've been smacked around by morton downey, punched in the nose by raquel welch, and what do i get?
i wanted everyone to wake up the next morning talking about me, howard stern.
that's the kind of thinking, though, that usually gets me into trouble.
to be quite honest, i didn't really want to be a programmer.
but at $250 a week, i could marry alison, and we'd get a real place together.
if i make less money, we wouldn't even be able to afford this apartment.
well, we can't really afford the apartment now, so it doesn't quite matter, really.
my parents would take me through there, and we just had a great time.
and we could walk out with tons of stuff even though my parents didn't make a lot of money.
was it the chinese guy calling in for the doobie brothers tickets?
you know when you did that ad, when you were just being yourself?
while i'm interviewing her, she actually invites me to go to a premiere for her movie.
i remember how embarrassing it was because nobody knew who i was.
that means they're, you know, they're really desperate for me, which i like.
and they say they're gonna move the building to the best part of the city, which i think is good, too...
i had, like, no listeners, and the couple of listeners i did have
would call in and tell me how bad i sucked on a regular basis.
uh, i know i shouldn't be interrupting in the middle of a song, but i got to tell you something.
i know a lot of you out there really love this music, but i just don't get it.
i was in a gook village, and i come upon a schoolhouse.
so i grab one of my grenades off my belt, and i throw it right into the schoolhouse.
i knew i was going to get in trouble if i did.
but he was really onto something, and i knew that there was something going on there... and i just went for it.
well, i've got blond hair, and i've got blue eyes, and my measurements are about 38-24-34.
some people tell me i look a lot like farrah fawcett.
hey, god, me and my wife are trying to have another baby.
a real man would have done it right the first time.
and i said to my wife, "honey, don't be upset that howard jr.'s in a formaldehyde jar.
we're gonna take him out of this office, we'll bring him home, and next week we'll bring him to the zoo in a stroller."
i wish that there were more things that could be just ours.
but i think it's right that i go crazy, you know?
howard... the way we work here at nbc... is a more professional manner than you're probably used to.
now, see, i don't care about what you did down in washington, 'cause that's chickenshit radio.
now, i'm gonna teach you how to say them, all right?
and you know, i hope you can get them, because, see, you don't have a real good voice like imus or captain frank or nothing, so we're gonna have to practice it.
you fucking waltz in here, and you think you know everything, don't you?
well, i fucking worked my fucking ass off to get to new york city, and you sure as fuck are not gonna fucking blow it for me!
i want to beat these guys, stomp them into the ground.
the only way to do that is to stay on the air.
i wouldn't even be doing bits like that if robin was with me.
i never would have even called his wife on the air if i had robin sitting there.
well, this is an exciting day for us here in the studio because we have a stage star with us.
this is donna porter with us on the show, and she's here to talk about life in the theater, and, donna, i don't know if you know this, but our own news guy ross buckingham
right now, you're getting a look at a live broadcast of the howard stern show.
that's about 13 inches, and you're licking whipped cream off a kielbasa, and you're putting it in your mouth, and you're jamming the kielbasa all the way down your throat.
ross buckingham, have you ever seen a woman swallow an entire 13-inch kielbasa?
when you were in the theater, did you ever work with a kielbasa?
mandy has agreed to actually get on the floor with me and give me a massage while she is nude.
what does a massage have to do with making it into history?
all the management at nbc... bunch of creeps, and i'm not afraid to say it right now, and, you know, it's funny, because i know you feel the same exact way i do about nbc
because you told me on the phone personally last week that you feel the same way.
i've been getting up at 5:00 every morning to work for howard.
i've been pissing off every publicist, burning every freakin' bridge in the industry,
i mean, the way they were screaming, at first i really thought i'd won them over.
i thought i was the beatles on ed sullivan or something.
by the powers vested in me by the federal communications commission,
i command you to get on the microphone in a serious manner and continue this broadcast.
i finally got up the courage to go down to the college radio station and get myself on the air.
and my name is howard stern on the howard stern experience, and if you love music, you'll love deep purple on tbu.
so, we were on our way to a rally in support of feminism, and we got caught in the rain.
i'm wondering if we can come in and just hang out for awhile.
in my, um, psychology class, we're studying b.f. skinner, and i started to realize that what skinner says is true...
we're all rats trapped in a box, all searching for a piece of cheese.
to be quite honest, i didn't really want to be a programmer.
but at $250 a week, i could marry alison, and we'd get a real place together.

i've been pissing off every publicist, burning every freakin' bridge in the industry,
well, i'm sure your lieutenant knows mr. barnes in an entirely different context.
i had the honor of interviewing mr. barnes for several days.
jimmy will turn up in a park somewhere or be recovered in some raid.
you know what will happen if they get me back in the keep again?
lieutenant nevin's son had a checkup two days before he was kidnapped.
he had something that looked like a bug bite, so the base doctor did a routine blood test.

lieutenant nevin's son had a checkup two days before he was kidnapped.
he had something that looked like a bug bite, so the base doctor did a routine blood test.
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
for, thus i hoped some day to aid oh, can such hope be vain?
when my dear country shall be made a nation once again
i took leave and stayed in london so lorcan could see him.
you should have seen his face the first time he saw his son.
inspector, i appreciate your candour, but as far as i'm concerned, the child is the matter.
if lieutenant nevins can provide a lead, i'll happily chase it down.
you know what would happen if they get me back in the keep again?
every man in my unit will end up dead or in prison.
hey, as bad as it is between you, the british would never approve the kidnapping of an american citizen.
the majority of the r.u.c. are probably working under the assumption you stole the baby.
i was trying through mischievous images to question our received ideas of female beauty.
women are induced from adolescence onwards to paint out personality, to falsify femininity in pursuit of a cosmetic standard.
he had a black hood that covered his head and a black sweater.
that's when i passed out, because when i came round, he's put this stuff over my mouth and eyes and he's tied up my hands!
now, you may know of an incident similar to this that happened recently.
a man in a black mask tied up the householders while he ransacked the house.
it's in connection with the death of mrs doreen harker, who tragically hanged herself last week while in police custody, with thick copper wire.
l was wondering, to be honest, where she might have got...
she heard "herpes" and tried to circumcise him with a tin opener!
when i open this door, step through and take a bow.
um... that last morning... the two of us... it was beautiful!
you know how sometimes when you make love it's like a nuclear explosion?
then, when i turned round, there's this man with like a black hood over his head!
and the next thing, i don't know, i fainted for maybe a minute.
if there was a way someone could get out of a room undetected,
i suppose the man to ask about it would be a magician.
they come over at times to see if i've got a proper job yet.
you know how parents look at you as if you've just got engaged to a fruit bat.
no, but her pa said she saw her at her desk.
no, she saw a pair of legs and some smoke, which proves nothing.
so, when joy thinks she's talking to this girl about her pictures it's actually serena.
and, as she talks, she moves round behind the other sofa.
so, now serena invites joy, apparently over the intercom, to collect the photos.
if she can work the trick with the phone, there's no reason why she couldn't have a bug rigged up.
but if you're crouching down at the third one, after yates, the doorway is just masked.
enough for serena to slip out of the room and then down the fire escape.
waited till he'd gone downstairs, then moved in up that wrought iron staircase.
it's important francesca saw her with the hood, so the burglar thing would work.
tell her to forget anything personal between us, this is a professional enquiry.
l'd like to publish her account of her affair with my husband.
it wasn't too difficult to get over that wall and into the bedroom.
he never picked up that letter because you never went in through the front door.
you see, that's where i have no idea how your mind works.
to suddenly lock into that area where because only her hands were tied up...
plus, the funniest sight gag we seem to have lost, for some reason!
jack, jokes that were acceptable 20-30 years ago, today we have to be more sensitive.
the essence of the campaign is that we take jack holiday, legendary king of slapstick, subvert the form that made you famous...
this whole discussion is academic because the client will hack it to shreds.
it's taken his sister five years to find that prostitute and get her to come forward.
she showed me the evidence and i kept pestering and publicising until the home office finally saw sense and granted a reprieve.
l give kirsten a ring on your behalf, explaining who you are, etc, etc.
you've read about the case, offering your professional services, if she's interested, in checking out that underground chamber.
one of the obituaries said, "he left behind a legacy of laughter. "
a heritage of hilarity that will survive us all, mrs holiday.
one minute it was the collapsing universe, the next, nuclear war.
l remember when he went to la, his last words to jennifer were begging her to take care, leave nothing to chance!
mr holiday's would have been more robust, because it's set inside the cliff rock.
it had to be hollowed out with jack hammers and god knows what else!
and if you're asking me if he could turn a key in a lock, load a gun and empty it into his head,
i'd say not unless a miracle happened in the last two weeks of his life!
all i can say is, if it was a trick, it's a bloody good one.
not only have you got a locked room no one can leave, even if you did get out, you're in a cliff!
lever, or a device he could operate with his crippled hands.
which he then dropped down the hole where the loo was going to go.
stuff like that. "we have had some difficulty acquiring supplies. "
maybe it's me, but i thought it was odd to keep something like that for nine years!
just to make sure rokesmith can't come up with an alibi, he's disposed of as well.
l buy that much, but it still doesn't tell us how the killer left after shooting holiday.
no, and it doesn't explain why a 100 watt light bulb is in a 40 watt packet.
or why that bloody lavatory keeps coming back to haunt me!
we never said he was a saint, but it doesn't mean he was a murderer.
as far as we know, the only women in his life were his sister and mother, who he adored.
no one ever thinks you'd go to that much trouble to fool an audience.
but if we hack away at it long enough, there's a way, an elaborate way, this crime could have been carried out.
l don't think you'll argue that it's your husband's writing, even in capitals.
the greek es and tails on the rs are all over that script you showed me upstairs.
several days before the murder, i can't say how long it took him,
rokesmith was systematically dismantling the end wall in what was to have been the toilet.
he now rebuilds the wall, this time deeper inside the room, leaving a narrow recess between the new wall and the concrete behind.
my guess is he swallows a bottle of something - pills, paracetamol, and with his last half hour or so, seals himself up.
the title of this group is "seductio ad absurdem", in which we see a juxtaposition between the sensuous and the fatuous.
i was trying through mischievous images to question our received ideas of female beauty.
she and your husband made love for two hours, then, when she was in the bedroom getting ready to leave, he went downstairs to take a call.
a man wearing a black hood got into the bedroom through the window, tied up miss boutron and took jewellery.
the girl who comes to clean for you, katrina toplis, arrived then, but by the time she and a neighbour found the body, the killer had got away through the garden, dropping his spoils en route, it seems.
now, you may know of an incident similar to this that happened recently.
a man in a black mask tied up the householders while he ransacked the house.
but due to the circumstances, mrs shale, i have to ask the question, where were you at the time all this happened, at 11.25 this morning?
like the leather corset and boots she wears to tie you up?
it's meant to be a family show, adam, not a bank commercial!
i don't know how, but she went back to that house and shot her old man in cold blood.
and she'll watch me go down for it, unless someone like you can nail her.
i don't want to sound all social worker, but it's been such a fulfilling venture!
i've learnt so much about steering people through trauma, especially bereavement.
um... that last morning... the two of us... it was beautiful!
you know how sometimes when you make love it's like a nuclear explosion?
then, when i turned round, there's this man with like a black hood over his head!
and the next thing, i don't know, i fainted for maybe a minute.
if there was a way someone could get out of a room undetected,
i suppose the man to ask about it would be a magician.
i'll need a few hours to go over it from every angle.
seems to all hinge on a phone call that came in from some girl called davina yates, or maybe bates, the pa can't remember.
joy comes back in to get the file from the cabinet.
she closes the door, goes back to her desk, stays there for the next three hours.
so, what happens if she never went in in the first place?
no, but her pa said she saw her at her desk.
she's already keyed the number, she just presses send, knowing that joy will turn her back to answer it.
so, when joy thinks she's talking to this girl about her pictures it's actually serena.
and, as she talks, she moves round behind the other sofa.
so, now serena invites joy, apparently over the intercom, to collect the photos.
enough for serena to slip out of the room and then down the fire escape.
coming back, she just nips in again while joy's in reception, goes back to her desk and swears she's been there all morning.
she's left her office empty for three hours with a pair of legs propped up?
what if the pa puts through a call or there's a fire drill?
listen, i'm going to go over some things with the director.
i'll leave jonathan here, and he's going to lock the door, aren't you, jonathan?
maybe we could meet for a drink afterwards to discuss terms.
for the third time of asking, can you ring me at the theatre asap?
it's not hard to make things look impossible, if you work at it.
it wasn't too difficult to get over that wall and into the bedroom.
he never picked up that letter because you never went in through the front door.
once you were inside, hedley's on the phone, katrina's due at any minute.
the guy is going to be lying there in a casket.
just breathe deep, don't talk too fast and you'll get through it.
but you got to figure over the course we'll hit a few bumps.
i'm just nervous about ally being in the next room when that happens.
... " oh,i wishihad knownthat ." or, "i wish i had known him better. "
and we think, "maybe that person up there is just saying nice things" ...
a good father and a good husband, a good man and... .
we don't get to say that very often about people these days.
the guy is going to be lying there in a casket.

i'll try not to overstay my welcome but at the moment i need your help.
we're in pursuit of a maquis raider headed for the badlands.
i saw him almost every day read his reports, had him to dinner.
i even took him to a baseball game in the holosuite once and i never saw it!
it's my job to be a good judge of character and what did i do?
not only did i not see it, i put him up for a promotion.
he launched three stratospheric torpedoes at the planet and spread cobalt diselenide throughout the biosphere.
a nerve agent that is harmless to most humanoids but it is deadly to cardassians.
we have no cloak, no transporters no replicators, and the stabilizing gyros are at only 50 percent.
so don't ask for any sharp turns unless you want to end up doing barrel rolls.
and by the time we got back on our feet again three maquis raiders came out of the plasma field.
well... it seems i couldn't get the job done either, captain.
so you think that eddington is using the music as a signal for a rendezvous in the breen system?
or a breen settlement like the one on portas v, which isn't far from the dmz.
the biogenic components of the weapons eddington's been using are very bulky and very unstable.
they need to be kept in a large, sophisticated cold-storage unit.
our intelligence drones detected a maquis freighter entering portas v three hours ago.
the freighter was last seen headed into the dorvan sector of the dmz.
once our repair team is back on board release the tractor beam.
the cardassians can limp their way home in a day or two.
when you attacked the malinche, you proved one thing... that the maquis have become an intolerable threat to the security of the federation and i am going to eliminate that threat.
but think about those people you saw in the caves huddled and starving.
the cardassian and maquis colonists who were forced to abandon their homes will make new lives for themselves on the planets their counterparts evacuated.
the balance in the region will be restored though the situation remains far from stable.
oh, the chief's had it on line for six hours now.
i think he's eager for someone to give it a try.
i even took him to a baseball game in the holosuite once and i never saw it!
it's my job to be a good judge of character and what did i do?
because... you're going to have to let go of this one.
eddington is someone else's problem now and you're going to have to live with that.
and eddington has announced that the maquis intend to reclaim the planet once they are gone.
what i don't understand is where the maquis got the materials to make a biogenic weapon.
we can go to warp six but the inertial dampers haven't been fully repaired so don't expect a smooth ride.
the weapons are also on line but the targeting scanners have to be manually calibrated.
with most of the bridge control functions off line all orders to engineering will have to be relayed.
in the interest of clarity, i thought it best that those messages be relayed with one voice.
let me give you all the bad news at once, sir.
we have no cloak, no transporters no replicators, and the stabilizing gyros are at only 50 percent.
that i have lost all perspective that i'm turning this into a vendetta between me and eddington and that i am putting the ship, the crew and my entire career at risk and if i had any brains at all
i'd go back to my office, sit down and read odo's crime reports.
the maquis had rigged it with a focused particle beam that punched through our gyro shielding and we lost helm control.
and by the time we got back on our feet again three maquis raiders came out of the plasma field.
with the defiant's computers still not fully operational we're relying on odo, back at deep space 9 to decipher the maquis message.
in the meantime, we're combing the dmz in the hopes of a chance encounter with eddington but with each passing hour, our hopes are fading.
well, metrical analysis shows an alternating tetrameter and pentameter structure but the computer could find no meaningful pattern in the words.
they appear to be just what they are... nonsensical phrases strung together because they rhyme... at least to the breen.
or a breen settlement like the one on portas v, which isn't far from the dmz.
the biogenic components of the weapons eddington's been using are very bulky and very unstable.
they need to be kept in a large, sophisticated cold-storage unit.
and if anyone knows how to keep things cold, it's the breen.
we've towed the transport ship out of the planet's gravitational pull.
once our repair team is back on board release the tractor beam.
a starfleet security officer is fascinated by a nineteenth-century french melodrama, and now he's a leader of the maquis...
a resistance group fighting the noble battle against the "evil" cardassians.
oh, the chief's had it on line for six hours now.
i think he's eager for someone to give it a try.
i even took him to a baseball game in the holosuite once and i never saw it!
it's my job to be a good judge of character and what did i do?
because... you're going to have to let go of this one.
eddington is someone else's problem now and you're going to have to live with that.
he launched three stratospheric torpedoes at the planet and spread cobalt diselenide throughout the biosphere.
a nerve agent that is harmless to most humanoids but it is deadly to cardassians.
with most of the bridge control functions off line all orders to engineering will have to be relayed.
in the interest of clarity, i thought it best that those messages be relayed with one voice.
let me give you all the bad news at once, sir.
we have no cloak, no transporters no replicators, and the stabilizing gyros are at only 50 percent.
that i have lost all perspective that i'm turning this into a vendetta between me and eddington and that i am putting the ship, the crew and my entire career at risk and if i had any brains at all
i'd go back to my office, sit down and read odo's crime reports.
and by the time we got back on our feet again three maquis raiders came out of the plasma field.
well... it seems i couldn't get the job done either, captain.
so you think that eddington is using the music as a signal for a rendezvous in the breen system?
or a breen settlement like the one on portas v, which isn't far from the dmz.
the biogenic components of the weapons eddington's been using are very bulky and very unstable.
they need to be kept in a large, sophisticated cold-storage unit.
our intelligence drones detected a maquis freighter entering portas v three hours ago.
the freighter was last seen headed into the dorvan sector of the dmz.
once our repair team is back on board release the tractor beam.
the cardassians can limp their way home in a day or two.
when you attacked the malinche, you proved one thing- that the maquis have become an intolerable threat to the security of the federation and i am going to eliminate that threat.
but think about those people you saw in the caves huddled and starving.
oh, the chief's had it on line for six hours now.
i think he's eager for someone to give it a try.
i even took him to a baseball game in the holosuite once and i never saw it!
it's my job to be a good judge of character and what did i do?
because... you're going to have to let go of this one.
eddington is someone else's problem now and you're going to have to live with that.
and eddington has announced that the maquis intend to reclaim the planet once they are gone.
what i don't understand is where the maquis got the materials to make a biogenic weapon.
we can go to warp six but the inertial dampers haven't been fully repaired so don't expect a smooth ride.
the weapons are also on line but the targeting scanners have to be manually calibrated.
with most of the bridge control functions off line all orders to engineering will have to be relayed.

i'd go back to my office, sit down and read odo's crime reports.
the maquis had rigged it with a focused particle beam that punched through our gyro shielding and we lost helm control.
and by the time we got back on our feet again three maquis raiders came out of the plasma field.
with the defiant's computers still not fully operational we're relying on odo, back at deep space 9 to decipher the maquis message.
in the meantime, we're combing the dmz in the hopes of a chance encounter with eddington but with each passing hour, our hopes are fading.
well, metrical analysis shows an alternating tetrameter and pentameter structure but the computer could find no meaningful pattern in the words.
they appear to be just what they are... nonsensical phrases strung together because they rhyme... at least to the breen.
or a breen settlement like the one on portas v, which isn't far from the dmz.
the biogenic components of the weapons eddington's been using are very bulky and very unstable.
they need to be kept in a large, sophisticated cold-storage unit.
and if anyone knows how to keep things cold, it's the breen.
we've towed the transport ship out of the planet's gravitational pull.
once our repair team is back on board release the tractor beam.
a starfleet security officer is fascinated by a nineteenth-century french melodrama, and now he's a leader of the maquis...
a resistance group fighting the noble battle against the "evil" cardassians.

what i'm saying, jack, is this employee of the month competition is not conducive to good team building.
pitting one member of staff against another introduces unhealthy competition to an otherwise happy team and why?
you see jack, when there are winners there have to be losers and that don't build a good team.
one person wins, flies off and i'm left with a team of losers.
the council will soon assess funding for next year, there's a very strong lobby in favour of privatisation,
i think they might look favourably on a management buyout submission,
that's what i used to dream about when i was a child.
night after night i'd dream about this grid in the road, and i used to think if only i could get down there,
i'd find somewhere nice and safe and warm, a sort of den, where me and my imaginary friends could meet and play.
and, you know, the funny thing was, there was actually a grid outside my house, you could see it from my bedroom window.
there doesn't seem to be much interest in my dreams workshop.
don't worry, darling, i'll deal with it at the staff meeting,
i'll inspire them by telling them about my dream, a dream where leisure pursuits bring peace and harmony.
no, not that sort of dream, not your vision thing, no, the sort of dreams you have at night, you know?
two canaries, a pint of milk and a crystal ball, mr brittas.
so for the runners up, the lucky losers, a special prize, a weekend of bonding, barrier breaking and team building where i tell you everything i know about the leisure industry.
well, i've increased the output ratio on this machine by 150% .
this means mr thompson gets twice as fit in half the time.
i was just wondering what sort of dream i should have.
i'm just gonna have my dream now and i wanted to clear it with you first.
well, it's her party in that sense, but it's my concept.
i mean, the birthday party package is all down to me.
it reminds me of a dream i used to have as a child.
i used to go down this grille and there was this underground world.
calm down, you've had a bad enough day as it is, you don't want a broken arm to go with it!
all i'm saying is, would you put in a good word about the cake, that's all.
i think he would want us to finish what he started.
we'll use what time we have to try and save her.
if we go back, we lose all hope of ever returning home.
we'll spend 29 years here because we gambled on a miraculous breakthrough.
i was sent to the hospital this morning because one of your leaders ordered it.
(tv announcer) the pyramid cannot be reopened and the ceremonial sealing has been canceled.
...and it's doubtful that we will ever hear their accounts publicly.
right now, what we do know is that the three people who apparently activated the vortex are believed to be trapped inside the pyramid.
you realize if the hospital finds out what i'm helping you to do, it could damage my career?
forgive me if i don't have a lot of sympathy for someone whose job is to experiment with killing people.
(tv reporter) we have no official word on how or why the pyramid is rotating, or if it's related to the people trapped inside.
and attempts to reach the kheri-heb thus far have been futile.
when the right slot passes over that opening, we should be able to climb inside.
what if your friends don't know where it's supposed to stop?
if there is a secret passage, that's got to be where it is.
i'm not going back out there unless i know for sure.
and my family- man, they go to washington, like, four times a year.
we have the environmental rallies and the no-nukes protest... and the legalize marijuana march... ifthey ever get it organized.
this is why i went into the u.s. attorney's office- so that someday i could get this shot.
but ifi'm gonna do this- ifwe're gonna do this... you need to understand how tough it's gonna be.
well, you know, speaking of rabbis, priests and ministers in a life raft... did you know that my husband, gregory montgomery... is very supportive of all major religions... and many ofthe minor ones as well?
[ clears throat ] dharma, dear, could i talk toyou forjust a moment?
they do have that great one of me with my fly open.
you know, honey, i think the best thing i could do foryou right now... is to just giveyou your own space.
and i need to make sure you really understand that... because we may never have sex again.
you know, honey, sometimes the universe puts obstacles in our path... to teach us things, to make us stronger and wiser.
i mean, i like to think of sex with greg as a form of meditation... where our bodies join together to reach a higher consciousness.
although there are times when i just jump him in the shower.
listen, whenyourwifie's not withyou... doyou needa dirtymagazine, or doyoujust wing it?
mr. montgomery, what do you say to the american autoworker... who wants to know whyyou were having sex in a foreign car?
as diffiicult as it is to saythis... it has been more difficult to live this lie the last 30 years.

i've been thinking, son... and i realized, you don't have any goals.
you've got to figure out what you want to do with your life.
is he the space shuttle astronaut or the stock car champ?
he got to the end of level 6 in scream ninja.
bobby, when i say "hero," i don't mean some weird game boy freak.
if you don't watch it, you're gonna end up like jason adderly's boy.
i was headed over here to knock you six ways from sunday with that guitar.
then i get here and you're playing that old song of yours, and...
everyyoung bride thinks that she wants to cook a thanksgiving dinner... and it always ends up the same.
someone cries, someone is rushed offto the emergency room... and a perfectly lovely bird gets wasted... which, if i don't eat soon, will be me.
and the leastyou can do is put the filthy little thing outside.
- you know, it's not too filthy to eat now, is it?
i usually love the smell of onions, but this is making me nauseous.
oh, onions did the same thing to me when i was pregnantwith you.
3 men may be tied to the east side but an identified man fired an
this continues away the violence that hits the city over the last two months.
the mayor called it a priority of the city earlier this morning after the body of zack starr, an alleged gang member, was discovered
this is the tenth gang-related death in the last three weeks.
vanessa was nine months pregnant the night she was attacked, bitten, left
robert found her, struggling to survive for the sake of her unborn child outside
until a friend of mine, abraham whistler found him and took him in.
so we saved blade from drinking the blood of animals, others... clone suppliers like the house of lychan.
take this city, it's been around since the 18th century and yet, if you ask somebody to point out a prominent historical landmark, they probably aim for the joe louis arena.
you see the past has been torn down and replaced by something that in a short will also be torn down and replaced.
you pump her full of it before sunrise, she might get a clear head for a
but if she feeds off a fresh kill before, then who the hell knows !
uh, i didn't know it was such a big deal to you.
'cause, you know, topanga got her license and shawn got his, and they wanted to be with me when i got mine.
he weirded out a little bit on me because, you know,
i got my license and made him feel old, and he went out and bought a cemetery plot and everything, but i bet you it's not nearly as bad as he's treating you.
see, the only reason you're not cruising down that turnpike right now with your arm around topanga and shawn in the back going, "whoo, whoo, whoo,"
is because morgan's his first daughter and not his third son, son.
will you stop telling cory to ditch his own birthday party?
and you, put a smile on your face and behave yourself.
you really don't want to do anything at all, do you?
you want to sneak into an r-rated film in another state?
so, here we are, on our own, driving down the open road.
just me, my topanga, and my shawn, and a big full moon right behind us.
okay, well, in that case, all i can say is that, um,
cory is a very nice boy who never hurt anybody, and if you do anything to him on his first day of driving, then i just think you are a mean, mean...
that means you have two years more of being a kid.
now i know that seems like hard labor when you have a license in your hand, but from what i can surmise of your home life, you're luckier, cory, than most who appear before me.
so, uh, when do you think there's gonna be tension between us again?
well, we just got through the driver's license thing, so probably the next time we fight, it'll be over your choice of college.
i called the organizers and raised hell that none of my people were invited.
well, only a couple of us papers are invited every year.
well, i'm just the new kid from down under, but i try.
i'm just the new kid from down under, but i try.
a professor in the next office heard a commotion and came over to see if everything was okay, but the door was locked.
when we got here, we found rankin lying on the floor, strangled.
matt, look, i promise i will not touch any of the evidence.
this is the second case of a person in a locked room dying of strangulation.
zip, but i did find out that professor rankin was on the same payroll plan as martinelli 200 thou from caribbean imports.
if both men were involved with vixen, this was probably their fee.
- leslie has pulled off a journalistic coup and he's handing it to you on a silver platter.
perry and i think you should be the one to interview peter massey before his execution.
i realize you're not quite yourself, hanson but you try that again and the antidote goes down the drain.
any chance you had for a normal life goes with it and you remain as you are.
you come out of something like that with such an appreciation for life.
i'm a little surprised you didn't call me to tell me.
i was going to call you again from the prison but i was locked inside that cell with massey all night.
i promised i'd get these down to photo, but i want to swap stories.
well, according to the chart, it's made up of a bunch of tiny businesses so it's probably some kind of shell company.
try cross-referencing flemming's client list with anyone even remotely attached to any of those little businesses.
so you begged me not to say anything to clark about that little incident.
and yet, at your first opportunity, you marched up to him...
i tried to tell you earlier what happened, which was that nothing happened.
but since he inexplicably came running to you with that nothing...
so caribbean imports was designed as a shell company for walter o'neil.
and once i found that out, i dug into o'neil's corporation, i came across this.
he showed up and said he wanted to buy me out.
i told him he was crazy and he pulled out a gun.
i mean, i, gotta tell you, in twenty years kids are going to be reading your book in school.
but the way the business works now, you can't get there alone.
you need an advocate, someone on your side so that you can concentrate on what's most important, so that you can do your work.
now i can't tell you how many authors have died penniless, scrounging for scraps, because they didn't have the right representation.
so remember tonight, we're going to pick out our christmas tree.
we're going to pick out, because we haven't picked out our tree.
i was thinking of paris, but i guess we're going back home.
hi there, my wife and would like two tickets to mahone bay, please.
look, i know it's weird to be back here, but could you just take it down a couple notches?
i mean — i want your best room top of the line
- yeah, but, you know how you hear all those near-death experience stories?
i mean, it was just strange that that's what she said, that they were waiting for me.
i mean, i'd like to believe that there were angels, you know, and there's, there's another side, a spiritual side.
i don't know, i know that's probably just much too irrational for you.
well, first of all, fifteen minutes ago, she thought you betrayed her.
she may have forgiven you, but is she sure of your love?
yeah, his name is, um, jim pazden, aka jim the penman.
he's a topline plate engraver with a record full of counterfeiting beefs.
glen and fred, the parakeets, the wine tour, uh, oh, and the 19 performances of a chorus line.
hey, i think you learn by experience in life, you know?
he's living with this guy named bill in the castro, okay.
so i figure since we got a little time, we can just swing by there after lisa's and then go to the jail ward, what do you think?
so what does foss do now that we've blown his cover?
i say he runs, leaves a trail of hot hundred dollar bills like bread crumbs.
that's still the plan, but if mr. foss gets a whiff that we're on to him, we're gonna have to move then and there.
and i think jerry and gordon are really gonna love that serving platter.
i got this funny little bill a couple of days ago in my in-box from accounting.
it's a balance-due bill of $2.39 from the palace hotel on an siu account.
there's no one else out there that's willing to pay 50 cents, almost, on the dollar.
we can't just manufacture $5 million out of thin air, can we?
hey, i think you learn by experience in life, you know?
a lot of gay guys pass themselves off as straights nowadays-- what's the difference?
once the old currency gets erased, they're not gonna be making phony paper anymore.
and, uh, and what's, what's your gig in this whole deal?
all right, well, listen, let me go check on your paperwork.
and, oh, um, lieutenant hamilton wanted me to make sure that you get right over there to see him.
hey, i got a lead on tim-- you know, jack conrad's boyfriend.
he's living with this guy named bill in the castro, okay.
all right, we're gonna run over to the secret service, see if we can get the file on foss.
hey, don't forget, we have to get a present for the commitment ceremony.
i mean, i don't know, if joe's waiting in the car, you might...
well, i did have a date with him, but, you know...
seeing her lying there, covered in what looked like blood, her cheeks sunken from an unfortunate face-lift, well, naturally, the paramedics just assumed that she had jumped to her death from the rooftop.
thank god she had her cell phone, or she'd still be in that body bag.
imagine you're wearing a long black velvet dress and you look fabulous.
you walk through this crowded party, and you see this amazing man looking at you from the other side of the room.
well, as much as i enjoy the evocative strains of your cornhusk-smokin', cousin-pokin', hillbilly strumfest,
i'm afraid it's against the rules, as per section three of the manual.
well, maybe you were right about how i try to sabotage myself, because, you know, growing up with my dad, always surrounded by these perfect women, well, you can imagine, and yesterday,
when you took that picture of me and made me feel beautiful, well, it's just been a long time since someone had done that, and... you know, i had a dream about it.

you walk through this crowded party, and you see this amazing man looking at you from the other side of the room.
your eyes meet for a brief instant, but, not to look too forward, you turn away.
every few minutes, you catch each other's gaze, and each look is different from the last.
first it's playful, and then it's coy, and then finally, sultry and seductive.
with candles and champagne, and there was a guy, but it's weird.
i can't for the life of me remember who it was.
kiss me, then look me straight in the eye and tell me that you don't want me.
i don't need to kiss you to know i don't want you.

they say he is the god of swords, a unification of man and sword
i am very curious and want to know if he is really that dangerous
i will go in and find them, then come back to you
i have only been away for a while and you look awful!
too bad, he has now become the god of the foods
if you miss him so much, i let you see him
so it's the loose-tongued on a close look and princess phoenix with three mouths on a far look
so it's four eyebrows on a far look and a dumb face on a close look!
look at him once brilliant and handsome... and now, all that is left is a pair of silent eyes nothing more!
look at dragon 2, seems to be strong and reliable but then, he is only a limp
if you want to fight in the palace, it's difficult to explain to the emperor
simon the snow blower and me are regarded... as "god of sword" and "sword saint"
brother, why don't you ask him to come to the palace to teach me martial arts?
if you call that a gift it's worse... then asking him to kneel on glass as a penalty
so your majesty want to print some tickets to earn some money?
jin guangda, with the men you have how many can you let into the palace?
but there're millions of great masters in the kung-fu world and only eight medals
who is to decide to whom these medals are to be given?
if you pull me on a big street... and i fall down in the new year, what face do i have?
then why don't you just tell me who is going to win?
i wish we can find simon the snow blower as soon as possible
we must take revenge ourselves and not let him die in cool-son yeh's hands
cool-son yeh, i will find the tianshan snow lotus to cure you
so you can fight simon the snow blower in good condition
they are two of the sons of the "seven tianshan sons"
the one who keeps talking is yen zizhun and the dumb one is xiao zichong
you can't say that one has to bear his own consequences
your master is a serious criminal and i am an lmperial agent
my master is definitely not the thief ghost, he was wronged
hey, your sister ye ziqing is still alive, go ask her
normally, the eunuchs in the palace and the guards can't go around
so hawk brother six has found a place where no one know
these three clay dolls are found on the body of shi zilun
he must have found out something he should not know and had himself killed
not really, i think he can is very gentle and considerate
i heard he only has feelings for his sword and nothing else
i have found out that my master is truly the thief ghost
but then, he is still our master and he raised us up for good sake
tonight's going to be a grand event of the capital, everyone's attention is drawn to it
the powerful four in the palace only issued eight gold medals
i have given five to unimportant people of the remaining three
if you really want to go, i can give one to you
not just for simon the snow blower, even i am not sure if i can come back
so i want you to stay by my side and take you to watch the duel
eight, i give it to you... and immoral wu, two sons of the tianshan clan, honest monk, priest wood
the remaining two were left for jade and simon the snow blower's girl
and has been fed with the blood of 1 78 famous swordsmen
mine is 3 feet 9 inches, made from iron of the western district
i am much smarter than you and my kung-fu is invincible
why did my father had to be sent to pingnan for being an illegitimate child and i even lost my title because i am an illegitimate child?
one year later, i will meet with my brother cool-son yeh in the west
i suddenly feel a calling from heaven and become a monk, passing on my throne to cool-son yeh
hawk brother six is really dead and his death is faked
you switched all attention to the duel at the summit of the forbidden city
please let me have the duel with simon the snow blower on the summit of the forbidden city
if i can't fight with him, i will regret it for the rest of my life
julia, obviously things are a little overwhelming for you right now.
and that means it's probably not the best time to make a huge decision like this.
and the next morning there's patsy's geo in the same spot.
with the rock right on the tire where you left it.
because i think it might be nice to wake up with you in the morning.
we've never done that, you know, wake up, have coffee together in bed.
hey, for your information, there was a fire in grace's apartment last night, and she had to stay here.
and i slept on the couch as if it's any of your--
but it might be nice to try it when you're actually here because of me and not because you're running away from home.
look, i know that things are tough for you right now with charlie.
but if you steal the stone, i'll never get in here!
they'll seal the place up so tight, not even a mouse will be able to get in!
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
i am a watcher, part of a secret society of men and women... who observe and record, but never interfere.
oh, it just breaks my heart to see you this way.
you know, i say if the stone is so important to you, we should just go and get it.
you see, with my talent and your muscles, the impossible takes just a little bit longer.
why would you want the stone of scone back in scotland?
but in this case, we know that you were just being used by those two men.
give us the names, and you might not grow old in prison.
and here by appointment to receive the stone... came counselors pontham and gardner.
we were approached-- mr. gardner and i-- to act as intermediaries... to, um, facilitate the return of the stone of destiny... to, uh, the scottish people and to their king.
but if you steal the stone, i'll never get in here!
they'll seal the place up so tight, not even a mouse will be able to get in!
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
i am a watcher, part of a secret society of men and women... who observe and record, but never interfere.
there's lots of fun in going round and seeing all the exciting things inside.
and mistletoe gives auntie a chance, even if you don't need it yourself.
but in this case, we know that you were just being used by those two men.
give us the names, and you might not grow old in prison.
and here by appointment to receive the stone... came counselors pontham and gardner.
we were approached-- mr. gardner and i-- to act as intermediaries... to, um, facilitate the return of the stone of destiny... to, uh, the scottish people and to their king.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
that damned war seemed to go on for a thousand years.
but in the end, you got the better of them, hmm?
cumberland was ready to march home after the rout, but i convinced him that we had to finish it.
we had to leave a mark, make sure those jacobites were wiped out.
i've never seen him this upset before, and you know how guilt-ridden he can be.
look, if he goes up against keane... thinking he deserves to lose, he'll lose.
but i also live with the fact that revenge doesn't make anything better.
i had a friend who said the same thing to me once.
i swore on richard dunbar's body... that i would find the man who killed him.
i swore to his wife and family... that i would not rest until macleod was dead.
in every century i've lived, there's been a war that kings and generals said would end wars.
there's been a people ground down in the name of peace.
some of these cases have been open five or six years.
imagine the reaction when you solve them all in one day.
i was trying to keep him alive, and he turned on me.
all right, correct me if i misunderstood, but this was after you framed him, wasn't it?
look, steven, i don't know you, but, um, i do know macleod.
he's the kind of guy who doesn't make promises he can't keep, and he carries a grudge a long time.
and i can tell you, it's not gonna make a bit of difference... in this big, bad world whether you kill him or he kills you.
but, uh, it makes a big difference to me... and to a lot of people who care about macleod.
what are you gonna think of yourself a hundred years from now... when someone's coming after you for killing a good man, and you're trying to explain your reasons?
i really hope he listens when your friends try to stand up for you.
you're gonna go out there, and it's not about culloden, and it's not about the earl of rosemont.
you have to just-- just forget about all that, and you just worry about coming back, okay?
i had to take responsibility for what i've done, and nothing you two could do was ever gonna solve it for me.
i had to face him and fight the best fight of my life... knowing he'd do the same.
fuelled by the flames of vengeance and persecution, the salem witch trials lasted a year.
by the end of sixteen ninety-three, twenty were hanged and the town had seen it's darkest days.
and pack lightly, you'll be provided with period clothing when you arrive.
the idea is for us to fully immerse ourselves in the repressive culture of the time.
- go and have a good time on your field trip.
eight bottles of beer on the wall, eight bottles of beer.
on each card is a role for you to play while at salem village.
most of the cards say 'townsperson' but one or more may say 'witch
this is new. mortals have been accusing each other for centuries but i think this may be the first time they actually got a real witch.
it's supposed to be a game but it doesn't feel like one to me.
i was going to sell them in a car boot sale.
i can't remember what it's like to dial a number from a telephone without hitting nine first.
of course, tape measures in those days were viewed with suspicion.
anyone who could unfurl 15 feet of thin sheet metal from a pocket-sized box would have been killed as a witch.
i was just saying, i sell kitchens, but i can't actually cook myself!
then he spies that cookbook and says, "it'd be nae use to me"!
# oh, rattling roaring willy is he he's off to the bbc
# oh, rattling roaring willy is he he's off to the bbc
# oh, willy goes there and willy goes there and there
# willy goes there and willy goes there and there... #
one of the city councilmen asked if he could stay and help out a little longer.
i'll bet he almost jumped at the chance to stay out there a little longer.
so we need somebody who's good with numbers and who knows our needs.
and being able to budget, say, a family of seven on a minister's salary couldn't hurt.
why don't i just pick you up after school and take you over?
no, i'd rather go with matt, if it's all the same to you.
i got as in science, and that is why i'm tutoring your fountain.
well, that and the fact that if jimmy's stuck in summer school, then you'll have less time with him and more time with me.
fine with me, but we'll see how you feel around 4:00.
you sure you have the time and energy to help me out at the office?
i've seen the many moods and faces of mary camden- the cold one, the intimidating one, the scary and the angry one.
those are a lot of faces and none of them friendly to a floundering science student.
so when she explains something to you, just smile so she knows you understood it.
show your teeth- you have nice teeth and you don't show them nearly enough.
well, not everyone's lucky enough to have your barometer about people.
the vestry feels that hiring someone with ron's record to work around so much cash is like, you know, letting the fox in to guard the hen house.
i thought maybe they elected me because they knew the budget had to be done in a hurry and they knew i could do it.
i also think they knew they could trust me to be fair, which, oddly enough, is more than you knew.
so, are you a real fireman or do you just answer the phone?
oh, so thisis the right number if i have an emergency?
well, simon says most of the numbers on my phone list are probably wrong, and i don't want to wait until there's an emergency to find out if he's right.
i don't think simon meant the numbers on the front page.
i wish i could say that, but the truth is i...
i wanted a lifestyle that my income couldn't support and i didn't think it wouldn't hurt anybody if i used the bank that i was working for to help me try and get it.
ruthie, you cannot use emergency numbers because your imaginary friend drank out of your dog's dish.
you can only use them if real people have real emergencies.
if you're trying to help yourself here, you have a thing or two to learn about a sales pitch.
ron kramer has a lot of knowledge and expertise, and because no one's willing to give him a second chance, it's all going to waste.
my job is to represent the church anditsvalues to the best of my ability.
now, most of the time, i do that with the support of the parishioners.
it's about understanding each other and doing what's best for the church given the limited monies available.
that's it - you know, having an organist would be nice, but it's not a necessity right now.
i've just been so caught up in this whole thing that i've ended up being everything i find so frustrating in lou- narrow-minded and short-tempered and...
and impassioned, which is one of the reasons i married you.
you hurt jimmy's chances of passing science and you turned this whole situation into a girls-fighting- over-a-guy thing, which i hate.
and even worse, you turned it into a sisters-fighting- over-a-guy thing, which i hate even more.
being more afraid of my mother's reaction to an f in science,
i've returned, on schedule... um, a few courteous minutes early, in fact.
while i appreciate that you're a passionate, whimsical creature by nature, you also need to appreciate my need for a passing science grade and just accept the fact there's nothing going on between your sister and me.
you should know me well enough by now to know that i'm not a free-love kind of guy.
because the policeman told me if i call when it's not an emergency, they might not be able to help somebody else who's in big trouble because they're at my house.
that's right, and you're not allowed to use the phone without asking an adult first, understand?
we've also talked this week about the need for sound business versus the need for compassion, and ironically, it is the church's budget that gives us our first and best place to talk about the business of compassion.
the budget is a series of credits and debits, uh, projections and returns, but it's more than that.
if you want to know what our values are, our hopes, look to the budget.
it'd be easy if we were just dealing with money because all of us have lost money on something.
it is our hope and faith that we fear losing most because they are so hard to come by and nearly impossible to replace.
but we lower our risk by investing in each other, our community and our faith.
the budget- this budget- is where we decide what kind of people we want to be.
this annual report is respectfully submitted by annie camden, treasurer pro tem.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
ten years i spent on that island with nothing but dragons for company.
ten long years to plan my revenge..., ...and now..., i'll destroy hercules in the very place he once defeated me.
but we have to track down adamis first and find out what's really going on.
i've done the best i can tryin' to protect you throughout the years just as i protected your mother before she was murdered.
iolaus, can we just hold off until we have proof about braxis?
if he's as bad as you say, we'll fight him side-by-side.
by the time hercules gets there braxis will be picking his teeth with iolaus' bones.
how can you be sure hercules won't kill braxis all by himself?
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
is that your mouth or did you borrow it from a moron?
go back to your lunch, little man, while you can still eat it.
ten years i spent on that island... with nothing but dragons for company.
ten long years to plan my revenge, and, now, i'll destroy hercules... in the very place he once defeated me.
well, hercules, i don't want to wait until he starts hunting people down.
iolaus, can we just hold off until we have proof about braxus?
and that, uh-- just being around you is very, um-- dangerous.
yeah-- as a matter of fact, danger is my middle name--
you might be the king of thieves, but i am master of mayhem.
there's a lot we can learn from each other, you know.
leave the sword where he said to leave it, and wait for him to make contact.
what if, in the process-- he kills the person with the sword, because he found it where i put it?
when you get into the room, drop a rope outside the window, and we'll climb up.
right now, just concentrate on getting that sword past the dog.
still-- give me one good reason why i shouldn't call him now.
one reason, one reason-- yes, well, uh-- you're looking for the best warrior.
hey-- who's the cute little blonde who swings the mean stick?
you lay one finger on her, and i will rip you apart with my bare ha--
yes.he's waiting nearby for the guards to leave, so he can come in and finish the job.
you know, for your information, there was no second part to his plan.
well, that may be, but i'd like to keep it here beating happily in my chest.
and while jet is alive, there is no guarantee of that.
when you get inside, go to the room jet told you to go to.
leave the sword where he said to leave it, and wait for him to make contact.
what if, in the process..., ...he kills the person with the sword because he found it where i put it?
well, if it were as simple as murder, he would have done that by now.
next, he gives me a legitimate reason to lock all the doors.
when he kills cleopatra, ptolemy's gonna make me a very wealthy man.
you see, first i need to know when, where and how often.
i'll let you know as soon as you make a firm offer.
he's waiting nearby for the guards to leave so he can come in and finish the job.
you know, for your information there was no second part to his plan.
yeah, you know if you know what you're doing, there is.
let's go to 23rd and 8th then we'll find out if you know what you're doing.
you don't want to go, you want me to turn around, i'll turn around.
what are you gonna do, take a left off the fuckin' bridge?
- how i'm supposed to know you don't explain it to me, left?
- you think i don't know how a hit gets set up?
problem is it's starting to languish right now and it needs jump-starting.
now the bureau .. would like you to go down there... and see if you could interest some of your mob friends.
i'd blow up all mulberry street before i'd give you up .. ya understand?
i don't know what i would do if you did something wrong.
you see, donnie, if i .. if i work out the strategy right...
- now you gotta .. you gotta hold up your end now.
standard .. procedure is that he is to check in with us every day.
now maybe he might miss a day or two here or there, but ..
he's right in the line of fire, not because he's one of us, because he's one of them.
who he's with and and .. who he's close to ..
i'm just saying if i had a thing, he could lay it off.
all that money you owe downtown... you'd have to lay off a brinks truck.
do you want me to take orders from a fucking jap?
i grew up in an orphanage because my old man was killed in okinawa.
the economy has to be good for us to make any money.
you don't think they got their own wise guys in florida?
new york with the politics, all the old beefs and the grudges.
down here, a guy like me could sit down with the boss.
we just picked up lefty on a wiretap talking to one of trafficante's guys.
a few things to go over to make a loan-sharking indictment.
like, " raquel welch is one great piece of ass." " forget about it."
but then, if you disagree, like, "a lincoln is better than a cadillac"?
that's the same thing as ifl put the bullet in his head myself.
i spent all these years trying to be the good guy in the white hat.
if you're a rat, then i'm the biggest mutt in the history of the mafia.
even if this thing is a federal boat, left... they scam all the others.
look, you bring that ring to any kike on 47th street, he's gonna tell you that that is primo.
you took away your wife's ring to go bet on the giants?
how am i supposed to know if you don't explain it?
you think i don't know how a hit gets set up?
from now on, i'll deal out the cards, you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.
fucking booths. $200 in action and what we have we got, five?
bobby, give sonny a good table and a bottle of your best, on me.
why don't you get him a tailor while you're at it?
problem is, it's starting to languish right now and needs jump-starting.

not because he's one of us, because he's one of them.
who he's with and who he's close to, they're all the top dogs now.
in our thing, you get sent for, you go in alive, you come out dead... and it's your best friend that does it.
anything should happen to me... make sure annette gets the car.
do you want me to take orders from a fucking jap?
i grew up in an orphanage because my old man was killed in okinawa.
i heard a whole conversation on the long john neville show.
here you got 3,000 wise guys all chasing the same nickel.
i mean, i know you're a skipper and i'm a nobody, but i can't do that to lefty.
listen to me, you cocksucker, i'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.
like, " raquel welch is one great piece of ass. " " forget about it. "
but then, if you disagree, like, "a lincoln is better than a cadillac"?
usually, the cops are so fucking dumb... it takes them three months to get wind something's going on.
then they gotta get a warrant and do their whatever with pictures-
standard procedure is that he is to check in with us every day.
maybe he might miss a day or two here and there, but...
i'd like to pop him, throw him in the water, take the fucking boat.
you said a couple of times how if you had that bertram again... you'd drive down to the pier with annette and just go.
look, you bring that ring to any kike on 47th street, he's gonna tell you that that is primo.

put a beaner inside here, then he knows these are men of men.
you see, if i work out the strategy right, you got to hold up your end now.

there's a bunch of assholes and the i.r.s. is another bunch of assholes.
so what i'm asking you to do is to place a phone call, asshole to asshole.
i guess you didn't ever think of paying these guys off, did you?
where the hell am i gonna get money to go bribing cops?
the point is, that's the last time we heard from him.
standard procedure is that he is to check in with us every day.
did you ever once ask yourself how i make it through my days?
i pretend i'm a widow with medals and scrapbooks and memories.
that's the same thing as if i put the bullet in his head myself, you understand?
i spent all these years trying to be the good guy.
i'd like to pop him, throw him in the water, take the fucking boat.

i'd like to pop him, throw him in the water, take the fucking boat.
remember you said a couple of times how if you had that bertram again, you'd drive down to the pier with annette and just go?
if you're a rat, then i'm the biggest fucking mutt in the history of the mafia.
even if this thing is a federal boat, left, they scam all these other people.
"this is a friend of mine." that means you're a connected guy.
if i said instead, "this is a friend of ours," that would mean you're a made guy.
how am i supposed to know if you don't explain it?
you think i don't know how a hit gets set up?
from now on, i'll deal out the cards, you say "gin" whenever you feel like it.

we just picked up lefty on a wiretap talking to one of trafficante's guys.
a few things to go over to make a loan-sharking indictment.
i mean, i know you're a skipper and i'm a nobody, but i can't do that to lefty.
listen to me, you cocksucker, i'll eat your fucking balls for breakfast.
put a beaner inside here, then he knows these are men of men.
you see, if i work out the strategy right, you got to hold up your end now.
like, "raquel welch is one great piece of ass." "forget about it."

- whereas, well, self-evidently... - did you ever think of giving him a raise?
the only way to give him a raise would be to upgrade him.
standard procedure is that he is to check in with us every day.
maybe he might miss a day or two here and there, but...

the summer i killed my father, i was 10 years old.
my brother poe was nine, and my sister cisely had just turned 14.
i could look at people, complete strangers, and see their lives.
but i looked at each of my husbands... and never saw a thing.
i want you to get a small bag made of skin of chamois.
in it, place this piece of moon stone and john conqueror root.
when i was growing up, children did not participate in a conversation of adults.
you can let them kids back talk and run wild if you want to.
if you're lucky, you might live long enough to one day have a husband and children.
but until then, this is my house and you'll do as i say.
but when i was with hosea, it was like my whole body was burning.
i'd come home and have to rub ice on my face and neck to cool down.
i was going upstairs to pack my bags, when i heard maynard say in a tone i'd never heard him use,
"i don't care who you are, sir, but if you don't leave my house at once, i will hurt you."
and i turned just in time to see hosea pull a gun out and aim it at maynard.
"i'm in love with your wife, and if you try to stop us, i'll kill you."
maynard walked right up and pushed his chest in the barrel of that gun, and he said,
"well, then, you'll have to kill me because my wife ain't going nowhere."
oh, eve... in that moment, i knew that i loved maynard.
he was so calm and brave... and it was hosea who was trembling.
mama was standing in the doorway of the kitchen and she was holding her heart like this.
i walked slowly over... and i stood next to my husband... and i looked at my lover... this man who had lit this great fire in me, and said,
i got in a fight with some knucklehead over at kings and came to under the pool table.
now, roz was sore at me about something, so she hadn't spoken to me in about a week.
i thought, " damn... the woman finds out i've been drinking and fighting, she'll leave me." anyway, they take me home, and she sees me all messed up, and she starts weeping,
and kissing me, and kissing me, and weeping, and nine months later...
all i know is, there must be a divine point to it all, and it's just over my head.
when we die, it will all come clear, and we'll say,
i am guilty in the sense that i adore her, and i allowed her to adore me.
it was a sweet indulgence, but nothing in her behavior prepared me for what happened the night of the storm.
roz and i had a terrible fight and i guess it was inevitable.
i knew cisely could never sleep through a fight like that.
each image is like a thread, each thread woven together to make a tapestry of intricate texture.
and the tapestry tells a story... and the story is our past.
the summer i killed my father, i was 10 years old.
my brother poe was 9, and my sister cisely had just turned 14.
and no sooner do we leave than mozelle has this vision of a child getting hit.
roz, you know i love my sister, but she's not unfamiliar with the inside of a mental hospital.
"tell this man you ain't going nowhere with him, so he can get the hell out of my house. "
mama was standing in the doorway of the kitchen, and she was holding her heart like this.
and sometimes i think there's no point at all, and that's the point.
all i know is most people's lives are a great disappointment to them.
i am guilty in the sense that i adore her, and i allowed her to adore me.
it was a sweet indulgence, but nothing in her behavior prepared me for what happened on the night of the storm.
hey, jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?
- i'll tell you what i'd like to do with it.
hey, jerry, do you want a flat edge on this molding or do you want me to bevel it?

that's a hell of a lot more than i can say for the 'cuda.
would you look at all the damn bullet holes in this thing.
nash said we were gonna take this nice trip up the coast and pick up a protected witness, you know?
and, uh, you'd only come in if he transported you personally.
so, then, we're gonna drop you in superior court in san francisco.
see, the hired killers part, that wasn't part of the story.
so, how long do you think it will be before a tow truck comes along here at random?
i'm gonna move that process along by doing something i haven't done in a while.
i mean, even when i looked like latino charles manson, no problem.
when was the last time you picked up a hitchhiker, bubba?
if we made an exception for you, we'd have to make an exception for everybody.
go in there, i'll have to cut your little fingers off.
they know we're gonna take the most direct route to the city.
my guess is they're probably parked up the road somewhere ready to take us out.
you're not fine, or you'd be here instead of calling to tell me why you're not.
stacy, you know that old train trestle near the point bonita battery where nick used to take us fishing?
oh, uh, enjoy the view, and, uh, let's hope the fog doesn't roll in.
kind of getting hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys, huh?

just like you could have told me there were experiments done on the gate in 1945.
my father headed up a research team that worked on the gate during the war.
if the goa'ulds haven't been to this planet, there is obviously a gate there.
then we would have unquestionable proof that they didn't build the stargates.
light years away, but still so close all this time, alive !
i think he's probably having a little trouble dealing with it too.
[ daniel ] a hundred and forty-six elements, letters or word symbols.
if they're letters, if they're pictographic, this could take a lifetime.
internal functions will convert and store that energy in capacitor-like reservoirs.
the inside wheel will only unlock and spin freely once there's enough reserve power.
it is the means by which the goa'uld enslave the jaffa.
i am not the only one among my people who believes this.
they serve as both incubators for their young and as their army.
an army made almost invulnerable by the restorative powers ... of the goa'uld larva they carry.
imagine the strategic advantage, sir ... if we could undermine the loyalty of the very group ... the goa'uld depend on to maintain their power.
how many of these other jaffa can you be sure of?
dammit teal'c, that's just what's going to ... happen if you go through that gate alone.
which is why i am inclined to authorise a mission ... to return to chulak and allow you to bring your son back.
if we are discovered ... you will be brought before apophis along with us.
well we'll just have to cross that bridge when we come to it.
they were about to lift the banishment so we could return to the city!
so you want this more for yourself than for our son?
it is one of the few worlds in all the galaxy ... with such an abundance.
yeah, but teal'c, if you recall, last time we were there...
i am not the only one among my people who believes this.
my first teacher, the jaffa master bra'tac ... he knew very well the goa'uld are false gods.
- the warrior jaffa class ... are the foundation of goa'uld power.
they serve as both incubators for their young and as their army.
teal'c claims there are other jaffa who believe in freedom ... from the goa'uld as much as he does.
imagine the strategic advantage, sir ... if we could undermine the loyalty of the very group ... the goa'uld depend on to maintain their power.
you know far too much about this command ... this facility, our defences.
i can't let that kind of knowledge fall into enemy hands.
no one has ever defied the goa'uld and lived to tell of it.
there was much talk in chulak of the warriors of earth.
do you know what i have endured ... to convince the priests we are still loyal?
they were about to lift the banishment so we could return to the city!
general west never offered because he probably didn't know they existed.
so... you don't know that they turned the gate on in 1945.
a doorway to heaven can mean any number of different things.
it could simply mean that anyone who passes through there will die.
it seems the planet in question is close to abydos, so it uses many of the same points in space as locators.
that's why the team in '45 could dial in without compensating for planetary shift.
"as long as she is here with me i will never feel alone."
"it seems impossible but every day we're here together i love her more."
we've only been able to speculate on the appearance and structure of an atom.
the fact that four completely alien races chose to represent it visually in an almost identical way...
a fancy light show that may be the key to our existence, or something like that.
uh, you wanna pick up the pace on this a little bit?
the element the gate is made up of absorbs energy directly.
internal functions will convert and store that energy in capacitor-like reservoirs but the inside wheel will only unlock and spin once there's enough reserve power.

he's hoping to get them to break formation so they'll go after the federation fighters.
he knows the jem'hadar will stand their ground, but the cardassians might just get angry enough to take the bait.
he's determined to get here and stop us from taking down this minefield.
now, i plan... to give sisko his opening... and then... close it on him.
but our bajoran allies might object to an arrest without cause.
if anyone asks we are merely holding them for questioning, hmm?
holding onto a prize as vast as the federation isn't going to be easy.
it's going to require an enormous number of ships a massive occupation army... and constant vigilance.
if you ask me the key to holding the federation... is earth.
if there's going to be an organized resistance against us its birthplace will be there.
perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life is that the bajoran people still refuse to appreciate how lucky they were to have me as their liberator.
i protected them in so many ways... cared for them as if they were my own children but to this day is there a single...
in exactly four minutes thousands of dominion ships will come pouring through that wormhole.
i just hope the defiant gets here in time for sisko to see it.
believe me, i don't want to die, but i have to do everything i can to prevent the dominion from conquering the alpha quadrant.
if that means sacrificing my life and the life of my crew so be it.
he wants them to break formation and go after the fighters.
the jem'hadar will stand their ground, but the cardassians might get angry and take the bait.
not with 2800 dominion ships waiting to come through that wormhole.
they won't be here for five hours, and need i remind you a lot can happen in that time.
perhaps the biggest disappointment in my life is that the bajoran people still refuse to appreciate how lucky they were to have me as their liberator.

tell the cortéz and the rest of the fleet to rendezvous at deep space 9.
all dominion personnel proceed to airlocks 4,7 and 12 for evacuation.
oh, illinois finally recognized the sacred bond between you and your hand.
just like the sacred bond between you and anyone with a shiny new penny.
dad, i just got a big infomercial for one of my new clients.
hey, hey, hey, now, does that mean that you're making money?
you know, i couldn't have done it without the support of my women's group.
one day, we all sat in a circle naked, but non-judgmental and then all six of us pulled out our hand mirrors and guess what happened?
not in so many words, but he blinked twice for "yes."
so you're saying you were proud of me for the way i tortured you?

you and all the other bastards... lucky enough to be here... children of sin, spawn of the damned... are all named for saints... saints who are disciplined, saints who are chaste.
you are named for john baptist rossi... a capuchin priest who gave away all his possessions.
won't happen, 'cause we're leaving tonight... this hearty brotherhood, on a crusade.
that's why i risked everything, agnes, my love... to bid you farewell.
russians are warming to the angry rhetoric... of former communist boss ivan tretiak.
now a billionaire oil magnate... and leader of his own political party...
my husband, he's sending me to england to live... until things change.
you are married not even a year... and already this bastard has a girlfriend?
and, uh, some of us feel the same way... about cold fusion... because it's there.
it's in nature... the raw, natural power just waiting to be harnessed.
there's more energy in one cubic mile of seawater... than in all the known oil reserves on earth.
i mean, you could drive your car 55 million miles... on a gallon of heavy water.
it would be the end of pollution... warmth for the whole world.
so why don't i demonstrate for you... why other people in the past have been so unsuccessful?
you're running away from... your past and your pain... and yet you keep it so close to you.
so you don't have to be afraid of who you are... because you're beautiful.
she disapproves of what i do, but eats the bread it buys her.
no heat for sale... but these clothes will make him warm.
as the number of deaths from freezing mounts... hundreds of thousands of protesters... have taken to the streets.
even as russian president karpov... is promising a mysterious solution... to the crippling heating-oil shortage... troops opposed to the elected government... and led by general leo sklarov... have begun to ring the russian capital city.
angry, frightened citizens... are gathering outside the kremlin in red square... but they're not braving the bitter cold... for yet another political rally.
they've been drawn here by the promise of a revelation... whatever that may be... in what's become a life-and-death struggle... for the future of democracy in russia.
many shocking documents were recovered... from the president's secret files... locked within his private safe.
the documents which will be published in today's papers... prove that the traitor karpov... was about to steal over 40 trillion... of our precious russian rubles... in a reckless scheme to save his hide!
the billionaire industrialist and his son, ilya,... were taken to the infamous lubyanka prison... where they await trial along with general leo sklarov.
moscow woke today to the forgotten sensation of warmth... as millions of gallons of heating oil... flowed from a storage depot discovered beneath tretiak's riverside mansion.
simon, if sainthood requires three miracles... then i'd say you've made it, my love... and so i hope you'll understand.
last night, it became clear what i have to do this morning.
we all know cold fusion has had a... a difficult childhood.
those of us in the field are orphans... bastards, at best.
donations totaling three billion dollars... were made today to the red cross.... the salvation army... and the united nations children's fund.
the funds were wired from the account... of jailed russian tycoon ivan tretiak.
here it comes now... sure as silence follows rain... the taste of you upon my lips... the fingers in my brain.
ever gentle... as it kills me where i lay... who am i to resist?
and how could you dare... to come so close... when you're just a ghost to me?
and i've got to get you out of my mind... but i can't escape from the feeling... as i... try to leave the memory behind.
you and all the other bastards... lucky enough to be here... children of sin, spawn of the damned... are all named for saints... saints who are disciplined, saints who are chaste.

now a billionaire oil magnate... and leader of his own political party...
tretiak predicted that the civil unrest engulfing russia... will only worsen, unless reformist president karpov... can overcome the heating-oil shortage... that has already killed scores of russians.
i was named for a saint who was a very wealthy man.
had the wine, women, songs... then took a vow of poverty and became a hermit... went to live in the forest...
i mean, you could drive your car 55 million miles... on a gallon of heavy water.
it would be the end of pollution... warmth for the whole world.
can't come all the way to russia... and not play russian roulette.
before you shoot me, want to know where the money is?
as the number of deaths from freezing mounts... hundreds of thousands of protesters... have taken to the streets.

simon, if sainthood requires three miracles... then i'd say you've made it, my love... and so i hope you'll understand.

russians are warming to the angry rhetoric... of former communist boss ivan tretiak.
now a billionaire oil magnate... and leader of his own political party...
my husband, he's sending me to england to live... until things change.
you are married not even a year... and already this bastard has a girlfriend?
and, uh, some of us feel the same way... about cold fusion... because it's there.
it's in nature... the raw, natural power just waiting to be harnessed.
there's more energy in one cubic mile of seawater... than in all the known oil reserves on earth.
i mean, you could drive your car 55 million miles... on a gallon of heavy water.
it would be the end of pollution... warmth for the whole world.
so why don't i demonstrate for you... why other people in the past have been so unsuccessful?
you're running away from... your past and your pain... and yet you keep it so close to you.
so you don't have to be afraid of who you are... because you're beautiful.
she disapproves of what i do, but eats the bread it buys her.
no heat for sale... but these clothes will make him warm.
even as russian president karpov... is promising a mysterious solution... to the crippling heating-oil shortage... troops opposed to the elected government... and led by general leo sklarov... have begun to ring the russian capital city.
angry, frightened citizens... are gathering outside the kremlin in red square... but they're not braving the bitter cold... for yet another political rally.
the documents which will be published in today's papers... prove that the traitor karpov... was about to steal over 40 trillion... of our precious russian rubles... in a reckless scheme to save his hide!
to add insult... millions of dollars were to be paid... to this international criminal!
i thought you were some old biddy... not some gorgeous soon-to-be-trillionaire.
you know you're going to be the richest woman in the world.
simon, if sainthood requires three miracles... then i'd say you've made it, my love... and so i hope you'll understand.
last night, it became clear what i have to do this morning.
if cold fusion is free, then you and i will be free.
if you think giving away everything before the world... preventing us from making an unimaginable fortune... will accomplish anything...
we all know cold fusion has had a... a difficult childhood.
those of us in the field are orphans... bastards, at best.
donations totaling three billion dollars... were made today to the red cross.... the salvation army... and the united nations children's fund.
the funds were wired from the account... of jailed russian tycoon ivan tretiak.
here it comes now... sure as silence follows rain... the taste of you upon my lips... the fingers in my brain.
ever gentle... as it kills me where i lay... who am i to resist?
and how could you dare... to come so close... when you're just a ghost to me?
and i've got to get you out of my mind... but i can't escape from the feeling... as i... try to leave the memory behind.
you and all the other bastards... lucky enough to be here... children of sin, spawn of the damned... are all named for saints... saints who are disciplined, saints who are chaste.
you are named for john baptist rossi... a capuchin priest who gave away all his possessions.
won't happen, 'cause we're leaving tonight... this hearty brotherhood, on a crusade.
that's why i risked everything, agnes, my love... to bid you farewell.

angry, frightened citizens... are gathering outside the kremlin in red square... but they're not braving the bitter cold... for yet another political rally.
they've been drawn here by the promise of a revelation... whatever that may be... in what's become a life-and-death struggle... for the future of democracy in russia.
many shocking documents were recovered... from the president's secret files... locked within his private safe.
the documents which will be published in today's papers... prove that the traitor karpov... was about to steal over 40 trillion... of our precious russian rubles... in a reckless scheme to save his hide!

moscow woke today to the forgotten sensation of warmth... as millions of gallons of heating oil... flowed from a storage depot discovered beneath tretiak's riverside mansion.
simon, if sainthood requires three miracles... then i'd say you've made it, my love... and so i hope you'll understand.
last night, it became clear what i have to do this morning.

i know grendel will try to destroy me before i can destroy him.
but the fact is, i'm the only guy who can expose him, smoke him out into the open.
if anyone's gonna get grendel, it'll be me, us, the police.
and we will get him in time, but we'll do it legally.
lester boyd was blown to bits by a bomb planted in his apartment.
'a fine man and a fine reporter was murdered for speaking the truth 'about nat grendel, 'boss of the international liveryman's union, 'who has added another murder to his list of crimes 'against his own union members and against the state.
what we have to do, hoppy, is figure out our next move.
you know, hoppy, the ways of the ungodly are fairly predictable.
right now, the important thing is to get a line on grendel's next move.
if he has ordered my execution, i'd like to know how, where and when.
you've had dozens beaten up by your thugs because they tried to vote you out and get an honest union boss.
lester boyd might've cut you down to size, but you had him blown to bits.
bunch of thick-headed cretins who aren't worth 60 cents a week.
i've got them $2.85 an hour and they should lick my boots for it.
a couple of days ago a fellow comes into my shop with a model airplane he wants me to repair.
and it's radio controlled so he can fly it two miles away.
i wouldn't talk to you about something i couldn't make work.
come to my shop tomorrow and i'll give you a demonstration.
i've known lester all my life, the boyds moved next door to us when i was nine.
i guess i fell in love with him on the spot.
it was the same way at college - parties, dances, formals.
i don't think i'll be able to face it without him.
trouble is, after what happened to boyd, how to put a bomb in templar's apartment without his knowing it?
what if your men planted two bombs, one that templar was meant to find.
it takes longer to get from new jersey to idlewild than to get from idlewild to paris.
what's more, i know i'm gonna be airsick all the way across.
why always do the police ask the questions when they already know the answer?
since 20 years, i am concierge here and never have the police asked one question which they couldn't answer themselves.
there are servants of the republic, of whom i am one, whose job is to concern themselves with crime.
we do not allow private individuals to take over duties of the police.
and miss north will not be having dinner with you tomorrow.
the minute we shook hands i had a hunch about him.
human interest story - brother and sister to be reunited after 20 years.
so anyone reading paris papers would know about the brione family.
ever since that night of the drop, i have dreamed of finding this man.
when he came out of prison, finistère and i and... another - he is a high official now - we swore that one day we would find this man and kill him.
when your father gave you the medal, did he say anything about it?
did he tell you to look for any kind of message?
once there were 30 men, waiting in a clearing in the woods before dawn.
they had flashlights hooked up to an car battery to guide a plane.
"one half of the 500,000 francs on deposit in my name
"in account number 48976 at the swiss national bank in geneva."
here in italy, it's worse because you have to go through customs when you're leaving the country.
every innocent tourist is suspected of having a painting up his sleeve to sell in switzerland.
the result of all this official suspicion is that every italian leaving rome airport is just a little bit nervous.
take that couple over there, the man and woman with a teenage son.
- monsieur templar, if i choose, i can send you from switzerland at once.
i do not so choose, you will remain in geneva until i do.
alfredo, you're 16, you've suffered your first tragedy, don't lash out blindly at people.
i know she planned this or she'd have told me what was in the briefcase!
signora, your husband was coming to my house tonight at eight.
a very important client of mine has arrived in geneva and i must meet him at his hotel at eight.
inspector, i've no right to interfere but i may be able to help.
mr templar, i know your reputation, poor garcia has already met justice.
they know i have the briefcase but they think they're in the clear.
now, suppose i do everything they expect but add a little bit more?
i don't know why a pearl is so fascinating, but all through history men have robbed, cheated... and even killed for them.
the cultured ones come pretty close, but nothing ever quite matches the real thing.
but our story is that we came to santa domingo just for game fishing.
to make sure everybody believes it, we're not going near those oyster beds for a week.
i was more disappointed than sore because i 'd always figured brad ryan for a thoroughly honest guy.
however, they were written off as a couple of con men and forgotten.
" i 've found the pearls and i want to pay back everyone who trusted me.
"please come to santa domingo to a bar called the cantina de les flores.
no, but this place takes a lot of keepi ng up and i move i n expensive ci rcles.
if brad has found the pearls, there might be a big payoff.
many people in santa domingo think of her as an angel.
if anything should happen to make her sad, or if she was hurt in any way, you would be killed, señor.
letting consuela keep me on what she earns as a waitress.
a doctor said i might get my sight back if i could get to a specialist.
it has something to do with beauty being in the eye of a beholder.
or being able to see the kingdom of heaven... in a mustard seed.
you and all the other bastards lucky enough to be here children of sin, spawn of the damned are all named for saints saints who are disciplined, saints who are chaste.
you are named for john baptist rossi a capuchin priest who gave away all his possessions.
won't happen, 'cause we're leaving tonight this hearty brotherhood, on a crusade.
that's why i risked everything, agnes, my love to bid you farewell.
now a billionaire oil magnate and leader of his own political party
tretiak predicted that the civil unrest engulfing russia will only worsen, unless reformist president karpov can overcome the heating-oil shortage that has already killed scores of russians.
i was named for a saint who was a very wealthy man.
had the wine, women, songs then took a vow of poverty and became a hermit went to live in the forest, in the nude.
i mean, you could drive your car 55 million miles on a gallon of heavy water.
it would be the end of pollution warmth for the whole world.
she disapproves of what i do, but eats the bread it buys her.
no heat for sale but these clothes will make him warm.
i have run every test on this cold fusion formula and must conclude it is not merely incomplete but rather... impossible.
you may as well try to create perpetual motion, mr. tretiak.
from here to the airport are 3 army checkpoints all of them loyal to us.
make certain they get the message-- she doesn't leave moscow alive.
still, no one's guessed the simple truth of where the heating oil went.
who would believe that a sea of oil was hidden under this very building?
as the number of deaths from freezing mounts hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets.
even as russian president karpov is promising a mysterious solution to the crippling heating-oil shortage troops opposed to the elected government and led by general leo sklarov have begun to ring the russian capital city.
angry, frightened citizens are gathering outside the kremlin in red square but they're not braving the bitter cold for yet another political rally.

i thought you were some old biddy not some gorgeous soon-to-be-trillionaire.
you know you're going to be the richest woman in the world.
simon, if sainthood requires three miracles then i'd say you've made it, my love and so i hope you'll understand.
last night, it became clear what i have to do this morning.
even though some of you may feel that its practical application is still somewhat speculative
i've come here today to share how that dream is slowly becoming a reality.
donations totaling 3 billion dollars were made today to the red cross the salvation army and the united nations children's fund.
the funds were wired from the account of jailed russian tycoon ivan tretiak.
just the journey and 3 nights in a hotel for the competition.
but you know... you have to be picked for france first.
the coefficient of the slant had been low but now it was rising.
and i realized that the slant was inverted and the angle was sharper.
why didn't you tell me what you wanted 3000 francs for?
the moment you saw me you thought i was bad and you assumed i was a whore.
i wanted to go too fast, like a kid tugging a plant to make it grow faster.
i should have been patient and waited for you to love me.
it joins a point on the inner surface to the outer without changing sides.
run your finger along the inside of the strip, you're inside... keep going and bingo!
just the journey and 3 nights in a hotel for the competition.
but you know... you have to be picked for france first.
there are only 24 hours in a day, if you miss the beginning you're lost, it's like tv.
they wonder why i'm not rich with such a clever girl.
we've discussed the real body, there's a complex body too, an even more abstract notion.
a beautiful construction, purely mathematical... you'll never find it in nature.
i thought i'd smothered the pain but it kept coming back, worse than ever.
the coefficient of the slant had been low but now it was rising.
would i be here because a guy asked me for a light?
be careful, kid, an accusation of sexual abuse is very serious.
i tried to imagine them, the others, without the smooth foreheads that never reflected troubles, the acne that disgusts me,
the plump rosy cheeks that i find obscene, the wide eyes that see nothing.

i did "william tell," taking the risk that the average philistine wouldn't.
all this idiot had to do was shoot the apple from in between my legs.
they do the same thing as the antibiotics you're used to.
i remember when it used to be an elephant gun of penicillin in the ass.
i have to lay off some of the staff including two pas.
the fairest way to do that is to give preference to those with seniority.
i think you might just possess the extreme bullheaded stubbornness to make this clinic thing work.
how would you like some seed money to start you off?
you know, someone ought to put that nutcase out of his misery.
you keep talking about our king like that, and both of us will hang.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
you saw what he did to palamedes and the old man at the well, and next time somebody could die.
augeus is still a human being and not totally responsible for his actions, and--
the people just feel you've neglected them, and, to tell the truth, you have.
let's see you try to keep the whole world in bed and out of trouble.
seemed like i was the only one who could reason with him.
now i don't think anyone can-- not me, not even you.
mint the coins, have your friend draw hercules's image on them.
hey, could he do a charcoal rendering on a burlap sack?
if you want to marry a prince, that i can do, but this is totally out of my league.
how can you just let him die like this, after all we've done to honor you?
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
i gotta get to that temple..., ...make a deal for the broken statue, and find a forge to melt it down.
i would think twice before messing around with anything of aphrodite's, ok?
you saw what he did to palamedes, and... the old man at the well..., ...and... next time, somebody could die.
augeus is still a human being and not... totally responsible for his actions, and...
when we were younger, he looked up to me like an older brother.
it seemed like i was the only one who could reason with him.
and then she told me that she said that i never even said that..., ...which is totally not true.
so i told athena to tell artemis that if she didn't return the sandals she borrowed, i was going...
you won't have a life if that statue's still standing when the king gets back.
general machus, we know king augeus hasn't been well, but... he has to realize--
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
i can't tell you how much it would mean to me to get your endorsement... on this augean stables manure.
i agreed to introduce you to the stable master, that's all.
i know you have a problem, but that's no way to solve it.
you saw what he did to palamedes and the old man at the well, and next time somebody could die.
you know, when we were younger, he looked up to me like an older brother.
seemed like i was the only one who could reason with him.
[ moaning ] and then she told me that she said that i never said that, which is totally not true.
so i told athena to tell artemis that if she didn't return the sandals she borrowed,
and you really think you can control lightning with a piece of copper?
[ chuckles ] old buddy, you've taken too many blows to the head.
i don't mean to be a pest, but the last time i checked, it was getting dark.
we have to move him to the center of the atrium.
this is gettin' a little nuts and i don't know what to do.
let me leave it up to the audience here in the studio.
i was an all-state halfback, and no offense, but three of you couldn't take me down.
why don't you just admit that you're obsessed with winning, man?
were i to lose, it would upset the balance of the universe.
but that's good, because my priority is helping the mayor win this election.
can't you see the yellow river's water, keeps flowing into the sea without returning?
can't you see the mourning of those, with grey hair before the mirror?
do as i tell you or i'll destroy your ashes, and you'll evaporate like thin air.
tonight... get me a living being... to increase my vitality, and lengthen my span of life
because of the chaotic situation, the people in town have all left.
the haunted sound at night, are made by those stray ghost.
i don't want to go without you, but king lias' message said the ceremony is tomorrow.
i'll have to push argo pretty hard to make it there myself.
i mean, i was very fierce when i took them out and...
listen, as far as your skin is concerned it reminds me of cream.
now i know what it's like to be admired by beautiful women and brave men.
now that things are back to normal, i know what i am.
"this one on your land blocks my view of the river."
"who would wanna look at a stupid river, when you could look at me?

why don't you just give him that stupid "world's greatest boss trophy" on your desk?
and we'll pay him a visit with one of the city hall santas.
mike, you let them go when you cut the holiday budget.
no one leaves here until i find out who ate king nebuchadnezzar.
james, just replace him with a kitkat and get on with your life.
there must be a way for us to take the golden hind.
for the gold in those horns and hooves..., it's worth a little risk.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
oh, well, you're only looking at her mentor, master, and former trainer.
i wish i was looking at you on the end of this rope...
you know, you can quit looking for hercules, 'cause he's not coming back.
i mean, even if he does he's marrying, you know, goatgirl, or whatever.
the gold in those horns and hooves-- it's worth a little risk.
[ man #3 ] if you think going against the hind and ares is a little risk, go ahead.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
i mean, even if he does, he's marrying, you know, goatgirl or whatever.
where are they gonna have the wedding, the chapel at the zoo?
but the weirdest thing about space is that a lot of what you're looking at isn't really there.
the light from the most distant stars has taken such a colossal time to get here, the real stars are long dead.
it's as if the telescope that produced these pictures were a kind of time machine showing you a view of the universe as it once was billions and billions of years ago.
but maybe the most spine-tingling of all these ancient pictures is this one.
this is the outer edge of the universe, so this light started towards us just after the very beginning.
thing is, one day will we see past that outer edge, back to before the bang?
to start with, getting up here to rendezvous with hubble involves some very strange rules of orbital dynamics.
catch up doesn't just mean firing your engines, because that puts you up into a higher orbit.
you have too in medication, plastics, photography, rubber, all kinds of stuff... and one rather special use.
because long before hydrazine got used to spin the shuttle in space, one of the greatest crises in history triggered the need for that other thing hydrazine can do.
see, this is hydrazine country, because that's the other thing hydrazine does:
knocks off the fungus growth that can spoil your agribusiness day.
so in 1882 in the bordeaux vineyards, here comes a professor of botany from the local university worrying about the end of civilization as we know it.
and then he notices something strange that gets the little gray cells doing overtime.
so our professor hightails it back to bordeaux and comes up with a modified version, the first ever fungicide you could spray on, the ancestor of all fungicides, like hydrazine, in the modern world.
now, this is not the first french wine crisis but the third.
and the last time this got loose in the vineyards, it was jump-out-of-the-window time, mes amis.
by 1880, half the vines in france are dead from phylloxera, and panic isn't the word.
that's lots of places... more is going to happen to your plane than an oil change and a top up.
as everybody knows, hygiene is practically a religion in switzerland, so the phrase you're likely to hear next is "let us spray."
the idea is basically a good one, and eventually it catches on.
and that is why all over the world today your plane is often much cleaner than you think it is... and everything on board, even a letter from your old granny.
okay, let's hold the mail for a moment and see where we are.
black holes in space are seen by hubble, serviced by the space shuttle, fueled by hydrazine.
that's also a fungicide first invented during the french phylloxera disaster caused by these little aphids, the reason for the 1878 swiss quarantine convention, which is why your plane gets sprayed these days and everything on it,
including a letter from your old granny, which is only there at all thanks to something else to benefit back then from the conventional swiss:
they can each keep the money they make from selling their own stamps.
with the money thing settled, that leaves only the money thing:
anyway, henry and william blow away their competitors, because they invent the cash-on delivery idea and because they have the fastest route to the west coast by ship and cutthroat prices.
so by 1859, wells and fargo are, so to speak, alone in the field... in more senses than one.
the reason you might be here in the emptiness is because of the colorado gold strikes and because the people here and the guys in the california gold fields want to hear from back east more than once every few months.
so the overland route started to look more attractive to misters wells and fargo, and this is what they do about that.
in 1859, they find a few lunatics in bars in the middle of nowhere happy to ride forever to some other middle of nowhere... places like this, right?
all the required orphans need... besides a touch of insanity and a six-gun... is a good horse and an undeveloped sense of self-preservation.
the pony express only lasts for 16 months, but it becomes a legend.
20 riders cover the 2,000 miles to sacramento and back at full gallop, risking death every step of the way.
the greatest legend of them all is a 15-year-old kid who rides the most dangerous stretch.
coming into three crossings, wyoming, one day, he hears that the rider for the next stage has been killed.
so he changes his horses the way they did, hardly touching the ground and rides on... 384 miles nonstop, the longest pony express ride ever recorded.
and then the telegraph comes along and spoils all the fun.
the kind of entertainment that starts here in the 15th century:
drinking songs... the same kind of naughty stuff that turns up 300 years later in american vaudeville acts.
the most famous writer of these numbers is a guy called olivier basselin, who tops the charts because he writes about the same thing every time:
wine, women, and song and people having a good time... unlike basselin himself, who has a really bad time, when he comes to a sticky end just down the road from vire in this area at a place called formigny in 1450,
here's the english army patrolling like they've been doing since they invaded this bit of france 300 years earlier when a french army suddenly comes out of nowhere.
now, english bowmen have the laser weapons of the period, so this is going to be a pushover... when suddenly the french produce a couple of the very latest cannon and start pounding the brits.
the english send out their green beret types to grab the cannon.
they're on their way back with them when french reinforcements turn up.
with drinking songs written by that guy who gets killed in a battle between the french and the english, okay?
now, the french finally chuck the english out of france, because they're led to victory by a crazy woman.
she's having visions and hearing the voices of what she describes as saints.
there is one version of that condition that would produce hallucinatory symptoms of this type.
they're a superstitious lot back then, burning witches pretty much every afternoon.
there have also been prophecies about a young girl saving the country.
well, she wins all the battles and puts the wimp on the throne.
and the backstabbers sell her down the river to the english.
they make mincemeat of her at what we would call a mistrial.
so she goes to the stake and is burned to death in 1431.
top of the league in this kind of friendly persuasion are the spanish.
of course, they've had a lot of practice on the well-to-do jewish community.
see, back in 1492, the uptight northern spanish christians take over southern spain from the laid-back southern spanish muslims.
now, the new christian rulers prevented jews from working in anything but finance, so guess what?
but the vast majority of them come here, where they know they'll be treated like human beings, even like talented and valuable human beings.
because although in here this place is jewish, out there this place is islamic... and tolerant and in deep trouble.
the economy in turkey is so bad they've been advertising for help.
so in the 16th century, 1/4 of a million exiled jews turn up here.
one of these guys is a fellow called joseph nasi, born in portugal, chucked out, spent some time in holland in the family plank.
in 1554, he comes here to istanbul, meets up with his aunt grace, who is a financial hotshot... and already well in with the turkish sultan,
suleiman the magnificent... and more important with his influential favorite wife, roxelane.
so with aunt grace's help, joseph nasi is in like flynn.
see, suleiman is running the biggest empire since rome on three continents.
and the problem is, his bureaucrats are "a:" corrupt and " b:" wouldn't know a balance sheet if they fill in one.
by 1560, joe is virtually suleiman's foreign minister living in a posh palace here on the bosporus and with his eye on greater things, like being king of cyprus, where the best wine comes from and where he wants the booze export monopoly.
in 1566, suleiman kicks the bucket, and his wimpy son, salim, takes over, which means that joe nasi's really running the entire show.
mind you, if you can survive the intrigue here at the sultan's top-copy palace, you can survive anything.
so by this time, joe nasi is flavor of the month.
his only mistake is that business about persuading the turks to grab cyprus, because that gets the europeans so ticked off they set up a league to do something about it.
and basically what that means is, any minute now everything for the turks is about to hit the fan, because one of the european allies is a bunch you wouldn't want to meet on a dark night.
meet the knights of malta and their new home, the island of malta.
by 1565, these guys have made so much trouble for the turks that they decide enough is enough and send in a humungous military force to wipe them out and fail, because the knights have nothing to lose and nowhere to go.
so eventually, the turks give up and go home, leaving the knights to enjoy their posh new grid pattern city and look after their wounded in the 16th-century equivalent of a high-tech emergency clinic.
this knights of malta hospital is way out on the cutting edge.
useful stuff to know if you spend the other half of your time slicing people up.
ironic that, because the knights get their medical know-how from somebody else who makes a specialty of slicing people up.
all the students stand around up there in the galleries while down here in the well at the bottom the lecturer does interestingly new things to corpses.
see, up to the time of vesalius, anatomy is pretty much anybody's guess.
you can't operate without killing people, so there hasn't been much interest in how your body actually works.
so the new anatomy they're about to teach here, thanks to vesalius, is a much bigger deal than you might think.
see, up till now, about all they've been able to teach is what the greeks and romans knew, which wasn't much.
that's why 16th-century doctors are still into cures like boiled poppy, lily oil, and minced earthworms.
and the reason why you couldn't buy the original book today for a million bucks is because back then
vesalius gets his illustrations done at the studio of an an unknown young painter, a guy who is so good at flesh tones, he'd turn on a mortician:
joan of arc leads the french to victory and is then burnt by the inquisition, who make life in spain so difficult for the jews that most of them run away to turkey, where one of them, joe nasi,
persuades them to attack the knights of malta, who look after their wounded in the best hospital around at the time because of the know-how that vesalius comes up with in his great anatomy book illustrated by titian, who's coming up next.
this is titian, and he lives here in 16th-century venice, a knockout city with more liquid assets than it has water.
now, the thing about having lots of money is that venice is so rich and powerful it doesn't really give a rat's ass about what the pope thinks.
so venetian wanna-bes commissioned people like titian to come up with portraits that will make them good-iooking.
that's why titian's portraits are a totally new kind of thing.
now, back then, this kind of stuff makes titian instantly famous.
and in no time at all, he's graduated from naked models to the real movers and shakers.
his portrait of pope paul iii makes it a cinch that he's going to do the ultimate biggie:
holy roman emperor charles v, who invites titian to come visit.
so they've got all the metal they need for people like charles v to go to war with, including, strangely enough, metal to make armor with.
i say "strangely enough," because what would you be doing on a battlefield wearing armor when, by this time, the name of the game is shooting people with guns?
remember him... does charles' portrait after the battle, kind of come-as-you-are, like this.
and as you can see from charles v here, he would never make it to battle in parade armor.
i mean, they screw you into it, which is another reason why we're here, because it is another little-known tourist fact about augsburg:
that it is the home of the metal screw, in places like this.
they're tiny jewelry screws originally, because the other thing that augsburg is full of besides iron is precious metal.
so the other thing you come to augsburg for, besides a portrait, is jewelry... or both.
in 1550, one of augsburg's famous goldsmith shops gets a commission from king henry of france to send somebody to paris to help with a little monetary scam
henry's dreamed up, the idea being that the shop also sends along one of their new screw-operated coin-making machines as well so that henry can turn out new coins of the realm that are not what they appear to be, called henrys.
when she marries king henry in 1533, she turns france into the food capital of the world it is today, with rave new ideas like forks, table settings, good wine, pasta, and fancy sauces.
then when dinner is over, another amazing new indulgence of which catherine is also probably the first user:
toothache, flatulence, sores, pregnancy pains, itching, halitosis, tetanus, and, believe it or not, a bad cough.
now, the great news for the governments of europe is that the new commodity is apparently addictive.
most of the immigrants getting off the boat in america in the 17th century are single young men with no jobs back home in england, where life has been real fun.
i mean, you mention out loud words like "freedom of movement, religious tolerance, justice for all, a chance to get ahead in life,"
the barbados plantation owners only want slaves, which leaves places like this.
historic st. mary's city in maryland, the only place for a fellow with no resume to make a buck.
all you need is a case of severe desperation... and a hoe to clear the weeds, a few seeds, a lot of luck, and 18-hour days.
all you do is plant and crop and move on, living in one-room wooden huts.
you sleep on the floor, eat meat and vegetable stew and corn bread, and drink booze.
and that's all you do, night and day, summer and winter, till you die at around age 45.
where they set up a tobacco-growing colony, where colonists get to work themselves into an early grave.
well, back then, life is pretty nasty, except for the people at the other end of this economic process making a million:
okay, to multiply 32 by 16, add the little numbers, and look this up in your log tables.
to do division, you do the same but subtract the little numbers.
in 1618, this is automated by the amazing new slide rule invented by william oughtred.
find your numbers by swiveling the pointers like this, and bottom right is the result.
oughtred's slide rule is made for him by one of the hottest instrument makers of the 17th century.
his name is elias allen, and he also happens, at one time, to be a mover and shaker in the clock maker's company of london, who never get around to building their own banqueting hall,
so they have their little annual dinners in the lord mayor of london's.
now, the clock makers start up just when the timekeeping business is really getting into the swing of things, with the amazing new high-tech wonder machine from holland invented by that swinging genius, christian huygens, the pendulum clock.
so being french, he turns his genius to vitally important matters like food and comes up with a gizmo you'll love if you love steamed potatoes.
papin previously fooled around with steam engines, so he knows all about stuff like air pressure and steam, right?
you're going to boil the water, and you're going to boil the food.
but you're going to do it with the lid screwed down tight under pressure with a pressure escape valve.
get into the food from the air, this after he's done tests leaving food lying around.
pasteur takes his bugs and submits them to every known torture:
and today we do it to milk products... and in hospitals to surgical instruments, in machines not a million miles away from that thing papin invented.
remember the pressure cooker, in medical circles known as an autoclave.
in tubes running through the back of the fridge... or an air conditioner, which is why this bar is nice and chilly.
just what you need when you're working in the steamy tropics.
harrison's freezing machines also get used to chill down paraffin oil.
if you get the temperature low enough, some of the paraffin goes solid.
and what that does is make possible something so commonplace that you probably don't consciously see it even when you use it.
so here we are about to end the show with an invisible object.
world war ii makes instant coffee a real flyer, so the instant the war is over, instant coffee is going to be an instant industry, which leaves only one small problem.
the k-rations are going to be great for the troops down there...
that's why for every soldier in the field, there are three people back at supply tearing their hair out because nobody's where they were last time you looked, because the army's mechanized in tanks and trucks.
and the reason i'm showing you this particular bit of film... notice every other shot is of a jeep?
an amazing bit of vehicular pizzazz that'll go anywhere and do anything.
and there is no terrain it can't go into or get out of.
so at the end of every day, the last thing that moves is a jeep, carrying supplies out to the front line.
and this is where the rock meets the hard place, because as this little wonder machine races along, it's creating the problem it's suppose to solve.
of the 27 pounds of supplies every american soldier needs every day just to go on fighting, over half is gasoline.
if the allies are to win the war, this is a problem that has to be cracked.
cracking is the petroleum industry equivalent of getting blood out of a stone:
getting refined product from oil and then doing it again with the same oil and then doing it again and again and again and again.
and what they get up to is a very attractive proposition.
the attraction in question is the attraction that molecules have for each other.
now, this marvel of industrial revolution technology kicks off a movement back then that will one day in the modern world give its name to the kind of people who hate technology with a passion, the luddites.
so you just know something bad is going to happen to this machine.
now, this may look like nothing more than dirty work at the crossroads to you, but back then, the punishment for doing something like this is hanging.
so you know these are desperate men here, men with starving children and the whole power of the state against them, including the army.
so there's nothing romantic about what these luddites leave behind them.
well, there's one romantic bit, which i'll get to after a brief catch-up on where we are so far.
instant coffee gets off the ground in world war ii, when artificial rubber is invented and so are nylons, made on machines like these original ones being smashed by the luddites, whose actions are defended by the romantic guy we're about to get to.
he's a young, 24-year-old nobody that nobody's ever heard of, and his emotional defense of the luddites in the british parliament sounds like something you could have heard on the hill yesterday.
and then it all goes down the toilet, because his frontier contact just doesn't turn up.
i mean, there he is with 45 camel loads of illegal cotton goods and no client.
fortunately for him, a friendly local turk takes it off him at cost.
galt chucks the whole thing up, comes back here to istanbul, takes the first boat home to fame and fortune as a novelist i bet you've never heard of.
now, the blockade has previously got the brits into other kinds of difficulties at sea.
another problem for the brits during that war is the americans.
they don't seem to like being chased around by british ships claiming that the yanks are carrying
british deserters on board, which the brits claim they need back to help with the war effort, about which the americans could care less.
ready to cross the atlantic from norfolk, virginia, with four of these "deserters" on board.
so the british navy boards the ship with some cock-and-bull story about wanting to send mail back to their granny in england, whip out their guns, and it all gets very nasty, with people killed and stuff.
now, why the brits at the time are making jokes about americans and mincemeat.
let me use a modern analogy to show you why the brits are so cocksure.
which is why a young american lawyer, who happens to be out here on a boat doing prisoner exchange and gets caught up in events, stays up all night watching 1,800 british bombs and rockets reduce american defenders to what will undoubtedly be... abject surrender, old boy.
except come the dawn and the time for the white flag, what the americans actually run up the flagpole at fort mchenry isn't actually white.
...in heav'n, where he sat in full glee, where he sat in full glee.
now, i don't want to make a big deal about the "star-spangled banner" being english, so let me tell you a bit about the original song.
okay, now for that strange name these boozers give themselves, the anacreon society.
anacreon turns out to be the name of a 6th-century b.c. ancient greek poet who, like these guys, is into erotica, alcohol, and general misbehavior.
because of the way literature back in the 16th century is not exactly easy to get at.
back then, it's pretty easy to find your friendly local library.
so henri hightails it back to geneva with the manuscript to become the greatest european publisher of greek lit ever.
and that's how those london boozers get to hear about anacreon.
so scaliger gets a grip on things with a giant chronology to pinpoint everything.
he takes the 28-year solar cycle, multiplies it by the 19-year lunar cycle, and multiplies that by the 15-year ancient roman tax cycle.
so, for example, what we call 2000 is 239 solar cycles plus 21 days,
353 lunar cycles plus 6 days, 447 tax cycles plus 8 days.
he must have felt like taking a gun and pulling the trigger.
which is something his dutch boss, prince maurice, is good at... well, getting troops to.
the other new thing at the time is muskets with paper cartridges.
you just bite off the end, pour in a measured charge.
you pound a weak spot in the enemy ranks with heavy cannon fire.
then you send the cavalry into the confusion to mop up.
gustavus' armies win all their battles with this new trick, because sweden has tons of iron and copper, essential raw materials you need when you want to be good at killing people, a talent that, as you will see, runs in gustavus' family.
that's why we are now in sunny italy with the next king of sweden, a woman... but swedish monarchs are all called "king"... named christina, who's good at killing people.
descartes thinks the universe works a bit like this modern water supply control center, because back then, water power runs everything.
so descartes thinks of everything... plants, animals, people... like machines operating on some kind of fluid power moving their bodies with valves and pumps and stuff, sending fluid along tubes to make your muscles work.
he even takes this mechanical approach to the way the human brain works.
and since your brain controls your body, he reckons it's a kind of fluid control center, like this one is, sending fluids down the nerves.
the wonderful thing about the past is, you have to keep remembering the real world around them.
i mean, these guys live at a time when they punish criminals by cutting them into four pieces.
the first modern view of the brain, which bit does what.
and willis is the first person to finger this bit as having something to do with running your autonomic functions:
willis' draftsman friend is a superegghead in a century of eggheads.
apart from this little job, he's also expert in astronomy, math, optics, weather forecasting, and submarines.
as you can see, he's also hot stuff on the drawing board and at the real thing... in this case, st. paul's cathedral, london, of which he is the architect.
sir christopher wren, who gets the job when he's only 36.
all you have to do is persuade investors to buy shares in one of the newly invented banks.
it's the french who try it first, persuaded by the guy who thinks up this nifty new idea, a scotsman called john law.
john law has persuaded the french, whose economy is going down the toilet fast, by the way, to start using an amazing new thing called paper money.
in 1717, thanks to john law, on any french street, you can also buy shares in his new offshore investment properties.
take a look at this evidence of how to get filthy rich.
it's the poster john law designs to act as a prospectus for what is touted to be an unequaled opportunity to make a killing.
and law uses the cash to found a capital city in his overseas investment paradise, called louisiana, and naturally gives the city a french name, new orleans.
well, three years later, law has introduced the word "millionaire" into the language, has taken the title duke of arkansas, and is about as rich as you can get... when things go, inevitably, right down the toilet.
now, you'd think the french reaction to this mess would be to ship their financial advisors off to prison somewhere and take austerity measures.
instead, they do something totally insane, which i'll get to after we stop for a quick catch-up.
the key player in what happens then, a french guy called caron de beaumarchais.
at some point, the french secret service recruits beaumarchais, and in 1776, he goes on a mission...
so the french set him up with this fake company at this secret location in paris.
stage one infiltration of french agents into british america begins with the top-secret purchase of 25,000 muskets, 200 cannon, and gunpowder for the american rebels, and this document, congressional approval of undercover french military advisors, then troops, then ships, then a navy blockade.
necker's daughter marries and becomes madame de stael, well-known as the author of a book on german culture and a general pain in the ass.
most of her life is spent in bedrooms with more lovers than she can count and with crowds of fans who sit around in the same bedroom while she holds forth on any subject you'd care to name.
to stir things up even further, schlegel's wife has run off with one of his fellow romantic gurus, that guy up there, the thinking woman's fancy,
friedrich von schelling, who applies the romantic principal to everything and invents a new buzzword:
it's at this point that von baer chickens out of the symmetry business and starts the work that i've been making all those bad jokes about.
after years of eyestrain, staring down the microscope at the most minute detail of bits of chicken... you're getting the point...
see those folds running along the center of the embryo tissue?
von baer reckons they roll up into nerves and spinal column.
okay, blindingly obvious to you, but remember, back then, nobody knows this stuff, especially the really big news von baer comes out with and that if you look very carefully at the way embryos develop...
in the case of humans, along the way, we pass through stages that in lower life-forms would be the fully developed stage... with gills, for instance, and a temporary but well-developed tail.
von baer's ideas to the scientific establishment does so after he's been at sea for a number of years.
he does his work in places that are holiday destinations today:
so he spends most of four years, between 1846 and 1850, splashing about in the water every time they park the boat.
well, her majesty's ship "rattlesnake," actually, which is doing an absolutely gripping survey of the south seas.
is the humble jellyfish, lower and simpler than which it is difficult to find, connected in some way to chickens?
and maybe even cats, dogs, apes, and maybe even... well, i bet you're there ahead of me when i say that huxley takes his ideas back to england, where he finds himself agreeing with a guy
who's saying that this is all true but the process includes human beings, as well, and getting into deep doo-doo with the church, who don't like at all the idea of connecting humans with animals.
ladies and gentlemen, in the blue corner, theological champeen for the church of england,
inspires the book on brains by willis, illustrated by the architect of st. paul's, christopher wren, who's into investments like the louisiana scam that ruins france and the french finance minister, whose daughter is the opinionated de stael,
whose romantic pals get huxley into jellyfish so he can defend the theory of evolution that survives to become the evolutionary explanation for everything and proving, as i said at the start, that life is no picnic.
a show that travels across the great web of knowledge, through space and time, to find the strangest connections between things... and all that stuff you've heard before.
i suppose in a way, you know, the whole "connections" concept is a product of the technology.
because back before the technology, you couldn't have seen life that way.
i mean, the way everything is connected... because back then, it wasn't.
and when you go anywhere, see anybody, buy anything, break a law, tell a lie, catch a cold... it knows.
and on the network, it doesn't matter where you do that.
feedback is what stops this happening, because it stops this happening.
german missiles going just too fast for people on the ground to hit... until feedback, the magic idea thought up by m.i.t. and bell labs for tracking the missile;
and then using fancy math to predict from the radar data where the missile is likely to be a few seconds from now.
then you keep feeding those predictions to the guys trying to shoot the missile down.
so instead of shooting at where the thing is, they shoot at where it's going to be.
by 1943, the predictors, as they're called, are able to do this.
appropriate, really, when you think of where the idea of feedback came from in the first place.
it's all due to a guy who is a french winemaker and who happens to find out what goes on inside you when you do things, i'm happy to say, like this.
ironic that it should have inspired claude bernard to do the awful things he did... coming up, after another minute or so of this enjoyable tourist stuff.
right in the middle of the beaujolais country, this is that guy's vineyard, and that over there's his house.
claude bernard, who's a doctor as well as a winemaker, notices something rather funny about, well, rabbit wee-wee.
he discovers that if you give a rabbit regular meals to eat, its urine is cloudy and alkaline.
but if a rabbit's had no food for a while, its urine goes clear and acid.
this earth-shattering observation gets claude bernard all excited about stomachs and gastric juices and other such internal matters.
and here in his farmhouse, he decides to take a closer, more scientific look.
and he finds out about the way that rabbits and humans automatically switch to living off their fat if they don't get any food.
and it's from physiologists working on homeostasis that those wartime predictor people you saw get their ideas for those antiaircraft feedback fire controls systems, remember?
oh, while we're here, take a look at the kind of science
giant glass containers for boiling and condensing and reducing... kind of science as cookery almost.
and then you write it all up in pen and ink, because this is before even typewriters.
see, claude's discovery of how your insides work is great news for medicine but not such great news for rabbits or guinea pigs, dogs, frogs, cats, rats, horses, or any of the many experimental animals
that young medical students now start to investigate the workings of... in the interest of discovery or of just getting qualified.
the real movers and shakers in antivivisection at the time are the english, because up to now, they've treated animals worst of anybody and have now decided it's time to develop a soft spot for man's best friends.
so as early as 1822, there's a society for the protection of animals from vivisection.
a place famous for its ancient castle and even more famous for its lousy winter weather.
rarely lousier than at 5:00 in the morning on september the 7th, 1838, when a luxury steamer with 68 people on board, heading for scotland, breaks up in a humungous storm out there off the farne islands.
and everybody goes down except for nine people clinging to the rocks and, fortunately for them, spotted by the young daughter of the local lighthouse man.
the girl, grace darling, and her dad, make two death-defying trips, rescue all the survivors, and trigger massive public support for more of the same.
as a result of which, if you're ever clinging to the rocks, with a bit of luck, this will happen.
lifeboats is what grace darling starts, and early on, they look like this.
covered in cork to make them unsinkable, with five pairs of oars, eventually this design gets used all over the world.
so thanks to antimissile feedback and claude bernard's vivisection and humane societies, here we are on the way to help somebody in distress from becoming an "apparently drowned."
south by southeast of the pinnacles, and due west of the longstown might.
now, it has to be said that back in 1854, when lifeboat associations really get going, it isn't all volunteer altruism, although there's a lot of that.
no, rescuing people back then tends to be something you do on the way to rescuing their cargo, because what with industrial production going up in europe and america, and raw materials by the thousand tons crossing the ocean,
there's a lot more shipping out there, so there's a lot more money out there.
but there's another reason for all those ships, as i'm sure you've guessed.
and it's linked to a new seafaring habit of chucking bottles over the side.
now, it's not often a bottle changes the course of history, but this is no ordinary bottle, as you can see.
meanwhile, all that extra shipping out there, which is out there thanks to a young american naval officer, who knows more about what goes on at sea than you could shake a crab net at.
this guy is so hot at oceanography... like how far winds and currents will take you at particular times of the year... that one day, when an american troop ship gets hit by a gigantic storm in the atlantic,
our pal, matthew maury, marks a cross on the chart, and that's exactly where the rescue ship finds the survivors floating in the water days later.
maury becomes an international weather biggie, which is why he gets to organize the first international weather conference, in brussels in 1853, where he talks everybody into standard formats for weather charts.
the other thing maury is hot for is a weather reporting network that will use the latest wonder technology, a new gizmo called the telegraph;
which of course bumps maury into sam morse, well-known by history for having invented the morse code and almost entirely forgotten by history for something else.
but before we get to that, why are we doing all this about maury here?
now for sam morse, revelations of thwarted ambition, and conspiracy theory.
and where better for such revelations than the home of such revelations, capitol hill?
the evidence would seem to indicate that mr. matthew maury and all those other weather experts are able to exchange data thanks to a trip mr. samuel morse takes back from europe to america in 1832 and during which he "invents" the telegraph.
in fact, any court in the land would agree that he's probably the sixth person to do so.
this is the capitol building rotunda in washington and the next bit of the story.
the reason morse is on that ship back from europe... remember?
... is because he's been over there painting this kind of stuff, for which he's already quite famous.
i mean, he's president of the national academy of art and design in new york, for a start.
so you won't be surprised to know that in terms of what happens next, he pretty much reckons he's got the picture.
thing is, back in 1836, they haven't quite finished building the rotunda.
and of the decoration and stuff left to do, the main job the rotunda art committee still have to commission is for a set of four giant paintings like this one;
a commission which sam morse's pitch to the committee kind of takes for granted.
he believes that the pope is infiltrating catholics into missouri in preparation for an armed uprising;
that there is a foul foreign conspiracy against these united states;
and that very soon there will be an american world empire!
well, you can imagine the reaction of the rotunda art committee, can't you?
meanwhile, why was he on that trip to europe in the first place?
well, as i said, boning up on european art in preparation for this presentation.
and also spending some time with his big hero, a fellow who had the kind of disease most of us would like to have.
the disease in question is a condition for which the only cure, even today, is trips to italy.
and sam morse's hero is nuts about the place, especially this place:
the tiny hill town of olevano romano, just south of rome, where the food and the wine and the people and the architecture and the sun and the olive groves will do to you what they do to this gent here,
washington allston, who turns up in 1805, so that he can do what all romantic painters did:
go totally over the top about how, well, italian italy is.
now, clearly this program hasn't suddenly turned into an art history class.
as usual, there's more to all this than meets the eye.
romantic poetry hotshot samuel taylor coleridge, one of the greatest scribblers and drug addicts in english lit.
and who spends time over in olevano romano, italy, visiting allston on his way back to england from this delightful spot:
the holiday island of malta, where he's been up to some pretty strange shenanigans.
but before i dish the dirt, a quick catch-up on the story so far.
electronic agents on the internet and wartime guns use feedback techniques discovered in the first place by claude bernard, whose vivisection experiments kick off all those animal rights movements called humane societies that really start out as lifeboat crews rescuing people
from all the shipwrecks happening because of all the extra ships out there who are using maury's data on wind and currents transmitted by the amazing new telegraph, invented by sam morse, who's also a painter whose hero is washington allston,
what coleridge is up to here is traveling all over the island on picnics and jolly trips to the countryside and at the same time working for the contemporary british equivalent of the cia.
and trying and failing miserably to get over his rather unfortunate habit, which is to take humungous amounts of opium four or five times a day and get totally off the wall.
oh, and he has written some great poetry, most of it hallucinatory.
now, as i said, coleridge isn't just taking in the scenery here.
by day, he's doing the 007 act, deeply involved with "for your eyes only" stuff.
on hush-hush missions he won't talk about, for the fellow running this place, the british governor of malta, a navy type called alexander ball.
and america's having a war with libya and needs a local base.
so the island is what you might call a classic hotbed of intrigue, as they say on stuffier programs than this.
alexander ball gets that governor's job in the first place because back in 1798, he's a navy captain fighting the french and gets orders to join a new squadron in the mediterranean.
the job of the squadron is to keep tabs on napoleon.
his fleet is rumoured to be in the french port of toulon, here.
now, british intelligence says his plan is to cross the mediterranean and invade egypt, here.
so he slips out of toulon with 29 warships and arms and ammunition up the ying-yang... everything they need to take over egypt.
now, this is a catastrophe in the making, and all there is to stop napoleon is alexander ball, his boss, and six measly little ships.
and it all ends like hollywood, as you knew it would.
it just so happens, the guy whose life ball has just saved is admiral horatio nelson, the great british hero, who promptly thanks ball by making him governor of malta... down here, you remember... while nelson himself nips off to mop up napoleon
and emma hamilton's husband is giving her enough rope, so she's spending most of her time partying with the locals.
the elderly hamilton is hardly the ideal match for a dish like emma, so she's in the market for some pretty fishy stunts with the local gentry, including one i can't possibly show you, so try this spaghetti-eating contest instead.
but emma knows her ship will come in if she plays her cards right.
well, it does, and i bet you've guessed who's on it.
there are parties where emma distributes buttons and ribbons with "h.n." on them.
she also entertains nelson wearing no underwear, and not surprisingly, they become friends.
nelson persuades his wife to stay back home with tales of how italy's bad for your health, and eventually he and emma return here to england, where she has his child and they hit the tabloids, so to speak.
he leaves again for sea, is killed at the battle of trafalgar, and that's it:
not bad for a gal who got her start in what can only be described as shocking circumstances.
doors have been opening for emma since she was a hooker, aged 14, from which she graduates to be mistress of various aristocrats.
doctor james graham claims his current treatment will generate a galvanizing effect on anybody who has a spark of life in them and wants to be a real live wire.
and if you think that sentence was dreadful, you should read graham's original sales pitch.
but where graham really scores is with his electrico-magnetico celestial bed, where, if you can't have children, a few high-voltage sessions with the good doctor, and from then on all your troubles will be little ones.
now, this may all look like indictable offenses to you, but you've got to remember that back then, this is high-tech amazement...
and of course, he's studied at the best medical school in britain:
edinburgh, where he is taught by a fellow with a drinking problem.
you run the steam through a jacket of cold water, which condenses the steam into drips of whiskey.
and that's still all there is to a still, except, of course, for the secret magic ingredient of the whiskey mash.
so he tells james watt, and that's why watt comes up with a steam engine that works so well it kicks off the industrial revolution.
and the legend is, he does it here, at a place called bo'ness, near edinburgh, in this very cottage.
in 1764, kinneil house is being rented by a yuppie coal mine owner called roebuck, who backs watt's steam engine research, and then his coal mines flood out, and he goes bankrupt before watt can finish his work.
the two of them split amicably enough, it's nobody's fault, and there's not much point, is there, in crying over spilt milk.
until roebuck comes up with a better way... cheaper and faster.
but the bleachers aren't keen, with good reason, because although roebuck's new stuff will bleach in 24 hours and costs a lot less, sulfuric acid's not exactly user-friendly if you happen to spill it.
so thanks to the electrical graham's link with black, who introduced watt to roebuck, here we are about to see the bleach fields disappear forever when somebody now invents a way to bleach cloth just like the way you do it in your washing machine today.
this somebody is called tennant, and he takes a scientific approach.
and when he produces a powdered version of the stuff, you can bleach clothes in the comfort of your own kitchen.
so the bleach fields go back to being moorland, and tennant goes on to become a paper millionaire.
where he worked for captain alexander ball, who saves nelson's life so he can fall for the dubious emma, whose electrical start in life was with dr. graham, educated in scotland by the whiskey experimenter joe black,
who's friends with the sulfuric roebuck, whose bleaching techniques are improved by tennant, who gets rich by making things whiter than white.
have you ever noticed how american documents from this period are all kind of mud colored, and the english stuff from the same time is gray?
that's because they're made from rags, and whatever color the rags are you get.
well, tennant's new bleach makes paper white at last, because it does the same to the rags no matter what the cloth, no matter what the pattern on them.
and the need for good white paper is on the rise, like everything else in the industrial revolution.
which is why, around 1812, a new french patent makes such a big hit here in london.
take a lot of bleached pulp made from rags and spread it evenly on a wire mesh belt, which is vibrating to shake all the water out.
then run the damp pulp between a series of heated rollers, and what you get is cheap enough to stick on the walls... and cover with fancy designs too.
and the printing is mechanized by now, too, because in 1840 a yorkshire cotton printing firm comes up with a way for printing paper with rollers.
by the mid-19th century, the romantic movement has everybody nostalgic for the middle ages and what life was like before they built the factory down the street.
so real aesthetes turn their homes into kind of victorian versions of the 15th century with gas light.
in britain, she publishes a new book, recently arrived from america and called "the fruits of philosophy."
now, this little book is no big deal to you or me.
we brits are running the place at the time, and annie reckons we shouldn't be.
so she takes on the crazy task of getting the british out of india.
by 1893, annie's done courses in spiritualism, hypnotism, and psychic perception, and moved on to various swamis and gurus and the indian national congress.
of which, by 1917, she will become president and get to know such movers and shakers as gandhi and nehru.
on the way to the political high life, she also sets up this place, the international theosophy headquarters, where courses in comparative religion are given.
so annie has come a long way since tinkling the ivories with down-and-out socialists like george bernard shaw.
ellen white has a series of visions, most of them about the direction the church ought to be going.
but as you'll see, from this little visionary home of hers, she changes more than just life in the church.
because the adventist church discourages its members from taking stimulants of any kind and from eating meat.
at one point, some adventists visit dansville, new york, famous for its water cures...
inspired by dansville, they do this... a 19th-century version of what i'm doing.
they set up the first real organized health and fitness center, and it sets a whole new style of living, as a result of which, today, every morning, people like me work up a sweat with some kind of keep fit thing or other.
in 1866, the adventists open the western health reform institute and, ten years later, invite a young doctor they've sponsored through training to be the superintendent.
he changes the name to the sanitarium, introduces room service and entertainment, and turns this place into where the elite meet.
he dresses only in white and can often be seen with his cockatoo on his shoulder.
he does away with some of the more violent water cures and opens schools of nursing, physical education, and home economics.
he works everybody to exhaustion on exercise machines known as muscle beaters and makes everybody sit, all the time, on posture chairs like this.
he starves his clients on a diet of water, yogurt, rice, nuts, fresh fruit and veggies, and then he does something that only changes the entire world.
electronic agents using feedback techniques developed for wartime guns because of claude bernard and all those experiments that kick off the antivivisection humane societies that really start out as lifeboat organizations set up to rescue people from ships using the wind and weather data from maury,
based on telegraphy invented by samuel morse, who learns painting from allston, who's a pal of coleridge, who works in malta for ball, who saves nelson for emma, who's worked for the electrical graham,
who's taught by whiskey scientist black, who knows the sulfuric roebuck, who bleaches paper that will be decorated by morris, who's a socialist with annie besant, who is a vegetarian just like the seventh day adventists.
which is why we end, as i said, with the day that changed the world.
because here in 1895, the superintendent was trying to invent a healthier kind of bread, and all he came up with was some mushy gunk.
so just for kicks, he put it through rollers and baked it.
and what came out changed the daily routine of the inhabitants of planet earth.
today, it's named after the superintendent who produced the original mush, and that is why a program that began with electronic agents in india ends here in battle creek, michigan, with this.
this one's his pattern, and you can produce it from any tiny bit of a human being left behind, say, at the scene of a crime.
that's why this thing changes life for detectives and maybe paternity suit lawyers and maybe dog tag manufacturers, because this is the identifier to end all identifiers.
these marks show the position of certain groups of molecules in alec's dna.
you can see that in my dna, molecule groups come in different places.
schlieren photography is mostly used in aerodynamic research when you're looking at how air behaves, because it shows shock waves as these dark lines, so you can design planes that go supersonic, like this one.
now, one of the hotshots in this kind of work is a hungarian called theodore von karman, who ends up in the u.s., where he kind of gets the jet propulsion lab off the ground and then does much to get other things off the ground,
not if you're on the tacoma narrows bridge in washington state on november 7, 1940, when the bridge starts shedding vortices like this.
the regular swirl of the vortices sets up sympathetic vibrations in the bridge, and this happens.
when you're shooting at the enemy, shredded propeller is not what you want.
back in world war i, that's one of the problems von karman fails to solve, but a pal of his called anthony fokker succeeds.
at the time, he's making the hottest planes around for the germans.
in 1915, a french plane gets shot down over german territory, and on board, they find this neat little trick:
on the propeller blades, steel wedges to deflect any bullet that comes from the machine gun on board, like this.
the ones that miss, of course, go through and hit the enemy plane.
so now all you have to do is point the plane and pull the trigger.
the new gizmo makes lots of money for comic book publishers.
fokker's little trick creates one of the greatest comic book heroes of all time.
a real one, though... a guy known as the red baron.
for manfred, war is just a great gentleman's game which he is better at than anybody else.
now, up in the thick of it, aerial combat consists of careering around the place, desperately dodging bullets, and desperately wondering where you are.
mind you, getting lost would be especially embarrassing for manfred von richthofen.
tell you why when we've had a quick catch-up, after this guy crashes.
okay, jeffries does the dna profile after protein separation with schlieren photography that shows vortices to plane-makers and bridge-builders.
anthony fokker solves the problem of shredded propeller, boosting the career of manfred von richthofen, who never gets lost because geography runs in his family.
see, manfred's great-uncle is a great geologist who kind of puts geography on the map.
to start with, like great-nephew manfred, he's pals with royalty, so he gets what he wants, which is to spend, oh, about 12 years on abstruse missions with oodles of boodle to go and do, well, whatever he likes.
i suppose it might have been because the place he was in at the time was a bit romantic.
now, romanticism, you'll recall, is all that back-to-nature, personal-feelings stuff, and it all kicks off here in 1776, in weimar, germany, with a nice guy named herder, who the people here in weimar really like.
thing about winckelmann is, though, he's the first person to try and see ancient ruins the way they were when people lived in them, like, you know, out here in the streets doing a bit of shopping, just like us;
living a small country town with public buildings and markets and squares just like we do.
so here they are, living lives like ours, doing dinner parties, having elections, checking on the entertainment guide for what's on, and nipping out in the evening to the theater for a show.
winckelmann reckons the greeks and romans are, culturally speaking, boffo... the purest forms of theater, the best architecture, the greatest art.
i mean, you can imagine a small, elegant cocktail party here 2,000 years ago not all that different from something you might want to go to yourself.
winckelmann writes all this up, so herder can snitch the best bits, in a thing about greek and roman art history.
meanwhile, all this classical stuff takes the world of the aesthete by the short and curlies.
in between the time when winckelmann writes and herder rewrites, the discovery of pompeii kicks off a kind of intermediate style called neoclassical... imitation greek and roman decor for your stately home in england, for instance, which turns out to be a great career opportunity
and while the play goes on, behind the curtain, they change the scene for the next act.
he also stops members of the audience from sitting up on the stage, chatting to the actors.
and most of all, he turns acting from the old, overdone, posing style to the modern realism we're used to today, moving around naturally with natural gestures.
this goes over very big at the box office and is probably why garrick has his best idea.
okay, remember ferdinand von richthofen's idea that people are affected by their environment, copied from herder's idea that people are affected by their times, copied from winckelmann's art history stuff he develops in italy,
where angelica kauffman meets actor david garrick, whose theater uses argand lamps that go into lighthouses and cause problems like this?
see, lighthouses make the ocean safer, so a lot more ships, so extra hassle for the people who live here in hispaniola, today the dominican republic, but back in the 18th century, the stopping-off point for ships headed for spain
loaded with south american gold and silver, some of which gets spent building hispaniola's capital city.
one of the other effects it has is to attract the kind of person whose standard phrase is
"have i got a deal for you," which is what happens here.
smugglers selling contraband and being chased by the coast guard people.
and the reason this is all happening this way today is because of all that gold and silver going home to spain back in history, because those people in hispaniola didn't like the way french and english smugglers were stopping their treasure ships
and offering them all kinds of cheap contraband and getting paid with the gold that should have been going back to spain.
so the coast guard got invented, and all this started happening.
the coast guard eventually board the english ship, there's a big fight, and the english captain, a guy called jenkins, gets his ear cut off.
the english pick it up off the deck, take it home in a box, and wave it about in parliament and stir everybody up, which is why the anglo-spanish war that follows in 1739 is called the war of jenkins' ear.
of the thousand-odd men anson starts out with, he gets home with 145, and not because of battles with the spaniards, no.
because of a dreaded mystery disease nobody understands... horrible swellings followed by terminal diarrhea, and then you croak.
thanks to a young navy doctor who learns his trade from a certain professor alexander monro, who is, as far as we know, still here where they left him.
i make that point because monro is the inspiration for an outbreak of grave-robbing at the time.
anyway, monro has studied all over europe and has done enough cutting up to become top man in what's under your skin.
and in 1726, he puts it all together in "anatomy of the human bones,"
all thanks to a crafty visual gizmo that, earlier on, has changed only the entire universe... in austria, in a tent.
okay, here's the tent, inside which, here's the man with the gizmo,
it's the image of the partial solar eclipse happening outside, and kepler's doing this because he's an astronomer.
being a 17th-century astronomer means being heavily into astrological mumbo jumbo, so take a sneaky look at what friend kepler is up to in the privacy of his own home.
but whatever it's called, kepler's discovery is one more proof that the earth, terra, is not the center of the universe but just a planet around the sun like all the others.
this amazing breakthrough is so much of a shock, it affects even the scientifically illiterate.
i mean people like poets, whom i will get to after a quick check on where the story has taken us so far.
you recall the caribbean coast guards that start the war of jenkins' ear and how in that war, anson's sailors die of scurvy, the cure for which is lime juice, discovered by the pupil of alexander monro,
who writes a skeleton book with no pictures because his old boss is doing one with pictures using the same camera obscura gizmo that kepler draws eclipses with before he proves that the earth is orbiting the sun, scientific news that blows away absolutely everything
everybody everywhere believes in, because, well, look at it from their point of view.
makes the end of the cold war feel like "see spot run," doesn't it?
you get a feel for how they must have felt with people like kepler pulling the cosmic rug out from under them.
i mean, with all the new astronomical data coming in, all bets are off.
in 1619, donne bumps into kepler in austria, and kepler gives him a copy of his new book about his new discovery... you remember, the stuff that turns out to be gravity... to bring home and give to the king here in england.
all about what stuff you need with you on the river.
you know, flies, waders, how to cast your line in different kinds of water, what pubs to go to with your pals, best time of day to catch whatever fish you're after, everything any fishing freak might ever want to know,
including hints on how to tell stories about the one that got away.
now, walton gets a lot of material for his book while fishing with an aristocratic young friend of his, charles cotton, who builds this little stone cottage for both of them to use.
here's when, and below it, the initials i.w., izaak walton, and c.c., charles cotton.
cotton himself is a dab hand at fly-fishing and is also filthy rich.
chateau d'yquem, possible the best dessert wine only in the entire world.
point being, cotton translates poetry, in this case from french, and in this case the writer, michel eyquem, is always said to come from the same family as that,
well, back in the early 17th century, being skeptical is something new and dangerous.
i mean, there are protestants and catholics and utopians and puritans and astrologers and who knows what else all telling you theirs is the only true way to salvation.
so it's a wise man who takes it all with a pinch of salt.
like monsieur eyquem, whom you may know by his pen name,
what happens when you shake up mercury in a tube and it glows?
something that people at the time call mercurial electricity and one of the obsessions of an english weirdo, francis hauksbee, who, being obsessed with electricity, invents the world's first static electricity machine.
just crank a glass container with a vacuum inside, rest your hand or any other part of you against the turning glass surface, count to several hundred, count to another several hundred... hey, what can i tell you;
this stuff took forever, and besides, what else did francis hauksbee have to do?
the red liquid goes higher up the narrow tube on the right.
now, hauksbee reckons this must have something to do with the liquid being more attracted up the narrow tube, which is why newton gets interested, because since he's the man who works out what gravity is,
okay, the poet john donne, whose biographer is a fishing freak called izaak walton, whose pal cotton translates the skeptical montaigne, whose science writer fan fontanelle does a newspaper column all about space and whose math is clobbered by bernoulli,
who is mystified by mercurial electricity, investigated by hauksbee, whose capillary work is published by newton and read by a vicar.
this study of tubes takes hale on to breathing and respiratory medicine and public health, which hales may well have seen as something of a musical matter.
a musical matter because hales reckons the source of all disease is foul or putrid air, found mostly in enclosed spaces, and what that has to do with public health is the way a church organ works.
you use hinged wooden flaps moving up and down, drawing air in and pushing it out of a wooden box.
it's not totally airtight, but i suspect the congregation doesn't care.
well, foul and putrid air isn't the cause of smallpox any more than any other disease, but funnily enough, the problem of smallpox is about to be solved anyway... by a country doctor who's never been near an organ
and who, in the end, you could say, goes completely cuckoo.
country doctor edward jenner lives in deepest nowhere, england, after doing something that saves the lives of millions of people all over the planet.
it all happens because of something very strange happening to the local milkmaids.
jenner gets to hear about a disease milkmaids are catching when they milk the cows.
it's called cowpox, and it makes horrible pustules on the hands.
now, cowpox is no big deal, but what jenner discovers is, it gives you immunity to a killer disease called smallpox.
in 1796, jenner hits the headlines when he deliberately infects the healthy son of one of his laborers with liquid from a cowpox pustule, and then he deliberately infects the kid with smallpox.
12 years later, everybody else has worked up enough nerve to to try it, with a reaction in the press not all that different from the reaction to genetic engineering today.
now, in case you're wondering if all that money and publicity goes to jenner's head and that's why i said he goes cuckoo, no.
see, the other thing besides vaccination about which jenner is cuckoo is cuckoos, on which he writes the definitive paper and gets elected to the royal society for services to ornithology.
and then dies, just in time to miss the guy who, you might say, turns bird-watching into an art.
meet j.j. audubon, the first real painter of birds and the man whose name has become synonymous with bird lovers everywhere.
audubon and his feathered friends become world-famous after he fails in about five careers and settles for painting.
in 1821, he's here, near st. francisville, louisiana, where he gets a job at the oakley plantation teaching basic painting techniques to the daughter of the family.
painting birds is a piece of cake here, since the woods and bayous of this part of louisiana are stiff with birds.
he starts a whole new fashion for bird-watching... and chocolate-box art, some people say.
well, you may not like it much, but you gotta admit it's accurate.
if photography had been invented at the time, you'd have said these were snapshots, right?
now, j. j has only one other obsession besides painting birds.
well, at one point, he commissions a survey of that colonial dump the russians are trying to off-ioad, persuades the u.s. secretary of state that the place is worth buying, and the russians are laughing all the way to the bank.
mind you, 100 years later, when the north slope oil fields come on stream who's the sucker then, hmm?
in some places, native americans are still at war with the government in washington.
it can be fatally dangerous to go anywhere west of the mississippi.
well, that's just what they do, which is why today you can't own property here or do much of anything without a permit, except visit, which people do in the thousands.
and like them, we end our journey here too, because thanks to all the connections we've made between the dna profile and the work on aerodynamics and machine guns and the red baron and geography and romantic ideas that start in italy
and paintings of actors and lighthouses and spanish gold and skeleton drawings and astronomical poetry by friends of fishing freaks who write books and skeptical wine-drinkers called eyquem and the cure for smallpox and american bird painters and devious russian real estate deals,
because of all that, in 1872, america gets a special place, the first national park, yellowstone.
because the continents began all joined up and then floated apart when the surface of the planet cracked and molten magma started spewing out from the center of the earth.
as they floated apart, the continents rode on plates of rock:
he thinks it all up in 1912, when he's out here in iceland flying kites to check on the winds and stuff... you know, being a weatherman.
one day, he watches an ice floe cracking apart and dreams up continental drift... which explains those ancient snails crawling from brazil to africa.
okay, this is a mirage of something that's not really there.
you see a mirage across a flat surface when hot air bends the light so it kind of curves around the earth and brings an image from beyond the horizon.
sometimes wind will distort the image in weird and wonderful ways.
it was medieval scientists who gave this castles-in-the-air mirage its name, fata morgana, a magic illusion by morgan the witch, the most powerful magician in medieval mythology, none other than the sister of the legendary ruler of ancient britain,
mind you, it's just as likely that the whole arthur thing is some ancient welsh myth about the calendar, like stonehenge here is a calendar.
you know, on a certain day, the sun comes up right between two particular stones, and that's how they used this place:
well, be that as it may, the reason we all know about king arthur... whoever and whatever he is... is because about 500 years after it all happens, or doesn't, some young french monk called chretine de troyes
comes over here on a trip to england, oh, around 1170.
he hears all the local stories about arthur and camelot and guinevere and all that and decides to take the stories back to france, where they're bound to top the charts.
well, they do, once chretine turns them into love poems, and they're the basis for the hollywood arthur you get in the movies.
courtly love is a game played by aristocrats in northern europe who get married not for love but for business, so alone in their boudoirs, the wives dream of handsome lovers while their husbands spend their entire adult lives
riding off to have military fun in some crusade or other.
now, in the modern world, this would be a recipe for marital disaster.
not in the middle ages, reason being, you commit adultery, they drown you, so you're kind of between a rock and a hard place.
those southern religious types may be the original inspiration for this romantic revolution in interpersonal relationships going on here up north, except what's going on down south is a good bit more revolution than romantic.
what kicks off the revolution is what's going on in places like this, where fat-cat churchmen are, according to the revolutionaries, boozing, fornicating, and worse.
so let me try and show you what the cabalists do with letters and numbers.
okay, it's 13th-century spain, and this is cabalist abraham abulafia, who writes a book on the strange truths words and numbers can reveal.
"holy trinity" adds up to 175, and so does "father, son," and "ghost."
for cabalists like abulafia, the way of cabala and meditating on the mystery of words and numbers brings endless peace.
in 1270, abulafia leaves spain and takes his cabalist mysteries elsewhere.
abulafia's cabalism goes over very big in mirandola, northern italy... a little town about which little can be said.
hey, he's lucky he gets a christian burial at all because of this stuff.
see, because of his interest in cabalism, he has a real love affair with hebrew, the language he says you have to know if you want to understand the bible.
okay, a little risky saying that back then, but pico's near-fatal mistake with the pope, who, you will recall, has power of thumbscrew, is to go one more step further and say that the mysteries of cabalism... wait for this... are the only way to understand the divinity of christ.
well, everything hits the papal fan, and it doesn't help that a very senior german catholic intellectual agrees with pico.
the senior german intellectual churchman that pico turns on to cabalism and the hebrew language is this guy, john reuchlin, who is troubled by a really burning question.
see, reuchlin thinks anybody worth his salt ought to know hebrew, so he writes the first hebrew latin grammar, so eventually, the german church authorities ask him about which hebrew books they should burn because they're anti-christian, and reuchlin says none
his name's philip melanchthon, and he moves my story along towards its unexpected end in the comfortable surroundings of wittenburg, germany.
wittenburg is the center of a new radical movement started by martin luther, who was excommunicated by the pope and starts his own religion here.
it's on the door of the church where it happened, so you know it's important.
these are the words that changed the history of the western world, and they're cast in bronze here to make sure you don't forget.
they are a shocking attack on the catholic church by martin luther about everything that's wrong with the church, in reaction to which remarks, rome goes totally ape.
luther and his pals protest and become known as "protestants," protestants.
turns up here as professor of greek, and between him and luther, it's love at first sight.
melanchthon and luther are the kind of guys kids love to hate, because they believe kids need one thing above all else:
by 1528, there are school inspectors, teachers on contract, a new junior-, middle-, and upper-school system, standardized textbooks, a curriculum, and latin till it's coming out of your ears.
the reason for the latin is, the protestant bible's in latin, and melanchthon's view is, bang that into their heads, and you can't fail.
mind you, there are extremists in the protestant movement who think melanchthon's lying down on the job.
instead of all this education stuff, they reckon he ought to be out there giving hell and brimstone to catholics... and sinners.
one of these radicals, who has the mother and father of all rows with melanchthon about this, is a guy who is a professor at koenigsberg university, on the baltic, here.
his name is andreas osiander, who is... how shall i put this?
osiander ends up in the history books with a reputation so bad, it's cosmic.
here's the official view of the cosmos at the time, with the earth...
and, of course, humankind... at the center of everything, circled by the sun and the moon and all the planets.
this idea has been around for 2,000 years, ever since the ancient greek philosopher aristotle dreams up a universe made of giant invisible concentric spheres made of some magic material, each one of the spheres carrying each one of the heavenly bodies attached to it.
now, this whole gobbledygook works fine until you take a closer look, because it doesn't explain why, from time to time,
mars appears to go backwards, which it ain't supposed to do.
well, by 1514, the calendar, based on this wrong view of things, is so far out of whack that good catholics don't know if it's really friday, and, like, can they eat meat or not?
so the pope puts a pole on the case, and in 1542 in nuremberg, they're about to print what he's done about it all.
so you just know something really bad is going to happen to this book... because its polish author comes up with an idea that nails aristotle's entire concept nearly stone dead.
if you put the sun at the center and everything else in orbit, it explains everything, including why mars appears to go backwards whenever the earth catches up and moves ahead of it for a while.
now, as far as osiander is concerned, this crazy stuff will prove the church has been wrong all along about everything, so he writes to the author, nicolaus copernicus, saying, "hey, why don't you say you don't mean it?
"say this is all theory, nothing to do with what's really happening up in the sky."
abulafia's cabalist numbers get pico of mirandola into hebrew studies, which get the catholic john reuchlin into book-burning trouble, not helped by support from his protestant nephew, philip melanchthon, who has a terrible row with the creep osiander,
who tries to persuade polish author nicolaus copernicus to say his new astronomy is just theory.
so osiander has pulled off the greatest con in history, so he gets back to his astrology and writing letters to an italian pal.
this is osiander's italian pal, and this is somebody we'll get back to.
okay, meet girolamo cardano, an italian doctor who writes the first great book on algebra, and he's here in scotland attending a patient who will, like this program, come to a sticky end.
as you can see, friend cardano is also a bit of a gambler, and he works out that there are only three results you get from throwing dice:
so cardano collects his fee and hightails it back to italy.
alas, as you will see, things don't go that well for cardano's poor old episcopal patient.
mary, the queen in question, leads a life that's more like a whodunit, full of intrigue and betrayal and dead bodies.
it's a miracle she makes it through the mayhem and skulduggery.
she goes back to scotland as queen of the place, so now she's mary, queen of scots.
and then she gets the hots for and marries a guy called henry darnley.
henry darnley has a claim to the english and scottish thrones too.
trouble is, darnley's a real lout who drinks and cheats on his wife and wants to be a real king and not just mary's significant other.
so in no time at all, there's queen elizabeth's army outside;
mary is captured, accused of okaying the plot to kill darnley and conspiring against queen elizabeth and executed;
every night for months, brahe gets the same readings, so nothing up there is changing, so all this is real.
and wherever you look from, that separation angle is the same, so both heavenly bodies are out there in space.
in 1573, brahe goes into print about this stuff, becomes so famous, he ends up as imperial astronomer, in spite of this, which i thought i'd try to see what it felt like.
all his life, he keeps quiet about it, and the only reason we know he loses his nose in a duel and wears a metal replacement and carries glue everywhere with him in case it falls off is because the story gets blown by one of his assistants,
see, after he quits tycho and astronomy, he sets up in amsterdam as a mapmaker.
astronomy and mapmaking go together because sailors use the stars to navigate by, don't they?
so by 1602, he's got one of the biggest print shops around, churning out updated versions of anything you might want to know about tides, winds, coastlines, star positions, you name it... anything, in fact, you might want to know
in order to get yourself from "a" for amsterdam to " b" for anywhere else, which is why he gets the plum job of mapmaker to the dutch east india company, whose main aim in life is, in fact,
what you're looking at is the botanical equivalent of a license to print money, a load of money, because this is no ordinary load.
it's something you've probably eaten, maybe without even knowing you did, and it's why those dutch guys risk life, limb, and shipwreck to get here.
take a look at one of the greater 17th-century profit centers of all time.
great thing is, no production line to eat up your capital.
you just leave the strips to dry out in the sun.
then you roll the strips into each other so they form a kind of stick, and then package the sticks in big bundles like this, and then take the whole lot back to holland and make at least 600°/° profit on the deal.
but because the earth's a globe, your angle back to the north star keeps changing, screws up your calculations, till a fellow named mercator solves the problem by flattening the earth on a chart, like this.
so now, when you head off on your straight line from "a" to " b,"
the fact that the new system distorts the real size of countries doesn't seem to matter much.
anyway, all this navigational stuff's put together in a giant atlas by a guy working in italy for the duke of tuscany, an englishman, name of dudley, who also provides the duke with a new seaport he badly needs.
then dudley brings in english shipbuilders to give the duke the navy he wants.
dudley also builds canals and drains marshes and other such stuff for the duke's superintendent of public works, a guy called bernardo buontalenti, and this is where the story takes a really unexpected turn.
now, buontalenti's an engineer, so the duke of tuscany asks him to do something to liven up the entertainments the duke likes to put on for his guests, and buontalenti goes right over the top, with movable scenery and people all dressed up in costumes
and a plot that involves a real story line and all the stuff you associate with going out to the theater today, with gods and goddesses and fake sea monsters and all kinds of gizmos you will now see in one of the world's first operas,
now, this opera thing catches on like wildfire in france, where the guy running the country for the king is an italian called mazeran... after he spent time reading the play in his giant new 40,000-volume library,
put together for him by a frenchman who writes a book rivetingly entitled...
the size of the ship dictates how big the crew is.
and they all get standardized pay scales, medical treatment, pensions, and discipline.
guns are standardized, and so is the kind of ammunition they fire.
pepys organizes the supply of everything a navy needs to stay afloat and ready to fight.
best of all, he manages to persuade the english parliament that the one thing the country needs is a fleet big enough, well, to control the sea.
they okay 30 new ships, and pepys' dream looks like coming true.
this is chappe's signaling gizmo, called a semaphore, shown here during a field trial by a guy named gamble for the british navy after chappe's blueprints have been found during the war.
story is that gamble's working in prisoner-of-war camps, and he's going through the pockets of some french officer and finds chappe's drawings, so he dashes home and builds a version for the navy.
now, each pattern stands for a letter, so all you have to do is decode the patterns, and you know what the message is.
unfortunately, somebody else thinks up an even better version, and he gets the contract.
as for that guy gamble, he goes back to prisoner-of-war exchange work after napoleon's defeat, and during this work, he comes across some french guy selling a pattern for preserving food in bottles.
gamble passes the idea on to a metalworking pal of his, and he turns it into something that lasts longer than the semaphore ever does:
canned food, just what intrepid explorers need in 1831, heading for the frozen north.
now, i know this isn't the frozen north, but, hey, i'll get there.
the deal is to find a passage running north of canada between the atlantic over there and the pacific over there, right?
well, frozen north expedition leader sir john ross and his nephew james don't find this passage thing.
but at one point, the nephew takes off over the ice to here, where he discovers the magnetic north pole.
hangs a magnetized needle on a bit of thread, like this, sees it point straight down, like this, so he claims the magnetic pole for king and country... harrumph... in spite of the fact that, as the magnetic pole is
but he's the reason for the tonic because he goes back to london and becomes director of the botanical gardens, where they're trying to grow the kind of tree that will produce quinine, a treatment for malaria,
which you can get back then in places like this, sri lanka, which we brits are running at the time.
keeps the british empire going out here, where the people at the time are also busy trying to grow something else, thanks to those people back in the botanical gardens.
this is one of those moments when you realize how often in history people can't see the forest for the trees.
back in 1888, all those botanical types know is, hooray, they've succeeded in transplanting rubber trees from south america to sri lanka here, so now, good things like raincoats can be invented and one day, tires for automobiles and surgical rubber gloves
and a million other wonderful examples of the progress of science.
how could any of them have foreseen, back when this stuff happened for the first time and rubber tapping kicked off one of the greatest industries of the 19th century, where it would end?
all they could have predicted, maybe, was that as the latex flowed from these trees, the profits would protect british industry against some future economic rainy day.
well, rubber was good news for raincoat makers... and really bad news for people living in hamburg, germany, in 1943, because at one point during world war ii, the japanese invade most of the places out east growing rubber, like malaysia,
and here in sri lanka is about all the rubber the allies have left for the war effort.
one of those efforts is a really nifty idea... well, it's a nifty idea if you're having a war... and that is to mix rubber with gasoline, which makes the gasoline burn slower and stick to anything while it does that.
so thanks to continental drift and wegener's passion for mirages, magic images from the sister of king arthur, whose chivalry supposedly triggers the medieval courtly love answer to adultery, inspired by the free love ideas of the mystical cathars,
who live next to the mystical cabalists with their thing about mystic numbers that turn pico of mirandola on to hebrew, which then brings trouble for john reuchlin, not helped by his nephew, the protestant melanchthon, who has a row with the creep osiander,
who pulls that famous con when he rewrites the work of copernicus.
osiander's italian pal, dr. cardano, who cures the asthmatic archbishop hamilton, executed for helping mary, queen of scots, whose lover, the explosive bothwell, ends up in scandinavia with a pal of astronomer tycho brahe,
whose assistant, willem blaeu, makes maps updated in the first proper atlas by the englishman dudley, working in italy for buontalenti, who kind of kicks off opera:
the new global diet for the new global person... the calorie-aware, weight-conscious, healthy-living individual.
this little flake is eaten by hundreds of millions of people worldwide.
this is what i'm talking about, what's left after you've taken the corn for the corn flakes.
there are thousands of tons of it being produced every day.
and thanks to a totally forgotten german chemist who i think really didn't know what he was doing anyway, this garbage is far from garbage.
for much of modern industry, what you could do with this stuff really beats the band.
this musical interlude is happening in the market square of the small eastern german town where the story starts.
it's called jena, and back in 1810, it got one of the best universities in the country and two professors, one of whom becomes world famous.
one of the things in the 19th century you're not going to find in fancy botanical gardens like this is that.
i mean, from a horticultural point of view, this is pretty low-rent stuff.
thanks to encouragement from goethe, an associate professor of chemistry here that i bet my life you've never heard of called wolfgang doebereiner takes a close look at various organic matters and comes up with a totally new chemical
i also bet my life you've never heard of called furfural.
now, don't ask me or him why doebereiner should do such a thing.
he just does and then does nothing about it, except to write the usual humongously boring scientific paper, about which for 100 years, nobody else does anything either.
till this point, most useful chemicals came from plants, but now they're going to be petroleum by-products.
agribusiness better find some new way to use their leftovers, or they'll be...
one day, the people at quaker oats dig up doebereiner's stuff and discover that if you press, boil, steam, and shove acid into corncobs and other kinds of organic garbage left after people have had their breakfast,
what do you get but furfural, which now turns out to be a chemical that goes into all kinds of good stuff.
anticarbuncle cream, which, fortunately for you, is not the next connection in this program.
because the other place furfural gets used is in making a resin that is just what people want for bonding abrasives to grinding wheels, a subject you've waited all your life to know about, i know.
all thanks to george westinghouse, who gets around edison's patent for a one-piece lightbulb with a two-piece lightbulb.
bottom, an open-necked bulb into which, above, the filament base fits.
meet abrasive american edward goodrich acheson, who does all that ground-glass work for westinghouse, because thanks to an accident, he owns a carborundum company.
the accident happens earlier, in 1861, when acheson is bashing a lot of electricity into a mixture of coke and clay.
one spectacular modern use of acheson's silicon carbide happens in 1960s vietnam with the invention of an outfit called the air cavalry, whose choppers are highly maneuverable, well-armed, and everywhere.
now, taking the wounded out or dropping green berets in and delivering supplies, doing reconnaissance, or conducting rocket attacks, chopper people are constantly and acutely aware of one minor problem.
one of the reasons choppers are so clever is because they can sit still in midair, which kind of makes them a target it is difficult to miss.
so it's the chopper people who think up a use for acheson's silicon carbide as a protective lining for their vulnerable machines, thing being, silicon carbide's a lot tougher than most of the stuff shooting up at them from the jungle below.
so what starts up there with the chopper pilots very soon comes down here with the grunts, where the fighting is very close-quarters, spoil-your-day type of stuff.
so in no time at all, what the well-dressed dogface is wearing is some helicopter protection for humans called a flak jacket, which has some very interesting features to it.
like if you're wearing one, you can throw a grenade just a few yards, turn and hunch up, and survive your blast while others do not.
and more than half of all wounds that were previously lethal become no longer lethal.
it all started with corn flakes made from corncobs that doebereiner turned into furfural to bond silicon carbide abrasives that westinghouse used to grind lightbulbs and that also ended up as protection for choppers and in flak jackets to protect against armor-piercing ammunition,
which originally got developed for use against something that first appeared in world war i.
the main snag for world war i infantry is getting snagged and then shocked on rows of barbed wire.
so here's the solution, named... because it looks just like a water tank... a tank.
the soft soil here in the beautiful san joaquin valley, california.
that and the fact that all the horses are about to be taken off the farms to be sent to europe for the war effort.
this critical situation inspires an enterprising type called ben holt, who lives here in the san joaquin valley, to invent one of those amazing labor-saving devices for which america has always been famous, set the stage for the development of the tank,
and change the whole nature of farming here on the local fields and then all over the world virtually at a stroke.
number one, the secret of the holt success, the crawler tracks.
the trick here is, the track spreads the load all the way along the track so the weight of the machine isn't concentrated on the wheels.
and what that means is, there's nowhere too soft for this baby to go.
which is great news for farmers here in the san joaquin valley and then everywhere else.
you can use one of these things to haul army supplies night and day, thick and thin, and it doesn't need hay.
and you can also turn it into a tank, which they do.
beer, as it happens, because that's what it takes for holt and everybody else in the u.s. to get to hear about diesel engines.
you know, history's funny in some ways, because the fellow who helps to make tractors synonymous with diesel engines is a brewer from st. louis called gustavus adolphus busch.
besides, it does end up making rudolf rich and famous, so let's hear it for mechanical obsessions.
now, the really clever thing about a diesel engine is, it's not a gasoline engine.
and the reason that's clever can only be described as a lot of hot air.
first because a gasoline engine compresses the air and the fuel spray mix, and then a spark explodes the mixture, so you have to get the timing just right, or the spark'll happen when the mixture's not ready.
what you're getting here is extremely efficient use of fuel, because the very high compression gives you more bang for your buck.
and because it's so efficient, you save fuel, and what that does is save you money.
but the really brilliant thing about diesel's idea is that his engine will run on almost anything.
and that's great news for europeans, because since the engine doesn't explode the fuel the way a gasoline engine does, it doesn't need refined petroleum product, and that's good, because back then in europe,
with almost no oil industry to speak of, that kind of stuff costs an arm and a leg.
anyway, some time around 1893, diesel gets a contract from a big engine factory here in germany, and in no time at all, diesel engines are in everything from battleships to fancy cars.
and what makes all this happen for a a man with a lonely childhood is the fact that one of the fuels
diesel says the engine might be able to use, there's lots of in germany.
krupp comes in on that engine deal with diesel i mentioned and helps diesel make enough for a comfortable old age.
come to think of it, as you'll see, the krupps are rather good at that kind of thing.
so krupp is the reason why the next stop on our journey is the coal fields of the german ruhr.
thanks to the fact that corncobs make adhesives to bond carborundum, otherwise known as silicon carbide, to grinding wheels used to grind lightbulbs.
but i didn't come here to get covered in coal dust just to tell you about boring industrial machinery but because there's another, more intriguing side to krupp.
the real reason krupp is so successful is the way he treats his workers, because he hates socialism.
krupp invents company benefits with showers and changing rooms and work uniforms and everything to make a krupp worker want to stay a krupp worker.
he also provides a canteen, hospitals, a pension fund, and all kinds of other goodies.
and across the road from the mine or the factory, he also builds company housing.
and in the pleasant company suburb, there's also a company school, a company church, a company kindergarten, and, of course, there's always a company store.
and who is so impressed by krupp... among other things, they both vastly prefer trees to people... that he, bismarck, tries out the krupp welfare thing on a national scale.
in 1889, he starts the world's first ever state pension scheme by which the average person gets enough to live on... once, that is, bismarck knows what constitutes the average person, a concept, naturally enough, thought up by a belgian astronomer.
meet alphonse quetelet, who's about to turn the kind of bodies astronomers observe into the kind of bodies governments observe.
see, the trouble with planets and such is that sometimes, if you don't see them frequently enough, you lose track of them.
so 19th-century astronomers used probability math to predict where you should look, even if all you've had are a few sightings.
quetelet's bright idea is to use the same probability math to work out another kind of prediction, the kind governments want to make about people, even if they're only able to keep their eye on a few of them.
and before you start feeling smug about repressive prussians and what else would you expect from countries where things get violent, the place quetelet's new numbers are about to make a real splash is the ever-so-genteel surroundings of the university of cambridge in england,
mainly because, as is so often the case in these programs, things are not quite what they seem... in this case, peaceful.
now, it's in this room in trinity college in 1833, while everybody's up here for a science conference in cambridge that quetelet gets together for tea... oh, muffin?
with a bunch of academics whom he persuades to set up what eventually becomes known as the royal statistical society.
of course, the real statistical aim of every middle-class victorian... tea?
is to gather data on the population of the growing industrial cities... people living in stinking, overcrowded, diseased squalor... so as to turn them into decent, obedient, hard-working, thrifty, nonrevolutionary workers.
how many ragged families can sing a jolly song, how many starving mothers can knit, the number of inspiring prints hanging on the walls of their filthy hovels, how often this kind of person gets their hair cut.
speaking of which, one of the guys at this uplifting cambridge chitchat gets his life changed by french hairdressers.
but once upon a time, they were in exactly the same mess, which is why this is one of those very rare occasions when the course of history is changed by a haircut, because that fellow from cambridge i mentioned,
a mathematician called charles babbage, takes a trip to france and turns up here not long after they've had a revolution and gone metric.
every single calculation they'd previously done in paris feet or marseilles gallons or whatever now has to be done in centimeters and liters and kilos and so on.
every table of calculation for every shop and factory and profession has to be recalculated.
and apart from the fact that half the aristocrats in france have lost their heads so there's not much work around for people like pierre gilles here to do anyway, the new revolutionary cut is kind of short back and sides.
so most places like this in france have so little work to do, they are, to put it mildly, tearing their hair out.
mind you, the thought of all that amateur arithmetic is enough to make your hair curl.
and to make matters worse, on average, there's hundreds of mistakes in every table they churn out.
so he comes up with an absolutely amazing invention that for anybody from then on who wants to do complicated mathematical tables will make all the difference.
babbage's difference engine does sums, and this is a really simple version of something so complicated, he never actually makes one.
say you want to add three on the right to seven on the left.
turn the little cog on the right three places, and that does the same to the cog on the left.
then babbage automates the process with the use of a punch card.
whichever rod gets through whichever hole in the card activates a selected set of levers that moves whichever cog you want to use for the sum.
the britannia bridge between england and wales, two giant, 1,500-foot tubes each big enough to take a train and each needing 2 million rivets, all done by a riveting machine controlled... you've guessed it... with punch cards.
engineer in charge robert stephenson also thinks up the idea of floating the massive tubes into position, an idea that causes ripples in more ways than one.
see, one of stephenson's close pals is the fellow who masterminds the floating delivery of the tube girders for the bridge.
he's also a hotshot engineer in his own right, and he's done everything from bridges in australia to railways in italy.
isambard kingdom brunel is his name, and he's got two problems.
and, as it happens, both of them will be solved by the britannia bridge.
the first problem is rivets, because brunel is planning to punch in no fewer than 31/2 million of them.
and the second problem is what he's planning to punch them into.
but brunel's new monster ship is going to be so big, it'll carry all the coal it needs.
well, it never actually happens, but for sheer effort, you've got to take your hat off to brunel.
here's brunel wearing his famous hat and, behind him, his monster ship, the "great eastern," built of the same tube girders as the britannia bridge and a zillion rivets.
i'll sing you a song of the fish of the sea, for we're bound for...
well, they don't come much bigger, if you think about it, than the atlantic.
three miles deep in some places, and the shortest way across is 2,000 miles of some of the worst weather in the world.
not exactly the kind of place anybody sane would want to do delicate precision engineering.
but, hey, these are victorians, and they can do the impossible, which is what is now proposed by an american gent called cyrus field.
atlantic weather guru matthew maury, who says, "go in august, and do it like this."
from valentia island off ireland to heart's content bay, newfoundland, because it's flat all the way.
now, you know there's only one ship in the world capable of carrying what is needed for all this madness, which is 2,000 miles of cable weighing 6,000 tons,
600 tons of equipment, and, above all, eleventeen million tons of coal.
three miles down in the incredibly hostile environment of the ocean floor, the stuff wrapped 'round it, the cable insulation, which turns out also to change this kind of stroke.
well, i never said i had a good drive, did i?
the underwater cable insulation is a new wondergunk that comes, as it happens, from these trees.
and in 1840, it's being used by the locals here in singapore when a young assistant surgeon called montgomery happens to stumble across it.
so gutta-percha turns up, just like plastic today, as a substitute for wood, leather, cardboard, paper, metal, and in the weirdest places:
stethoscopes, false teeth, inkstands, flower vases, and, of course, wrapped around cyrus field's transatlantic cable.
but the real reason for all this palaver with me and the clubs is what gutta-percha does to the ancient and exclusive game of golf.
and if you're a golf fanatic, get ready to take a picture of your tv screen now and frame it.
well, after a lot of buffing, the old buffers finally agree.
the new ball is introduced, and scottish golf really takes off.
krupp welfare uses statistics calculated by babbage's engine using punch cards that rivet bridges and the "great eastern"
that lays the cable insulated by gutta-percha that gets used to make cheap golf balls so now ordinary scotsmen can get to play.
and the reason they do that is because there's a wonderful new thing called leisure time.
all that trade with america is boosting the scottish economy, and the powerful and straightlaced scottish church would rather the newly affluent workers spent their money on sports and family holidays by the sea instead of drinking it away in the pub outside the factory.
the hot air in question is the business of a guy called neilson, the manager of the gasworks in glasgow, scotland.
in 1832, he thinks up the idea of blasting hot air into iron-melting furnaces, making them hot enough to burn even low-grade scottish coal, thus turning scotland into an instant industrial country with factory managers who have enough money and spare time
now, when you're talking about whether a country makes it to industrial status, which scotland now does, as you saw, thanks to neilson, having those iron foundries is the litmus test, which is what neilson's new partner, charles macintosh,
and his father, george here, have been doing in the scottish glens.
because litmus paper does all that stuff, like changing color when you dip it in acid or alkali, if you recall your school chemistry lessons, because it's impregnated with this stuff, a particular lichen or moss that george macintosh is looking for.
the moss is one ingredient of a dye called cudbear, which will color cloth bright red.
so since back in 1777, george macintosh, who dyes cloth, has been spending weeks at a time out on romantic moss-collecting trips among the heather to get his raw material.
now, most unfortunately, cudbear dye needs one other vital ingredient besides scottish moss, and it's something that will take us back from these lonely highlands to that hot air gas company manager neilson, because the other ingredient for cudbear dye
requires the macintosh company to go looking for raw materials in less salubrious places than the scottish glens.
it's urine, which contains ammonia, which is why neilson and the macintosh family got together in the first place, since ammonia is a by-product of what you get when you make coal gas, and you recall that's what neilson made at his gasworks.
okay, let's leave george macintosh up this mountain while i change the subject, because at this point in the story, the path of history splits into two.
the first pathway takes us away from moss collecting to some pretty weird goings on a good deal farther south.
back in scotland, neilson's father has been employed by a fellow called john roebuck, who owns coal mines, and roebuck has been taught in edinburgh by a professor called joe black.
roebuck tells black about the water flooding his mines, and black tells roebuck about james watt of steam engine fame.
and together, watt and roebuck make mine-draining music with watt's new steam-driven pump.
roebuck's money sets watt up in business, and he makes a fortune and eventually becomes an amateur scientist, like all gentlemen did at the time.
they're always all about which one of them has done some experiment or other to find out what water is.
well, watt becomes a member of the royal society, the two of them meet and become friends, and that's that.
that's why i'm telling you all this in india, because the young man is a fellow called james macie, and his main contribution to science is to investigate... hang on a minute.
to investigate a liquid that appears in the joints of bamboo.
so friend macie takes this medicinal bamboo juice and does everything but drink it.
under differing circumstances, it effervesces, turns jellylike, goes into a glass shape, or becomes a powder.
back then, this is reckoned to be do-good stuff, because it saves the kids from starving to death in the streets.
dale even builds them a school, and they get clean clothes once a week.
in return for such generosity, the deal with the orphanage is,
dale doesn't have to pay any wages to his little employees until they're age 15.
in 1824, he leaves here for america, where he sets up a commune at a place called new harmony, indiana.
well, the venture fails, and he comes back here to britain.
but his four sons take out american citizenship and stay on in the states, where their story and that of james macie, the rich bamboo freak, join up.
this is where it all comes together and when things get to hit the fan in a really spectacular manner.
see, owen's eldest son is a fellow called robert dale owen, and in 1842, he gets elected to congress as an indiana democrat.
well, in 1844, he gets mixed up in the affairs of an englishman called james macie.
and you remember he left a fortune of 104,960 of these things, english gold sovereigns, to america.
well, by 1844, they've arrived in the states, been melted down, and turned into u.s. money.
by this time, there are now $2.5 billion invested in these examples of junk.
and how's the treasury going to get their hands on it?
never mind the interest the real estate bank of arkansas hasn't paid.
well, you can imagine the kind of field day the legislators up here on the hill have with this little peccadillo.
certain members regard the gift as an insult to the american people and say that the united states has humbled and degraded itself by accepting this money from degenerate aristocrats.
others argue that the united states should take the money and run.
corncobs become resins for diamond polishing with carborundum that protects you from shells fired at tanks developed from american tractors that used diesel engines built with funding from krupp, who inspired
bismarck's welfare scheme based on quetelet's statistics that inspired the babbage engine, whose punch cards were used to rivet the "great eastern,"
wherever you go, the little beetles seem to have worked out how to adapt to the amazing variety of habitats in the world.
when he answers his own question... why do all these varieties get so varied and how?
... with his own answer... you survive if you fit the local conditions, in other words, the survival of the fittest... he blows everybody away.
well, he would have, except he lets some other guy who has the same idea publish first, and he blows everybody away.
a frightfully polite, frightfully british case of "after you, mr. darwin."
matter of fact, there's a nasty rumor that our creepy-crawly guy sent a letter with the key data in it to the great man, who said he'd only received it "after some considerable delay."
spiritualism is on the minds of some of the greatest scientists of the day and maybe transferring to other minds, hmm?
telepathy is the obsession of another spiritualist, an eminent british physicist named lodge, who invents those cards you see in all the telepathy tests with squares and stuff on them.
so lodge comes up with a little gizmo that reacts to even the tiniest electrical signals, so simple it's brilliant.
lodge's idea is to use a telegraph key to send electrical signals when it triggers an electric spark that produces the signal.
then an automatic tapper breaks the filings apart, ready to receive again.
lodge's experiment shows his gizmo is working, because the signal moves a needle and rings a bell.
in 1906, the dude fessenden makes electricity with an electricity maker...
you know, magnets spin round in a copper wire and make electricity.
except for one bunch of people, who have... gone totally bananas.
now, you might wonder why a bunch of banana people would freak out over long-distance radio.
and what that means is, in places like here, in the dominican republic, you can pick your bananas all year round.
and then the clock starts to tick, because the second you pick your banana, it starts to ripen.
to organize long-distance, get your trains and your ships to the same port at the same time, avoid trainloads of rotting bananas going nowhere.
and all this happens because the amazing growth of the banana is only matched by the amazing growth of the banana market.
certain americans with interests in growing investments, like bananas, split to central america, where they end up owning large bits of these countries and owning large bits of their governments, thus giving the language a new term, "banana republics,"
and a new international musical smash hit to go on the new international radio waves.
this guy is the second in what will turn out to be a long line of family botanists.
his name is candolle, and he's a professor at geneva academy.
he persuades the geneva authorities here to start using an amazing recent invention, a thing called a postage stamp.
by 1874, so many other countries have followed the swiss example and started mail services that there is a critical postal problem to be licked.
not the stamp, what happens after you stick it on the letter and send it off to foreign parts, wherever they may be... which, back then, is anybody's guess.
so in 1874 here in switzerland, everybody gets together to standardize everything:
see, these cartoonists get their start in life thanks to a satirical magazine called "punch"
that kicks off back in 1841 and specializes in targeting public figures like fat-cat politicians who are doing nothing about the terrible social conditions and corruption among government officials.
i mean, it's 1840, and they're building something more like 1340, mostly to designs by august pugin, who sounds a bit of a weirdo.
i mean, he actually writes a book with the serious title of "the true principals of pointed architecture."
mind you, all this historical ceremony and people dressing up is, if you think about it, entirely fake.
i mean, none of them dresses like this at home, do they?
today the baltic republic of latvia, where a whole western cultural movement started with a chip on the shoulder.
this is the shoulder in question, a teacher called herder you may not have heard of, because everybody snitches his ideas and becomes more famous than him... famous like byron, schubert, and goethe.
so he starts churning out books by the yard on everything from music to history, philosophy, literature, poetry, art, and, above all, a shocking new concept:
german culture, one great example of which is, of course, the architecture herder reckons was invented by germans:
an idea which will get some other people excited a couple of hundred years later.
now, a key element of any ancient culture and all that is language.
if you could find the ancient, original language, you'd be that bit closer to knowing what those ancient germans were like and why, as herder says, they were so superior.
so for herder, it is like dying and going to heaven when he gets to hear of a newly discovered poem dating from... wait for it...
because here we're talking ancient tales and legends from the highlands of scotland in gaelic.
now, the reason herder gets to know about all this ancient gaelic stuff is because back in 1760, a scotsman called james macpherson is riding all round the scottish highlands
see, all this tourist-brochure stuff about scotland is introduced by the english after they've invaded the country and destroyed the clans and "pacified the place,"
which they do by making it illegal to wear the tartan or speak gaelic or carry a sword and by evicting scottish highlanders from their lands and burning their homes.
so all this unpleasantness is why our friend james macpherson is scribbling furiously, because he can see the writing on the wall for celtic culture.
macpherson hopes to stop the rot by publishing a great 3rd-century epic poem he's discovered in the highlands all about the celtic hero ossian.
that fools everybody because it's a royal fake, speaking of which...
welcome to the battle of culloden in 1746, where the english inflict a great defeat on the scots and which gives them the excuse for those terrible atrocities in scotland later on.
and has never set foot in scotland till now and never does again after this little disaster.
after the defeat at culloden, charlie bums around europe and in 1770 ends up here in florence, where he rents the corsini palace, where he falls down in a drunken stupor every night after playing himself to sleep with this old scottish tune
and crying over spilt whiskey and the highlanders he'd led to their deaths and the women he'd let down and the promises he'd broken, being an international laughingstock and a lousy cello player and maybe remembering a woman called flora macdonald,
flora being a loyal fan who risks her life for this has-been after the great defeat.
she disguises him as a woman and gets him to the ship waiting to smuggle him out of the country so he can run away.
and, you know, to this day, there are still scotsmen all over the world who raise their glasses to prince charles stuart and toast the "king over the water,"
conveniently forgetting the drunken old sot ending his days here in italy ignored by everybody and covered in ulcers.
unlike flora macdonald, who makes her own escape to somewhere altogether better for the health:
and most of all because these trees are what you might call a license to print money.
these trees are vital to national security for the same reason that all north carolina people are called tarheels, because what you do to keep your navy floating and fighting fit is chop up the trees and then cook them in an underground kiln,
the other money-making product that comes from these trees is just as easy to get at.
make this kind of cut in the tree, and resin oozes out.
back then, they drink it or rub it on, because it's supposed to cure pretty much any disease that you could ever catch.
so in 1775, you're doing all this in north carolina, you're one of the people helping the british navy rule the waves...
mind you, by the time european royals like charles ii are collecting this stuff, only royals can afford it... like 100 thou apiece back then.
lacquerware costs an arm and a leg because there's a craze for it in the west and because no chinese will tell the round-eyes how to make it.
so the secret puts the price up and sets the fashion for chinese bad taste.
eventually, the crafty westerners work out that turpentine's involved with lacquer in some way.
pontypool is famous for back then is the very thin sheet metal they make... at the first really good iron-rolling mills in britain.
so that welsh lacquer isn't developed for use on wood, which is expensive, but for use on tinplate, which is cheap.
french secretary of state colbert, is making overtures to them and any other foreign craftsmen to come to france and get french industry out of the ash can, where it's been since the king spent all the country's money.
well, the german tinplate people won't come, but lots of others do, and colbert sets up factories so france can make luxury goods like these instead of importing them all.
colbert floats of a lot of ideas for economic recovery so france can become a superpower.
some fail, but the one that floats the best is the reason why colbert has a modern missile cruiser named after him.
colbert himself gets particularly ticked off when he finds out that one day, when they need a spare mast, there isn't one to be found in the entire country.
so he pumps in money up the naval ying yang and turns the whole situation around.
in no time at all, there are 120 new french warships backed up by everything else navies are supposed to have... guns, ammo, that stuff... thus putting france back into the superpower league.
matter of fact, colbert and his grand plan for france is why today all over the world they still speak french in much of southeast asia, africa, the caribbean, and of course canada.
this is the kind of thing all those foreigners make for colbert.
well, to be fair, there are one or two frenchmen involved, and one of them's a guy called pierre puget.
which includes a new navy with ships decorated by puget, who gets his artistic start at the pitti palace in florence, where we go next.
in 1650, the pitti's being refurbished because it doesn't look grand enough for the grand duke, who brings in some of the hottest interior decorators he can find from all over italy.
the point of all this heavenly decor is, the duke is crazy for the new astronomy, coming from his favorite egghead, galileo.
in 1657, the duke and his brother start an academy of science so they can network with other nerds.
now, if you ask anybody who worked on the vacuum after this and discovered you could compress air and what it did when you did, they'd say boyle, of boyle's law.
nobody remembers, except every french person, that in france and only in france, it's called mariotte's law.
one other thing mariotte gets up to is looking at how fountains work.
now, this involves a water supply, and mariotte works out with astonishing perspicacity that most of the water supply around almost certainly comes from the sky.
so mariotte moves on to weather forecasting, sets up a reporting network all over france.
of course, by the time the reports get to him, they're a little out of date.
as usual with mariotte, somebody else has done all the work, a guy named pierre perrault, who's another perspicacious genius.
he reckons that if rainfall is the source of supply for fountains, it's probably what fills up rivers too.
and all those other stories in the first-ever kids' storybook, called "mother goose,"
a whole world of make-believe where nothing is what it appears to be, which is the reason i'm telling you this in the french disneyland, because apart from storybooks,
charles perrault gets into deep doo-doo with the french literary establishment when, in 1697, he mounts an attack on the classics... you know, greek and roman literature.
and then he goes totally off the rails by describing everybody's big hero, the ancient greek philosopher plato, as boring and then making remarks like, "who gives a rat's ass anyway
jonathan swift, world's greatest satirist, who drags the brits into the fight.
now, swift, who writes "gulliver's travels" and all that, is a churchman, but he's just a bit too good at the verbal vitriol, so he tends to get up the nose of very important people,
so you can guess what that does to his clerical career prospects.
see, back then, the way to a comfortable life... lots of food and wine and not too much work... is to become a bishop.
berkeley's new thing is about training yourself to recognize that nothing is ever what it appears to be... like all this is.
okay, here's berkeley's idea about how we look at things and recognize them.
young reckons, like berkeley, that color is processed in your brain too.
all that hits your retina are the primary colors in the spectrum:
shine a light through a prism, and split the light into primary colors.
then slide in another prism and see if you can split up one of the primary colors.
cortona paints astronomical ceilings in the pitti palace for the duke, who's turned on by torricelli's discovery of the vacuum at the top of a tube of mercury.
barometers and weather forecasts excite perrault, whose brother starts the literary revolt that also involves swift, whose pal bishop berkeley thinks up a new theory of vision confirmed by young, who then gets deeply into ancient egyptian.
young cracks the ancient egyptian language because quite by accident, he gets involved with an ancient egyptian stone covered in writing.
one day, when he had nothing better to do, somebody lent him the rosetta stone to play with.
after a while, young decides that the little groups of signs that repeat all over the place must be common words like "and"
and that bigger groups that appear regularly could be some kind of title, like "king" maybe.
once you've done that with this kind of egyptian writing, you just repeat the trick for hieroglyphs.
all this, you can do thanks to this giant book, produced by napoleon's scientists after they invade egypt in 1799, where, as i mentioned, the brits clobber napoleon and then grab the rosetta stone.
thing is, the book's got a zillion drawings of what they all saw up the nile, including a load more inscriptions for the hieroglyph code breakers to work on.
and there are all these drawings because of the speed those frenchmen were working at up the nile, getting the lead out in more senses than one, because france has just solved zee great french pencil crisis.
fellow called nicolas conté invents a mixture of graphite and clay, and, voila, an amazing new artificial pencil lead.
that's why that giant pencil sketchbook got done up the nile and then published by that pencil inventor,
to the union general below about what the confederate army is doing.
the general in question is george mcclellan, who's running the army of the potomac and is one of the few people to realize you can spy with a balloon.
he's among the more famous criminals, like jesse james, caught by mcclellan's now very experienced spy once he gets out of the army and opens the greatest detective agency in the history of the united states and named after him, the pinkerton.
and then pinkerton's casebook looks like the who's who of crookery.
irish, catholic, and tough... who gets a job as a miner and starts to act irish, catholic, and tough.
for two years, he sends pinkerton secret reports and avoids killing the people he's been ordered to by taking to whiskey so the mollies will think he's a hopeless drunk... and becomes a hopeless drunk.
but you try telling that to the fans, who've been making the pilgrimage to this place for the last 100 years... and who, 100 years ago, learn all about mcparlan in a novel called "the valley of fear,"
based on mcparlan's adventures with the molly maguires but not starring mcparlan.
the exiled scots escape to north carolina, making turpentine, used for making chinese lacquer on tinplate colbert wants.
french navy decorator puget, who paints places where they play with barometers.
the weather freak, whose brother's writing turns on swift, whose pal berkeley has visual theories that young confirms while decoding ancient egyptian from examples sketched by pencils invented by french balloonists.
the american balloons by pinkerton and his intrepid agent mcparlan, who becomes famous in england.
this program reveals how, if you stay cool, free, tropical, healthy, maritime, watery, foolish,
eastern, on the move, frog loving, and experimental, you, too, can stay in touch.
an american scientist called lyman spitzer is apparently on one of these things for about half an hour.
on the way up the mountain, he's thinking about that newspaper story about some guy in argentina who's cracked the nuclear fusion problem.
when you do, they release a humungous amount of heat to make steam to drive turbines to make electricity.
so first you need a gas packed with the atoms so they're more likely to hit each other, and the gas has to be hot, like a million degrees.
nothing is what gets kamerlingh onnes his nobel prize... getting the temperature down to nearly nothing.
because onnes thinks that when things are chilled close to absolute zero, they do strange things.
take a small magnet, and place it gently on a special kind of metal plate you're going to make extremely cold.
okay, now for the chill down with a liquid gas colder than minus 100 degrees.
meet louis-paul cailletet, french ballooning freak, and his group of fellow noodlers.
cailletet's another physicist who is keen on getting high, so he invents the first ever liquid oxygen breathing system for people heading up where the air is thin.
no fool cailletet, he takes the cold oxygen and repeats the trick, each time dropping the pressure deliberately.
each time, the oxygen temperature drops further and further until, at one point, it's so cold, it goes liquid.
cailletet carries his liquid oxygen in a flask and sniffs the vapors.
this, of course, leads him on to study breathing and pressure and all that good stuff.
the eiffel tower, built of wrought iron by, guess who, gustave eiffel.
as i said, gustave is also a noodler and obsessed by what you can do with towers, like release things and observe their aerodynamic behavior, for instance.
i mean, there are monarchists who want a king and crazy radicals who want another revolution and socialists and anarchists and every other kind of -ists.
so the idea is to come up with something that will strengthen the moderates and give the place a little political stability.
so they decide to give america a present, made by gustave, to remind all frenchmen of their good, moderate, democratic friends, the yanks.
and, of course, remind the yanks and the rest of the world that, nudge nudge, it was the french who bankrolled the american war of independence.
it was french, looking away from america back towards what the french regarded as the home of liberty, france.
so the statue was intended to be nothing less than a permanent reminder of french culture, a gigantic ad for french achievements right in the middle of new york harbor.
but now take a look at how the americans give french political intentions the old switcheroo.
what does it is the famous poem written for the statue.
who also builds miss liberty with her poem by zionist emma lazarus, whose zionism takes my story to tropical shores.
at one point during her efforts to establish a jewish state, which this isn't,
i suppose i ought to mention that most of the traveling oliphant gets up to, he's doing something somewhere for queen and country.
one job he gets is working for a diplomat name of elgin, who hits the headlines when he forces beijing to accept opium instead of money for exports to britain and brings addiction and ruin to china.
the missing bits look like this, and in 1803, they're removed by one of the elgin family, lord elgin.
the pieces he snitches had originally been the parthenon temple frieze, found in bits by lord elgin after the parthenon was blown up during a war.
elgin discovers them being ground up for cement by local builders and decides he'd better save them and then sells them to the british museum, where they still are, with the help of thomas lawrence, a really big-name, high-society painter.
lawrence paints the queen and anybody else that matters, as a result of which he gets appointed painter to the king, which is going to be great for lawrence's financial health, speaking of which, in 1776,
not surprising, considering the background of the new royal physician, john hunter, who was a bit of a slower learner.
well, it takes till he's 17 before he can read and write.
but with all that experience, where else would he go but surgery?
hunter is so good at it, he kind of kicks off modern surgical procedures.
so he and his brother open an anatomy school in london, a knockout success, and john indulges his other obsessions:
the study of codfish hearing, the digestion of hibernating lizards, and hedgehogs.
in 1760, before hunter becomes royal physician, he has a terrible row with his brother, who promptly walks out on him... to be replaced by another anatomist called william hewson, who, in 1770, has the luck to marry a lady whose lodger is a kind of negotiator
and who comes in to help settle a row william hewson's having about a contract.
and the reason we care about this negotiator person is something i'll get to after i have this tooth fixed.
oh, the other reason i'm in the dentist's chair, another obsession of john hunter.
the other thing franklin gets up to with all these transatlantic crossings is find out you can get across the atlantic faster if you get your ship onto a mysterious current moving east across the ocean.
and you know you're on this current because its water is warmer than the surrounding sea.
now, the reason fahrenheit's thermometer is such a boffo success is because back in the 18th century, finding out what the temperature is is not what you'd call an exact science.
in fact, you could say they're all working in the dark.
fahrenheit clears up the confusion created by everybody doing it a different way with different scales on their instruments so temperature is a matter of anybody's guess.
now, to start with, the way fahrenheit makes his thermometer is nothing new.
okay, make each degree four degrees, which turns freezing water from 71/2 to 30 and a healthy armpit to 90 but doesn't divide by 8.
so make 3032 and 9096, and there you are, plus one last tweak.
fahrenheit kind of just turns up, takes notes of ole rømer's notes, and then nips back down south to amsterdam, not long after which
ole rømer's notes get destroyed in a terrible fire, not long after which, it's "ole who?"
rømer gets picked up by a french astronomer and brought here to france, where he does amazing things like working out the speed of light and becomes the favorite foreign egghead of king louis xiv.
and that's eventually why the king of denmark asks ole to come home, and that's eventually why
jean picard, a major french science nerd, one of those "i can go anywhere, do anything" types, you know?
serve him right, considering what king louis xiv asks him to do next, which is to ask him to do this.
he rigs up a telescope to measure the slightest differences in land levels so he knows exactly where to site the reservoirs.
so by 1683, there's a whole network of interconnecting channels and pools and stuff to keep enough water coming to keep fountains spurting night and day and, most important of all, provide the king with the water show he wants
a garden center the like of which nobody has ever seen before.
the versailles gardens are put together for louis by one of the greatest gardeners in history, fellow named le nôtre, a man for whom nature needs a haircut.
what louis xiv does to satisfy his megalomania makes even hollywood consumption look inconspicuous.
about the only thing louis doesn't mess with are the french forests, only because the other thing he wants is a navy, which is why the next royal inspector of the french marine has an obsession about wood.
here we are on a british man-of-war awaiting the arrival of the aforementioned
french inspector general of marine, a genial twit by the name of duhamel du monceau.
duhamel is here because this is where you come back then if you want to learn all about making wooden warships.
in the middle of the 18th century, it takes more than french gold braid and fancy hats to impress the british navy, who are busy taking over the world.
i mean, they're so accustomed to winning every sea battle they fight, they even write catchy little tunes about ruling the waves.
now, the reason this scribbling fool is taking so many notes is, in terms of timber use, this place is the equivalent of a fair-sized bit of forest.
like oak for the interior fittings belowdecks, oak for the decks, oak for the ship's furniture, and oak for the hull.
then there's oak for the cannon supports, more oak for the pulley blocks you wind all the ropes on, and, of course, the gangways are made of oak.
so when he gets back to france, he becomes a tree hugger and sets up the first real arboretum with experimental shrubs and trees on his family estate, where he also writes copious works on fertilizing and hoeing and manuring and general agricultural muck.
one of his books gets translated into english in 1759 and becomes a big hit with british architectural types, a matter which takes us once more to tropical shores.
duhamel's book about gardens strikes just the right note with an english guy who's just written a book of his own, which is kind of about what you do once you've got the garden duhamel talks about in his book.
all about the kind of building you might like to have if you had a really posh garden and you wanted a really fancy place to live in.
by 1761, he's chief royal architect, and by 1774, he's getting really big jobs.
i mean, take a look at this desirable residence, a giant palace called somerset house in downtown london.
not royal, of course, and, if you live up here in scotland and you're waiting to catch the next one to somewhere, not frequent, if at all, given the state of the roads.
by 1802 or so, the state of scottish roads becomes the concern of a stone mason employed by william chambers back when he was building somerset house, remember?
scottish highlanders from their land and setting fire to their houses and all that good stuff and are now wondering what's happened to scotland's population, like most of them have hightailed it to the u.s. and canada.
so the english ask telford to think about measures to get the scots to come back.
over 28 years, telford puts in harbors, 900 miles of new roads, and 1,000 new bridges.
so when the committee for the new london bridge turns down his high-tech cast-iron design,
comes up with a design for a cast-iron london bridge which is turned down by the london bridge committee, a bunch of politicians and science biggies, including the guy who's about to do something to this program which i hope you'll find illuminating.
the committee member in question is thomas young here, who is, by this time, on everybody's committee, being, well, a genius.
here we have a candle, a lens, a card with a pinhole in it, and one with two slits.
okay, shine the light from the candle through the lens so you get a nice, focused beam.
then carefully place your cards so that the light goes first through the pinhole, then the slits, and voila.
young realizes the light going through the slits and mingling must be coming in light waves, because this interference pattern could only be made by waves.
and the hunt for it shakes up the brains of most of the 19th century's complement of serious propellerheads.
now, the biggest propeller in germany at the time is a harrumph type name of helmholtz, prof at the university of berlin, and he puts one of his whiz kids, hertz, onto the case.
meanwhile, what does müller mean by that stuff about what makes everything tick?
well, what müller is thinking of is one of those weird
"may the force be with you" things operating in people, in animals, even in plants.
to start with, take a look at the bit of a plant that fascinates müller:
except for another german who spends many experimental years on the beach... in his case, monte carlo... and takes over as leader of the vitalist movement.
his name is ludwig klages, and you know klages better than you may think for something else he gets up to, because klages is the guy who analyses the way people move and comes up with what we now call body language
but look at him, leaning towards her, nodding when she nods, legs crossed towards her.
this, says klages, is a couple of people trying not to display their inner feelings but sending out messages in spite of themselves.
klages reckons every move you make gives you away like that, shows the real you behind what he calls the "mask of courtesy."
klages uses his research to develop a new science he calls characterology and sells it as a hotshot analytical tool when you're interviewing people for job selection.
klages is the guy who starts all that stuff about handwriting being another way to see into a person's character, the idea being the way you write is a mixture of all the conflicting forces that make up your personality.
and graphology, as it's called, can reveal which side of your personality has got the upper hand.
so klages' graphology says, for example, large sloping letters show either enthusiasm and getting on with people or, depending which side of you is stronger, lack of realism and a tendency to rashness.
on the other hand, small vertical writing is either realism and rationality or lack of enthusiasm and a certain coldness of character.
my handwriting is clearly realistic and rational with a touch of paranoia and, you will note, barely readable.
now, one of the reasons why klages' graphology claims to be able to reveal character from writing is because everybody's is unique, a painful fact of life for anybody trying to deal with the u.s. mail in the 1960s when they start trying
to get some automation into the process by inventing the zip code because the increase in business mail gets kind of overwhelming and goes on that way.
so by the 1980s, there are nifty new optical character-recognition machines, which are able to read the zip and then spray a bar code onto the piece of mail so computers read the bar code and sort the mail.
but you still have to write the zip code in capital letters because of what klages calls the "extreme individualism" of handwriting.
mind you, all this black marks on paper and handwriting stuff will all disappear anyway when we switch from ink to electronics.
i mean, the same electronics that made possible optical character recognition so machines can read the zip code on this envelope and tell me where to bring this letter exactly.
for instance, here to sri lanka, to the southern province of sri lanka, here, to a village in the middle of nowhere called balana.
without thought to geography... with the equivalent of a laptop, a cell phone, and a satellite on the great global net.
and if you've been watching this series, you'll know what i mean, because throughout this series, we've been traveling on a kind of global net through time and space on the great web of knowledge
who also built the statue of liberty with its famous poem by the jewish activist emma lazarus, who gets a lot of help from oliphant, whose boss elgin is the son of the guy who snitches the elgin marbles and sells them
with the help of royal painter thomas lawrence, whose colleague dr. hunter has an assistant whose wife's lodger is none other than benjamin franklin, who charts the gulf stream with a thermometer fahrenheit snitches from ole rømer,
whose pal picard surveys versailles and provides the water for the fountains and the royal gardens and all the trees that inspire duhamel to write the book on gardening that gets read by the architect william chambers, who hires the scottish stone mason thomas telford,
whose idea for london bridge is turned down by thomas young, whose light waves travel in ether, as do hertz's electricity waves, with which helmholtz zaps that frog to disprove the vitalists, whose leader, klages,
one of the lethal things this warplane can drop on the enemy is something that changed the face of war over 50 years ago with a rubber shortage... rubber they used to use in world war ii mixed with gasoline
so it would burn slowly when you dropped it on something:
the solution to this crisis produces one of the most controversial weapons of all time.
what these early '50s flights are testing is a kind of gel that does this:
the really effective thing about napalm is that when they stick it to you, they really stick it to you.
when a 100-gallon drop tank filled with sticky napalm hits the ground, within an area 30 by 90 yards, everything is toast.
it's ironic, that toasting effect that napalm has, considering where it all starts:
on toast, with this stuff, invented by an obscure frenchman named mége to solve a crucial problem facing france at the time:
a rapidly rising population of people too poor to have breakfast.
what little food they can afford is a lousy diet, anyway... when it comes to energy-giving food that'll keep you going all day long in some factory or other.
so mége comes up with a mixture of beef suet and milk that will spread and is cheap enough for all those poor, starving factory workers to afford.
and for reasons that mystify me, he sells the pattern to a dutchman, and the world gets margarine and likes it so much, there isn't enough beef suet to go around, which, you might say, changes the name of the game.
but back in the late 19th century, palm oil is the reason there's margarine on your supermarket shelves today, and it's so easy to get.
you just reach up and cut... and then squeeze the oil out of the fruit.
well, about 20 years after mége does his thing, they find a way to harden up the vegetable oils in margarine so it'll spread on the bread.
now, to be perfectly fair, the way they do this is extremely boring, but i'll be extremely quick.
okay, here are your palm oil molecules, and here are some hydrogen molecules, which don't normally belong together until you introduce stuff called kieselguhr, a fine powder, onto which you deposit a little nickel,
and what the nickel on the kieselguhr does is act like a catalyst.
all you have to do is get the whole lot well mixed up, and bingo, the hydrogen molecules stick themselves into the palm oil molecules.
because it's getting hydrogen into the oil, the process is called hydrogenation, and it makes the oil stiff enough so it'll spread on your toast.
and the kieselguhr-nickel catalyst will do that hardening trick to most oils, including, ironically, fish oils.
because that stuff with the funny name, kieselguhr, is why the fish are where they are to be fished in the first place.
now, when the tiny plankton die, their tiny shells sink and zillions of years later have become sedimentary layers you grind up into kieselguhr powder.
and we know this because of a fellow named victor hensen, who in 1888 is trying to make more money for the german fishing fleet.
north and south, with pretty constant strong winds drawing cold, food-rich currents up from the depths, plankton thrive.
and what that does is explain why you get all those anchovies and tuna off the coast of peru at certain times of the year.
so the anchovies that live on the plankton have a feast, and then the tuna that live on the anchovies have a feast, and then we have a feast.
and the reason that current happens at all is discovered by a dutchman called ballot.
if this were a light approaching at a zillion miles an hour, its light waves would get to you increasingly frequently.
higher frequency light is bluer, so the approaching light source should look bluer.
if the light is departing, light waves from it hit you less frequently.
low-frequency light's redder, so doppler reckons the red stars astronomers see must be stars moving away from us and the blue stars, coming towards us.
when the wheel is going at exactly 12.6 revolutions a second, the teeth...
watch the bottom... pass at exactly the same time as the light wave crests and block the light.
on our way to hitting the water, palm oil is hardened for margarine with a process using that stuff called kieselguhr, made from shells of dead plankton that live in currents identified by ballot, who also tests the doppler effect
that happens with moving sound and moving stars, so fizeau works out the speed of light.
fizeau marries the daughter of a spectacularly boring french flower freak about whom virtually nothing has been written, you'll be happy to hear, not even by his best pal, who lives here in paris and writes a lot.
the scribbling friend is the greatest french romantic novelist nobody's ever heard of, named prosper merimee.
he gets told the story when he's traveling in spain and bumps into an aristocratic spanish family and becomes a good pal of them all, and especially the little daughter.
that friendship with the little girl turns out to be one of the best things that ever happens to merimee.
years later, when he's back in paris, so is she, grown up and empress of france.
okay, we fast-forward to 1834, when merimee's back here in paris and his little pal is empress, and merimee gets to be the great savior of notre dame cathedral because the empress gets him the job of inspector general of monuments,
well, he is until they start noticing that every time he inspects a library, valuable books kind of go missing.
chased by the cops, he escapes to england... where another italian book lover offers him a job.
i've spent most of my life waiting for days just to get my hands on one... here at the british museum library.
libri's pal, antonio panizzi, becomes the head librarian in 1856, and he's the guy who designs the great main reading room beloved of readers and snoozers the world over.
you can imagine him, can't you, in retirement, settling down in the evening over a nice cup of hot chocolate and thanking the fellow who made it all possible:
the guy who invented hot chocolate, dr. hans sloane, fortunately for panizzi, the guy who got the british museum built in the first place.
the unfortunate event occurs not long before the aristocratic lady in question sets off in 1715 for turkey.
what that doctor, hans sloane, has done back in london is save the life of lady mary wortley montague from a disease that nearly always kills and always disfigures:
she discovers that smallpox in turkey isn't the killer disease it is back in england.
so she takes a closer look, and what she discovers puts her in the medical history books.
turns out the turks are taking the liquid from the pustules of people with smallpox and inoculating healthy children with it, who then never catch smallpox.
this turns lady mary on so much, eventually, back in england, she persuades the medical profession to start inoculating.
the other thing she does here is write flowery letters home about her experiences, including how turkey is coveting tulips.
at the time, there's a tulip craze among the turkish aristocracy, so they're worth a fortune, and there are 1,300 varieties.
tulips have been a rarity in the west since the 1560s, when europeans get their first glimpse of them in a book by a swiss guy, conrad gesner, who's also the first person to classify plants by their structures and seeds.
but gesner's real claim to fame is a modest work he comes up with in 1555, entitled "the universal collection of books."
every author since the printing press 100 years before and dictionaries, encyclopedias, grammar books, and the lord's prayer in 22 languages, and something complicated on how to analyze the real meaning of ancient texts.
that last thing endears him to his godfather, who's keen on that kind of approach to the bible and partial to sausages.
what happens next is a rare case of history being changed, thanks to conrad gesner's godfather, by somebody's eating habits.
point is, gesner's godfather is a swiss, sausage-eating catholic priest about to turn protestant and persuade many other swiss catholics to do the same, so we're talking the theological importance of sausages, because if you were about to lead a protestant revolt against rome,
one way to rally others to your cause could be with sausages.
thing is, gesner's godfather is one ulrich swingli, and he eats the sausage in question in 1522 in zurich in lent,
the oldest english regiment, the coldstream guards, who move with precision in battle with this new trick.
the new idea of maneuvering on the battlefield in close ranks like this means they also drop big hats and wide cloaks in favor of combat outfits.
the guy who introduces marching bands also goes on to put music and movement together in a very different way.
his name is lully, and by 1673, he's master of music for louis xiv, and he's putting on some of the very first versions of this:
what they do there is the business of the king's superintendent of dance, one pierre beauchamps, who invents choreography, which is taught by this ingenious method.
the idea really catches on, and soon, dancers are, so to speak, toeing beauchamps' line.
the technique is called track notation from the line you follow to the different positions of the feet.
so using these notations, here for the first time is what early ballet must have looked like when they put it on stage in london in 1717... something like this.
you see how much more limited the movements are than in ballet today?
the first time ballet and drama are put together, it's a smash hit called the " beggar's opera"
but for a few months back in 1714, he's secretary to a club of literary biggies.
the name of the game is to publish anonymous articles attacking public figures without getting caught.
what divides good christians but the words transubstantiation, consubstantiation, and no substantiation?
of course, none of this makes any sense today, but back then, these guys really dipped their pens in vitriol, aided and abetted by the only one among them who can afford to wine and dine everybody
music to the ears of a dull and uneventful young mathematician in holland.
and that's all i want to say about him, except to say his name is willem s'gravesande, and he's writing an analysis of isaac newton's work.
but in this case, one of these guys visits willem in holland to get his opinion... this, however, well before the frenchman in question becomes a famous hotshot philosopher, international scientist, and literary lover.
here we are in france, where the literary lover does his literary loving.
the only affair that matters happens here, at the chateau de cirey in eastern france.
this is where our lover, name of voltaire, ends up spending several years of unwedded bliss with the lady of the house... the beautiful emily du chatelet, whose husband is in the military and permanently somewhere else.
i guess the best way to describe this amorous couple is compulsive workaholics and, i suppose... control freaks, because when you come here to visit these two, which i suppose half of european brainpower does, it doesn't matter
what kind of intellectual big cheese you might be back home, here you live by the bell.
mind you, in spite of all the egghead intensity, life in the country is pretty relaxing, so voltaire and emily have a constant stream of guests.
after the hustle and bustle of paris and all those husbands he might run into,
voltaire settles down here for a few years, happily, at cirey.
and for the rest of his life, takes things at a snail's pace.
this is the northern italian city of avila, center of the universe for contemporary snail research by a towering intellect of italian science who is also into worms and bugs at the time.
the worm and bug man works in the hallowed halls of the university of avila, where they still remember him, name of lazaro spallanzani, the man who turns the lowly worm into a science star.
you know, it's a pity so few people know about spallanzani, mainly because somebody else got all the credit nearly 100 years later for a nifty idea that was really spallanzani's.
pasteur is that other guy's name, and i'll bet you've heard of him.
well, here's what spallanzani does, way ahead of pasteur, and never gets the credit.
here's a flask full of dirty water full of little whizzer microorganisms that spallanzani sees down a microscope like this.
ernst hoffman's life goes a bit like coppelia, full of fits and starts.
he's a lawyer, then a playwright, then a theater impresario, then out of work, and in 1819, a judge and the author of the first weirdo psychological novels.
as judge, he's investigating a bunch of nationalists, one of whom, name of karl follen, decides he won't get a fair trial.
so in 1820, he runs away, vaulting the border to france, then vaulting the border to switzerland, then vaulting the atlantic to the u.s. a... where the other side of his nationalism takes him over every obstacle
gymnastics then gets taken up by the american ymca, and in 1852, the first ymca world conference is organized by henry dunant of switzerland, and then things for dunant take a really nasty turn.
one day in 1859, the french and the austrians fight a battle, naturally enough, neither in france nor austria but just outside a small village in northern italy called solferino.
dunant tries to do something, anything, for soldiers lying in pools of their own blood.
for three straight days and nights, everybody works like hell with nothing but water and strips of cloth for bandages.
and finally, in 1864, he persuades 15 countries to get together to set up battlefield medical teams, cross the lines, help the wounded, go anywhere.
henry's little meeting, which they have in geneva, agrees on a convention.
nobody knows why till it is discovered that blood contains things that mean all bloods don't necessarily mix well.
these things turn out to be factors that put blood into identifiable groups:
you do transfusions between compatible blood groups, and it's no problem.
the guy who discovers this gets a nobel prize for his work back in 1900 because it makes possible modern surgery.
then you repeat that trick twice, so temporarily, you've turned the vessel tube into a triangle shape, easy enough to sew.
and when you've done the three sides, the vessel springs back circular and joined all the way round.
next thing carroll wants is to be able to pump replacement blood and nutrients into organs removed for treatment so they'll survive to go back.
this pump, designed by a pal of his, does that, so now carroll can work towards his real goal:
32 guns, special armor, fastest battleship afloat, and goes 12,000 miles without refueling.
world war ii starts, and in the atlantic, "graf spee" strikes.
and it's all over, except for adolf hitler, who decides the brits have come to invade norway, so he does.
in april 1940, the germans take norway, the final link in the chain of events
i've been following in this program towards the moment when we hit the water, remember?
the german invasion of norway takes place in a matter of days.
three weeks later, they've got the biggest security ring you've ever seen round that place down there.
it's a hydroelectric plant, and it's the most important german invasion target in norway because it uses the electricity generated by water falling from this dam high in the mountains to make more water, but it's water of a special kind...
now, all water has tiny amounts of deuterium in it, and with unlimited electricity from the hydroelectric station, you can kind of reduce the mix and end up with water heavy in deuterium, which is why they call it "heavy water."
now, if you shoot neutrons through this heavy water, the deuterium atoms will slow the neutrons down just enough so that when they hit a bit of uranium on the other side, they kick off a nuclear chain reaction,
before she sees turkish tulips, first drawn by gesner, whose godfather eats sausages and cancels the military contract with france, where they invent military music and choreography, used in a london show by john gay, whose friend arbuthnot does statistics that impress the dutch mathematician
who knows voltaire, who hears from the worm-slicing spallanzani, who stars in the story by judge hoffman, who tries german nationalists who start gymnastics, adopted by the ymca and the guy who kicks off the red cross,
who need blood typing, surgical stitching, and the transfusion pump invented by lindbergh, whose father-in-law's disarmament treaty leads to "graf spee," "altmark,"
and the german invasion of norway and the allied commandos whose mission was to hit the water.
smithson discovered it when he was crystal hunting in england and came across stuff like this.
it's called calamine, as in calamine lotion, which is made of one form of the crystal.
if you slice a bit out and then squeeze it, put pressure on it, the crystal changes shape slightly, and when it does that, it gives off an electric charge.
and the more pressure you put on it, the more electric charge it makes.
put two crystal slices up against each other and hit one with electricity.
it changes shape, squeezes the other one, and it makes electricity... the same charge that affected the first one.
now, don't nod off, because, as you will see, this turns out to be a tale of genius and a dark passion and behavior that perhaps can best be described as bohemian... in more ways than one,
because one of those two french brothers working on crystals, a fellow called pierre, marries a girl called marie who comes from poland, and the reason they both care deeply about where i am now... down the bottom of a mine in the czech republic,
together with this very slightly radioactive water... is because this is where they get the raw material on which they will use their little electricity gauge and change the entire world.
here's where the raw material comes from... the northern mountains of the czech republic in bohemia, and it comes out of these mountains by the ton.
and before our curious couple get interested in it, it's used for coloring ceramics.
and it's mined here, just outside the little town of jáchymov... down there.
oh, by the way, that use of pitchblende to color ceramics was something to do with glazing pottery and nothing to do with my story, so i won't go on about it.
okay, in 1896, a german called röntgen totally blows away the world of science with one of the most amazing discoveries anybody has ever seen.
looking for more mystery rays and what you might do with them.
it only takes a few weeks, and bingo, some frenchman repeats the trick.
and it turns out if you put an object between the uranium and a photographic plate and then leave the whole shebang in darkness, the next time you look, there's a shadow of the object on the plate,
as if the uranium had been giving out some mysterious invisible light.
the other thing uranium does, our frenchman discovers, is to very slightly charge up the air around it.
but this is ho-hum stuff and nothing at all to do with the exciting mystery rays, so our frenchman kind of ignores that bit.
in 1898, the curies are getting concentrates of various materials by boiling and distilling them, and one of the things they do that to is pitchblende.
and their crystal electricity gauge identifies an amazingly powerful electrical charge in the air all round the stuff.
soon everybody's decided slightly radioactive water is good for your health.
speaking of health, unfortunately, marie's husband, pierre, is killed by a truck not long afterwards.
five years later, the widow curie is sending out ioneliness signals to the guy who has been their lab assistant for years, a fellow called paul langevin, who gets the message, and in no time at all,
the two of them become a big of an item... and a national scandal, because back then, widows are not supposed to send that kind of signal to unattached men.
course, given what langevin is about to do with the curies' little crystal gizmo, receiving signals is right up his street.
you're watching langevin's use of the crystal right now, because that's how this submarine hunter knows when to fire her depth charges to best effect, because, thanks to langevin and what's called the langevin sandwich,
attached to the hull of the ship is a small kind of dome structure and, inside, that langevin sandwich i mentioned... a slice of crystal sandwiched between two plates of steel.
okay, you recall the crystal reacts to electricity by changing its shape each time you zap it.
when that happens, the vibration caused by the changing crystal shape makes the steel plates vibrate too.
and when that happens, the vibrations are really powerful and send out waves into the water surrounding the dome, like this.
the waves go out in all directions, and when they hit something, like a sub, they bounce back, put pressure on the crystal, and it makes electricity.
and that's what generates the pinging noise that tells the sub hunter were the sub is and what to do about it.
the langevin sandwich becomes known as sonar, and early in world war ii, it makes life very uncomfortable for the german u-boat wolf packs lurking under the surface and helps the allies win the battle of the atlantic.
by the end of the war, thanks to sonar, the allies have sunk 782 u-boats or forced them to surface to surrender.
the only one of her kind still in one piece, anchored in san francisco as a tourist attraction.
she's a special kind of ship, designed to carry supplies and american troops to europe through thick, thin, and wolf packs.
and to add insult to injury, when they are launched, they have no radio detection finders, no fire detection equipment, no emergency power generators, and no lifeboat radios.
but with a war on, the name of the game is fast and, above all, cheap.
you go from one ship to another, and you don't know you've left.
and that's because nobody's ever built a ship this way before.
by 1942, they've got it down to an incredible 151/2 hours.
they carry 9,000 tons, go at 11 knots, and nobody thinks they'll last longer than five years, even if a u-boat doesn't get them first.
that's another reason why during world war ii, this ship is such hot stuff.
point about welding a ship is, it's faster than joining the bits together with rivets, but not as strong.
you get acetylene gas by slowly dripping water onto calcium carbide, which some guy discovers you can make by banging high-voltage electric current into a mixture of lime and coke.
you deliver the current through a pair of carbon rods and do the whole thing in something called an electric arc furnace.
this is the brightest light in history so far, caused by electricity arcing across between these two carbon rods and causing them to burn incandescent.
keeping the rods the right distance apart as they burn away is something a frenchman called foucault thinks up.
he calls it a regulator, and, basically, it uses the tiny variation in current as the rods burn away to run a clockwork mechanism that moves the rods, keeping them close together.
in the theater, the arc light is the answer to every actor's prayer.
the first proper experimental version of it happens here, in the pantheon in the center of paris, and it's one of those science discoveries that gives you goose bumps.
foucault takes a heavy ball and attaches it to a great, long wire and makes sure the wire isn't twisted.
then he pulls it off to one side and fixes it to the wall with a piece of string.
and then, to make sure nothing will inference the swing of the ball in the slightest way, he burns the string.
if we move our camera so that it stays in line with this ball and we do a bit of time-lapse photography and i sit as still as i can, you'll see what foucault saw.
the ball goes on swinging in the same place, in inertial space, independent of the earth.
i said this was a cosmic idea because if you put foucault's clockwork arc light regulator together with his inertial pendulum, there's only one thing you can use them for... to save astronomers from eyestrain.
put yourself in the astronomer's place, staring up at the nightly show whizzing by, because thanks to the fact that the earth spins at 1,000 miles an hour, you're moving around at a fair lick, and the stars aren't.
foucault's doing that inertial pendulum thing of his and realizes that the trick to stargazing is to use a clockwork regulator... remember the arc light... to turn a telescope the opposite way to the earth so heavenly bodies stay in the frame
just long enough for foucault to do what he does next... take a photograph.
and speaking of shows, that's where foucault gets his photography from in the first place.
okay, this is the 1822 version of virtual reality, called a diorama, and the latest excitement for the paris glitterati.
put a light on the scene itself, and off the fog effect goes, and the scene clears.
take light off the spring scene and onto the snow scene behind, and that's what you see.
you take a silvered copper plate out of its case... in darkness, of course...
expose it to the scene, and then utter those immortal photographic words,
put the exposed plate in iodine vapor to get a film of silver iodide on the plate.
now put it in mercury vapor that only sticks to the bits hit by bright light.
dipping the plate in hyposulfite washes off the bits not mercurized.
wash everything with distilled water, and you get the world's first photograph.
and one day, his vats need cleaning out, so he chucks in some sulfuric acid, and out come violet fumes that condense to become what he then discovers is iodine for daguerre to use in his photographs.
the reason for the fumes is what courtois has been using as a replacement for wood ash.
this one, for instance, in northern scotland, where a lot of that wood ash replacement comes from, thanks to the fact that the 18th-century scottish nobility are pretty fed up with living in crumbling ancestral homes with no heat or running water or lavatories.
nope, they'd rather be enjoying the high life down in london, but with no money, no way.
all you have to do to make yourself a fortune is persuade all those penniless, starving, and unemployed peasants who live on your land to collect it for you.
this is the easy bit, since the law at the time prevents them from emigrating to a better life in america, they're desperate for any work, and most of them owe you rent.
you just, well, burn it in pits and then pile stones on top to compress the ashes down, which is why making money with kelp is a piece of cake... because what comes out is cakes of wood ash.
ship these off to the factories in england, where they grind the cakes into a fine powder which they call potash and scottish aristocrats call "money for jam."
the profits from this local slavery are so humungous that soon, some scottish castle owners have enough cash to spare to build more castles with no heat, running water, or lavatories in which they don't have to live,
because now they're having fun spending the rest of the profits down in london.
i refer, of course, to that minor event otherwise known as the industrial revolution, for which potash is essential, especially in the underwear business.
see, down south in england, three decades of hot indian summers has meant great harvests and cheap food, so spare cash to buy a knockout new foreign fabric called cotton.
make more of this new wonder cloth but for the same amount of money.
so in 1753, they automate the weaver's shuttle by putting it on little wheels and tying a bit of string to it so the weaver can tug it backwards and forwards.
the thread makers can't make thread fast enough to keep up with this new weaving speed.
so in 1776, they automate the way the cotton wool is drawn of bobbins and pulled out into thread, so the old thread making by hand problem is solved, and the old thread makers are out of work.
some people want even finer cloth for that fancy new idea i mentioned earlier... underwear.
so in 1779, somebody thought that one out with a really nifty trick:
demand goes through the roof, and all this thanks to those indian summers.
the other place they have indian summers is india, where the cotton comes from... places like madras, founded by the english.
by 1790, the stuff is leaving here for britain by the ton.
at first, it's finished articles like shirts going back to england for the rich to wear, but as all that industrial revolution textile machinery gets into high gear, back in the u.k., we're into mass marketing,
and with roads the way they are out here, regular delivery is in your dreams.
none of which helps british cloth manufacturers, tearing their hair out because they've got a market growing like top seed.
ah, no, not this kind... the kind invented around 1793 by a penniless american called eli whitney... a cotton gin, a machine that takes the seeds out of cotton automatically, a bit like that.
whitney's gin deseeds cotton 300 times faster than a human can, so the price of american cotton goes through the floor.
that switch to cheap american cotton really boosted the economy of the southern states and expanded cotton growing until there was almost nothing else going on there.
none of which helps whitney very much, who, early on, has switched from gins to muskets anyway and a new french idea for making guns with interchangeable parts so that if a bit breaks in battle, you just slam in a replacement.
and back then, clock making is a very time-consuming business till eli whitney's interchangeable parts idea gets around, and suddenly, now everybody can know what time it is, because with a few lathes and patterns and measuring gauges,
you can churn out cheap wooden clocks made of interchangeable parts till it's time for the cows to come home.
in 1816, a young fellow named chauncey jerome sets up shop in new england and uses the same technique, but this time, instead of wood, he uses sheets of brass and gets machines to cut out the patterns for each bit by the thousand.
jerome's production-line approach turns the household clock into the world's first consumer durable.
smithson's crystals, curies' radium, sonar protecting ships welded by acetylene that leads to arc lights and pendulums so stargazers can photograph the sky with daguerreotypes using iodine from seaweed, which gets burnt for potash used on cotton,
which is processed by the gin invented by whitney, whose interchangeability ideas kick off poor old chauncey jerome.
the three-ring circus is, after all, invented by the prince of humbug, a.k.a. p.t. barnum, who starts in showbiz with a freak show.
then he finds a two-foot-high man he calls tom thumb and shows him off to european royalty.
but in 1880, his pièce de résistance is the greatest show on earth.
earlier on, in 1850, barnum makes a good deal of money as the american tour manager for the biggest thing in music maybe till elvis, an opera singer known as the swedish nightingale...
and speaking of notes, another musical genius with an interest in cash gets an offer from london to write an opera for lind, which he jumps at, because foreign commissions like that pay seven times what he gets from la scala back home in italy.
giuseppe verdi's opera starring lind, to the usual rapturous audiences, is called "i masnadieri,"
and if you've never heard of it, that's because some people say without jenny lind, it would have bombed.
point is what it says about verdi, like, "he gets away with a lot."
i'm not saying he isn't one of the greatest operatic geniuses of all time.
but what he tends to write about, given what's going on at the time, is, to say the very least, dangerous lunacy.
let me tell you about what's going on at the time and why verdi's a lunatic.
in 1847, when he and lind get together, the austrians are occupying italy, right?
so here's verdi writing stuff with choruses called "long live italy"
and story lines about the israelites in captivity and arias about the fight for freedom.
okay, he's camouflaging it all by setting the things in france or israel or even america, but you'd have to be tone-deaf not to get the message behind verdi's political pitch.
about the only word missing from all this nationalistic libretto stuff is the word "get it."
turkish sultan abdülaziz, who has the khedive well under his thumb, and the khedive wants out from under;
besides which, the khedive is keen to make egypt look less like a third-rate run-down dump, which, at the time, it is.
unfortunately, verdi delivers "aida" too late for the khedive's third reason for asking him, which is to celebrate the inauguration of another great egyptian showpiece, the suez canal.
when it opens in 1869, it's the ninth wonder of the world, it brings east and west six weeks closer because now you don't have to go around africa, and it brings thomas cook into the story,
because cook is one of the nobodies who goes to the opening of the canal.
now, the red carpet gets rolled out for princes and ambassadors and assorted entertainment megastars, but rubberneckers like cook get to pay their own way and to spend a day here on the mediterranean island of malta en route.
not long afterwards, thomas cook limited are starting to run the cooks' tours... they've done ever since... and they've opened an office here in malta.
and, of course, one of the tours they're offering is egypt and, of course, the canal, which, as ninth wonder of the world, is well worth your package tour dollar.
100 miles long, starting at an unknown village that becomes port said, then through the desert, hitting various lakes on the way... one of which gets a new town named after the khedive,
ismailia... then through a final ridge, and the mediterranean is finally joined to the red sea.
25,000 laborers, ten years to build, and runs egypt into so much debt, the khedive has to sell his shares.
a lot of new harbors are built, as well as a lot of new lighthouses.
they even build another canal all the way from the nile to provide drinking water for the workers.
but the thing about the suez canal is, there may be no question that, historically speaking, it's the greatest idea since shish kebab.
and his hero is yet another suez canal wanna-be who, by the strangest coincidence, has a couple of brothers here in malta.
and this third person also claims to have designed the canal... name of henri saint-simon, a curious character, to say the least.
now, saint-simon's secretary, a fellow called auguste comte, another loony... and the last;
i promise... regards saint-simon as a kind of world-class genius, the guru of all time.
"just rational, scientific observation of how all the bits of the world fit together."
the thing is, back at the theological stage of development, there's no way people can be scientific.
and he says, "when you're looking at how a person functions,
"all you can go on is their view of the world,
on the subject of absolutes, buddhism's all about that... you know, no absolutes, no center to the universe, nothing but, uh, nothingness.
buddhism is attractive to the guy who takes over from comte, because buddhism represents a point of view that kind of says, "there's no point of view."
the fellow who turns that into a science is the professor of physics at the university of vienna in 1895,
ernst mach, famous for his popular science lectures, one of which is not a million miles from what these shows are all about... the accidental nature of discovery.
without a frame of reference, all you get is the local effect, which is no use to anybody... certainly not the hardheads in science.
so mach comes up with a view of how to view that somebody else calls mach's principle and that says, "everything in the cosmos is affected by everything else,"
here's the partial eclipse track, and here's the total eclipse track.
so here, on princes island, they photograph the moment of total eclipse when, because of the darkness, the stars are visible in the sky.
here's a couple... see... printed black on white to make them easier to make out.
now here comes the incredibly minute bit of detail that so often changes the course of history.
the guy who took this picture suddenly fell down... and a jeep with a machine gun came around the corner... so we started to shoot.
later we learned that none of the refugees had been killed... and that woman gave me this pot out of gratitude.
you were supposed to guard her, not take her out dancing.
i figured if she wanted to dance, better to do it near you.
when she was born, i was sorry she wasn't a son.
ten years later i was happy she was not a boy.
the doctor assured me that if you drink a glass of vodka, you'll die.
besides you're the only guy who's not doing this for money.
you won't let her get hurt, whatever the cost... that's why i hired you.
i asked you not to get out of the car every time.
i had to put you in the back seat and clean up that fat slob you shot in the street.
you were lucky he was aiming at your back, and not your head... because at that distance, he would've blown your head off.
i'll put the word out that if they sell drugs in front of school...
i'll shove enough drugs up their ass to give them constipation.
it's like building a house and burning everything all around it.
love is listening at the door to hear if those are her shoes squeaking on the stairs.
love is when you whisper baby to a woman forty years old, when you watch her eating even though you can't swallow a thing... and when you can't fall asleep until you touch her.
love is when you're standing under a tree together and you wish it would fall over so you'd have to protect her.
i have a chance to get an award for the best grades this year.
i went to the zacheta gallery with leon and i have a speech to give tomorrow.
i'm not grown up and that's why i'm going be alone now.
when my father was your age he burned a german tank!
and if you want another kind of love i'll wear a different mask.
if you want a partner, take my hand... if you want to hit me in anger, here i am.
i could beg on my knees for you to come back, to no avail...
i could crawl to you, baby, and grovel at your feet...
which means that i need you here to take over his cases, and his paperwork.
now i understand you've already started on the missing boy case.
i've got some bad news and i've got some good news.
last night dci formby was involved in a motor accident and broke both legs and an arm, yes i know.
all we do know is that he was naked, he'd been chloroformed, he was gagged with masking tape.
one other strange thing, someone had cut off his finger on his left hand.
so we've got a missing boy and a murder to solve.
there is one clue, half an hour before this little boy died, he ate a frankfurter.
so now you've got another theory that this is an insurance fraud?
yeah, well there's only one snag isn't there, the girl would have to be in on it as well.
eight in the evening 'til four in the morning, well, you take what you can get, don't you?
usually i look in on dean when i get back, but last night...
bobby kirkby is missing and we've got a child killer out there.
i want you to pull your finger out, you're not making enough effort.
his company can well afford this and more, if he refuses and the money is not delivered, the boy will die in circumstances in which i will never be identified.
sir richard will be held responsible as your paper will explain to the public.
all right, can you tell us how the deal is to be done, so that after the exchange we can pick the kidnapper up?
if i have your word there'll be no police involvement until it's over.
for this i get several millions of pounds worth of publicity.
do you mind if i put a tracer in amongst the money, sir?
this manic has abducted a child to make money out of me.
i'm responding with a commercial decision because the publicity is better than twopence off a can of beans.
collier will be in the store in radio communication, watching the public telephones.
now our man will make contact through those phones at 8 o'clock.
all the cars in those trees have got their lights out.
they don't come on again until they're looking for the girls' knickers afterwards.
then i saw a holdall, in the bushes, brand new it was.
so i decided to take it home and give it to the police in the morning.
you might like to know that he's going to go ahead with his press conference at 12 o'clock.
only now he intends to tell the whole world about last night's police fiasco.
sir, the stansfield case, do you mind if i put a tail on grafton?
no, it's fine by me but you better check it out with mullett first.
listen jack, i've got something on him you might be able to use as a lever.
do you remember those forged tens and twenties we had in town about a year back?
drop all charges against tommy dunstan and let me have all the information on those forged notes.
you'll be please to know that all the furs and jewelry were over insured.
you kidnapped one of those boys and you killed the other.
then you sent a ransom note, and last night you went to denton heath to collect.
unfortunately some poor old boy got in the way, so you clumped him one and snatched the money.
and you thinking the money was untraceable, you went on a spending spree.
but what you didn't know was, we had a list of all the serial numbers.
so we've got you bang to rights and i'm tired of listening to your lies so much so that i'm not even bothering to record them.
well, it took cindy a long time, if you know what i mean?
and when i went to where the bag was, there was an old bloke ferreting about, he was looking for something.
why didn't he just hide dean and then pretend he was still alive?
he needed a boy alive to make the appeal to sir richard.
maybe there is another possibility that's staring us in the face?
maybe the kidnapper did turn up, and someone snatched the money from him.
i'm sorry to bother you, but we've had a bit of luck.
we've caught the man who attacked you and stole the bag.
you're looking for hair, you're looking for fibre, you're looking for blood.
burton, don't forget we're also looking for a cassette recorder, we're looking for a computer printer and we're also looking for a bottle of chloroform.
you've been over that man's house with a tooth comb and his car.
any more pressure on finch and he'll have you for police harassment.
benidorm is wonderfully hot and we pity you shivering away in denton.
yes, do pay the milk bill for us and we'll settle up next week.
besides, any hatred i felt could never have been satisfied by money.
mr. frost, now that my wife has gone, and i don't have long to live, so what would i do with the ransom?
that means we don't speak to our competitors or the press.
eileen finch was on the point of breeching that rule, when i asked her to leave.
his intentions were to get sir richard cordwell to part with some of that funny money so he could expose him.
but unfortunately it went wrong and he didn't pick it up.
if he kept his mouth shut, the boy would die and he'd walk free.
do a deal, the boy lives, and he still walks free.
you know, something happened today, when we went to that house in wrights lane.
i'm sure it's important but i just can't put my finger on it.
well i tried to phone you at home, sir, but no one answered.
i haven't been more than six foot from the phone all evening.
which means that i need you here to take over his cases, and his paperwork.
now i understand you've already started on the missing boy case.
i've got some bad news and i've got some good news.

my assistant and i are up here looking for oil deposits.
well, when you see your assistant, tell him he's gonna have to replace that spare.
you see, around here a lot of folks often go out into the woods and go hiking.
i'm sure he's just somewhere out in the great outdoors communing with nature.
i don't care what the sheriff said, he didn't just walk off.
no one leaves without their wallet, or their laptop, or their car.
these people are pleasant to the point of nausea, but they tell you nothing.
maybe they don't think they have anything interesting to tell you.
up to 1949, there were 27 deaths, since 1949, there have been three.
talk to the town people about it, what do they say?
i spent the night in a speck of a town called mount dora.
it was hurricane season, so i got no further than the hotel bar.
look, she said she was going to the restaurant and she was gonna meet with parker.
why don't you go into your office and give him a call?
three people have disappeared in this town within the past two days.
now, if you're not gonna do anything about it, maybe the state police will.
if you don't become one of us, wade, you'll be sacrificed with the others.
you choose this, then you choose to be young for the rest of your life.
you may look young, parker, but, inside, you are as old and decrepit as i look.

i feel these words as if their meaning were weight being lifted from me knowing that you will read them and share my burden as i have come to trust no other.
that you should know my heart look into it finding there the memory and experience that belong to you that are you is a comfort to me now as i feel the tethers loose and the prospects darken for the continuance of a journey that began not so long ago and which began again with a faith shaken and strengthened by your convictions.

what it's like to know there is nothing you can do about it.
if that's too hard for you, then go as an investigator.
whatever you found or whatever you might find i think we both know that right now the truth is in me.

he emigrated to israel after world war ii where he joined the irgun... the jewish military underground.
he was arrested in 1959 by the british for a bombing that killed seven civilians.
just this morning... ..this is what i found under our door.
and now you've come here not to help us,... ..but to ask our help so you can impose your justice... ..on the only man who's taken justice into his own hands.
possibly moisture may have ieeched into the coffin,... ..into the binding and the pages of the book.
if the groundwater was contaminated, arsine gas could've created a combustible mixture.
it was a communal wedding ring made in kolin, a village near prague.
my father was an apprentice to the man who designed it.
until the day that i told him i was getting married.
and for the first time in 50 years, he took out this ring.
that a customer needed him, and that he would call me back.
but when i heard the phone ring later, something told me not to pick it up.
i feel these words as if their meaning... were weight being lifted from me, knowing that you will read them and share my burden... as i have come to trust no other.
that you should know my heart, look into it, finding there the memory and experience that belong to you, that are you, is a comfort to me now as i feel the tethers loose... and the prospects darken... for the continuance of a journey that began not so long ago,
and which began again with a faith shaken and strengthened... by your convictions.
if not for which i might never have been so strong now... as i cross to face you and look at you incomplete, hoping that you will forgive me... for not making the rest of the journey with you.
it is a mass on the wall between my sinus and cerebrum.
if it pushes into my brain, statistically there is about zero chance of survival.
if what you have is a result of your abduction, and that is something the government knows,
- then those are facts that should be brought to light.
i need you to bring the overnight bag from the trunk of the car.
and i need you to call my mother... and ask her to bring some things up to the hospital.
i think we both know that... right now the truth is in me.
and that's where i need to pursue it... as soon as possible.
and if the darkness should have swallowed me as you read this, you must never think there was the possibility of some secret intervention-- something you might have done.
and though we have traveled far together, this last distance must necessarily be traveled alone.
you'd think under your aegis, he wouldn't be consigned to a corner of the basement.
at least he doesn't take an elevator up to get to work.
[scully's voice] i have not written to you in thelast24hours... because the treatment has weakened my spirit as well as my body.
mulder, it's difficult to describe to you the fear of facing an enemy... which i can neither conquer nor escape.
seeing her, i can't help but see myself in a month or a year.
i pray that i have her courage to face this journey.
mulder, i feel you close... though i know you are now pursuing your own path.
for that i am grateful-- more than i could ever express.
you can't quite figure it out, but it can be explained, and it will be explained.
and no matter what you think as a scientist or doctor, there is a way and you will find it... to save yourself.
(scully's voice) for the first time i feel time like a heartbeat the seconds pumping in my breast like a reckoning the numinous mysteries that once seemed so distant and unreal threatening clarity in the presence of a truth entertained not in youth but only in its passage.
i feel these words as if their meaning were weight being lifted from me knowing that you will read them and share my burden as i have come to trust no other.
that you should know my heart look into it finding there the memory and experience that belong to you that are you is a comfort to me now as i feel the tethers loose and the prospects darken for the continuance of a journey that began not so long ago and which began again with a faith shaken and strengthened by your convictions.

(scully's voice) in med school i learned that cancer arrives in the body unannounced a dark stranger who takes up residence turning its new home against itself.
this is the evil of cancer that it starts as an invader but soon becomes one with the invaded forcing you to destroy it.
mulder, i hope that in these terms you might know it and know me and accept this stranger so many recognise but cannot ever completely cast out.
and if the darkness should have swallowed me as you read this you must never think there was the possibility of some secret intervention something you might have done.
i look at her with a respect that can only come from one who is about to walk the same dark path.
seeing her, i can't help but see myself in a month or a year.
i pray that i have her courage to face this journey.
mulder, i feel you close though i know you are now pursuing your own path.
for that i am grateful more than i could ever express.
i need to know you are out there if i am ever to see through this.
you can't quite figure it out, but it can be explained, and it will be.
and no matter what you think as a scientist or a doctor there is a way and you will find it to save yourself.
if dad hadn't turned his garage into a workshop... he wouldn't have to park on the street.
then he wouldn't need an alarm that goes off whenever i blow my nose... which now thanks to you involves blood.
i mean you've got to admit your father's making a iot of noise... and your mother is a bit of a meddler.
they're not so bad that we have to have a meeting.
i mean they wouldn't have to be calling a meeting... if the whole thing hadn't gotten completely intolerable.
look the neighbors just wanna come over to ask for our help... and i think the least we can do is listen to what they have to say.
and your mother accepts my packages and then she neglects to inform me.
you're mad now but when one of those babies explodes you're gonna thank her.
you're more in the ¡°covet thy neighbor's wife¡± phase of iife.
it's not that i don't love my mother and my father... it's just that it's very hard to honor them.
that i'm just sick and tired of being manipulated and treated like a child... and i'm just not gonna let them do it anymore?
are you going to take the name of the lord in vain when you do?
they just want to come over to discuss the problem... and you've got to admit there's a problem.
i mean£¬ they wouldn't have to be calling a meeting... if the whole thing hadn't gotten completely intolerable.
are you saying that maybe i feel this way because... deep down i think the neighbors are right?
that part of me wants to throw them out of the neighborhood£¬ too?
we all have these kinds of feeling from time to time.
you know£¬ there was a man on our church council a few years ago.
will it be wrong to let them know how i feel?
that i'm just sick and tired of being manipulated and treated like a child... and i'm just not gonna let them do it anymore?
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
do you lie awake at night, wondering if there was something else you could've done?
maybe if you had gotten there a little sooner, been a little bit more respectful to hera.
all people are wicked... and they deserve everything they're gonna get.
i've known too much good in the world to believe that.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
[ grunts ] you have no reason to be angry at me, hercules.
after all, i'm not the one that hung the giant bull's-eye on your family.
late at night, in the dark all alone, do you, uh-- do you hear your children screaming?
do you lie awake at night, wondering if there was something else you could've done?
i learned to get exactly what i want when i want it!
and you realize, hercules, theonlyreason your friends are still alive, is because ihave allowed it!
[ pops top ] all people are wicked, and they deserve everything they're gonna get.
i've known too much good in the world to believe that.
you ever get a feeling that your-- your life is just ebbing away?
you're kinda getting out of step with things, and, i don't know, there's nothin' you can do about it?
i think the first thing i'm gonna do is find the good xena... and rip out her tongue, just to hear her whistle an apology!
i hate to spoil your fantasy, but you're not out of here yet.
a wanderer, constantly facing other immortals in combat to the death.
the winner takes his enemy's head... and with it, his power.
but i'll tell you, that kid could find a penny at the bottom of the ocean.
tell me, duncan, do you think it's only good deeds that define a man's soul?
a couple of years ago, my grandfather got the bank into leveraged bonds.
that's a pretty risky investment for a conservative man like george.
can you justify... every person you've ever fought and everyone you've ever killed?
if i've killed unnecessarily, i didn't know so at the time.
i thought i'd drop in and say hi, but i thought i should call.
check if you're in, if it's okay, that you haven't got anybody with you or anything, that you're by yourself.
we were having a good time because we were good together not because we were desperate or horny.
i guess i thought it meant there was a reason for us to be together.
and if we were on the phone and one of us was out of town, it was even better.
look, if you were in australia right now, i'd ask you to marry me.
there used to be reasons for people to be together, to stay together like stability and security and even kids.
but you see, i don't need you for these reasons nowadays.
i mean, i can get all this on my own if i wanted to.
so if there are no real reasons for two people to be together then you're into unreal reasons, fantastic things.
but just as a favor, since it makes no difference could you not disappear in the night like a thief like you realized that you're at the wrong place, like you made this horrible mistake?
so i don't have to worry that i upset you or disappointed you or hurt you or drooled on you.
with the full knowledge that we really don't know what we are doing.
and that we might exchange this permanent internal unhappiness for a remolding of reality.
you always think that tomorrow it will be the way it was before.
and the memory gets stronger and stronger and it just makes every day worse and worse.
the lowest would have been the guy right before him who asked me to marry him and then went away and wanted me to visit him.
i called him to firm up the details, and a woman answered the phone.
and this was at midnight, and she tried to wake him up.
he was in a drunken stupor and could not be awakened.
he followed me, and when he left, we were back together.
but by the time he made it to new york, we had somehow broken up again.
and even then, he still wanted to go out with me.
he was gonna marry her, but he said we'd still stay the same meaning we'd still be together because at this point, we were together.
one night i got home, and she broke up with me over e-mail.
and the reason that she gave me was that she had met someone else over e-mail.
i thought i'd drop in and say hi, but i thought i should call.

especially since i scarcely know you, and my wife never did.
now, if you'll excuse me, there are things i have to do.
i lose my temper at the slightest provocation - bang, it's all over.
maxim hits the roof once in a blue moon, and how he hits it!
i would like to ask that if it should happen again,
mrs de winter will inform me, so as to save any unnecessary disturbance.
the clothes she was wearing the night she was drowned were torn from her body in the water.
there was nothing on her at all when she was found.
i know excellent shops in london for that sort of thing.
and it must be kept a secret to surprise mr de winter.
i don't shut myself up in my room to cry like mr de winter.
oh, yes, i used to hear him, behind his door like a trapped animal.
this is a delicate matter and it should remain between us.
the last thing i want to do is cause you both any pain or distress.
she'd walk around some garden party, arm-in-arm with me... a smile on her face like an angel.
the next day she'd scurry back up to london to that flat of hers, like some animal to its hole in a ditch.
i accept that you delivered the boat in sound condition, which is all i need from you.
it seems mrs de winter relaxed her watchfulness and lost her life.
it was a shock to find that i made a mistake in identification 12 months ago.
now i find that my late wife not only drowned in her cabin, but that the boat was damaged deliberately to sink.
i don't suppose there are any secrets between you and your wife.
and from the look of things, crawley here makes up a happy trio.
i shall be at the cottage if you get this follow me down in the car.
i'll spend the night at the cottage and leave the door open for you.
clearly she gave me a false name because she wanted confidentiality.
our profession has to respect that like the confession, but... from your description, this was your wife, mr de winter.
i would think of manderley as it might have been... if we could have lived there without fear.
i would remember the rose garden in summer, tea under the chestnut tree.

the city of chicago today is in mourning... in the wake of this weekend's tragic hostage situation... at the federal building.
lead negotiator karen warren... has officially resigned from her position with the police department.
tony hopkins played on jodie at the wrap party for lambs.
my stomach lining is just not going to get a break today, is it?
you whisked me away back to my place before the crab cakes could even arrive.
there's no better way to celebrate an anniversary than with an historical re-enactment.
"survived by his wife florence, a former miss washington and two sons, joe, a marine corps colonel, and professional baseball player mickey crane".
nothing like starting the day off jealous of a dead guy.
well, if i had to choose, i'd say you are a bit of a fussbudget.
if you don't mind this substitution, "demanding" is more le motjuste.
i've been down this road so many times they call it the roz expressway.
i've heard that phrase before, but in a slightly different context.
you did rhapsodise when she took you to cigare volant and you were seated in a secret vip room we never knew existed.
are you suggesting i'm so shallow i was with her for her connections?
it's only a moped if you pedal it, and i never pedalled.
i just wonder if what you're mourning isn't so much the loss of sam as the loss of her celebrity lifestyle.
i must admit things never did seem quite right between us.
if it hadn't been for her friends, i probably would've broken it off myself.
i'm going to tell you what we'll be doing this weekend.
we are taking the concorde to london for a party at alec guinness' place.
we're 1,000 miles southeast of moscow on the plains of kazakhstan.
a soyuz rocket, the 300-ton workhorse of the russian space program ... rolls out to the launch pad.
this is the cosmodrome at baikonur ... a sight few western eyes have seen.
under the old soviet union ... it was so secret, it wasn't even on the maps.
nations of the world are banding together ... to build the first permanent international space station.
phase one, a series of joint missions and crew exchanges, is now under way.
it's been home to scores of men and women ... for more than a decade.
they come and go in a soyuz spacecraft, docked there on the right.
then it takes away the garbage ... and burns up as it enters earth's atmosphere.
and now, there's another visitor to russia's mir, an american citizen:
she's the first american woman to live on mir ... and she's very much at home.
i think i'd been up on mir about three months ... when the first progress came and we opened it up.
then yuri would say, "you can smell ... all the fresh fruit and vegetables that are here."
so we dug around and we got those bags out ... and for that lunch we had fresh tomatoes and onions.
one night, yuri and yuri and i were sitting ... sort of floating around, just talking about our childhood.
here we were, three people, we grew up in two different countries ... and we'd been working together, having a real good time together.
and that was just amazing to us, how the world had changed.
we got talking about when i was growing up ... how afraid america was of russia ... and then they were explaining to me how afraid russia was of america.
i can go and be a space explorer, because certainly ... space won't be all explored by the time i grow up."
says mr. k., "the soviets will overtake america ... and then wave bye-bye."
but even the threat of annihilation ... couldn't smother the human urge to explore.
in the u.s., titan missile carriers also launched the scientific probes ...
then in 1975 ... the first joint u.s.-soviet mission in space, apollo-soyuz ... ignited hope for future cooperation.
as tensions cooled further, new partnerships emerged ... and american companies began successful joint ventures ... with the rocket builders at khrunichev.
star city is also home ... to the only full-sized model of the mir station.
now it attracts a steady stream of american astronauts ... who are getting acquainted with the station and how it operates.
not only do they learn every detail about mir ... they do it in a different language.
in a typical day, we started at 9:00 in the morning ... and we would listen to everything in russian all day long.
i realized, when i started training and met the russians ... that if i couldn't go to the window with a cosmonaut —
a guy who flew migs across the border when i was on the west side flying f-15s.
soon charlie will share that moment with these cosmonauts ... when the shuttle docks with mir for the first time.
anatoly solovyev, on the left, has already logged ... more than six months in space.
next to him is cosmonaut-engineer nikolai budarin, making his first flight.
if anything goes wrong in space, the soyuz is their lifeboat.
inside this centrifuge, cosmonauts condition themselves ... for the forces they'll encounter during launch and landing ... up to eight times earth's gravity.
for cosmonaut and astronaut alike, the "zero-g" experience is basic training.
i have a wife and two sons, and i have a dog.
anatoly and nik will train for their shuttle launch in texas.
it'll bring back norm thagard, the first american to live on mir.
norm and his cosmonaut crewmates have been four months in space.
you have two 100-ton vehicles that are gonna collide ... and you can cause great destruction if you don't do that exactly right.
if it is not in the right position — left, right, up, down, in or out.
anatoly, being the veteran cosmonaut that he was ... had been there many times before.
for nikolai, it had to be very exciting because this was his first visit to the mir.
the crew that was operating the station when we arrived ... was the mission commander, vladimir dezhurov ... and the "bort engineer" or flight engineer, gennady strekalov.
the base block is the central module of mir ... but it's also the meeting place ... very much like my kitchen is the meeting place in my house.
there's a table and it's a gathering place ... whether it's work, whether it's a meal, if it's just a time to relax.
that high-tech piece of equipment is their vibration sensor ... and every time the mir shakes, the little bird will tweet.
gennady and i are transferring a tank of water ... that's been supplied from the space shuttle, over to the mir.
we transferred two and a half times the original planned water transfer ... some 1,067 pounds.
we were busy as beavers during the course of the five docked days ... bringing that stuff back and forth.
during their stay, vladimir, gennady and norm thagard ... have consumed some 330 meals around this table.
norm was the only american ever to ride a russian rocket to space.
he had studied russian for about three years before the flight.
we learned a lot about the psychological aspects ... of family separation from norm's stay on the mir.
one of the things we've suggested for the future space station:
then it was norm's turn to show the space shuttle ... to vladimir and gennady.
particularly the spacelab ... where they'd be doing the in-flight testing to find out ... what the effect had been on them of being in space that long.
we make some measurements ... to help us understand how the body has adapted over a long period of time.
we make similar measurements after return to earth ... to see what the body has done in re-adaptation.
and you see, we made room for their feet in the lockers there.
this gave them a little extra "g" protection ... and made for a very soft landing.
when we left, we shook hands with anatoly and nik ... closed the hatch, and you knew that it got very, very quiet on their side.
it's a bittersweet moment when you leave friends behind ... and you watch the two vehicles separate.
it's a very true thing that the hurricane has blown through ... and you know you are saying goodbye, and you don't really want to.
because the shuttle has wings, it can glide softly to a landing.
to cushion the blow, they fire retro-rockets two seconds before they hit.
the searing heat of re-entry has scorched the outer walls of the capsule.
you should not try to be heroic ... because you are not used to sudden gravity.
anatoly's wife, natalya, and the boys wait for him at star city.
every time anybody enters mir for the first time ... it really is an eye-opener as to the lack of storage space ... and how much equipment has accumulated up there over the years.
imagine living in the house that you now live in ... and you haven't thrown anything away for over 10 years ... and then you bring in some new things.
when you'd come into the node here ... you had to have an idea which way you were going ahead of time ... or you could sure get turned around as to where to go next.
every day i would either be on the treadmill or the ergometer.
and this was important because we needed to make sure ... that we had a body worth coming back to when we returned to earth.
i lost one of my shoes and i still needed to exercise ... so i tried exercising barefooted ... which really hurt the bottom of my feet, running on the treadmill.
it's loaded with scientific experiments from the u.s., europe and russia.
the research done here today is vital ... for the planning of the future international space station.
what we need to get to, if we're ever gonna go to other planets ... is the ability to grow and regenerate in the spacecraft itself.
on this flight, we got to see a lot more of the earth ... than i'd ever got to see on a short flight.
when i first got up there, a lot of the lakes were frozen ... and then over the next few weeks you could see the ice break up.
you could see all these big land masses ... you could see them sort of green up as crops started to grow.
it just made me feel really nice ... like i was at home.
on the first progress that came up, my daughter had put a sci-fi book on there.
nasa has detected a problem with the space shuttle rocket boosters.
they were used to lift columbia into orbit two weeks ago.
that could mean astronaut shannon lucid will be staying ... on the russian space station mir longer than planned.
atlantis is scheduled to pick her up from mir ... but nasa says the glue problem may mean ...
i thought about it, and actually i talked with yuri and yuri about it a little bit.
i always think it's good to talk about the possibilities that could happen.
atlantis, houston ... we have a vision of loveliness coming down in the tv view here.
and finally you get to the moment where you're in the docking system ... looking through a small window, you can see the faces on the other side ... and you can just feel the anticipation.
the first thing i saw when shannon was back on 79 ... was that the crew around her was laughing.
when i called them, the first thing i heard was shannon laughing.
so i think her attitude is infectious ... and i think that her attitude is one reason this mission went so well.
now john blaha will carry on the work begun by norm thagard ...
i mean, there were many times when i was up on mir when i'd think:
"who would've ever thought that a child from oklahoma, in the '50s ... would've grown up to spend six months ... on a russian space station with a couple russians?"
it was something you wouldn't have put in your fiction novel ... if you were writing one.
when dr. lucid was in the 8th grade ... she wrote an essay saying she wanted to be a rocket scientist.
it takes a lot of learning and a lot of knowledge ... to be able to fly humans in space.
for so many years, we did it entirely separately from each other.
my sweet penelope and the gods had given me a son.
but at the same moment, the world we had built together was changed forever.
bound by my oath of allegiance and honor me dictating to protect my country,
i was forced to leave my home, not knowing if i would see my wife ever ... and my child.
i convinced them to build the horse, and you offer it as a sign of defeat.
in gratitude, they called me a coward and left me to beg you.
everyone knows odysseus the great hero who built the trojan horse.
but ... few greeks know that you're the only who can not go home.
but hope to hold in my arms at last penelope ... was swept away by the fury of the raging winds.
carried away by the storm ... all our food and our water lost ...
we saw in the distance from a window nearest the other, singing her song ...
she invited us to come and eat and drink of his smooth voice, and all enträrent.
if you need proof, will see your boat, five years covered by the tide.
and ask yourself if the memory of your wife is as good as yours!
from this side of the kingdom of poseidon ... is a constellation which is never below the horizon ... crouched like a hunter.
put the cap on its brightest star ... you will reach the straits of scylla ... and charybdis.
she invites r goes ... but it is a terrifying creature!
when she opens her mouth wide open, you and all those who accompany you ... will be swallowed by his power!
after sixteen years of tests, nothing frightens us, my warriors and me.
but we had never seen what we saw between the rocks.
i have to step over that pig as soon as i enter elatos the cellar!
see men of our own island, binge on your back and that of telemachus is too much for me!
so you see, we ... certain rights ... in your house.
the young prince to go home is a man of honor!
we have lived in your land, but it can be repaired, we ... killed anyone.
your crime is to have tried to steal my world ...
we sailed for months, from cyclops island to the setting sun.
our hearts heavy with the lost of antiphus and his gentle flute.
either lord odysseus is dead, lost in poseidon's graveyard, or he has chose not to return, to abandon your mother, his kingdom, and you.
now, your mother will choose one of us and marry again.
blinded, you do not see that it is the journey itself which makes up your life.
only when you understand this will you understand the meaning of wisdom.
the answer has been before your eyes, every night at sea.
on this side of poseidon's realm, there is a constellation which never sinks beneath the horizon, shapes like a hunter.
the day the gods gave you to us, they took your father from me.
but he promised me, with you lying here in my arms, that he would return alive, as this tree around which we built own world is alive.
winter turn to summer as we neared the straits of scylla and charybdis.
after a 16 year ordeal, nothing could frighten me or my warriors.
i have to crawl over that pig, elatus, each time i went open the treasury!
and to watch men from our own island eat you and telemachus out of house and home!
they offer no proof of my father's death, yet seek to take his place.
and before my mother's eyes, they beat my servants and rape my maids!
- we will greet him, with the spear in his back.
when i touch you skin, i wonder how you got this scar.
to let it leave my lips would only cause you pain.
i know only one long lost hero, who being curse by the gods could survive.
but it was poseidon, who allowed me to continue my journey to consider his words.
i understood that i was only 1 man in the world.
any other man, after so many years, would have rushed home to embrace his wife and children.
and blinded by his impatience, would have been hacked in two by the intruders.
i told them to make this offering to you, great king.
to my brothers, after 10 years of war, you have won.
our hearts heavy with the lost of antiphus and his gentle flute.
our mouths dry with thirst, desperate for water to drink, we approached another unknown land.
if you needed proof to you eyes, go see your ship buried in 5 years of tide.
and on the way, wonder if your wife's memory is as strong as yours!
you were given your men back, and yet, you lingered in my bed.
15 years, i have not seen my son and my home.
he has chose not to return, to abandon your mother, his kingdom, and you.
now, your mother will choose one of us and marry again.
blinded, you do not see that it is the journey itself which makes up your life.
only when you understand this will you understand the meaning of wisdom.
the answer has been before your eyes, every night at sea.
on this side of poseidon's realm, there is a constellation which never sinks beneath the horizon, shapes like a hunter.

winter turn to summer as we neared the straits of scylla and charybdis.
after a 16 year ordeal, nothing could frighten me or my warriors.
you are the first man they have seen in their lives.
i myself, have not laid eyes on one for over 100 years.
to let it leave my lips would only cause you pain.
i know only one long lost hero, who being curse by the gods could survive.
but it was poseidon, who allowed me to continue my journey to consider his words.

and on the way, wonder if your wife's memory is as strong as yours!
you were given your men back, and yet, you lingered in my bed.
15 years, i have not seen my son and my home.
she invites you in, but she is a thing of terror, odysseus.
when she opens her gaping mouth, you and all with you, will be swallowed by her force!
you are the first man they have seen in their lives.
i myself, have not laid eyes on one for over 100 years.
neither zeus nor any god pity odysseus, it is envy which sends you here.
they are all outraged by me openly making love to a mortal man.
it's an honor to all phaeacie that such a hero as odysseus of ithaca, sits among us.
i will give my finest ship heavy with gifts and food, and the finest mariners of all phaeacie, to sail you safely home.
i sailed to sparta, and heard the words from king menelaus' lips.
i believe my father lies at the bottom of the sea.
and it's mostly sacred and beautiful, but nothing as beautiful as a man's own world.
that he can take in his hands and it will always be his.
oh, and i guess that makes her, like, some kind of expert, huh?
hey, i'm just glad to have someone here who's got some experience with this kind of thing, aren't you?
and you know, if you think it is such a great idea, you call him.
it won't make any sense coming from sarah or me or charlie.
like you even have a clue as to what goes on in his life.
you know, because i don't remember seeing any of you at the apartment, spending time, making sure everything's okay.
it doesn't mean that i have a problem or that i can't stop.
and it sure as hell doesn't mean that i need you guys acting all concerned over nothing, and carting me off to some rehab center.
maybe that's the problem, that i'm on my own for the first time, and i'm taking care of myself, and nobody likes that, because that's not the way things work around here.
i'm supposed to be the one taking care of all of you, right?
now that i'm stuck at a state school trying to make the best of it, you're trying to tear me down.
bailey, that's-- as long as i'm the one making the sacrifices, you're all okay because that's what you expect.
you were drunk and loud and making a scene with the waiters, bumping into things.
and you were the same way when i met you at club.
how about the one that you slept with after the wedding?
you know, the one that you slept with two days after you dumped kirsten, the love of your life?
and all that stuff about kirsten after the wedding, it's not like he made it sound.
right, and it's over now, and you're a different person, so i'm fine.
- in kindergarten or something, but mom used to drive him to the restaurant a couple mornings a week because he left his car there overnight.
and he'd sit in the back with me and tell jokes, make up stupid songs.
or i'd walk into something at the tail end of it, and mom's eyes would be all red, and i figured it was about the restaurant doing bad, or them not having enough money,
or about how late he used to come home at night.
- ten million dollars, and all of it-- - [ groans ]
i see you guys out there, you'll be sent down to the minors.
maybe you are old enough to move your room up into the attic.
if that's what you really want to do, it's okay with me.
you oughta keep that away from your crotch, or you'll end up on the dickless wonder list.
artie, you better not let the fire marshal catch you doing that.
larry couldn't stop crying even when the fly girls were dancing.
he just kept blubbering about the fucking baby fawn's mother cooking in a brush fire.
um, the last time i went, there was a flight in from jamaica just ahead of me.
so there were all these cops and drug dogs, and one of the dogs lunged at me.
uh, well, actually, i was just taking charlie to meet larry.
i thought you said we were going on a yogurt run.
and so that's why she has the mommy's former lovers mobile.
and it's got pictures of about 1,000 different guys on it.
well, we have covered every damn inch of this building and we ran out of ideas.
and then we got cornered by that reporter and we had no other choice but to meet larry, but we would love to hear what we are gonna do next.
um, i just talked to maintenance, and they won't be able to get a couch in here until next week.
and until then, they expect me to do what, just to go fuck myself?
well, i can assure you that mr. sanders is not a criminal.
that may be, but i'm not leaving here until i find out where these cigars came from.
i'm kind of, you know, after-relationship, kind of not interested, but i did actually, uh... get in touch with somebody from my past.
i was on another talk show recently, and i told a story about my first kiss... right.
or i got, you know, somebody contacted me and said she wanted to get in touch with me.
and she sent me a picture and she looked pretty good.
you know, i heard the car show is in town next week.
maybe if you suck off lee iacocca, he'll give you miss auto parts.
i don't know you and i never really talked to you, but i heard a lot about you.
i feel like i know you, so just, um... hang in there, buddy.
i cannot believe you could do that to a child, mary lou.
he wanted to, and it was really just a couple of puffs.
you brought dinner to a pregnant girl, feel asleep on her couch, came home at dawn.
as i recall, you had three weeks driving privileges taken away.
a birthday i'd like to remember for the rest of my life.
but, no, if you don't want to give me anything, then don't give me anything;
i just have a few things i want to do myself.
honey, you can't keep breaking things so that you can pay steve to fix them.
well, i thought afterwards you could come over and have some cake.
well, maybe when you're finished with dinner, you could come over to dwight's party.
one, you wanted to come, and two, i promised mrs. bink i wouldn't tell dad.
you know, it really would mean a lot to me if you let lucy come to the party.
and they wouldn't take a risk like that unless it was important.
they still should be disciplined for leaving school no matter what, and i still reserve the right to add to their punishment if we find out that whatever they were doing is not as terrific as you think it was.
you still get dinner and presents with the family, plus the bonus of going to a birthday party.
dwight seems like a fun guy, andjimmy's going to be there.
since i can't have my own party, i decided to skip it.
i'm really tired of people complaining when we have so much more than other people have.
we have a house to live in, we have food to eat, we have nice clothes to wear.
i'd like to hear a little gratitude around here once in a while!
even under the worst circumstances, they're still grateful for what they have.
all they asked me... was to say a prayer for them.
as far as the ankle is concerned, it's just some sprained ligaments and a fractured fibula.
she can go home tomorrow, but she's gonna have to use a walker to get around.
now, she may need some help while she's getting used to it.
you know, her biggest problem is that she needs to feel needed.
one of our listening posts in the gamma quadrant picked this up a few minutes ago.
it looks like a cardassian military code but the computer doesn't recognize it.
the transmitter tain used to contact the station where is it?
you have to crawl through that hole and kind of slide your way up into the wall.
he wired the message and the transmission coordinates directly into the system's circuitry.
that way, all he had to do was connect the transmitter to the power grid and let it run.
right now, we have a more immediate concern such as... who sabotaged our graviton emitters?
i don't know who it was but they did a pretty thorough job.
the emitters had the exact opposite effect of what we'd intended.
they were supposed to collapse the wormhole's spatial matrix and close it forever.
odo tells me that a bajoran maintenance engineer has been missing ever since the dominion fleet arrived in the alpha quadrant.
and if that was our changeling he's either gone or assumed a new identity.
i suppose you could give me a crash course in cardassian field engineering.
i should be ready to take over from you in what?
it would appear that he suffers from an acute form of claustrophobia.
it's a wonder that he lasted as long as he did.
right now, the only part of the song that i wish to hear is the verse that tells of our escape.
what good is defeating every jem'hadar soldier in this compound if it does not bring us closer to our freedom?
the jem'hadar don't eat, don't drink and they don't have sex and if that wasn't bad enough, the founders don't eat and don't drink and they don't have sex either.
which, between you and me makes my financial future less than promising.
we may have to wait for them to open fire and then...
captain, i'm picking up a priority one message from the gamma quadrant.
well, for one thing he was a lot easier to get along with.
so, i suppose this means you want your klingon opera collection back.
you have to crawl through that hole and kind of slide your way up into the wall.
it took him over a year to modify the old life-support system into a transmitter.
the dominion recognizes us for what we are... the true leaders of the alpha quadrant.
and now that we are joined together equal partners in all endeavors the only people with anything to fear will be our enemies.
i don't know who it was but they did a pretty thorough job.
the emitters had the exact opposite effect of what we'd intended.
five years ago, no one had ever heard of bajor or deep space 9 and now, all our hopes rest here.
where the tides of fortune take us no man can know.
it's a wonder that he lasted as long as he did.
then one of us will have to finish reconfiguring the transmitter.
i'm sure the chancellor will be willing to assign some klingon troops to guard key facilities.
klingons helping to protect deep space 9... what an interesting concept.
no, no, you should be glad you did because now i'm going to return the favor... and give you a chance to save your precious federation.
all you have to do is convince them to follow cardassia's example.
a few days ago, i swore all cardassia lost would be regained.
that space station you're so fond of... was built by cardassia.
the healer that bound the warrior's wounds, so he could fight again.
right now, the only part of the song that i wish to hear is the verse that tells of our escape.
i can't make head nor tail of the power-relay systems on his bird-of-prey.
we're never going to get all these klingon ships up and running.
you should see the monument they're erecting in my honor at the gateway to the imperial plaza.
is that why you sold out your people to the dominion?

so, i suppose this means you want your klingon opera collection back.
i even built a transmitter, but then i...spilled grape soda on it and the whole thing shorted out.
however, i did manage to have a brief conversation with the captain of a shrimp boat.
i should never have let them go off without me, uh, on vacation.
well, until they get back, can't we just enjoy our time alone?
i've made a horrible, horrible mistake, and i can't stop hating myself for making it.
well, you know, dr. solomon, a person should never be sad for the mistakes he's made.
i've never seen you bring your lunch in a picnic basket before.
well, i've never seen you in a thong bikini before, but there's a first time for everything, right?
before he died... i promised i'd take care of jackie and keep him safe.
as long as i'm around, jackie's a chef, not a cop.

you can take care of yourself, but what about the others?
hey, i'm sticking with jackie until i get my tape back.
jackie, i know you can take care of yourself, but what about the other three?
hey, i'm sticking with jackie until i get my tape back.
as mr. kurokawa sat at his word processor, having a drink,
"kurokawa daizo (62) - kurokawa hospital director" as mr. kurokawa sat at his word processor, having a drink,
the blood on the "ke", "mu", and "ro" keys came from his pinky when mr. kurokawa typed "jun" with his index finger, but no one presses keys on the very left side with their right pinky.
then where did the blood on that left key come from?
most likely, mr. kurokawa was hit from behind by the stealthy culprit, upon which he put his right hand to his head.
this is probably where the blood on his pinky came from.
then, when he looked back, he was hit again, and he knocked over the keyboard with his pinky as he fell.
in other words, the english uppercase key on the very left was not pressed of mr. kurokawa's will at the time of the crime, but just happened to be pressed as he fell instead.
you removed your slippers at the time of the crime, did you not?
because the slippers would have made noise on the wood flooring, making it impossible for you to sneak up on mr. kurokawa unnoticed.
unbeknownst to you you actually stepped in some of the blood on the ground.
the inexplicably missing bit of blood in exhibit a proves this.
there should be blood on the bottom of your white sock!
you also said in your statement that you hadn't gotten near the body.
the fact no one noticed the simple changes to my hair and name means the incident wasn't big enough for any of you to remember it.
i tried to get testimonies from the hospital staff so i could accuse him, but not a single person would help me!
i was so absorbed with watching the deal that i didn't notice a second man sneak up from behind me!
he forced me to take a poison, and when i woke up my body had shrunk!
unable to stand by and watch, i took his place and used my powers of deduction to solve tough case after tough case.
as a result, the old man's now a prominent and famous detective, while i'm stuck doing grade school all over again.
there are plenty of others, but my main weapon is undoubtedly this!
even when i'm small, my mind remains that of a sharp detective!
but no one has yet duplicated the wing-flapping mechanism of insects!
if i can create the very first one and sell it as a toy,
- inventor" "as such, i would like to invite you to the afternoon tea garden party
"as such, i would like to invite you to the afternoon tea garden party
and we both have red as our lucky color for may!
so i was thinking of giving him a red polo shirt!
we're seeing the movie in this building, in beika cinema 1!
we're meeting in the lobby at 10:00 on the night of the 3rd!
we're isolated from that ward there, and there are no electronic medical devices here, so cell phones can be used here!
dr. agasa explained the situation, which is why we brought you here!
the only possibilities are that the timer stopped due to a malfunction, or that the culprit stopped it remotely for whatever reason...
from the fact that the culprit went out of his way to phone kudo-kun, he either wanted to challenge the famous high school detective, or he's someone with a personal grudge against him.
out of all of shinichi-kun's cases so far, which one received the most public attention?
that'd be the one involving mayor okamoto of west tama city...
a 25 year old female office worker living in west tama city died when she was hit by a car the mayor's son was driving.
the mayor had been in the passenger seat during what at first seemed to be a regular accident...
"okamoto shicho (52) -" okamoto kohei (21) - west tama city mayor"shicho's son"
this cigarette butt was found lying directly next to the victim.
the only way to reach it from the driver's seat is with your left hand.
but that lighter only had fingerprints from your right hand on it.
again, this train will continue to run nonstop for the time being.
should you find a suspicious item onboard, please refrain from touching it and let the conductor know.
both toto railways and the police department have only commented by saying that there has been an emergency situation!
30 minutes is the most the police can keep it under wraps...
in other words, it takes about 12 seconds to travel 200 meters!
the bombs are rigged to explode just barely after that amount of time!
i sadly watched the rain pound on you as you bent over
if there was only one umbrella in this world, i'd find it for you
if there was only one umbrella in this world, i'd find it for you one train left!
if there was only one umbrella in this world, i'd find it for you
i can't do anything, but i can't get drenched in your place, either
i can't do anything, but i can't get drenched in your place, either this is train #10!
i can't do anything, but i can't get drenched in your place, either we did it!
i beg of you, please confess your worries to me we did it!
the bombs are placed where there wouldn't be shade from buildings or walls after 4:00 pm!
when searching, always be aware of the sun's location and be very careful not to cover the bombs with your own shadows!
the bridge was completed in 1983, and the fact it was built of stone in an english style instead of iron was quite the topic at the time.
with this bridge's design, moriya teiji won the architectural association of japan's newcomer award!
say, i wonder who designed all these houses that were set on fire!
i bet we might find something interesting if we look into it!
you were suspicious that he had set the fire that killed him!
certain of this, you set fire to each of professor moriya's buildings!
these incidents were not perpetrated by someone with a grudge against professor moriya!
the one responsible is the designer of the four mansions set on fire, as well as the bridge...
and with his design of the bridge on the loop, he won the architectural association of japan's newcomer award!
professor moriya continued to produce new buildings after that, when he suddenly- or maybe not so suddenly- wanted to get rid of the works he created in his youth.
by challenging me and tarnishing my name as a high school detective, the professor hoped to exact revenge on me, while also trying to camouflage his goal- the bridge's destruction- to look unrelated to the recent string of mansion arsons!
and the reason he stopped the bomb timer in the carrying case was because of the gas lampposts in the playground!
even if it can be disarmed, the last wire will determine her fate!
several pillars of smoke are rising from the beika city building-
arm in arm, a merry couple strolled by, their voices just bursting out
arm in arm, a merry couple strolled by, their voices just bursting out cut it...
arm in arm, a merry couple strolled by, their voices just bursting out cut whichever color you want...
arm in arm, a merry couple strolled by, their voices just bursting out but... what if i get it wrong?
arm in arm, a merry couple strolled by, their voices just bursting out it doesn't matter.
i grew a little jealous as i was reminded that you weren't here we're goners anyway, once time is up...
i grew a little jealous as i was reminded that you weren't here so choose your color...
i grew a little jealous as i was reminded that you weren't here b-but...
i grew a little jealous as i was reminded that you weren't here
i grew a little jealous as i was reminded that you weren't here don't worry!
you know, when my heart lets its guard down, it wants to be weak we'll be together when we die...
you know, when my heart lets its guard down, it wants to be weak
you know, when my heart lets its guard down, it wants to be weak shinichi...
you know, when my heart lets its guard down, it wants to be weak so, yes, i gritted my teeth and tried putting on a forced smile
both shinichi and i have red as our lucky color for may!
i want to see you so i decided that we gotta see this!
i truly feel sorry for not being able to say things well
i mulled it over a while, but i eventually fell asleep from exhaustion
on the weekends, this town's air is stuffy and makes me choke, and when i sighed deeply, it was blotted out by the outdoor speakers
even when i put the words together, they're never meant to be said
the voice i shout as loudly as i can into the sky over this bustling city is my "happy birthday" to that person, in some other faraway city
the voice i shout as loudly as i can into the sky over this bustling city
so i get up the nerve to break his heart and he gives me this look and says, "i wanna cry because i'm losing the best friend i ever had."
and at that moment i knew i felt the same way.
now i'm to scoot you to the ballpark so you can hang with michael.
but first you have to meet a lot of really old women.
why would he trade all that for running, say a piece of the pr at a powerful complex conglomerate like your dad's?
that's just the sort of thing my father and i discussed.
what, all of a sudden i'm supposed to drop out of school?
forget my family, forget my career, forget everything i ever planned for?
i am breaking her heart in the short run but really doing her a favor.
she would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
it must've hurt dating so much and not finding the right one.
she couldn't sit down for seven years until she met teensy-weensy little me.
i'd built you up so much i couldn't let him lose face in front of you.
he could never stack up to the one man i measure everyone against.
this is built in the art deco style of the 1920s.
in the centre the building is set back for light to come down to the city.
i have offered mike o'neal my new son-in-law a great opportunity in my company.
to his own detriment michael will not accept our offer while he works for you.
i have to say this quick or i'll just have a massive coronary and then you'll never hear it and you have to.
this is, by far, the dumbest thing i've ever done in my entire life.
the pus that infects the mucus that cruds up the fungus that feeds on the pond scum.
on the other hand thank you for loving me that much.
i had to cover a game in milwaukee, and she saw me off.
the train was starting to leave and i jumped up on the step, and i held the handle.
and without a thought in my head, i just shouted, "marry me!"
and the train was pulling out, and she just suddenly screamed:
and he comes toward you the moves of a jungle cat.
and although you quite correctly sense that he is gay like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are you think:
my husband says to scoot you to the ballpark... so you can hang with michael.
but first you have to meet a lot of really old women.
i am breaking her heart in the short run... but really doing her a gigantic favor.
she would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
all those stories that michael told me were hilarious... but all those broken relationships, all those men.
it must have hurt going through so many guys and never finding the right one.
how could he think that my father and i would do such a thing?
i only minored in psych, you understand, but... maybe michael couldn't commit to this marriage... so he created... a delusion... produced an unconscious, psychosomatic... manifestation of--
love is a strong word... and i don't know that i'm necessarily qualified--
i guess i wouldn't be totally oft base it i said that, in her way... she does possess strong feelings--
i have done nothing but underhanded, despicable... not even terribly imaginative things since i got here.
i was just trying to win you... to win you back.
i haven't done much that i'm proud of the last three days.
i'd like to take you to the church... so you can walk down that aisle... and marry the man of our dreams.
i dreamt that some psychopath was trying to break the two of you up.
luckily, i woke up and i see... that the world is just as it should be... for my best friend... has won the best woman.
he takes a razor, cuts his finger, then does the same to me...
he says, "swear if we're not married at 28, we'll marry each other".
i thought i was like you, until i met rumpled, smelly old michael.
then i found i was as sentimental as those nitwits i'd always pitied.
walter's re-organising pr and needs a brilliant guy that he can completely trust.
then you beg: "michael, do this for daddy, just for six months".
so there i was with "dionne", having one hell of a sing-song.
then suddenly, breezing out of the electroshock room, i saw her.
the moment i wake up... before i put on my makeup
i say a little prayer for you while combing my hair now and wondering what dress to wear now
we'll drive up, get the right key, and go back to the office.
but if i fall asleep on the altar tomorrow, you'd better be there.
i dreamed that some psychopath was trying to break you two up.
luckily, i woke up, and i see... that the world is just as it should be.
i thought i was like you, and proud to be... until i met rumpled, smelly, old michael.
then i found i was just a sentimental schmuck... like all those flighty nitwits i'd always pitied.
he's got you on a pedestal... and me in his arms.
my god, it's the bride and the woman she'll never live up to.
i am breaking her heart in the short run... but really doing her a gigantic favor.
she would be so miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
all those stories that michael told me were hilarious... but all those broken relationships, all those men.
it must have hurt going through so many guys and never finding the right one.
everybody will be busy with more important things... and this is really my last chance.
if i could just get up to walter's office, they're by the computer.
we'll get the right key, and we'll go back to the office.
if i fall asleep on the altar tomorrow, you'd better be there.
love is a strong word... and i don't know that i'm necessarily qualified--

although you quite correctly sense that he is like most devastatingly handsome single men of his age are... you think, what the hell... life goes on.
so i get up the nerve to break his heart... and he gives me this look.
then he said, "the thing that makes me want to cry is...
my husband says to scoot you to the ballpark... so you can hang with michael.

like a summer rose lt needs the sun and the rain
i need your sweet love i need your sweet love to ease
she would he so miserahle tagging along after this insensitive doofus.
do you really love him... or is this just about winning?
it must have hurt going through so many guys and never tinding the right one.
she couldn't sit down for seven years until she met teensy-weensy little me.
i'd built you up so muoh... i couldn't let him lose faoe in tront ot you.
he could never stack up to the one man i measure everyone against.
and the world ls cold i will leel a glow just thinking ol you
and the way you look tonight ls your dance card tilled?
i don't know. i'm still hoping tor a miracle, i suppose.
how could he think that my tather and i would do such a thing?
i have to say this quick or i'll just have this massive coronary... and then you'll never hear it, and you have to.
this is, by far, the dumbest thing i've ever done in my entire lite.
the pus that intects the mucus... that cruds up the tungus that teeds on the pond soum.
on the other hand... thank you... tor loving me that much.
i had to cover a game in milwaukee, and she saw me ott.
the train was starting to leave and... i jumped up on the step and i held the handle... and without... a thought in my head, i just shouted, "marry me."
and he comes towards you... the moves ol a jungle cat.
although you quite oorrectly sense that he ls... gay... like most devastatingly handsome single men ol his age are... you think, what the hell... lite goes on.
but don't compare your luck with his, as his numbers always win.
no matter how hard i work, i can never be wealthy.
i've stuck to my number for years, but only have myself to blame, for not buying it once.
what bad luck because that was when it struck the 1st prize!
if i fold you and stuff you into my wallet, would you still smile?
if i were the president, i'd have different expressions on each note to show its value.
brother, you've so many ideas, why not apply them to our bak kut teh?
i've told you many times, only old folks visit our stall.
as the largest bookies in singapore, paying only half is embarrassing.
it's ok to be a little embarrassed, as long as we don't lose money.
if the traffic police can become the fortune god, what in the world can be unlucky?
after i won the lottery, i realised that our benefactor and the fortune god will help us in different guises.
richard, your shampoo girl said she'd be my mistress at $30,000 a year.
the 17-year old batam girl i met is cheaper, younger and bustier younger and sexier...
chicken king, there are desirable women in batam, but your retirement fund is for your old age, not for splurging on women.
when she runs off with another man and your money, you'll bitterly regret it.
listen to me, i am good at setting up chain stores.
i'll look after business development and richard will take care of production.
look, when he needed a loan, he treated me like a king.
now when i need my money back, i've to treat him like a king.
many aunties gamble on the cruise too, and they aren't there because they won 4-d.
there're so many familiar faces there, they brought each other there.
but with everything, as long as we're not hooked, something good will emerge.
i've learnt many valuable lessons through 4-d, and i'm proud of them.
as we didn't know better, we thought 4-d was the way to go.
only much later did we see the fortune god was in our midst, our friends around us.
so i get up the nerve to break his heart... and he gives me this look.
then he said, "the thing that makes me want to cry is...
i thought i was like you, and proud to be... until i met rumpled, smelly, old michael.

the sox are at home. "sport" wants a profile on frank thomas.
you think it's irresponsible to take off a weekend to get married?
i may break her heart, but i'm really doing her a favour.
she would be so miserable tagging on after this insensitive doof us.
i say a little prayer for you while combing my hair now and wondering what dress to wear now
i say a little prayer for you for ever you'll stay in my heart and i will love you forever, we never will part oh howl love you together, forever, is how it must be to live with out you
i'd built you up so much, i couldn't let him lose face.
he could never stack up to the one man i measure everyone against.
without a thought in my head, i just shouted, "marry me"
and the train was pulling out, and she suddenly screamed, 'yes"
you'll find her, and see all that love in her eyes.
i just hope it's soon, or i'd hate to be you at six o'clock.
in exchange for money, or in the name ofthe ballot papers... in the name ofthe holy places and in the name ofreligion... they're outbidding each other;, because god is up for sale!
it's an open market, where these commodities are up for sale.
the human race is being plundered... and the almighty is still silent.
to wipe outsins from the face ofthe earth... why isn't the angel ofdeath ever born?
and sing the litany of assurances to put people to sleep for 5 years.
make some minor changes in the old manifesto and publish it!
the goverment will institute an enquiry into the deaths... and a file will be prepared with the findings of their slaying.
this file will rot in the records as millions ofother files... in goverment offices do!
you will remember that when mr mohanlal, the minister... contested the elections for the first time... all he owned were effects to the extent of125 rupees.
that too, in the clothes in wore... apart from loose change, ofcourse.
make proper use ofthe rights the constitution has given you... and throw out the dishonest leaders who occupy their chairs!
they have sworn to be cremated with the chair but they won't let go oftheir high offices!
even in the states where your party is in power there has been no rule ofrighteousness.
how's that possible with demons like you around in the country?
when have you let us rule in peace, even in the states... where our party is in power?
you've found some excuse or the other... to dismiss our goverments and impose president's rule.
they're the same people who drove away the british... and won india her independence!
but they're now slaves to politicians who are thugs like you!
whether you kill him... or bury him alive makes no difference to me!
besides, i will pay you as much as you wish for thejob.
janki... you shall be the mother in the family, after i'm dead.
you will undoubtedly love your children, when you give birth to them.
just go home and talk to your brother and tell him...
not to mess with the tunga family, if you want to live in this city.
but how could i even pray when i heard you had arrived?
i've just come running here with the bell in my hand!
else, those refusing me something just can't live in this town!
you don't seem to have met people who refuse to accept you as god!
ifthere is anyone i revere after god, it is my sister-in-law.
i swear in my sister-in-law's name today... that i have never loved anyone but you.
it was because ofyou that i promised your mother... and did not even bear a child!
for 14 long years, i consoled myselfwith the feeling... that bharat was my son!
which is why we've given dr. ram the highest award in medicine.
and i've had so much ofpraise lavished on him ... that he'd forget even the grief ofhis wife and brother's death!
it's the combination ofmy reign and your policies... which keep your brand ofpolitics alive!
didn't you say that politicians and chameleons can change colours at any time?
even the public has never been able to guess my moves till this day.
how the hell will they know what i am up to?
but, as a doctor... how could i desert my patient on the operation table?
i had to save his life and i had very little time.
but i'm now reduced to being a prisoner, bearing no. 52.
i used to be a scientist in the labs ofthe indian atomic energy.
like a devout muslin, i used to pray to the almighty, 5 times a day.
but to make me confess to the crime... the so-called patrons of the law beat me up so badly... that iteven ruptured the veins in my legs.
when those who rule the country have pronounced me guilty... who will prove my innocence?
the police, the courts and the law and order... are all slaves to their maneouvres.
inspector daanapani... who was decorated by the government last year, for his bravery.
he came here with a couple of constables that night, and...
it was the minister, mohanlal, who plotted your brother's death... with the help ofrana.
they wanted him outoftheir way to get on with their plans.
the mohanlal you connived with, to kill my brother... has snatched your brother from you, to teach you a lesson!
cursed is the father... who cremates his young and only son.
we'll now present to you a fusion ofthe east and the west.
you must know how the indians are obsessed with foreign dances!
should anything untoward happen there, ask your family... to have a day found to mourn your death!
on this auspicious day, we will show you some rare glimpses... ofthe services our revered leader has rendered to society.
even in his childhood, the all pervading poverty... made such an indelible impression on his mind... that the mere sight ofpoverty moved the child to tears.
treating poverty as the no. 1 enemy ofthe masses... the boy dedicated himself to the service ofsociety.
this is not a door on the poverty-stricken masses ... that will shut at your behest.
this is the voice ofthe indian who has awoken from his slumber... which will be silenced only after you have accounted for your sins!
i have discussed the issue with the new minister... and we will now share everything 50, 50!
you could say that we, the crooked politicians... will keep robbing the stupid masses ofindia for all times to come!
you use politics for a crutch and sacrifice anyone... to achieve your own selfish ends.
i am not the only one you have used as a pawn in your game... you have also trapped the masses ofthe country in your dirty trap!
the people will now realise... how you have robbed the nation with the thugs!
they'll know how you've made a shroud outofthe uniform... the police wear!
and once you won the elections, you deserted the masses... as ifthey were unwed mothers!
people who sweat and toil for the country... find it difficult to even feed their children.
leaders like you don't deserve to take birth in this country!
i will ask you to account for the miseries ofevery indian today!
i t is fundamental to her nature to consume other living life forms, like you.
so you think we should leave her on the planet then?
when they put me in here, they removed my heart, to prevent escape.
they kept me conscious while they did it, made me watch.
there's one from each end, i didn't know which one is yours.
i'm afraid you'll just have to choose one, and hope it's mine.
but when the prisoners reprogrammed me, the old flame came back.
you're not pretty - but you're my kind of not pretty.
i was on my way to trial and execution, which is why i triggered the security system when i came through the door.
it was me who arranged for the cyborg pilot to be reprogrammed to kill the crew.
this prisoner transport will self destruct in 10 minutes, as there has been a breach of the prisoner containment area.
i repeat - this prisoner transport will self destruct in 9 minutes and 52 seconds.
i repeat - this prisoner transport will self destruct in 9 minutes and 5 seconds.
attention, attention - this prisoner transport will self destruct in 8 minutes and 10 seconds.
tweedle, as soon as i get teeth i will bite you and i know some dead flesh i will nibble on as well
we've just come from a place called transylvania, where people bite each other - a lot
to take a ride in this moth, to er, to clear my head.
and when i come back i want to see you all acting the way you normally do, starting now!
so far i've discovered 32 different types of parasite and viral infection - no wonder he smells!
i am looking for something more specific ... a neuro-chemical messenger that would open stanley to suggestion and control by others
and there's no way i'm gonna stay up here in space knowing that you are in trouble on that planet, ok?
i thought i recognised a figure from the images that dr longbore showed me.
the presence of parablood in stanley confirms what i had suspected.
you must keep as far away as you can from vlad
like me, divine executioners need protoblood to function, but their bodies are also imbued with a special bio-venom called parablood.
when injected into its human victim, it turns them into the executioner's slaves, and like a virus it replicates itself in the host's body, to perpetuate its evil
the old priest i met in the village, father borscht, claimed to have found vlad's tomb when he was a young man.
i suggest you search his things for any information that could be useful in the fight against her.
- and you only suspect what i will do to the people of this planet?
what i will, in fact, do, is merrily infect the local villagers with parablood, and then i will instruct them to scatter throughout this world and each infect a hundred others, who will in turn infect a hundred more.
and once every mother, father, son and daughter is my slave,
i will order the human race that pollutes this sphere to visit upon themselves a suicidal horror beyond their darkest dreams
the time prophet told me you would come to this planet - before i killed her
how did you cross over from the light universe to this one?
i located a bruise in the time/space fabric that separates the light universe form this dark one
my killing you will not just be an act of vengeance
no no - the only thing that's really happening is your complete disconnection from reality, to a degree which exceeds even what i'm used to - and i'm used to a lot
see, if you stay here, she'll destroy you, all of you!
i am joseph van helsing, last of the van helsing line.
my family - who were almost as nutty as you - fought vampires and the like their whole lives.
- but that doesn't mean i'm above a little play in the hay.
even if you do have a few alien bats in your belfry
- 'the beast cannot dim the light of a pure heart' so, there you go - nothing to worry about.
as long as you have a pure heart, which i'm sure you all do
you can wait for me, or you can fly away wherever you'd like to go.
the moth is yours to keep, as long as you take it away from here - now
no, it's a foul effluent - but it's free of the parablood
well - you're not perfect stanley h tweedle, but i always knew you had a good heart
well if there are no footprints she has to be here.
they have balloons on this planet - and we do not know if xev is still alive.
i'm tired of being stuck here, and i'm tired of being captain of this ship and i'm just - look,
i just wanna find some place with a little bit of peace and quiet.
and suppose we do break out of this orbit, wha t then?
i mean, where are we gonna go, what are we gonna do, hmm?
i don't know, i don't know what decision to make, all right?
except that i gotta sleep on it, that's my decision, ok?
just answer me one question - do you actually know what sex is?
sex is when a female plant is fertilised by a male plant, and a new plant is created.
surely we could create a plant that would make you happy, at least a bit?
you know, right now i can honestly say, more than ever before, that there is no kinda plant that you can
i know you need protein, but i don't want you to eat them, ok?
i want you, i want you to teach them how to please a man, in creative ways.
then we could find a place for us to live together.
there is no right place for the dead - to live.
yeah, yeah, that's it, it's a, it's a big bug, but, uh, it's, uh, it's also a spaceship.
i mean, it, it flies around like a bug, only it's bigger!
my point, my point ... is that this time, we should actually have a plan, you know?
let's actually choose a worthwhile destination, instead of just, finding some random one!
now, listen, my arms are tired, my legs are about to give out, and my back is burning up.
so, you can poke all you want, but i'm not gonna do this anymore, period.
look, i know you don't have tongues, but you got, you got ears, haven't ya?
look, i'm stanley h. tweedle, captain of the lexx, and i'm not gonna put up with this any longer!
look, i don't have a whole lot more left in me, okay?
hey, look, if i don't have a head, i won't be able to pump at all!
except for one short period each year, i've been frozen for over 4 millennia.
you have been switching on once a month during that same period.
when we pass between the two planets, i can drop down to one, or the other.
i have no way of knowing which one they are on, i'll have to make a random choice.
mr president, last tuesday atf agents working at seti, the civilian organisation that searches for extra terrestrial intelligence, reported that a twelve year old boy from sulphur, louisiana ostensibly as part of a school science project,
called seti headquarters to report that he had spotted a large, self-propelled unidentified object in the vicinity of the earth's moon.
do not be misled by feelings of sympathy for this boy, mr president, he's likely part of the greatest threat the human race has ever faced.
the discovery of extra terrestrial life in the earth's vicinity automatically triggered the hague-schlieffen plan, and the atf went into immediate action.
we eliminated all personages employed at seti, along with their relatives and acquaintances, and we destroyed their headquarters building.
the fbi effectively credited this action to religious fanatics, and our news organisations, with the exception of a few insignificant journalists, effectively bought the deception.
as per the plan, any potentially suspicious journalists were eliminated by the cia.
i think we should congratulate the fbi, the cia, and the boys at the bureau of alcohol,
the secret legislation authorised by senators hague and schlieffen which you signed into law last year - they agreed to forget that little unpleasantness with the french ambassador's daughter.
mr president, a communication has been arranged between you and the aliens.
- hopes and dreams, and an interest in the finer things that life has to offer, especially warm, cuddly, smoochy things - you know what i mean.
our planet is decaying in its own filth, and is best avoided by all aliens.
look pal, i don't know what you're going on about, ok, except it doesn't make any sense at all.
look - what i want is a place with nice beaches and good food and open minded interesting attractive women and not a whole lot else.
ok, so buddy, you're president of something or other, whoever you are, i think you should know i am stanley h tweedle, and i'm captain of the most powerful destructive force in the two universes,
and i've blown up plenty of planets, and if i don't start getting a little more co-operation from you,
i'm going to use your little blue planet for target practice!
we have the capacity, and the will, to defend ourselves aggressively against any and all unfriendly alien intrusion.
- how come you still have the key to the lexx, huh?
i'm the captain, and i think i should have the key back right now!
in my memories, i have but limited knowledge of this universe.
however, i believe that this planet is at the very centre of the darkest part of the dark zone.
just come on xev, just blow up the stupid planet and then we can go someplace else and we can find ourselves a nice planet.
it makes little difference whether or not you destroy this planet.
xev - ask the lexx how long it will take him to reach the nearest other solar system.
lexx, how long will it take you to reach the next solar system?
the slut and the security guard should go down to the stupid planet and join the other lowlifes, and the robot head and the corpse he lusts after will stay up here on the lexx forever and ever.
the next solar system may or may not have the digestible organic material that the lexx needs.
then you have to spend eight very challenging years in simulators before your name even gets on the list.
but it's not really that hard, once you get used to it.
i'm right here in the middle of the amazon jungle, watching the last living pair of luminescent paraguayan toucans doing the glowing thing just like on the discovery channel.
a bird that only a few years ago was thought to be just an indian legend, which i am about to capture on my own camera.
hey - you guys said this part of the jungle was totally undisturbed - in fact, you guaranteed it .
you bring those birds back, or return my twelve thousand bucks.
those birds are back here in ten minutes, or you're gonna hear from my lawyer!
as we predicted, the exit polls are confirming thatthe republicans and democratic candidates areneck and neck.
typically, we find voters, who are frustrated with the traditional parties, often express this frustration by casting their ballots for independents.
so it may be that this particular exit sample is telling us that americans are very frustrated.
but i have to admit, it's certainly a first to see somany voters support the same, almost unknowncandidate.
no-one, including us, seems to know very much about reginald j priest, other than the fact that he was a vietnam war mia.
but we remind you that this is just an early exit poll, which will likely have little further meaning as the official results start pouring in from across the nation.
you know bob, i have to admit that in the privacy of the poll booth this morning, i couldn't bring myself to vote for either one.
can't they leave me alone, it's the middle of election night!
they say that the alien spacecraft has taken a bite out of the amazon rain forest, leaving a large lake.
maybe this priest guy will siphon off votes from huff more than me.maybe this is just what i need to go over the top.
nasa has lost contact with the space shuttle and think that the crew are dead.
we will take you now live to mr priest's campaign headquarters in atlantic city, new jersey.
my first official act will be to pardon president davison for his crimes.
you can't bring xev to the edge of sexual ecstasy because she finds you utterly and completely repulsive, so that means you have to kill her sooner or later, and i would prefer sooner.
you know, 790, i admit sometimes xev really does make me feel like wanting to kill her, you see, but i'm not a psychotic robot head so the answer is definitely no.
you show me how to get the key to drive this ship, and that dirty little love slave will be history.
you're not attracted to six thousand year old dead men, are you?
we can spend the rest of our lives in a vacuum - on that moon!
kai is not going to spend the rest of his life anywhere, because kai is dead.
i do believe that, baby, but what i mean is that all i intended to do was kill you to get the key to this ship.
but now that i've seen what you look like in the flesh, i'm going to break with my tradition and do you first.
i may be bad, but i always stick to my deals and i very rarely ever lie - it's much more fun to tell the truth.
so if you do know a way to get to kai, we could find it too.
however, we want you to understand the importance of our commission.
that is why we insist that each claimant answer a few questions, so that we may, in time, better understand the physiognomy of human evil.
claimant, you will not progress your claim until you respect the rules and procedures by which this adjudication commission adjudicates its claims.
i withdraw all claims and request that this - commission, throw me from the edge of this city.
the rocks down here produce some heat, but not as much as in other places.
it is possible for a human being to survive down here, for a few days at least - survive the heat that is, not necessarily his fellow man.
fire is too hot to sustain human life, and we have no water.
they have no end of water, but they will not give us a single drop.
i was the first thing he laid eyes on after he was reset.
you are the first and only, you dead gorgeous drop of man.
i mean, if i asked you to blow up a planet, could you do that?
i think my weapon still has enough charge in it, stan.
as lexx cannot propel himself, he cannot control where he is pointed.
and since he is unable to destroy anything unless directly pointed at it,
..then there is no need for you to decide whether or not to destroy the planet called fire - at least, not for the time being.
yeah, i think i get that - so, so - how long will it be before lexx is pointed at fire again?
it was a required function for assassins of the divine order.
it's ok, just, you can go away, ok, just lave me alone, please, please just leave me alone.
a slow moving chemical propelled craft, typical of a type 13 planet in its last stage of development.
houston - a great big bug just passed us, heading straight toward the earth.
it is a simple time coded number stream transmitted by the missiles to determine whether the object they are attacking is a friend or a foe.
a friendly object would recognise the code and send the appropriate response code back, so the missiles would not attack it.
eat my jam code, missiles that want to separate me from my beloved!
i got that bug at 6 o'clock, and i'm moving in to swat that fly right now.
no planet is important unless my captain says it is - and you are my captain, captain stanley.
lexx - do you ever find yourself in the mood to just blow something up?
you ruled fire until xev blew it up, and - .
i'm isambard prince, director of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms of the united states of america, and i've been sent here to attempt to reason with the alien threat.
i want a place, where only i rule, and everybody does everything that i say.
you can have whatever country you want - within reason, of course.
now, throw him to his death over the edge of the bridge.
you take this off right away, or i'll tell the lexx to blow up your planet.
i will fly away in the lexx and find another planet to ruin - but not necessarily with you, stanley tweedle.
you put that bomb in the lexx, didn't you, the one that went off in its stomach?
the divine order was a clerical organisation that once dominated the league of 20,000 planets.
the divine order was headed by his divine shadow, a human tyrant possessed of an insect essence - the enemy of humankind.
but if the universe was destroyed, how is it that we are here now?
the universe that was destroyed was the light universe, which once existed in the same time and space as the dark zone.
come on, come on, me and you was always been buddies.
look, here i am just out taking a morning walk, and, and thinking about you, as a fact, and you start putting this crazy thing on me - .
this was uncovered in the first chaldean city of ur in sumeria, approximately 4000 bc.
once again - the identical number of segments, and once again, we find it associated with death.
till recently i was associated with a team of researchers divided between this planet's most powerful nuclear particle accelerators.
my team has been building ever more powerful particle accelerators, trying to determine the mass, if any, of the higgs-boson, in order to complete our picture of the basic building blocks of this universe.
i tried to stop the project, but in their blind rush tobe the first to measure the higgs-boson,no-one would listen.
i warned the government, and for my efforts to save the human race i was fired, dismissed from waarp - the world association of applied research physicists - and stripped of all seven of my phds.
sometime within the next twelve months, either fermilab or cern will reach the power level needed to determine the higgs-boson, and therefore, within the next twelve months, this planet will be shrunk to the size of a pea.
we tried to sabotage the facilities, but they're onto us now.
we know we can't stop fermilab or cern, the government will not listen to us, the media think we are a crazed cult.
so we chose to gamble all our limited resources on one almost hopeless bet.
we have been searching the skies and continuously broadcasting a distress message into space for two years now.
we knew that unless we were rescued by advanced extra-terrestrials, we would all die this year, along with every otherplant, animal and micro-organism on this doomedplanet.
i came to this planet with xev, to learn if it wasagood place for her to find suitable men whowouldmake her happy.
this planet is not a good place for anyone to do anything.
the atf recently destroyed seti - the organisation that searched for extraterrestrial life, with which we were closely associated.
that action makes no sense, unless you believe as i do, that the blight of inexplicable and irrational events that have lately beset this world are a cry of pain, from a planet that knows it is doomed.
- i hate to break the news to you, but you're not a plant!
you're a brunnen g warrior, and then you became an assassin for the divine order, you're not meant to rot in a garden!
you are captain of the lexx, the mightiest weapon in the two universes - what's left of them - and have been so for more than four thousand years.
they seek advantage by rising above us, so they are shedding weight to gain in altitude.
their strategy is to puncture our balloon's bag and make us descend.
make sure they all stay out of range of his weapon.
you should be one of mine, you should be with me.
if you can hate me, you should be able to hate others.
and i also punish some who have done nothing wrong, who slip through the cracks - but then, no system is perfect.
you may not understand why i do what i do, but even less do i understand why you make the choices that you do.
can we get naked now and play ridethe tower of power?
it's not what you look like on the outside, but the man on the inside that matters to me?
- i like a man with a lot of meat on his bones!
can we get naked now and play ride the tower of power?
the dead man will jump over the side and sink into the sea.
unless he does that in ten seconds, priest will cut the cord on xev, and she will sink into the sea. 10.
i'm informing you right now that i am in no way equipped for a jump like that.
you know, my fingers won't respond to the instructions from my brain to let go.
let me add my voice to the criticism of your rude welcome.
i promise you that the quality of surgery here on medsat is better than the administration.
we know it can be released at the point of death.
and as doctors, we know that the will can be broken at the point of death.
it seems clear that you will be able to rematerialise unless we break you down into subatomic particles.
our satellite drive is powered by a plasma beam from the ion furnace.
i would say "what would we be, if we didn't try?".
and actually mean it - then it just became a line.
er - the thing is, lyekka, no-one really notices me much.
and you're popular, even though some people say bad things about you.
you see, i like, i like to be in a garden.
i like to work the soil with my hands, get everything just right.
just a plain order of big old fries for me please.
yeah, well, i'm not sure potatoes are lexx's strong point, but it will taste potato-like - if you use your imagination.
i mean, we may seem backward to you captain, but i don't think there's a man of us here'd exchange any of this for what we got on potatoho.
i mean, when i think of my, my farm, my little garden, my becky boo, my girl -
i've been saving this special potato ever since i was a kid.
i wanted to be the first to give it to an alien.
this just in - the sacred college of cardinals of the catholic church have finally chosen a new pope.
although it's not a requirement of canon law, the college normally elects one of its own members as leader of the world's more than one billion catholics.
it was getting so acrimonious, we decided to picka compromise candidate at random from thenewspaper.
once conclave begins, no communication is allowed with the outside world, and the only newspaper we had was the real estate section of the miami herald.
you said we were going to go last year - of course, we didn't go anywhere last year.
you said we were gonna go the year before - and the year before that.
now xev, look, i know that you think that sometimes i make really stupid decisions, and i admit, once or twice in the past, maybe i coulda done things a bit better, but trust me on this one.
what i am doing is for the greater good of everybody.
then you'll end up killing thousands and thousands of innocent people.
look xev - the only chance that entire planet has is with prince out of the way, now you know that's true
are you sure it is possible to kill prince in the conventional sense?
you mean, after he's killed, he might be able to come back, like he did on fire?
therefore making this planet a much better place for me, for you, for everybody!
now lexx - you see that bit that sticks out there?
i've had it with this whole stupid planet, i've had it with prince, and i've had it with everything.
i say we just get outta here right now, and take our chances someplace else.
unless i eat a lot more i will not be able to go very far very quickly.
look lexx, we'll find you something else to eat along the way, ok?
you know, one minute it's there, the next minute - pfft!
well that's an interesting theory, mr president, but i doubt that the people will accept such an explanation.
when something as terrible as this happens, someone must be seen to pay for it, otherwise the public will not be satisfied.
and as you know - this is exactly the sort of incident that gets a presidency into trouble.
it could take the lexx many thousands of years to reach a suitable planet in its weakened condition.
you will of course choose to enter cryosleep, but the cryopods may not continue to function properly for that length of time.
- i will be able to go full speed if i ate just that small little part of the blue planet.
it has lots of green goodness and yummy protein, and not too many hard rocks.
wait a second - if that's a country, then doesn't it possibly have lots of people?
holland appears to be densely populated - which means it would supply lexx with plenty of protein.
if i kill stan the key will flow to you and you will become captain of the lexx.
oh come on, but you wouldn't really do that would you, kai old buddy old pal, you wouldn't kill me,
ladies and gentlemen - we have got a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad situation here, but we found a way to save the presidency, yes - it's a good day.
what the president is saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that we have learned who is responsible for orlando.
fire fighters have been called in to retrieve a cat stuck in a power line along i95.
film at 11 - and cuba was nuked off the face of the earth late this afternoon by president priest, in retaliation for yesterday's evil attack on orlando.
the queen of england owns her own beautiful island full of gardens and antiques.
the position is currently filled, but all it would take to free it up would be a couple of phone calls.
you forget, i'm the head of the most powerful institution on this planet -
the bureau of alcohol, tobacco and firearms of the united states of america, and as such, i have an immense capacity to protect myself.
you know i can be reborn, whenever and however i want.
that was true on the planet fire - but is it true on earth?
you know that when you destroyed the planet fire all of its evil including me came here, so it makes no difference.
this planet will be just as bad whether i live or die.
well, once upon a time, there was this president called jfk.
and this president had a very bad habit of not following orders -
yeah - and being a true fact that i am the only one here that ever acts sensibly, and seeing that i'm the captain of the lexx,
i hereby officially insist that we leave this system by the quickest means possible.
and something really terrible is gonna happen to me, and in order to avoid all those negatives nobody's going anywhere ever again - that's it.
we can use the moths to bring food to the lexx, but the moth breeders are incapable of flying them without guidance.
the nearest system, which may or may not have life bearing planets, would take more than 17 years to reach in a moth.
well, still, i mean flying for 17 years is better than crashing in 191 hours.
well, of course it would, i mean, you've been down there.
fire's a, it's a terrible place, and water - it's just weird.
the last divine shadow, whom i killed, was meant to possess the key and command the lexx.
as i have his memories i have a general understanding of how it works.
the divine shadow i killed was not concerned with the transfer of the key to the lexx except to the next divine shadow to follow him, who would have received it on his death, by a kiss.
there are other ways to transfer the key, but i do not know what they are.
ah well, well that's interesting, that's something for me to look forward to - hopefully, a long way down the road.
790, focus on the part of stan's brain where he experiences sexual pleasure.
i don't know xev, i mean i wasn't exactly focused at the time.
i mean come on, you were there, it was 4000 years ago.
so kai - how do we get the key out of him?
there is - potentially - a connection between the ecstasy of sexual climax, the ecstasy of death, and the location of the key in stanley's brain.
he may be able to transfer the key at will, if his medulla sexuala is stimulated to the required leve of ecstasy.
and how do we get stanley to this level of ecstasy?
it means you're never gonna have the kind of personal experience that i just had, so maybe you'd like to know what it's like to have the ultimate sexual experience with a woman?
i am not interested in any type of sexual experience with a woman.
well, how can you give it back to me if i don't, you know, do it for you?
i will simply bring myself over the edge of sexual ecstasy.
how long before we are directly aimed at the planet water?
in 4 minutes and 12 seconds i will be aimed directly at the water planet.
then please, when you are directly aimed at it, i want you to destroy it.
may i eat the chunks that fly away when i blow it up?
i may not have reached the height of sexual ecstasy in round one, but maybe we will make some progress in round two.
- you were wearing, but that rubber thing that i had, i didn't like it all that much, it was just kinda tight and
does that mean that i had the ultimate in sexual satisfaction with a man, or a woman?
i think that you are best placed to answer that question yourself, stanley.
that's a fresh pair of panties for you to put on.
don't matter whether you like 'em or not - you won't be wearing 'em long.
well, like a big bug really - except with mechanical parts.
and - it is the most powerful destructive force ever built.
you know, i don't even know if prince is a man.
i mean, he used to be the ruler of this really evil planet called fire, and he, he would die over and over again, and every time he'd come back, same as before, except more evil.
- i want you to tell these people everything they need to know to be able to leave this planet in the way they want.
you could have asked me to do something difficult at least.
we need to leave this planet in the next few months.
teach us how to build a space vessel capable of carrying us safely to another life bearing planet.
of course it's not difficult - and of course you can't build one because this is a type 13 planet in its final stage.
you simply do not have the technology to create such a vessel.
i hate to disappoint you, but one does not get to wear what one wants in the texas prison system.
anyway, like i was saying prince stole a moth, flew it down here.
but i would have to analyse endless possibilities, which is just a huge waste of time.
790 - waste the time, and inform me of stanley tweedle's precise location as soon as you have determined it.
and at your moment of death, in theory anyway, the key will fly from your hand - and into mine.
and i'm about to test that theory right now, by removing your supports and dropping you to your death on the concrete floor below.
precisely, and that's why he is a very important part of this experiment.
because if the key does go into him, i shall press a second button and drop the pathetic little science student to his death.
"my name is" - then just pick a name from the list - tiffany, melanie, any name, it doesn't matter.
"i am sixteen years old, with blue eyes and blonde hair".
the key has left you, stanley, but unfortunately has transferred itself to the pathetic little science student instead of me.
however, before i can start the second part of my experiment, which is to drop that science student to his death, perhaps i ought to cut you down first.
it was destroyed by robotic drone arms under the control of the evil bio-vizier mantrid.
on the cluster, i was sentenced to become a love slave.
i have the perfect body, but i cannot find myself a man.
i thought i loved kai, and maybe i still do 790, locate the origin of this signal.
you're the most evil person i ever met, i can't believe i'm helping you.
sometimes stanley, in order to help yourself, you have to help others.
at 10:00 this morning, i closed a deal... to purchase a 50,000-square-foot space across the street from the royalton.
if you play your cards right, you'll come home with your sweetest gig.
you see, i was on the phone, and the line moved.
but i couldn't move with it because the cord wouldn't stretch that far.
i think if a guy gets hit by a bus, it's because he wasn't looking... not because of some master plan.
you don't think it was fate... you were standing in this line when i got off the phone?
they'd like nothing better than to catch you with your pants down.
then they should definitely be looking into jeff... because he actually heads up... our "pants down" department.
that can only last about three months because eventually it leaks out.
then you spend the next three months getting to know your real selves.
there's a spot in the middle of central park... the bethesda fountain.
if you sit there long enough, the entire city walks by.
now you, on the other hand... you're not even an active presbyterian.
so why don't you want me to carry my faith and my belief to our child?
it's a good way to be, a good thing to do.
it's not the only way to be, not the only thing to do.
look, alex... we're here to get a job done and we're running behind schedule.
can i help it if cinco de mayo fell on tuesday?
half of the squirrels ended up on the north rim.... and the other half on the south rim.
over time, the two families became different... each adjusting to their own environment.
the ones to the north are dark... bushy-tailed and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner... meaner and much prettier.
now, i don't know what happened but between the tuna and your aunt's tamales...
i actually worried i had met the woman of my dreams at the dry cleaners and didn't notice.
then you spend three months getting to know your real selves.
then one of you wants a commitment, the other doesn't so you start over.
there's a spot in central park, the bethesda fountain where if you sit there long enough, the entire city walks by.
and i know a canyon where if you sit there long enough nobody finds you.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
even though they look different and they act different they are the exact same squirrel.
no, you see, i was on the phone, and the line moved.
but i couldn't move with it because the cord wouldn't stretch that far.
they'd like nothing better than to catch you with your pants down.
well, then, they should definitely be looking into jeff, because he actually heads up our... "pants-down" department.
and then months later you show up and say you're pregnant, and i'm supposed to know exactly what to do?
well, i'm sorry, but i don't know exactly what to do.
the oldest one is antonio, then carlos, juan, miguel, fernando, and i am the baby.
but anybody messes with me, i can take care of myself.
that can only last about three months anyway because eventually it leaks out.
then you have to spend the next three months getting to know your real selves.
half of the squirrels ended up on the north rim and the other half on the south rim.
over time, the two families became different, each one adjusting to their own environment.
the ones to the north are dark, bushy-tailed and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
so, with your help and with your help and with your help,
i think this can be the most successful club we've ever had, so...
how can you be in love with someone you just met?
when i am eighteen, i will come to las vegas and find you.
this morning, i closed a deal to buy a 50,000 square foot space across from the royalton.
if you play your cards right, you come home to the sweetest gig ever.
i actually worried i had met the woman of my dreams at the dry cleaners and didn't notice.
but then you show up and i realize that's not true.
when the west was stolen from mexico the fuentes made a vow.
even though they took our land, they'd never take our culture!
now you, on the other hand you're not an active presbyterian.
so, why don't you want me to carry my faith and belief to our child?
the ones to the north are dark, bushy-tailed, and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
how can you be in love with someone you just met?
when i am eighteen, i will come to las vegas and find you.
this morning, i closed a deal to buy a 50,000 square foot space across from the royalton.
if you play your cards right, you come home to the sweetest gig ever.
you walked out on me at 5 a.m. i never heard from you.
months later you show up pregnant, and i'm supposed to know what to do?
now, i don't know what happened but between the tuna and your aunt's tamales....
i actually worried i had met the woman of my dreams at the dry cleaners and didn't notice.
then you spend three months getting to know your real selves.
then one of you wants a commitment, the other doesn't so you start over.
there's a spot in central park, the bethesda fountain where if you sit there long enough, the entire city walks by.
and i know a canyon where if you sit there long enough nobody finds you.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
even though they look different and they act different they are the exact same squirrel.
no, you see, i was on the phone, and the line moved.
but i couldn't move with it because the cord wouldn't stretch that far.
i think if a guy gets hit by a bus, it's because he wasn't looking, not because of some master plan.
so you don't think it was fate you were standing in this line when i got off the phone?
and then months later you show up and say you're pregnant, and i'm supposed to know exactly what to do?
well, i'm sorry, but i don't know exactly what to do.
that can only last about three months anyway because eventually it leaks out.
then you have to spend the next three months getting to know your real selves.
over time, the two families became different, each one adjusting to their own environment.
the ones to the north are dark, bushy-tailed and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
and even though they look different and they act different, they are the exact same squirrel.
so, with your help and with your help and with your help,
i think this can be the most successful club we've ever had, so...
how can you be in love with someone you just met?
when i am eighteen, i will come to las vegas and find you.
this morning, i closed a deal to buy a 50,000 square foot space across from the royalton.

the ones to the north are dark, bushy-tailed, and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
at 10:00 this morning, i closed a deal to purchase a 50,000-square-foot space, right across the street from the royalton.
if you play your cards right, don't get distracted, you'll be coming home with the sweetest gig you ever had in your life.
* the prison band was there they began to wail *
* the band was jumpin' and the joint began to swing *
but i couldn't move with it because the cord wouldn't stretch that far.
i'd like to believe you, but your nose is actually growing.
then months later you show up and say you're pregnant, and i'm supposed to know exactly what to do?
well, i'm sorry, but i don't know exactly what to do.
the oldest one is antonio, then carlos, juan, miguel, fernando, and i am the baby.
but anybody messes with me, i can take care of myself.
i mean, i was actually worried that i'd already met the woman of my dreams... at the dry cleaners and i was too busy to notice.
but then you show up and i realize that's not true.
that can only last about three months anyway because eventually it leaks out.
then you have to spend the next three months getting to know your real selves.
there's a spot in the middle of central park... the bethesda fountain...
if you sit there long enough, the entire city walks by.
we're here to get a job done, and we're runnin' a little behind schedule.
hey, can i help it if cinco de mayo fell on a tuesday?
half of the squirrels ended up on the north rim... and the other half on the south rim.
over time, the two families became different, each one adjusting to their own environment.
the ones to the north are dark, bushy-tailed and have bigger ears.
the ones to the south are leaner, meaner and much prettier.
o god whose nature is ever to show mercy and forbearance we humbly entreat thee for the soul of thy servant edward perle who at thy bidding has departed from this life
a benefactor of the abbey he died shriven of his sins
therefore do not deliver him into the enemy's hands or put him out of mind for ever but bid thy holy angels welcome him and lead him home to paradise
ut quia in te speravit et credidit, non poenas inferni sustineat, sed gaudia aeterna possideat
they also undertake to make annual payment, during my lifetime, of one rose from the white rose bush that grows in the garden of the rose house.
that single rose to be delivered to me, judith perle, upon the first day of each july in remembrance of my husband.
which can command a sturdy rent when a tenant is placed in it.
we have also prayed a whole year now, brother prior - for the widow's dear departed husband.
no death is untimely, brother oswin, if it is god's will.
i suppose, brother cadfael, being expert in matters horticultural, it'll be your job to sally forth today and present the first rose to the lady?
sometimes other men, even brother eluric, as he stood before me with the first rose, there was a warmth that shames me before my husband's memory.
judith, your guilt is that edward died and you did not.
almighty god, let the soul of thy servant edward perle have entrance to the company of thy saints.
almighty god, let the soul of thy servant edward perle have entrance to the company of thy saints.
any more than i would leave the knife lying in my own garden?
well, whether he would or not, we need to melt some candle ends.
if it were not for the rose rent, he would be alive now.
if it were not for me, he would be alive now.
lf, as you say, there has been a studied use of poison as well as violent murder.
you seek not just stability and purpose, then, but also refuge?
but you clearly have no such vocation... or you wouldn't have said it would be welcome
no, it is not enough just to escape from the world outside, or from yourself.
she set out last night for the abbey but she never reached here.
the porter has not seen her your father abbot brother prior
master coliar, you will help us both by going into town and raising friends and townsfolk for a thorough search.
until we have searched from the english bridge to bristol, i will not say your cousin's drowned.
some say in the river... three years ago at chester, whereupon he left and has moved from place to place unsettled ever since.
oswin, it surely is not in your vows to listen to gossip?
he said... your heart could no longer be fixed within a rose.
and still thought i would give up the past for a future with him?
not only the heel worn down on the one side, and the toe on the other, but this crack diagonally across the ball of the foot.
so... the river has saved us the cost of a trial, and bertred a worse fate than drowning.
i lost sight of him after he left town by the postern gate.
but i suspect he was going to the tenterground or wool warehouse.
and... then i'm told that he is dead which is why i must tell you, brother, there was someone else abroad by the river last night.
he passed me, hurrying, and i saw him clearly, though he did not see me.
you cannot keep your people in such anxiety a moment longer.
even if you have promised to spare this idiot youth, thomas, from the consequences of his folly.
if that is your wish, nor shall i - outside this room.
provided i can be certain thomas hynde's only crime involved you and the counting house.
and now another suspect has proved innocent, you persecute me further.
mine is the only leg you have hold of and you are determined that the boot be made to fit!
the true owner killed eluric, then murdered bertred and used him to put us off the scent.
only one other person... apart from you and oswin, knew that i had that cast.
she thinks that i am more deserving than a mother church already fat with land and gold.
if you were to die today, both unmarried and uncloistered, that would be fair.
yet i'm not your brother, nor do i desire to be.
i look at you with the same eyes as any other man, and have done since before you married edward.
you see how foul and devious i've become because of you.
how each bloody act solves one difficulty and raises ten more!
no, he would approve of niall and wish you great happiness together.
though... as to being together, i trust he has told you all his story?
i have to fight out more about casca and save him.
then these two guys will have no reason to go after one another.
my father was almost run down today because of the careless driving of menos scum.
your father was almost run down because he was too deaf to hear the warnings.
the first day everything seems normal well, excepting that joxer gets killed.
the next day, i fix that, and then argo gets killed.
on the third day, i know that there was something i am supposed to do and that somehow it's tied in with this blood feud.
so i find out all about the old man getting hit by the cart, and i save him.
hey, i'm the one who got us those goose eggs to begin with!
i mean, if you want a big goose egg, i'm your man.
then these two guys will have no reason to go after one another.
no fight means no duel, means no bloodbath, means the day no longer has to repeat itself.
my father was almost run down today, because of the careless driving of menos scum.
your father was almost run down, because he was too deaf to hear the warnings.
i am supposed to do, and that somehow, it's tied in with this blood feud.

so, if i'm in l.a. and i want to know the time in new york...
i don't have to go through the anguish of adding three.
i got a scheme to develop this lake... and i think that you could appreciate it.
now, no need, really, for you to look at these... 'cause you can envision this... better than these folks can draw... but i want you to look at these figures.
now, they'll be looking for us in the south, all right?
if we can get back south of this pass, by tonight... we can use the flares.
well, they'd have these two set points on the land... they'd left behind, or sailed away from... and they'd line them up, and that would be their bearing.
and then they'd trail this long rope behind the ship... pointing it at those two points.
then, what are our chances, really... when all is said and done?
i mean... we can walk out of here and we probably die... or we can stay here, and he'll certainly gonna die.
now, you think this spot is so remote... that only thefew can enjoy it, but i got a plan.

this is the guy we should have been shooting all along.
- there's a guy who's got some character in his face.
here's the bear hunter's cabin, where we were supposed to have gone.
and this is where we did go— through this pass, the mountains, the river.
well, they'd have these two set points on the land they'd left behind... or sailed away from... and they'd line them up, and that would be their bearing.
and then they'd trail this long rope behind their ship... uh, pointing it at those two points there, or whatever—
what we'll do— we'll get together when we get back— you and me and your wife— and we'll all get into a hot tub... and, um— [lisping] bare our feelings... and, uh—
look, even if i wanted to kill you, i need you to get home.
then what are our chances, really, when all is said and done?
i mean, we can walk outta here, and we'll probably die.

he's a billionaire. you know what happens when you misplace one.
going to make some story to tell when we get home.
then what are our chances when all is said and done?
we can walk out and probably die, or stay here and he'll certainly die.

i guess we'll never know because you only played high school ball.
hey, at least i was man enough to suit up for it.
you know, as in cooking dinner and serving it to your family.
well, in that case, thanks for getting rid of it, honey.
i should be in heaven right now having sex with young elvis.
then it wouldn't be heaven for him anymore, though, would it?
i'd say it was a chicken, but it doesn't have any breasts just nuggets.
and it takes 10 of them to make a decent meal.
all we have to do is score the first touchdown and we get to go home.
so give me the ball and stay out of my way.
ronald martin, the man who strangled donna braun for seven minutes.
dr. braun, i am both mindful of your presence in the courtroom every day and of your loss.
"more than all our expert testimony, more than all our unconvoluted..."
i'm sorry. "...uncontroverted evidence what the defense is going for, more than anything else, is your common sense the seat-of-the-pants wisdom of the reasonable person."
on the charge of first-degree murder we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
on the charge of second-degree murder we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
on the charge of voluntary manslaughter we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this completes your service and i thank you for your time.
and i want to also caution you that when you leave this room you may be subject to second-guessing.
i want to emphasize to you that aside from the parties and attorneys and myself you are the only people who heard all the relevant facts of this case.
- your honor dr. braun cannot be considered a flight risk.
he's a health risk, goes about shooting people in the head.
might we have the first grade teacher of the defendant as well?
the synagogue of b'nai zion will vouch for dr. braun's character.
i'm sure you're aware that product liability cases can potentially drag on forever and you might be worried about that.
there's medical information, scientific evidence technical data with respect to cigarettes.
and you will believe dr. clark because he is the only doctor who actually treated margaret ray.
as for whether cigarettes cause lung cancer we will not be calling witnesses to prove that, either.
we will present evidence of a two-year investigation conducted by the fda, in which it found nicotine to be addictive.
so much, in fact that the fda now regulates cigarettes as drug-delivery devices.
it's one of the things we're proud of in this country.
no, it's a slippery slope once you start arguing that people shouldn't have the right to make personal choices.
they put out a product, when used as directed, causes cancer.
it's the plaintiff's contention that when their product does kill somebody they should bear some responsibility.
well, that's another thing i won't be doing in this trial.
i would never presume to be able to articulate his pain.
enticing people to use a product that could give them cancer probably will give them cancer and feel no remorse.
the defendant, t.l. michaels, generates revenues exceeding $28 billion a year.
that offer is only being made because sometimes it's cheaper to shoo away a mosquito rather than to slap it dead.
look, i'm not gonna pretend that we measure up on legal talent.
we might be crazy, but there's a climate out there right now.
states are suing tobacco companies for health costs associated with smoking.
it's just a matter of time before a jury in massachusetts is gonna wanna pinch you.
and if we get them there, to the point where they want you to feel a sting even a little sting imagine.
and here's the biggest thing of all most victims don't bother to sue because you're too big a windmill.
what if you should ever lose a jury trial to a plaintiff who puts on so simple a case?
- lf they can get rid of it now they can sell it as a nuisance settlement.
as soon as the trial's in progress, any settlement is perceived as defeat.
for which he was judged to be insane at the time.
but there was no suggestion of insanity at the time father o'brien forgave him.
the jury never got to hear the truth in ronald martin's trial.
they never knew that he previously tried to kill another girl because he suppressed that information.
a lot of injustice would occur but this isn't such a case.
and jerry braun shouldn't be crucified because of what might hypothetically happen if you don't condemn him on some legal principal when morally, it's not so simple.

five years i worked my fingers to the bone for wellington, cracking his codes and ciphers.
i beg him for a brigade, he gives me a brigade.
i intend to celebrate tomorrow night with a good bottle of claret.
i want you to do me the honour of dining with me.
lord wellington wants...proof, so he's set up a tribunal of inquiry.
if it finds there is a case against you, you go to a court martial.
major sharpe will be confined to quarters in the barracks at bordeaux.
oh, molly, i'm so glad you went back and bought this.
i gave the provosts a guinea to get themselves some rum.
and human nature being what it is, one little drop led to another little drop.
why has she not written me to tell me what's happening?
more than likely, she has written to you, but how would a letter find us out here?
he's gone to see the man who makes major ducos' spectacles.
he said i should take care of you until he comes back.
you will take us to major sharpe, and major sharpe will take us to the treasure.
how the devil can he do that when ducos has it?
never really thinking about the war finishing, and what i'd do, where i'd go.
these past few weeks, being here with you, helping on the farm, it's been good.
you can die up there, or you can die down here.
if you make me come up for you, you will die very slowly,
she is in this court today, and she is prepared to testify to the innocence of major sharpe.
do you wish to hear her testimony, or do you take my word?
five years i worked my fingers to the bone for wellington, cracking his codes and ciphers.
i beg him for a brigade, he gives me a brigade.
i intend to celebrate tomorrow night with a good bottle of claret.
i want you to do me the honor of dining with me.
oh, molly, i'm so glad you went back and bought this.
i wanted it so much when we saw it yesterday, but it seemed so expensive.
i gave the provosts a guinea to get themselves some rum.
and human nature being what it is, one little drop led to another little drop.
he's gone to see the man who makes major ducos' spectacles.
he said i should take care of you until he comes back.
i too would have been a soldier, but for my eyes.
but now the war is over, we are friends, n'est-ce pas?
you will take us to major sharpe, and major sharpe will take us to the treasure.
how the devil can he do that when ducos has it?
never really thinking about the war finishing, and what i'd do, where i'd go.
these past few weeks, being here with you, helping on the farm, it's been good.
you can die up there, or you can die down here.
if you make me come up for you, you will die very slowly,
i hope what you said is true, ross, because if it's not, i'll go back there and i'll shoot him in the head.
might've been better if he'd shot you in the head, sharpe.
lord wellington wants... proof, so he's set up a tribunal of inquiry.
if it finds there is a case against you, you go to a court martial.
where is major ducos and colonel maillot at this moment in time, sir?
major ducos is missing and presumed dead at the hands of major sharpe.
if this tribunal of inquiry finds against major sharpe, he will be court-martialed for murder.
you cannot shoot a man with no more evidence than a scrap of paper, which looks as if a spider has crawled all over it.
i think, monsieur roland, we must insist on colonel maillot appearing before this tribunal.
i will fetch him here myself, but it will take two weeks.
why has she not written me to tell me what's happening?
more than likely, she has written to you, but how would a letter find us out here?
do you think if major sharpe and myself had the imperial treasure,
i would waste my time in a shop that makes spectacles?
today, we begin prayer and meditation as preparation for our days of atonement.
may the prophets walk with us as we begin our journey.
before he became a vedek your friend was involved in some very questionable activities.
latha was a violent man but then he found the prophets.
and the last time i talked to him he'd changed... really changed.
i don't doubt that, major, but it would appear that the violence of his past has finally caught up with him.
it came over the primary subspace antenna at 1341 hours... almost the same moment latha was killed on bajor.
and you think that this is a threat to all the former members of the shakaar resistance cell?
she passed us information for years without anyone catching on but she was always so afraid... afraid she'd be caught and executed... but she never stopped.
i told her once that i thought she was braver than all of us because she had to live with her fear every day.
even after the occupation was over she didn't want anyone to know that she was secretly helping us.
she was worried... that someone would come looking for her for revenge.
since she was an informant it stands to reason that fala was killed because she was providing information to the resistance... information that the shakaar used to plan an attack on a cardassian target.
the killer is probably someone who was either injured or who lost a family member or a friend in that attack.
major if i may make a suggestion... why don't you return to your quarters and rest for now?
it may be several hours before they're able to make a complete search.
but they have not yet invented the system that lupaza cannot beat.

someone attached a small hunter probe to the hull of a talavian freighter.
when the ship docked at the station the probe detached itself and then began a visual scan of every room in the habitat ring.
my sources on cardassia have given me a list of possible suspects.
they all have the computer skills the opportunity, and the motive, to carry out these attacks.
i'm satisfied that none of them could have committed the murders.
the fourth name is silaran prin a cardassian living on a planet near the dmz.
a creature, born within the comforting anonymity of darkness awakens in the harsh truth of daylight.

may the prophets walk with us as we begin our journey.
before he became a vedek your friend was involved in some very questionable activities.
latha was a violent man but then he found the prophets.
and the last time i talked to him he'd changed... really changed.
i don't doubt that, major, but it would appear that the violence of his past has finally caught up with him.
it came over the primary subspace antenna at 1341 hours... almost the same moment latha was killed on bajor.
and you think that this is a threat to all the former members of the shakaar resistance cell?
she passed us information for years without anyone catching on but she was always so afraid... afraid she'd be caught and executed... but she never stopped.
i told her once that i thought she was braver than all of us because she had to live with her fear every day.
even after the occupation was over she didn't want anyone to know that she was secretly helping us.
she was worried... that someone would come looking for her for revenge.
since she was an informant it stands to reason that fala was killed because she was providing information to the resistance... information that the shakaar used to plan an attack on a cardassian target.
the killer is probably someone who was either injured or who lost a family member or a friend in that attack.
major if i may make a suggestion... why don't you return to your quarters and rest for now?
it may be several hours before they're able to make a complete search.
but they have not yet invented the system that lupaza cannot beat.

he should know that if the dreaming does not go well you will not be allowed to return to him.
all right, i need you to close both your eyes for a moment and open them slowly when i tell you.

if i am not pure minbari, it doesn't matter if i marry sheridan.
my children will never be pure minbari either way, so there is nothing to lose.
it was our tradition, long ago, when we still warred amongst ourselves after the war was over, each side would give one of its own to the other in marriage.
the victorious side gave a female of its clan to the one that lost that suffered the most deaths, as a symbol of life and hope.
12 months after it happened, shock and bewilderment continue to surround the strange events that occurred in a remote old country house last summer, where a man is said to have literally vanished into thin air.
well-known within the international church of spiritualism was the revered medium and psychic mr jacques futrelle, who, on june 21st last year, elected to stage an unusual experiment at his home in berkshire, the bizarre and sprawling mansion known as metropolis.
as the night wore on, discussion turned to a curious rumour concerning an old attic room at the top of the house, where a madman had been kept under lock and key by his titled relatives.
and where, it was said, the lunatic's ghost still stalked his former prison, feeding on the souls of non-believers.
the challenge thrown down by their host was for the arch-sceptic
mencken, if he dared, to spend a night alone in the room.
and so, at ten minutes to midnight, after careful inspection by independent witnesses, the door was closed, and secured with four heavy-duty padlocks supplied by the guests.
to ensure no single person could assist in his escape, each retained their key as, separately, they retired for the night.
what they found the next day sent a thrill of terror through them all.
though the door and the locks had clearly not been tampered with, and there was no other conceivable way out of the room,
storms out the room with all her clothes, chucks them on the front lawn.
five minutes later, this woman's coming down the stairs, half naked, but amazingly, her foot has now completely healed up!
what she hadn't considered, he'd actually got two women in that bed, and the other one'd done a runner out the back!
so now you get reports sent to you, from all over the world.
ok, you've selected a card in your mind only, and written it down.
i want you now to fold the piece of paper in half please.
then half again, and hold it high up in the air.
i'm now assimilating that card, removing it from the piece of paper.
what are you saying, just because some smart-arse viewer in basildon's managed to work out how the...
what's happening now, are we doing a tribute to roy orbison?
you became just like this vegetable, completely lost the power of speech, and bladder function.
by the end they were feeding you through a tube, it was horrible.
dates back to when constance was a little girl, in the '30s.
her father was like this world famous medium, could supposedly communicate with the dead.
it was just after he bought this place, am i right?
they discovered this room, like an attic, right at the very top of the house.
no-one who's spent the night there has ever survived to tell us.
something in that room has caused seven human beings to disappear, without a trace, as if they never physically existed.
i tell you, if my boss-man finds out i've been giving you the guided tour...
there's still time to change your mind cos this is not a place you want to go after dark.
which means they're looking for a lot of zeros, but i said i'd think it over.
oh, what i wouldn't give, jonathan, for a piece of that action.
cos you know, obviously, i never took it seriously...all that stuff.
it's just, when she started coming on to me, it was like...
cos if it hadn't been for those two mad women, completely mucking up my life... the lovely carla, and her predecessor who's thankfully pissed off to the states...
so, i think the chance of me getting dragged into all that caper again is...
one year later, no rational explanation has been advanced for what happened that night.
nor, can it be assumed, will a solution ever be found to this dark, impenetrable mystery.
and once again, my sincere apologies for that little mix-up yesterday.
i managed to find his number, of course, in the end.
i asked this bloke if his name was creek, he said yes.
he'd say anything for six pints of ruddles and a shepherds pie!
the door, as you'll discover, has not been secretly hinged on the other side.
nor is there an invisible panel that can be opened halfway along.
i was brought up by an aunt in westphalia, and the house was rented out.
and over the next 40 years, the story of what happened here prompted one or two others... with that daredevil mentality i cannot comprehend.
foolishly, you just ignore these things, and hope they'll go away, but...
what form of magic, d'you think, jonathan, are we looking at here?
and where do you stand, mr gessler, on the nightmare room?
you're not buying into all this back story about a predatory demon devouring the unwary?
i only know i felt a lot more comfortable when that part of the house was off-limits.
you think i haven't tried to pick that room apart a hundred times to see what makes it tick?
# would i like go with you and see a movie
# first i say, "no ,i've got some plans for tonight."
delia gunning, our local newspaper editor, and ellen ashley-adams, who publishes the parish magazine.
between them they're more than capable of putting the frighteners on half the home counties.
# if you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
# i'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dying to be saying
i dunno, you hear people talk about, "taking their secrets to the grave".
i just get an idea sometimes, i have to run with it.
i don't know where i'd be today without knowing what a hypotenuse was.
i operate on instinct and adrenaline and i don't have a lot of time for intellectual snobbery, so...oh...
grudgingly, though, i suppose you're right, this is gonna be a complete dead end.
or, on the contrary, does it advance our thinking, in one very key respect?
written in the first person, so we can assume it was his choice of inscription.
how tempting is it, to think that a man with a fondness for latin, when scribbling a note to himself on that reichstag cutting,
and very probably suggests something far more sinister, and far more impenetrable.
somehow or other, futrelle rigged up that room, to dispose of a man he'd loathed and detested.
last month's marie claire, he scored a big fat 89%, didn't he?
"cancel all other wedding plans, you have found the love of your life!"
to do everything that's asked of us here, by these people, by our consciences.
a human being's life is not ours to put a price on.
well, the trick, of course, is to fool the reader into trusting all the wrong people.
and then, in the most apparently innocent and everyday details, slowly sow the seeds of terror.
if you could get something slightly more appropriate organised by way of her working wardrobe?
just to give my husband a fighting chance with his deadline?
oh, well, you see, the folly of unrequited lust has more than once brought tragedy upon this house.
according to the story, in the late 1880s, a young egyptian woman of striking beauty came to work here as a housekeeper.
until finally, when his passion for her cooled, a strange demonic force is said to have transformed her from seductress to sorceress.
and she put a curse on her former lover, predicting the exact date and time of day that he would meet a dreadful, agonising death.
but the strange thing was, no creature or living being had come within 20 yards of him when it happened.
nor could any other method or means of his murder be found.
not a mark or injury anywhere on his body, or any suggestion or possibility he'd taken poison.
so her act of vengeance, through whatever supernatural agency, forever went unpunished.
if you believe in the power of a restless spirit to take control of a person's soul.
ok, so we come in off the lighting change with a whip-spot to find the table.
"the egregious xenophobe was on more odious form as we travelled to a village on the eritrean border,
"where he was heard to say, 'let's hope we don't all get eaten alive',
the slight reddening of your fingertips is characteristic of someone who's recently been handling hot plates.
the chafing on your knees almost certainly the result of cleaning floors.
"and i will pleasure every inch of it, until you scream for mercy."
yeah, forgive me if i don't rush out and buy your latest manual on gender politics any time soon.
and the two of us were out in the country, one day, middle of nowhere, and there was this cottage, in a field, that was there one minute, and then - so bizarre - just completely vanished into thin air.
and when i went over to look around, there was this horrible old man slithering about on the ground.
cos i just worry they can tell i'm on a wire.
but how about if i climb up the rope for real, if you put enough tension in it, and then i could just secretly hook the harness through when i get to the top, just before the flash.
it's just i had this amazing last-minute thing come up and i had to dash off again, after you'd come in specially.
'it was a bit of an odd night in the end...'
do you know, it's a bit old hat this, don't you reckon, flying round the stage as a fairy?
what if i was, i don't know, like a little imp or something, all in red.
hi, my name's adam klaus, and i just want to take a moment before i go onstage...
what on earth possessed him to record it in his dressing room?
..and do what i love doing most of all, entertaining people of all races and creeds, to register a big, heartfelt apology for what i now realise was a stupid and unguarded remark on my recent trip for magic relief.
anyone who really knows me, knows my stance on the issue of race relations could not be more positive...
insecurities can play havoc with your mental health, as i unfortunately managed to demonstrate, not very thoughtfully, the other night.
what he's trying to say is he's such an anally fixated big-head, he thought the only reason you wanted him was for his world-famous powers of deduction.
it's like, maybe i can see things sometimes that aren't there any more.
you know, the mystery of the vanishing cottage may be the least challenging of this whole puzzle.
and when you stop and think about it, the man in the grass would be part of the only explanation that could possibly fit.
it's a bit of a flyer, but the real clue to what you saw that night will almost certainly be the weather.
my brother and i, well, it seems like ancient history now.
till i took off overseas, earned a crust or two, and then a couple of years ago, fresh marriage, fresh start, something seemed to just beckon me back.
the cause of his death never resolved from that day to this.
unsurprisingly, this egyptian femme fatale character was not slow, after that, to exploit her celebrity status.
i've ransacked her personal account of those years for some sort of clue, how she did it, but...
em, yes, riveting as all this is, of course, to students of ancient history, there's a small matter of unexplained death threats which i don't know if anyone's taking very seriously, but...
or a part of the river thames in oxfordshire depending on your preference.
picked up some interesting pieces then, mr dore, on your travels.
look, i'm going to have to love you and leave you for now.
one or two calls to make, so hopefully catch up with you later.
or four if we count the spirit of our victorian witch, whatever she was, who appears able to re-materialise in a pile of logs.
ah, now, i've got a pretty good idea how that was done.
now, you'll correct me if i'm wrong here, i've no doubt, but was there not a very old magic trick once where you had this big sheet of glass on the stage, tipped over at an angle, and then
some bod in the orchestra pit, who'd be reflected upwards, to look all kind of eerie and translucent.
i mean, she comes in here every day, at six, i think it is, so it's not like we'll be stuck down here forever.
just the 5½ hours then, imprisoned in an airless dungeon beneath half a hundredweight of tree stumps(?
well, so we could check out that theory, see if there was a sheet of glass that they...
fortunately, i like nothing better when trapped in a coal-hole, than to curl up with a good book.
what is very persuasive is his theory that she couldn't resist the idea of leaving some kind of cryptic hint behind, somewhere in the book, about how she pulled it off.
it may be nothing, but if you look at that dedication she's put in the front...
i always say, if i have a vice, it's to be screwed on the edge of a bench.
and that's got me into trouble on more than one occasion.
that cottage you saw and then didn't see, we've had a thought.
never mind how unlikely the thought, just run with the sheer, cold analysis.
but what looks like a building, that can seem to disappear, that could have been placed in that field deliberately, in the middle of nowhere, for a purpose that's unlikely to occur to any of us.
these days, probably, no-one'd go to the trouble of building the facade of a fairytale cottage on location for a scene in a movie now long forgotten, pending the arrival of a film unit in a few days' time.
when you first spot it, during a lull in the wind, the illusion's complete.
a second later, our "night watchman" character, there to keep an eye on the site takes a nasty tumble.
we are all of us unique and blessed before god, and the tragedy of any loss touches us all.
but while harriet dore today is no longer flesh, her spirit, i know, walks among us still.
i doubt there's anyone round here would have known her from a bar of soap.
but how prophetic were your words, mrs gantry - "it'll all end in tears." yes.
though if you want my opinion, it was definitely news to him.
at the time of her murder, harriet dore was eight weeks pregnant.
it may seem macabre, but i always say, if you want a job doing...
and listen, i must tell you, miss ross, i'm such a devotee of your work.
no, just so we've got it right, father, order of events that day.
you were all sitting there at the table, you heard all these noises, and then you actually saw her pushed out of the window?
and the strangest request, he asked if he might come to the church and undergo confession.
at which point, i'm afraid i had to leave, when the cat came in.
we've heard that the shred of cloth that was in her hand, it has now been confirmed, was torn from the accused's dress.
and before she died, mr alberic, can you tell us as precisely as your memory will allow, what were her last words?
and you wouldn't say the novels of hugo dore were always noted for their original plotlines.
all right, so he's found out his wife's been playing around.
decides to bump her off, but make it look like the work of his amorous young housekeeper.
he knows she still has nightmares about some weird experience that happened 20 years ago, so he uses that back story about our victorian friend to try and spook her into believing she actually did it.
and at this stage, of course, the purest hypothesis, but it would certainly all slot together very neatly.
the scream in the garden, the light bulb that blew in her room that night and... ..hcn.
that he was a close friend of the scientist, sir francis galton, who, among his many varied achievements, is widely credited as the inventor of the dog whistle.
120 years ago, thereabouts, a previous housekeeper at green lanterns famously put a curse on her employer that caused him to die, apparently without any physical explanation.
to an impressionable mind, the idea of that malign presence still in the house, somehow controlling her actions, was fairly terrifying, and may have had a direct bearing on the run-up to harriet dore's death.
the mechanics of that first crime, from all the evidence, were pretty daunting.
a healthy man with a healthy heart, in the middle of a lawn, suddenly keels over and dies.
no marks or wounds were detected, no food or drink that could have been poisoned, there was no possible trigger that could have caused his death at exactly 3.15, the moment it was predicted, just a high-pitched, blood-curdling scream that came from the bushes.
but where do we think the inspiration for something like that would come from?
a prototype ultrasonic whistle, known to be in northcote's possession at the time.
too weak, certainly, to crack a watch at that distance, but used on a custom-made replica light bulb, just outside a bedroom door...
lights are geared to go off all over the house and, in the dark, the picture's easily switched back.
mr dore, as a calculated ploy to frame the accused, has deliberately orchestrated all the events you describe, and then pushed his own wife out of the window.
how exactly, when he was sitting at a table on the far side of the garden with two independent witnesses?
it wouldn't be the first case of this kind where an accomplice was involved.
an accomplice who appears to have borne a miraculous resemblance to miss somerton, according to the deceased.
from her position in the room, the way the light was coming in through that other window, she'd have been virtually in silhouette.
bearing in mind all the death threats, the victim's already primed for her to try something.
and the more you turn it all over, the more you realise that hugo dore was a whole lot smarter than we gave him credit for.
to kill someone in such a way... that the victim is going to accuse the wrong person seconds before they die, it's bordering on psychopathic genius.
cos i know what it is to believe in someone that much, to build your whole future on someone, because it's something you know and feel, deep down, is right, with every instinct you ever trusted.
and, you know, that is absolutely the way, the true and perfect way, to get shat upon from a great height.
so, which of the many drawing boards do you want to go back to?
i suppose it's a lot to hope for, it's suddenly going to just fall into place.
it's only when you're actually here, you can see it - the solution to the whole trick.
and it pretty much explains, i think, who was washing their hands in that bathroom.
it's only since you got back, something, or someone, persuaded you it was time to settle that score.
it's not very fashionable, but... sometimes i think you have to meet brutality with brutality.
cos the way you did it was straight off a film set, wasn't it?
only instead of using a stunt performer, who might just pass muster in the wide shot, you did something quite barbaric.
and as we heard the other week, no-one round here knows harriet dore from a bar of soap.
when emily took cover in that house, she couldn't have known how close she was to the truth.
a hotel room somewhere, sitting it out till a few months' time, you'd be back together, overseas.
that wooden pipe, it turned out, wasn't that much of a clue in the scheme of things.
that information was sacred, and not for me to pass on.
but when i spotted you out there last night, in the garden, it did occur to me.
a couple of urgent text messages would bring them and us together.
but as you say, it does all feel rather final somehow.
believe it or not, we don't need to be patronised, we can think for ourselves.
and what i know about this guy is that he's real, he's sincere, and he's got it here.
and we had a fine and fertile discussion, did we not, on the future course of the act.
you could say my john dore was drizzled with creative juices.
but listen, you know what i've been thinking, that police shrink she said about might've been onto something, when she talked about blocking out things that have happened?
it wouldn't surprise me if she had absolutely no recollection of that stuff with his brother.
like she'd airbrushed it all out of her head, the court case, everything.
you read about all that bollocks, like a kind of denial.
"the next she was to leave this world, extinguished without trace.
"try looking as i might throughout the chamber's every crack and crevice,
well, that's always been the challenge, but i'm afraid no one ever got rich from me yet.
yeah, except this is real "the pit and the pendulum" time, right?
someone from a right-wing, fundamentalist church who, i'm afraid, was a lot more dangerous than we gave him credit for.
when he met her for that meal that night, she found out... just how much he knew.
god will judge you for your deed, i can promise you, and he will not be lenient.
but alan was with us all day at the theatre when it happened.
or how he got out of an underground chamber which you've examined yourself - and the passageway leading up to it - and found to be solid stone.
i freely admit, mr creek, that he's probably taken those secrets to the grave.
whether it would profit me to try and disinter them is doubtful.
but i'm sure this will be the subject of much lively debate amongst your fellow conjurers for years to come.
what actually happens in front of the camera is of little consequence.
by reconfiguring, reinflecting the words and pictures, we create our own unique form of illusion, every bit as false, every bit as compelling as your own.
the secret to how it worked, i imagine, would be well-documented in the castle archives.
not too hard to ferret out for a new owner with more than a passing interest in gothic folklore.
the operation has a symmetrical elegance that you of all people would admire.
the chains that control the drawbridge control also a false ceiling to the cell.
in the real ceiling, the only way they could get the chains in and out.
so they cooked up that stuff about a flue for the smoke.
you will just say i dream these things, but trust me, i do not...
swift re-edit after dinner, it's all ready to be played back to me later on, to seal the idea that he escaped.
so his guard would be down when you went for the big one.
but then you knew he'd never refused a professional challenge in his life.
in the early hours, kalanak and his car are taken to the bridge.
a taller driver, i might've had a flash of what was really going on.
he got what he deserved, but did you want to be part of it?
and that whole thing with her diary, you knew what was in it, you just didn't want us to find it till you were ready.
so you hung on to that laptop, invented a not-very-baffling password, so his motive would come out just too late for him to be arrested.
by the time the police realise he's guilty, he's jumped off a bridge.
and when you're wondering where you go from here, remember, the guilty aren't always those that kill.
understand that, and you'll understand why alan kalanak's soul rightly belongs in hell.
but that number he gave me, they'd never even heard of anyone called ver...
i've got a lot to offer, carla... if you'll let me be part of your life.
she didn't use one, at least not for the stuff we've read so far.
but what if there were other things, even more personal and sensitive, that she found some way of hiding from us?
what appears to be the final missing piece of the jigsaw.
and when you think of it, the only person who could possibly have made it look like a bullet passed through the window.
that whole thing about the distance the gun was fired from was never important.
if we must look for evidence, let's get on with it.
'cause when she said you were the most special person in the world, there was more truth to that than you could ever know.
we should've got an inkling from all that time she took off in the '70s.
we know because she left a fairly detailed confessional account behind.
some of it so personal, it's only this second come to light.
and now... if you're wondering whatever became of him this is what became of him.
because i was mad enough to engage him on this picture.
when security arrived, he had his head up her shirt, trying to bite the thing off.
ladies, if you'll just hold that thought while i make a record of your details.
i'm also deeply insecure, emotionally vulnerable and prone to irrational outbursts.
now you know the whole picture, it's up to you whether you want to see me again or not.
12 months after it happened, shock and bewilderment continue to surround the strange events that occurred in a remote old country house last summer, where a man is said to have literally vanished into thin air.
well-known within the international church of spiritualism was the revered medium and psychic mr jacques futrelle, who, on june 21st last year, elected to stage an unusual experiment at his home in berkshire, the bizarre and sprawling mansion known as metropolis.
as the night wore on, discussion turned to a curious rumour concerning an old attic room at the top of the house, where a madman had been kept under lock and key by his titled relatives.
and where, it was said, the lunatic's ghost still stalked his former prison, feeding on the souls of non-believers.
the challenge thrown down by their host was for the arch-sceptic
mencken, if he dared, to spend a night alone in the room.
and so, at ten minutes to midnight, after careful inspection by independent witnesses, the door was closed, and secured with four heavy-duty padlocks supplied by the guests.
to ensure no single person could assist in his escape, each retained their key as, separately, they retired for the night.
what they found the next day sent a thrill of terror through them all.
though the door and the locks had clearly not been tampered with, and there was no other conceivable way out of the room,
storms out the room with all her clothes, chucks them on the front lawn.
five minutes later, this woman's coming down the stairs, half naked, but amazingly, her foot has now completely healed up!
what she hadn't considered, he'd actually got two women in that bed, and the other one'd done a runner out the back!
so now you get reports sent to you, from all over the world.
ok, you've selected a card in your mind only, and written it down.
i want you now to fold the piece of paper in half please.
then half again, and hold it high up in the air.
i'm now assimilating that card, removing it from the piece of paper.
what are you saying, just because some smart-arse viewer in basildon's managed to work out how the...
what's happening now, are we doing a tribute to roy orbison?
you became just like this vegetable, completely lost the power of speech, and bladder function.
by the end they were feeding you through a tube, it was horrible.
dates back to when constance was a little girl, in the '30s.
her father was like this world famous medium, could supposedly communicate with the dead.
it was just after he bought this place, am i right?
they discovered this room, like an attic, right at the very top of the house.
no-one who's spent the night there has ever survived to tell us.
something in that room has caused seven human beings to disappear, without a trace, as if they never physically existed.
i tell you, if my boss-man finds out i've been giving you the guided tour...
there's still time to change your mind cos this is not a place you want to go after dark.
which means they're looking for a lot of zeros, but i said i'd think it over.
oh, what i wouldn't give, jonathan, for a piece of that action.
cos you know, obviously, i never took it seriously...all that stuff.
it's just, when she started coming on to me, it was like...
cos if it hadn't been for those two mad women, completely mucking up my life... the lovely carla, and her predecessor who's thankfully pissed off to the states...
so, i think the chance of me getting dragged into all that caper again is...
one year later, no rational explanation has been advanced for what happened that night.
nor, can it be assumed, will a solution ever be found to this dark, impenetrable mystery.
and once again, my sincere apologies for that little mix-up yesterday.
i managed to find his number, of course, in the end.
i asked this bloke if his name was creek, he said yes.
he'd say anything for six pints of ruddles and a shepherds pie!
the door, as you'll discover, has not been secretly hinged on the other side.
nor is there an invisible panel that can be opened halfway along.
i was brought up by an aunt in westphalia, and the house was rented out.
and over the next 40 years, the story of what happened here prompted one or two others... with that daredevil mentality i cannot comprehend.
foolishly, you just ignore these things, and hope they'll go away, but...
what form of magic, d'you think, jonathan, are we looking at here?
and where do you stand, mr gessler, on the nightmare room?
you're not buying into all this back story about a predatory demon devouring the unwary?
i only know i felt a lot more comfortable when that part of the house was off-limits.
you think i haven't tried to pick that room apart a hundred times to see what makes it tick?
# would i like go with you and see a movie
# first i say, "no ,i've got some plans for tonight."
delia gunning, our local newspaper editor, and ellen ashley-adams, who publishes the parish magazine.
between them they're more than capable of putting the frighteners on half the home counties.
# if you decide someday to stop this little game that you are playing
# i'm gonna tell you all the things my heart's been a-dying to be saying
i dunno, you hear people talk about, "taking their secrets to the grave".
i just get an idea sometimes, i have to run with it.
i don't know where i'd be today without knowing what a hypotenuse was.
i operate on instinct and adrenaline and i don't have a lot of time for intellectual snobbery, so...oh...
grudgingly, though, i suppose you're right, this is gonna be a complete dead end.
or, on the contrary, does it advance our thinking, in one very key respect?
written in the first person, so we can assume it was his choice of inscription.
how tempting is it, to think that a man with a fondness for latin, when scribbling a note to himself on that reichstag cutting,
and very probably suggests something far more sinister, and far more impenetrable.
somehow or other, futrelle rigged up that room, to dispose of a man he'd loathed and detested.
last month's marie claire, he scored a big fat 89%, didn't he?
"cancel all other wedding plans, you have found the love of your life!"
to do everything that's asked of us here, by these people, by our consciences.
a human being's life is not ours to put a price on.
one thing that's always lodged in my mind... and you wonder, i suppose, eventually, whether you just imagined it, but...
as they were all standing there, chattering away, trying to make sense of it all,
"how the hell did i get to this point in my life?"
standing here, on a ransom drop, waiting for the woman i love to be bundled into a ditch - if we're lucky.
when i first met her, she was performing a trapeze act in prague quite brilliantly.
i mean, truly astonishing, the skeletal dexterity, what she could do with her body.
i hope you're not gonna just spend tonight fretting about all this other stuff?
she wants to run around solving murders and kidnappings to stick on her silly website...
and will you not keep tidying up after me all the while?
god, i read an article the other day, said that's a classic sign of being spiritually repressed.
it's like, when the elasticity or something, it just suddenly goes in the implant and it all just collapses.
means i'll have to go back and see that bloody surgeon again in the morning.
oh...sorry, i thought we were talking about max headroom there, on the phone.
you ever actually seen him in the flesh, that bloke, or...
no, it's just...when that other one hit the window, the first day we were up there, a few minutes later i saw it, or i thought i did, sticking out the roof.
exactly where you'd expect to find it, just below the attic.
which pretty much killed off a little hypothesis i had before i had a chance to get going.
that the room we'd been standing in was not the same one as we're looking at now, on top of the house.
but then, what you said yesterday, obviously opened the whole thing up again.
that bird could've been up there for days, it didn't prove anything.
which meant that maybe it wasn't such a mad idea after all.
bearing in mind the size of the place, and the fact you're going up a spiral staircase, by the time you get to the top you could be almost anywhere.
we just take it as read that it's an attic because of the small pitched ceiling but...
..that room could easily be on another level with a small angled ceiling or a "hypotenuse"
certainly not that bedroom she slept in i looked round the other day.
oh, that's what i came down here for... industrial-strength pain killers for her back.
you feel the hoover dam was an engineering breeze next to that one, but, as you know well enough, that's the very reason these things work.
there's a level of artifice that common sense just won't tolerate.
something so enduring and elaborate, suddenly demonic possession sounds a lot more plausible.
that gooey "ectoplasm", it's fairly safe to say, was pre-set, to drip all over mencken as he lay in the bed that night.
just to make doubly sure he'll want to freshen up in the morning.
the fact that it's now harbouring dead insects may well have had a similar effect on your friend.
yes, well, we see the light now, at least, on so many things this morning.
that strange affair in the warehouse, which i'm sure was an honest mistake at the time.
also, just here, our local daily newspaper, published only this morning.
our two young tourists apparently recognised her from all the news coverage and rang up the police straight away.
because therein lies the perfect, cryptic clue, which if you cast your mind back, through everything we've seen and heard, these last few weeks, points us in a very clear direction.
towards the one person here capable of pulling something like this off.
absolutely, but it might make sense to get down the local nick asap.
assuming our mr gessler will shortly be released without charge, and who knows, we might be able to put this whole thing to bed.
lance gessler murdered elodie that night, as he'd always planned to, after god knows what taunting and suffering had gone on, since he staged that phoney kidnap.
as tempting as our little thought was, about the emergency tracheotomy, not sure it ever really had legs.
somewhere, you imagine, behind that facade of charm, was a gene that drove him, like his grandfather, to crush all opposition, with ruthless ingenuity, and with a callous disregard for anyone else he brought in to help.
someone who might come along and pick up that money, in the road.
and someone who, somehow, managed to rig up a video, that appeared to contradict the evidence of three independent witnesses.
of course, he never expected to be caught in the act like that.
that footage was always a part of a carefully planned insurance policy.
a kidnap victim's caught on camera, taking a quiet stroll in the park?
even if she never turns up again, it'd be hard to put a murder case together.
maybe we'd all warm to the idea that she'd faked it with glenn, so the two of them could do a runner together.
but how do we explain that newspaper that was conveniently being read in the background?
a daily paper, with up to the minute news, that couldn't even have existed until first thing this morning.
a council meeting being interrupted by a swarm of bees wasn't too tricky to engineer...
..and not too tricky, once you think back, to trace the culprit.
local side's a dead cert to get knocked out of a cup tie, but you'd shoot an alternative, probably, as a cutaway, just in case.
thing, i suppose, that sealed it, was that headline on page three.
yes, just waiting for our friends to arrive, there'll be six of us in all.
if you'd like to take a seat over there, please, thank you.
given the fact that she's already fooled you once adam, you don't think it's possible that miss candy mountains might actually have been selling you one great big dummy all along just to get you on board?
it wouldn't take a lot of research, would it, into your recent output to have tumbled to the magic properties of vanishing ink?
cos, i mean, i wasn't looking for it, i swear but...
according to this month's vogue, you just have to act on impulse sometimes.
just make that phone call, hop on a plane, whatever it takes, and just seize the moment, or it's gone forever.
it's just, the more i kept thinking about him after that day in the theatre, i don't know what it was.
it just needs a bit of a sweep each morning to clear away any debris.
right.and a good, thorough scrub-down three times a week with a fungicidal agent.very good.
well, the trick, of course, is to fool the reader into trusting all the wrong people.
and then, in the most apparently innocent and everyday details, slowly sow the seeds of terror.
oh, well, you see, the folly of unrequited lust has more than once brought tragedy upon this house.
according to the story, in the late 1880s, a young egyptian woman of striking beauty came to work here as a housekeeper.
until finally, when his passion for her cooled, a strange demonic force is said to have transformed her from seductress to sorceress.
and she put a curse on her former lover, predicting the exact date and time of day that he would meet a dreadful, agonising death.
but the strange thing was, no creature or living being had come within 20 yards of him when it happened.
nor could any other method or means of his murder be found.
not a mark or injury anywhere on his body, or any suggestion or possibility he'd taken poison.
so her act of vengeance, through whatever supernatural agency, forever went unpunished.
if you believe in the power of a restless spirit to take control of a person's soul.
ok, so we come in off the lighting change with a whip-spot to find the table.
"the egregious xenophobe was on more odious form as we travelled to a village on the eritrean border,
"where he was heard to say, 'let's hope we don't all get eaten alive',
the slight reddening of your fingertips is characteristic of someone who's recently been handling hot plates.
the chafing on your knees almost certainly the result of cleaning floors.
have you any idea of the immense physical precision required here?
it takes years of training to perfect the complex curvature of the joints.
yeah, forgive me if i don't rush out and buy your latest manual on gender politics any time soon.
in the same series, i think wasn't it, as "dot cotton on super-string theory"?
and the two of us were out in the country, one day, middle of nowhere, and there was this cottage, in a field, that was there one minute, and then - so bizarre - just completely vanished into thin air.
and when i went over to look around, there was this horrible old man slithering about on the ground.
the only thing, i've had an idea how we can make it look better when i go up the rope.
cos i just worry they can tell i'm on a wire.
but how about if i climb up the rope for real, if you put enough tension in it, and then i could just secretly hook the harness through when i get to the top, just before the flash.
cos when we did gym at school, i was actually pretty damned nif...
it's just i had this amazing last-minute thing come up and i had to dash off again, after you'd come in specially.
'it was a bit of an odd night in the end...'
my trouble, i'm too good-natured for my own good.is that right?
though i don't suppose emily'd have a problem if i brought in an office junior as a sounding board.
what if i was, i don't know, like a little imp or something, all in red.
and he could be dressed as maybe a wizard or something, like in that mickey mouse film.
what on earth possessed him to record it in his dressing room?
..and do what i love doing most of all, entertaining people of all races and creeds, to register a big, heartfelt apology for what i now realise was a stupid and unguarded remark on my recent trip for magic relief.
insecurities can play havoc with your mental health, as i unfortunately managed to demonstrate, not very thoughtfully, the other night.
what he's trying to say is he's such an anally fixated big-head, he thought the only reason you wanted him was for his world-famous powers of deduction.
you know, the mystery of the vanishing cottage may be the least challenging of this whole puzzle.
and when you stop and think about it, the man in the grass would be part of the only explanation that could possibly fit.
my brother and i, well, it seems like ancient history now.
till i took off overseas, earned a crust or two, and then a couple of years ago, fresh marriage, fresh start, something seemed to just beckon me back.
the cause of his death never resolved from that day to this.
unsurprisingly, this egyptian femme fatale character was not slow, after that, to exploit her celebrity status.
i've ransacked her personal account of those years for some sort of clue, how she did it, but...
em, yes, riveting as all this is, of course, to students of ancient history, there's a small matter of unexplained death threats which i don't know if anyone's taking very seriously, but...
or a part of the river thames in oxfordshire depending on your preference.
picked up some interesting pieces then, mr dore, on your travels.
look, i'm going to have to love you and leave you for now.
one or two calls to make, so hopefully catch up with you later.
or four if we count the spirit of our victorian witch, whatever she was, who appears able to re-materialise in a pile of logs.
ah, now, i've got a pretty good idea how that was done.
now, you'll correct me if i'm wrong here, i've no doubt, but was there not a very old magic trick once where you had this big sheet of glass on the stage, tipped over at an angle, and then
some bod in the orchestra pit, who'd be reflected upwards, to look all kind of eerie and translucent.
i mean, she comes in here every day, at six, i think it is, so it's not like we'll be stuck down here forever.
just the 5½ hours then, imprisoned in an airless dungeon beneath half a hundredweight of tree stumps(?
well, so we could check out that theory, see if there was a sheet of glass that they...
fortunately, i like nothing better when trapped in a coal-hole, than to curl up with a good book.
what is very persuasive is his theory that she couldn't resist the idea of leaving some kind of cryptic hint behind, somewhere in the book, about how she pulled it off.
it may be nothing, but if you look at that dedication she's put in the front...
that cottage you saw and then didn't see, we've had a thought.
never mind how unlikely the thought, just run with the sheer, cold analysis.
but what looks like a building, that can seem to disappear, that could have been placed in that field deliberately, in the middle of nowhere, for a purpose that's unlikely to occur to any of us.
these days, probably, no-one'd go to the trouble of building the facade of a fairytale cottage on location for a scene in a movie now long forgotten, pending the arrival of a film unit in a few days' time.
when you first spot it, during a lull in the wind, the illusion's complete.
a second later, our "night watchman" character, there to keep an eye on the site takes a nasty tumble.
we are all of us unique and blessed before god, and the tragedy of any loss touches us all.
but while harriet dore today is no longer flesh, her spirit, i know, walks among us still.
i doubt there's anyone round here would have known her from a bar of soap.
but how prophetic were your words, mrs gantry - "it'll all end in tears." yes.
though if you want my opinion, it was definitely news to him.
at the time of her murder, harriet dore was eight weeks pregnant.
it may seem macabre, but i always say, if you want a job doing...
and listen, i must tell you, miss ross, i'm such a devotee of your work.
and if you're looking for a weapon that could kill a man in the middle of a lawn without being seen or heard, how about that blowpipe we saw in his study?
what's-her-face screams, so he turns his head, and gets it in the neck from the wife.
it was an odd meeting - he seemed to be burdened with the issue of man's accountability for his sins.
and the strangest request, he asked if he might come to the church and undergo confession.
but you heard sounds of a violent struggle going on, and your wife screaming at someone.
yes.we've heard that the shred of cloth that was in her hand, it has now been confirmed, was torn from the accused's dress.
i'd be a lot closer to cracking this thing if i knew what it was i was trying to crack.
obviously, a major fit-up, but i don't fancy her chances with that jury.
all right, so he's found out his wife's been playing around.
decides to bump her off, but make it look like the work of his amorous young housekeeper.
and at this stage, of course, the purest hypothesis, but it would certainly all slot together very neatly.
the scream in the garden, the light bulb that blew in her room that night and... ..hcn.
i didn't have any choice, did i, with the doors all locked.
just pull.i'm going to have to put it on its side.
120 years ago, thereabouts, a previous housekeeper at green lanterns famously put a curse on her employer that caused him to die, apparently without any physical explanation.
to an impressionable mind, the idea of that malign presence still in the house, somehow controlling her actions, was fairly terrifying, and may have had a direct bearing on the run-up to harriet dore's death.
the mechanics of that first crime, from all the evidence, were pretty daunting.
a healthy man with a healthy heart, in the middle of a lawn, suddenly keels over and dies.
unless that scream was not a reaction... ..but the instrument of murder itself.
a scream that set in motion something so lethal that it could kill within seconds, and then disappear, quite literally, into thin air.
fair to say you'd need specialist skills to put something like that together, but i think we can assume that she had the contacts, and that her powers of persuasion were well up to it.
but where do we think the inspiration for something like that would come from?
a prototype ultrasonic whistle, known to be in northcote's possession at the time.
too weak, certainly, to crack a watch at that distance, but used on a custom-made replica light bulb, just outside a bedroom door...
so let me just see if i have this correct, mr creek.
mr dore, as a calculated ploy to frame the accused, has deliberately orchestrated all the events you describe, and then pushed his own wife out of the window.
how exactly, when he was sitting at a table on the far side of the garden with two independent witnesses?
it wouldn't be the first case of this kind where an accomplice was involved.
an accomplice who appears to have borne a miraculous resemblance to miss somerton, according to the deceased.
from her position in the room, the way the light was coming in through that other window, she'd have been virtually in silhouette.
all that guff i cobbled together about an accomplice in silhouette and "seeing what she expected to see", doesn't get near to explaining what happened that day.
and the more you turn it all over, the more you realise that hugo dore was a whole lot smarter than we gave him credit for.
to kill someone in such a way... that the victim is going to accuse the wrong person seconds before they die, it's bordering on psychopathic genius.
of course, there is one other possibility, which we both know is staring us in the face.
i suppose it's a lot to hope for, it's suddenly going to just fall into place.
except somewhere here is the key to how it was all worked.
it's only when you're actually here, you can see it - the solution to the whole trick.
and it pretty much explains, i think, who was washing their hands in that bathroom.
it's only since you got back, something, or someone, persuaded you it was time to settle that score.
it's not very fashionable, but... sometimes i think you have to meet brutality with brutality.
cos the way you did it was straight off a film set, wasn't it?
only instead of using a stunt performer, who might just pass muster in the wide shot, you did something quite barbaric.
and as we heard the other week, no-one round here knows harriet dore from a bar of soap.
when emily took cover in that house, she couldn't have known how close she was to the truth.
a hotel room somewhere, sitting it out till a few months' time, you'd be back together, overseas.
that wooden pipe, it turned out, wasn't that much of a clue in the scheme of things.
that information was sacred, and not for me to pass on.
but when i spotted you out there last night, in the garden, it did occur to me.
a couple of urgent text messages would bring them and us together.
but as you say, it does all feel rather final somehow.
'we are all of us unique 'and blessed before god and the tragedy of any loss touches us all.
'but while i am, today, no longer flesh, my spirit, i know, 'walks among you still.'
now i know i speak for most people here when i say i'm sick and tired of being lectured to by white middle class intellectuals, about what i am and what i'm not meant to be offended by.
believe it or not, we don't need to be patronised, we can think for ourselves.
and what i know about this guy is that he's real, he's sincere, and he's got it here.
and we're proud to have him on the roll call tonight, working for the race against racism, would you please give it up for mr adam klaus.
it wouldn't surprise me if she had absolutely no recollection of that stuff with his brother.
like she'd airbrushed it all out of her head, the court case, everything.
if he could just pop his head round the door occasionally, to see how i'm getting on.
like i said, when you buy into that kind of idiosyncratic genius, the hypochondria comes with the territory.
raymond, you couldn't be an angel and get me some more water?
i mean, with the best will in the world, jodee, she's not george clooney.
well, let me remind you, mr creek, that alan kalanak is currently the 17th-highest-paid entertainer in america.
for the derisory sum you're paying, you're lucky to get him at all.
whatever it is that's been eating away at you ever since we started this shoot.
every day, i see it in your eyes, a kind of haunted melancholy that won't let go.
a double-jointed pigeon trained to open a hidden compartment with its beak.
you said "no thanks", but you recognised a major new talent when it came along.
i know what you're going through, what you must think of me, but... you have to believe me, what you wanted, the two of us, wasn't possible.
god forgive me if i ever let you believe that we could...
you gave me self-belief and the courage to quit my job and shove one big finger up at the world.
and even when my wife was like, "this is killing our marriage.
this is kenny, who'll be joining us as an associate creative consultant.
if you'd ease him in gently, make him feel at home,
not only have you screwed up his life, reduced him to the level of a cave-dweller,
i've got to pretend to work with him to repair the damage!
maybe you'd like to draw up some kind of a discussion document, kenny, so we can kick it around.
we've a special guest artist arriving, we'll be working through his act all morning, so...
i guess what i saw in her eyes that night was... mortal terror.
and now you just think, "dear merciful jesus, shouldn't i have done something?"
for some reason, i can't imagine why, he wanted me to pick your brains.
like i've got nothing better to do than come here to this... peculiar place.
i don't suppose you possess such a thing as a tow...
of course, the police are running around like headless chickens trying to make sense of it.
"herman grole, surrealist auteur or candidate for care in the community?"
do you realise what the catering budget on a film like this could do for the horn of africa?
you haven't listened to a word i've said, have you, since i got here?
if you'd bothered to watch the news, you'd know what i'm talking about.
yet the window was completely intact and clearly hadn't been opened.
not only was it protected on the inside by another glass panel bolted to the wall, there wasn't any water on the frame, despite the fact that it was bucketing down with rain at the... time.
remember, these are highly skilled hollywood actors who can make us believe anything they want.
bronson peterman, her co-star, by all accounts was driving her completely batty.
there are too many noughts riding on this picture for me to abort.
plus, we have to be out of this house by next week.
and if you're thinking of checking out the study, be sure to clear it with inspector bullstrode.
i'll have a shufti around the window, you see what you can get out of mr superhunk.
the thing is, they were all on the wrong side of the door when it happened.
everyone we've been talking to has to be in the clear.
i was just confirming they're not pictures his fans would want to see posted on the net.
vivian and i shared a long-standing passion for the verse of edgar allan poe.
somebody has done a terrible thing to somebody we all cared for, but we have to believe that fate is ultimately just, and, one day, the guilty will pay for their crimes.
i'm going to ask alan now, as a man with deep convictions in the lutheran faith, to say a few words of grace.
ok, the frame was fixed solid, but what if the glass slides up and down into some kind of cavity in the ceiling?
then all the killer has to do is just wedge the thing open while he takes aim...
in the mid-1500s, during the counter-reformation, the catholic queen mary began a reign of terror to realign the church with rome.
to make an example of certain dissenters, she had them brought here to a dungeon deep beneath the castle, where, it is said, any protestant would be delivered straight to hell.
according to the story... the victims were staked out on the floor of a sheer stone well... and the door above them locked and bolted.
when it was opened again, just a few minutes later, nothing remained of the body except a few small piles of ash... leading to the belief that the well was some kind of passageway to the fires of damnation.
this is, supposedly, a contemporary account by a protestant bishop who lost his own wife down there.
alan, your eyes are, i think, a little better than mine.
"the next she was to leave this world, extinguished without trace.
"try looking as i might throughout the chamber's every crack and crevice,
i've been down here more times than is good for me but right up these walls, all the way to the top, i've never found so much as a loose brick or an opening of any kind.
except for that one small hole up there, which looks as if it was i don't know, maybe a flue or something for the smoke.
but if you want to lock someone away to rot, this is the place.
- no one'd get out of here in a million years.
you'll pay a million dollars in cash to the first person who comes up with a room or a device or contraption he can't get out of.
well, that's always been the challenge, but i'm afraid no one ever got rich from me yet.
yeah, except this is real "the pit and the pendulum" time, right?
and i tell you, once i get into fantasy role-play, i show no mercy.
we're standing directly over the top of the dungeon, the location of which you've managed to calculate by memorising exactly how far we walked, and in which direction, to get down there last night.
32 paces from the foot of the steps, then another 67 at 90 degrees to the left, which should put the epicentre... just here.
i mean, i have absolutely no idea how he got out of there, short of a secret passageway none of us knew of.
the people who built this place had to be a lot cleverer than that.
since it'd be pointless to store a password next to the file it's meant to protect.
right, so i figure obviously it's not the password, it's a reminder of the password.
someone from a right-wing, fundamentalist church who, i'm afraid, was a lot more dangerous than we gave him credit for.
when he met her for that meal that night, she found out... just how much he knew.
god will judge you for your deed, i can promise you, and he will not be lenient.
but alan was with us all day at the theatre when it happened.
or how he got out of an underground chamber which you've examined yourself - and the passageway leading up to it - and found to be solid stone.
i freely admit, mr creek, that he's probably taken those secrets to the grave.
whether it would profit me to try and disinter them is doubtful.
but i'm sure this will be the subject of much lively debate amongst your fellow conjurers for years to come.
what actually happens in front of the camera is of little consequence.
by reconfiguring, reinflecting the words and pictures, we create our own unique form of illusion, every bit as false, every bit as compelling as your own.
why do i get the feeling satan's chimney was never designed as a chimney?
maybe they used to pour some kind of acid down it.
the secret to how it worked, i imagine, would be well-documented in the castle archives.
not too hard to ferret out for a new owner with more than a passing interest in gothic folklore.
the operation has a symmetrical elegance that you of all people would admire.
the chains that control the drawbridge control also a false ceiling to the cell.
in the real ceiling, the only way they could get the chains in and out.
so they cooked up that stuff about a flue for the smoke.
a taller driver, i might've had a flash of what was really going on.
but maybe raymond wasn't the first choice to drive the car that night.
bottom line, you were in two minds about the whole operation.
he got what he deserved, but did you want to be part of it?
and that whole thing with her diary, you knew what was in it, you just didn't want us to find it till you were ready.
so you hung on to that laptop, invented a not-very-baffling password, so his motive would come out just too late for him to be arrested.
as for your baroque mind, to twig that whole contraption from an imaginary wasp...
the image was right there in front of me on that tray.
either he planted some kind of device, which we know was never found, or what if he set someone up to do it for him?
the look on her face when she was pointing at the window, it was almost...
what appears to be the final missing piece of the jigsaw.
and when you think of it, the only person who could possibly have made it look like a bullet passed through the window.
that whole thing about the distance the gun was fired from was never important.
if we must look for evidence, let's get on with it.
'cause when she said you were the most special person in the world, there was more truth to that than you could ever know.
we should've got an inkling from all that time she took off in the '70s.
we know because she left a fairly detailed confessional account behind.
some of it so personal, it's only this second come to light.
and now... if you're wondering whatever became of him this is what became of him.
because i was mad enough to engage him on this picture.
when security arrived, he had his head up her shirt, trying to bite the thing off.
ladies, if you'll just hold that thought while i make a record of your details.
i'm also deeply insecure, emotionally vulnerable and prone to irrational outbursts.
now you know the whole picture, it's up to you whether you want to see me again or not.
but then, you'll be quite handy with a needle yourself, jonathan.
you're not the first gynaecologist to use that spoon, but it's always an honour.
i didn't believe in souls, didn't believe in satan... until the next day.
i'd finally got round to having a go at this dead tree in the garden.
it was just old papers from the loft, letters and diaries of my mum's, stuff of my dad's - both deceased, but you know how you hang onto things.
- i hate to think what they'd have made of this.
i rang up the police, and they had him straight down there to identify the body.
it seems she'd been double-crossing this bloke she worked for, who's a bit of a psycho.
all this diabolism stuff is just to distract his wife, who takes that stuff seriously.
plus, it gives him an excuse to start enjoying himself again - the gambling and sleeping around.
it's what you said about being in a frank capra movie.
a little light came on suddenly, just for a second, then fizzled out again.
all i know is that something's happened that's turned my life around, and i don't knock it and i don't question it.
if you'll excuse me, i think that's my business adviser just arrived.
if i couldn't live with myself, how could i live with him?
god will forgive, i kept telling him, but you have to let go.
i said, "you'd have to be barmy. " she said, "if that's what he wants, he's welcome to it. "
she left half an hour ago, aiming to get there for three.
if mrs spearfish chooses to surrender her share for whatever reasons, that's her right.
the marriage having reached a point of irretrievable breakdown, they should do as they see fit.
cutting her off without a penny was never the object of the exercise.
the point was to take them to the wire and back.
you haven't just guessed that someone's about to dig up an old tree.
that points to some kind of surveillance, professional operators watching their every move.
the only clue was a red birthmark that appeared on his face for a second, then vanished.
of course, it wasn't a birthmark, and it wasn't blood, and it was a sleepless night before the answer popped into my head.
it was the red dot from a laser gun-sight, suggesting we were into a very clever piece of technology here.
a weapon that can target and disable without leaving a mark on someone's body.
suddenly, we're looking at a figure with so much clout, it's frightening.
and this afternoon in the courtroom, it all dropped into place.
that thing about not knowing what's lurking in your family tree...
of course, i'd already seen it... in this house yesterday morning.
alice's mother would have had every opportunity back in the '60s...
she's worked in service to dukes and lords and... goodness knows who else.
you know what my job, my life, would be worth if i told you that?
well, high enough for any tell-tale letters and diaries in that tea chest to be torched using some remote-controlled gizmo or other?
let's just say it was 30 years before the facts became clear.
the brief was to see that she and her family were well provided for, without alerting them to the truth.
the spectre of him gambling it all meant you had to move quick.
we could hardly leave her alone with a lunatic with a gun at large.
i'm no marriage counsellor, but something told me it was still solid enough... underneath.
they just needed shaking up a bit to knock some sense into them, basically.
all this because no one can tell her who her real father is.
they'd rather she lived the rest of her life believing this black magic baloney.
and after what has been a deeply distressing time for me, personally and professionally,
i thank god that once again good has triumphed over evil.
fortuitous how it's all panned out, although business affairs are a secondary consideration.
what is important is that i have emerged from this sordid affair without a stain...
one thing that's always lodged in my mind... and you wonder, i suppose, eventually, whether you just imagined it, but...
as they were all standing there, chattering away, trying to make sense of it all,
"how the hell did i get to this point in my life?"
standing here, on a ransom drop, waiting for the woman i love to be bundled into a ditch - if we're lucky.
when i first met her, she was performing a trapeze act in prague quite brilliantly.
i mean, truly astonishing, the skeletal dexterity, what she could do with her body.
i hope you're not gonna just spend tonight fretting about all this other stuff?
she wants to run around solving murders and kidnappings to stick on her silly website...
and will you not keep tidying up after me all the while?
god, i read an article the other day, said that's a classic sign of being spiritually repressed.
it's like, when the elasticity or something, it just suddenly goes in the implant and it all just collapses.
means i'll have to go back and see that bloody surgeon again in the morning.
oh...sorry, i thought we were talking about max headroom there, on the phone.
you ever actually seen him in the flesh, that bloke, or...
no, it's just...when that other one hit the window, the first day we were up there, a few minutes later i saw it, or i thought i did, sticking out the roof.
exactly where you'd expect to find it, just below the attic.
which pretty much killed off a little hypothesis i had before i had a chance to get going.
that the room we'd been standing in was not the same one as we're looking at now, on top of the house.
but then, what you said yesterday, obviously opened the whole thing up again.
that bird could've been up there for days, it didn't prove anything.
which meant that maybe it wasn't such a mad idea after all.
bearing in mind the size of the place, and the fact you're going up a spiral staircase, by the time you get to the top you could be almost anywhere.
we just take it as read that it's an attic because of the small pitched ceiling but...
..that room could easily be on another level with a small angled ceiling or a "hypotenuse"
certainly not that bedroom she slept in i looked round the other day.
oh, that's what i came down here for... industrial-strength pain killers for her back.
you feel the hoover dam was an engineering breeze next to that one, but, as you know well enough, that's the very reason these things work.
there's a level of artifice that common sense just won't tolerate.
something so enduring and elaborate, suddenly demonic possession sounds a lot more plausible.
that gooey "ectoplasm", it's fairly safe to say, was pre-set, to drip all over mencken as he lay in the bed that night.
just to make doubly sure he'll want to freshen up in the morning.
the fact that it's now harbouring dead insects may well have had a similar effect on your friend.
yes, well, we see the light now, at least, on so many things this morning.
that strange affair in the warehouse, which i'm sure was an honest mistake at the time.
also, just here, our local daily newspaper, published only this morning.
our two young tourists apparently recognised her from all the news coverage and rang up the police straight away.
because therein lies the perfect, cryptic clue, which if you cast your mind back, through everything we've seen and heard, these last few weeks, points us in a very clear direction.
towards the one person here capable of pulling something like this off.
absolutely, but it might make sense to get down the local nick asap.
assuming our mr gessler will shortly be released without charge, and who knows, we might be able to put this whole thing to bed.
lance gessler murdered elodie that night, as he'd always planned to, after god knows what taunting and suffering had gone on, since he staged that phoney kidnap.
as tempting as our little thought was, about the emergency tracheotomy, not sure it ever really had legs.
somewhere, you imagine, behind that facade of charm, was a gene that drove him, like his grandfather, to crush all opposition, with ruthless ingenuity, and with a callous disregard for anyone else he brought in to help.
someone who might come along and pick up that money, in the road.
and someone who, somehow, managed to rig up a video, that appeared to contradict the evidence of three independent witnesses.
of course, he never expected to be caught in the act like that.
that footage was always a part of a carefully planned insurance policy.
a kidnap victim's caught on camera, taking a quiet stroll in the park?
even if she never turns up again, it'd be hard to put a murder case together.
maybe we'd all warm to the idea that she'd faked it with glenn, so the two of them could do a runner together.
but how do we explain that newspaper that was conveniently being read in the background?
a daily paper, with up to the minute news, that couldn't even have existed until first thing this morning.
a council meeting being interrupted by a swarm of bees wasn't too tricky to engineer...
..and not too tricky, once you think back, to trace the culprit.
local side's a dead cert to get knocked out of a cup tie, but you'd shoot an alternative, probably, as a cutaway, just in case.
thing, i suppose, that sealed it, was that headline on page three.
yes, just waiting for our friends to arrive, there'll be six of us in all.
if you'd like to take a seat over there, please, thank you.
given the fact that she's already fooled you once adam, you don't think it's possible that miss candy mountains might actually have been selling you one great big dummy all along just to get you on board?
it wouldn't take a lot of research, would it, into your recent output to have tumbled to the magic properties of vanishing ink?
cos, i mean, i wasn't looking for it, i swear but...
according to this month's vogue, you just have to act on impulse sometimes.
just make that phone call, hop on a plane, whatever it takes, and just seize the moment, or it's gone forever.
it's just, the more i kept thinking about him after that day in the theatre, i don't know what it was.
in this room you will read, reflect on your sins, and learn penitence through the power of prayer.
and you will truly see god, and learn to love him through the blessed saint barnabas, and repent the error of your heathen ways.
'there's a lady in sweden, for example, who for 11 years 'now has been sending me videos of her husband's colonoscopies.
'and while it's true that to a specialist in rectal polyps 'his abdomen is positively stacked with treasures, what's curious 'is her passion for meticulously documenting their progress.
that prognosis, i'm told, is amazingly accurate, based on this new software that can sample the echocardiogram and then calculate the exact rate of ventricular atrophy.
as a tool for assessing life expectancy in terminal heart disease, it's one of the most exciting new clinical developments i can remember.
yes, going to be clearing a space soon for that bafta documentary award!
i tell you, 108 days with the most primitive people on earth - 109 if you count the baggage staff at jakarta - just so opens your eyes to life, survival, existence.
these girls who all woke up with, like, strange red rings on their head.
think one of them was actually found dead the next morning.
and he was so looking forward to catching up with you today.
but them's the breaks, i'm afraid, when you're running a global advertising agency.
it's just that, to say that to me, to even allude...
it's the first time ever he's tried to rattle me with subtext.
look, if all you've come here to do is smirk at the fact that i've finally managed to turn my life around, progress my career, do something a bit more grown-up and responsible and creatively challenging.
only i've got a very important presentation to weetabix in five minutes, so if you don't mind...
a dead man in a room, right, seen and photographed by witnesses, completely evaporates into thin air.
walls, floor, ceiling all rock solid, no way he could have got out through the window, or through the door, which was being watched the whole time, and yet when they went in...
there's a lot of mad talk in this village already about supernatural forces.
and now with this franklin tartikoff character just apparently turning into dust, like some kind of vampire...
a name that immediately sprang to mind, of course, when this little puzzle first presented itself.
he and i had the pleasure of working together once, on the curious matter of the limping man...
get me a cast, as quick as you like, and roll out operation dandini.
yeah, i think that's where dc o'brien would have been, sir, when he was checking out the windows.
'franklin tartikoff, whose dead body was discovered late last night 'by his adopted daughter fariba tartikoff, 'only to vanish, minutes later, right under everyone's nose.
'but then, hopes of a solution rose this morning with 'the arrival of the formidable investigator gideon pryke, 'who famously suffered near-fatal injuries five years ago 'while rescuing a child's puppy during the chinese embassy siege 'and whose unique ability...'
according to the statements, about 13 minutes before they broke down the door.
so i can take it we're not looking at any tomfoolery with floorboards, or hidden panels, or...
we'll give that daughter of his the benefit of the doubt for now, but only for now.
rest assured, someone around here knows a lot more than they're saying and by jingo, i'll have it out of them before we're done.
or it could be the most significant detail in the whole case.
i suppose the "gp" on that corrupted disc is unlikely to be our doctor friend.
one other point, mrs tartikoff, you may be able to help us with.
a text my sergeant found on your phone, dated january 3rd.
a rather queer business in which a 14-year-old girl was found dead in bed, with a red ring on her face.
no apparent explanation for what killed her, but the general consensus was "sheer terror."
more red rings were subsequently reported on several other girls, but they lived to tell the tale.
you can imagine the effect it had on us - young, impressionable schoolchildren.
they think there might be some kind of local secret society in the village.
this appeared 18 months ago, and i know plenty of people say it's still going on.
what, a few rolled-up trouser legs and the odd moose head?
i don't think we'll lose any sleep over this one, mrs tartikoff.
but rest assured, if i spot any dodgy handshakes in the village, i'll let you know.
yes, well, i need to be getting off now, to this seminar.
you know there's some interesting stuff here, about this place when you start looking for it.
it says here, another thing a lot of ex-pupils talked about was something called the "quiet room", which was like a room where the nuns would put unruly pupils with just some bread and water and a bible
"actually said they had seen god in the room, with several others
"claiming they had actually been touched by the blessed saint as they reached out to him."
question is why would you label a photo that was taken in that room upstairs "waxwood cove"?
jonathan, i've got a horrible feeling we're not alone in this place.
that's got to be worth more than "mmm" any day of the week!
i'd like to see you manage to work that one out.
the capital c threw up another possibility that would dovetail rather neatly with that photo taken upstairs.
waxwood cove quite obviously makes no sense as a place name.
but what if the end of that photo had been cut off to remove something, or someone else, from the picture and at the same time part of the writing went with it.
well it's...it's hardly a theory we can test at this stage, but how much more tenable is the idea of a waxwood coven and a group of mutinous catholic schoolgirls adopting the name of a witch from greek mythology -
so you think they might have had their own little secret society that had something to do with those rings and the girl that died?
whatever it was that happened that night, this suggests they knew it was coming.
so i guess we know now how those nuns made them all feel they'd been "touched by the lord".
it would appear someone round here's doing a rather naff job of trying to frighten us off.
not many of those on the electoral roll, but we have turned up one in south derbyshire, so anything exciting, i'll give you a bell.
so, there you go, that's us both booked in upstairs for later.
it's a little thing called "growth", you should try it some time.
course, he never said, did he, where those pictures were taken, but if we're talking fields and farms,
in which you were locked in a room with bread and water and a bible, and a portrait of st barnabas, and you had a vision of god?
along with a whole load of other pupils who were sent to the "quiet room".
not quite the miracle it seemed at the time, i would suggest.
but the reason you buried it, i'm guessing now, is because you couldn't face the idea of being judged... for a mortal sin, committed by you and your catholic school friends who belonged to this, whatever it was called, waxwood hall witches' coven.
those red rings that appeared on all the other girls' heads just had to be a smokescreen you deliberately repeated, to make other people think the first one was part of some bigger, supernatural mystery.
i can speculate, rosalind, till the cows come home, about what happened that day, "at midnight"...
even when she wrote to me, beth, and sent me the photo... ..how could i bear, even now, to look into those eyes?
how could i seek forgiveness when there was no one there?
i thought it might be a good idea to just pool our thoughts and see if we can't nudge this one, finally, into the back of the net.
sceptic, as i was, about all that secret society nonsense, it turns out to have been at the very heart of this illusion.
a fleeting image last night of a revolving pumpkin suddenly unlocked it for me.
what it was that had changed between these two pictures, before and after the body disappeared.
for all his credentials as this iconic polymath, there was a lighter side, wasn't there, to your father, that was all of a piece with his early work in tv and radio.
and yet another passion, that he took a mischievous delight in keeping secret.
'it would look like the flap had just slipped back again.
'she'd go off and ring the police 'and i'd have, maybe ten minutes to take it all apart.
'when she never moved from outside door, i had to improvise.'
'amazingly, i found a few minutes before the police arrived, 'to recover it all.'
the fact that that globe had revolved 180 degrees, of course, proved nothing.
but it was enough to trigger the only real insight that made any sense here, that all we actually need to think we've seen a body is the head.
maybe i just dared to hope somewhere in that night of hell, there was some... purpose.
that i could take her to a place where science would desert her.
before she left us, something deeper, more meaningful might find its way into her life.
of course we still don't know who, or what, made that statue come down.
what's known in the business, i think, as 'a smoking gun'.
or at least it would be... if any of it was real.
but how scary is it, that certain people in very high places appear to have somehow got wind of this footage, and took it completely at face value?
then everything we're told never happens in real life, tracking down every copy of the dvd, and neutralising anyone who might have known about it...
who else could've beaten me to that false lead in derbyshire?
they'll take the rap for all this today, but that's about all.
he's a 24-carat asshole and he'll gross this picture 200 million.
raymond, you couldn't be an angel and get me some more water?
a double-jointed pigeon trained to open a hidden compartment with its beak.
you said "no thanks", but you recognised a major new talent when it came along.
i know what you're going through, what you must think of me, but... you have to believe me, what you wanted, the two of us, wasn't possible.
god forgive me if i ever let you believe that we could...
you gave me self-belief and the courage to quit my job and shove one big finger up at the world.
and even when my wife was like, "this is killing our marriage.
this is kenny, who'll be joining us as an associate creative consultant.
if you'd ease him in gently, make him feel at home,
not only have you screwed up his life, reduced him to the level of a cave-dweller,
i've got to pretend to work with him to repair the damage!
maybe you'd like to draw up some kind of a discussion document, kenny, so we can kick it around.
we've a special guest artist arriving, we'll be working through his act all morning, so...
for some reason, i can't imagine why, he wanted me to pick your brains.
like i've got nothing better to do than come here to this... peculiar place.
i don't suppose you possess such a thing as a tow...
of course, the police are running around like headless chickens trying to make sense of it.
"herman grole, surrealist auteur or candidate for care in the community?"
do you realise what the catering budget on a film like this could do for the horn of africa?
you haven't listened to a word i've said, have you, since i got here?
if you'd bothered to watch the news, you'd know what i'm talking about.
yet the window was completely intact and clearly hadn't been opened.
not only was it protected on the inside by another glass panel bolted to the wall, there wasn't any water on the frame, despite the fact that it was bucketing down with rain at the... time.
remember, these are highly skilled hollywood actors who can make us believe anything they want.
bronson peterman, her co-star, by all accounts was driving her completely batty.
there are too many noughts riding on this picture for me to abort.
plus, we have to be out of this house by next week.
and if you're thinking of checking out the study, be sure to clear it with inspector bullstrode.
i'll have a shufti around the window, you see what you can get out of mr superhunk.
i hear you were right outside when it happened, so we must presume a silencer was used.
we were making a heck of a lot of noise and tom was going cuckoo with that axe.
maybe if you just leave that behind, i'll finish myself off.
"death awaits you at doomdorf castle." i'm telling you, i could feel his goosebumps.
the thing is, they were all on the wrong side of the door when it happened.
everyone we've been talking to has to be in the clear.
how bronson deals with the stresses of stardom is up to him.
i was just confirming they're not pictures his fans would want to see posted on the net.
vivian and i shared a long-standing passion for the verse of edgar allan poe.
today, as her soul is reclaimed by the country that gave her life, his lines have never seemed more eloquent.
somebody has done a terrible thing to somebody we all cared for, but we have to believe that fate is ultimately just, and, one day, the guilty will pay for their crimes.
i'm going to ask alan now, as a man with deep convictions in the lutheran faith, to say a few words of grace.
ok, the frame was fixed solid, but what if the glass slides up and down into some kind of cavity in the ceiling?
then all the killer has to do is just wedge the thing open while he takes aim...
in the mid-1500s, during the counter-reformation, the catholic queen mary began a reign of terror to realign the church with rome.
to make an example of certain dissenters, she had them brought here to a dungeon deep beneath the castle, where, it is said, any protestant would be delivered straight to hell.
according to the story... the victims were staked out on the floor of a sheer stone well... and the door above them locked and bolted.
when it was opened again, just a few minutes later, nothing remained of the body except a few small piles of ash... leading to the belief that the well was some kind of passageway to the fires of damnation.
this is, supposedly, a contemporary account by a protestant bishop who lost his own wife down there.
alan, your eyes are, i think, a little better than mine.
the one who looks unhappy to others may regard himself as being happy.
if a man's greedy and always complaining, despite being rich and living a life of ease, he's far worse off than me.
since our children left to begin their lives we're more dependent on each other.
if one of us should die first, the other must reconsider how to live.
there are a lot of people who are jealous of office love affairs.
there are a lot of people over 35 who haven't been able to get married.
i'm going to see for the first time things i couldn't see before.
i thought that the todai law faculty and the public prosecutor's office were really something.
i knew that when you came back you were actually running away.
as long as you know where you can always run to, that's fine.
if you want to say bad things about me, that's fine.
say them a million times if it makes you feel better.
if you really love him that much, then see him one more time!
it's better if you make sure of how each other feels.
even though he understands, it's still hard for him to accept that you're really going.
but things are the way they are, there's nothing that can be done.
i didn't really like the work, but i was very happy being with all of you.
it was an honor to have such a wonderful time in tokyo and with this company.
the next race is the one adult, one child combination, '2 person 3 legged' race.
in this race, the president will be participating with his son shinoyama kenji.
if you give up at 10, you'll be a loser for the rest of your life.
when there are people stronger than you, you have to think of a way to win!
thanks for your help in the 2 person 3 legged race yesterday.
you actually ran and lost the race, and still take all the credit!
if one isn't, then one will never know about life's possibilities.
i too, wonder if i have the right to decide a person's crimes every day.
do you want to see us in our uniforms too, like riko?
they said they wanted to see the uniforms; that's why i wore it.
if i don't, then i won't be able to go forward.

i was afraid when i heard you cut ties with a woman just to protect yourself.
i also thought that for you social standing was really important.
i told myself to stop thinking about you, but i couldn't help it.
i kept thinking about why you and sanae did those things.
i want you to stand in front of shibuya station and yell "i love riko!"
after that do a handstand in your underwear and walk from the park to parco.
the china office has invited me to work in shanghai as a translator.
i think it's a good idea to go overseas and start a new life.
it's written with the characters for sei (saint) and tan (birthday).
i'll be in shanghai at christmas so i'm saying it now.
it's been a long time since i've been to an amusement park.
when i was in high school there wasn't a big amusement park like this, so everyone went all the way to tokyo.

i was 17, working in the megamart part-time as a trolley-parker.
after a couple of months, i fell in love with cashier number four.
she was married to this bald bloke who served the fish, ten years older than her.
he was more interested in his amateur dramatics group than her.
one evening, we snuck into the stock room and started making love on a box of tinned asparagus.
after a few minutes - about halfway through, i was 17 - she said, "there's someone at the door!"
he asked what the hell she was doing lying on a box of tinned veg with no kit on.
she said she was trying to get an all-over tan from the light bulb.
i promised him anything, said i'd never see her again, just let me out!
in the end, he relented, and i heard the box being opened.

i stepped out... bollock naked... right in the middle of an amateur production of "the importance of being earnest".

but then i lost my crew, my ship and i ended up here with a fridge full of trainers, two sets of clothes and pipes that squelookle when they should nureek!
i mean, i've tried, i really have tried to fit in!
the reading last night said a meteor storm was coming in, but it won't hit us for 12 hours.
we should gather up some supplies, food and water, and maybe even that magnetic fishing game.
we've found a grille about 20 metres down which drops down into a supply room.
we can't get through to unscrew the bolts, but with smaller hands you might have better luck.
i was 17, working in the megamart part-time as a trolley-parker.
after a couple of months, i fell in love with cashier number four.
she was married to this bald bloke who served the fish, ten years older than her.
he was more interested in his amateur dramatics group than her.
one evening, we snuck into the stockroom and started making love on a box of tinned asparagus.
after a few minutes - about halfway through, i was 17 - she said, "there's someone at the door!"
he asked what the hell she was doing lying on a box of reduced tinned veg with no kit on.
she said she was trying to get an all-over tan from the light bulb.
i promised him anything, said i'd never see her again, just let me out!
in the end, he relented, and i heard the box being opened.
so i got up, snapped on the light, and there under a mountain of shoes was poor old squeaky having an epileptic fit.
i managed to wedge one of my trainers into his mouth.
we'd arrive on the first day of term, put on our total immersion suits and connect to the mainframe.
suddenly, there we'd be in a perfect replica of a girls' boarding school.
i want a drink but i can't be bothered to get up...
i wanna go to the loo but i can't be bothered to go down the corridor...
couple of posters and a trailer before 'the world's stupidest stuntmen' video and, take it from me, that laundry room will be packed!
i think you're doing mr lister and the cat a great disservice, ma'am.
just for the record i'd like to repeat that i'm only here because i can't sleep.
so i decided to do some of my laundry and help out kryten.
the only way to get to the backup is through the service ducts.
two miles of ventways that wind their way through the ship like intestines.
we've found a grill about twenty meters down on the right, which drops down into a supply room.
we can't get through to unscrew the fastening bolts but, ma'am, with smaller hands you might enjoy better luck.
i was seventeen, working in the megamart, part time, as a trolley-parker.
after a couple of months i fell in love with cashier number four...
we snuck into the stock room; started makin' love on a box of tinned asparagus.
after a couple of minutes, about half way through, i was seventeen, she leapt up and said:
"there's someone at the door!", so i jumped into this wooden packing crate; it was 'im!
he asked what the hell she was doing lying on a box of reduced, tinned, dented veg with no kit on.
"let me out!"; promised him anything, said i'd never see her again, just let me out!
in the end, he relented, and i heard the box being opened.
for you, the trip through the ducts was far from pointless.
it was an emotional journey where you gleaned invaluable insights into your crewmates.
keiko and the kids will be a lot safer on earth than they are here.
they've only been gone two days and i miss them already.
still, don't you feel better knowing they're out of harm's way?
i wish i could convince jake to visit earth for a while.
it would be a great honor to be married by the emissary.
it's not for another two weeks so you have plenty of time to get ready.
which means if the dominion attacks they just sit by and do nothing.
the romulans, the miradorn, the tholians... the dominion is making impressive inroads in the alpha quadrant.
no matter how many the jem'hadar destroyed there'd always be more.
we'd program them to swarm detonate... 20 or 30 mines to each ship.
then we are to defend the station until the mines are in position and the field has been activated.
the defiant will be unable to raise shields or cloak while deploying the mines.
i'm afraid it's left them somewhat jittery so they're understandably concerned about insuring the sovereignty of their borders.
and since they're now members of the dominion their concerns have become our concerns.
i would think by now you have more than enough ships to defend cardassia.
you may think that, and i may think that but the cardassians...
what if... we agreed to limit our convoys to cargo ships construction units, civilian aid?
things that will help them get their economy back on its feet.
captain, fighting them at the border or fighting them here at the station makes no difference to me.
you don't think starfleet could be persuaded to send us a few more ships, say 50?
in that case, i'd better go and get the infirmary ready.
mr. worf, see to the weapons array and issue combat assignments.
the sad truth is, major, if there is a war now the federation can't guarantee the safety of bajor which means bajor must be kept out of the fighting.
i don't like this any more than you do, major but it's bajor's only chance for survival.
the problems of two newlyweds are but a small thread in the tapestry of galactic events.
you might not understand that today or even tomorrow but someday you will.
but if it'd make you feel any better you could always deputize me.
i'm sure if the jem'hadar board the station you'll make yourself useful.
i've always said you were an idiot but i never believed it more than i do at this moment.
brother, if you want to insult me it's going to have to wait till later.
if you do, you risk setting off every mine on this ship.
and if i don't we may not have a ship left!
but no victory can make this moment any easier for me.
and i promise, i will not rest until i stand with you again... here... in this place where i belong.
keiko and the kids will be a lot safer on earth than they are here.

i guess i'll have to start brushing up on my bajoran.
that's the fifth convoy headed for cardassia in the last five weeks.
i can only imagine how many jem'hadar soldiers are stationed there now.
i'm not giving up on it but, this way, i get to see my work in print.
and, apparently, i get to see everything i say in print, too.
well, there were some orion free traders in quark's last night and they heard from a vulcan diplomat that the romulans signed a nonaggression pact with the dominion.
a lot of rumors float around at a time like this, cadet.
not for another two weeks and in the meantime, we have work to do.
but what if leeta turns out to be just like nog's mother?
we'd program them to swarm detonate... 20 or 30 mines to each ship.
the only problem is you'll have to wait until the entire mine field is deployed before you activate it.
no dinner invitations, no flowers, no attempts at changing the nature of our relationship.
until the current crisis has passed we both need our minds to be clear... to be free of any unnecessary distractions.
i'm pleased to call them allies but as you know, they've just been through a terrible war with the klingons.
i'm afraid it's left them somewhat jittery so they're understandably concerned about insuring the sovereignty of their borders.
and since they're now members of the dominion their concerns have become our concerns.
i would think by now you have more than enough ships to defend cardassia.
things that will help them get their economy back on its feet.
did you know when we arrived children were starving on cardassia prime?
the moment i mentioned that we weren't going to remove the mines we both knew there'd be war.
everything else was just words... a feeble attempt to lull the other side into a false sense of security.
and i refuse to see everything we've accomplished torn down again.
the sad truth is, major, if there is a war now the federation can't guarantee the safety of bajor which means bajor must be kept out of the fighting.
so at least half of you is going to be accepted.
i'm sure that major kira's friends will take good care of you.
i once knew a cardassian... a dashing, handsome young man with a promising career.
but one day, through no fault of his own he found himself exiled and alone with nowhere to turn.
well, that was the most pathetic excuse for a wedding ceremony i've ever seen.
no bridal auction, no latinum dances and the bride... the bride was severely overdressed.
i heard you're not coming with us... that you've been assigned to martok's ship.
it may be some time before we see each other again.
when i first took command of this post all i wanted was to be somewhere else... anywhere but here.
but now, five years later this has become my home, and you have become my family.
i can't risk the entire crew for one man... even though he is my son.
and whether i like it or not, he is a man capable of making his own choices.
one is made of wood, and the other one is metal.
the man is quite surprised, and the doctor doesn't know what to say either.
they talk about how the sun turned blood-red before it set.
and they talk about how they felt when the sun was loosing its power,
i don't fucking care what it is called as long as it flies!
put your hands behind your head and step back from the car!
"when leaving the diner, brest threatened a woman and took her car."
"brest, who seems to be ready for anything, robbed a bank the other day for 80,000 marks."

you stand on the beach and taste the salty smell of the wind that comes from the ocean, and inside you feel the warmth of never ending freedom,
and on your lips the bitter, tear- soaked kiss of your lover.
don't you know how it is when you arrive in heaven?
in heaven that's all they talk about - the ocean - and how wonderful it is.
and they talk about how they felt when the sun was loosing its power,
- and the cold that was coming from the ocean, while the rest of the fire was still glowing.
but i want my car back and therefore i'm giving you another chance.
bring the car back and the two motherfuckers that stole it!
do you remember that the doctor said that you only have a few days left?
maybe we should pick just one wish - the most important one!
"we do not know what he did to wurlitzer, but we hope that the hostage is ok."
"we will be back as soon as there are more news.
boss, they stole a car and are heading for the dutch border now.
tell our people to follow and observe them, but without attracting attention!
how fucking wonderful it is to watch that big ball of fire melt into the ocean
the only light that's left like a candle from the inside...

the open-door policy has now brought us to the crossroads, gentlemen.
on the one hand is the path to prosperity which demands great sacrifice.
on the other, there is the path of peace and brotherhood.
now, are we prepared for a struggle so that we may prosper in future?
the fallen statues of the icons in russia bear out this fact!
think of the money that the open-door police will bring into the country.
those living in flats will move to slums and those from the slums will be out on the streets only to be crushed under the swanky cars of the corporate sector!
it is because of stubborn people like you that this country was divided!
this has to do with the future of the millions of the country.
we have had a pretty good debate on the open-door policy today.
he has come to discuss something very important with you, dad.
i've come to invite you to my birthday party next week.
it's a matter of pride for every father to watch his son grow as tall as he himself is.
i'm even more proud, for my son is two inches taller than me!
on my birthday today, i wished to pour my heart out to you.
but the governor has poisoned the atmosphere, before i could do that.
he does not approve of the girl i am in love with.
it's a blow to his respect to accept her as his daughter-in-law.
he launched an attack on the deceased at the party on august 29th !
thanks to the guests who were present there he contained his sinful intentions!
on the night of the 30th, he found the opportunity and killed his father!
without wasting the court's time, your honor i'd like to present leading personalities of the city who stand testimony to sahil's waywardness!
when the police arrested sahil sinha at the site of the crime on the 30th ...he was dead drunk.
the finger-prints on the weapon of murder and the deceased's body belonged only to sahil sinha.
it clearly states that the heir to all his wealth, will be not his only son, harsh sinha, but sahil sinha.
it was his lust for wealth that compelled him to murder his father.
is it a lie that he was in a murderous mood?
is it a lie that he mercilessly stabbed your husband to death?
when they want to give someone severe punishment they send the prisoner to that cell for some days.
if you somehow manage to reach that cell there is hope for you.
exactly two feet under the commode in the toilet is the drain which leads to the sea.
how far will i be able to swim in the sea?
it's four days since they were locked away in the dark cell, sir.
hunger and thirst must have dried up their intestines by now!
which means, i will not be asked why i fired at their chests.
they always aim at our heads and we are ordered to fire at their legs!
no wonder then that any particle of dust stands out like a sore thumb.
where could sand from the seas have gotten into your room from?
we can announce a reward for those who have him arrested, brother.
anyone capturing sahil alive or dead will get 10 million rupees.
perhaps the lure of money will make the public get hold of him.
why do we need the police, if we're going to take help from the public?
i could understand how much dad loved me, only after losing him.
i hope you don't realize the truth only after you have lost me.
no wonder he put a reward of 10 million on my head!
so i'd get caught and his misdeeds would remain a secret!
i'll get him to tell me tonight that he loves me alone!
what brings you to the police station so early in the day?

i hope you don't realize the truth only after you have lost me.
it would be wise now to make our own arrangements of security.
if i happen to kill the boy in self-defense will i be guilty of murder?
whoever he was, he couldn't have been a friend of your dad.
i think it's either a feud or a large gain that has motivated this murder.
since my father was a governor, a public figure somebody must surely have gained from his death!
and i'm a mere student who could frame me for murder and gain from it?
i'll get him to tell me tonight that he loves me alone!
what brings you to the police station so early in the day?
you must take sahil and go away to some faraway place!
i made the mistake of being silent, although i knew everything.
on the one hand is the path to prosperity which demands great sacrifice.
on the other, there is the path of peace and brotherhood.
i think we must adopt the path of modernization and progress, governor.
we must permit foreign companies to have free trade in our country.
we must not let foreign companies set foot on our soil!
between holding a gun to the temple and enslaving someone and buying them out with dollars, there is no difference whatsoever.
but i hope to find a solution in about a fortnight.
we will surely find a middle-path which preseryes the welfare of the people and their progress.
a personality like you needs a lawyer, too, besides a doctor.
"after whatever you've thought, you have to get along with me"
you know he married me and took sahil for his son after the death of my husband.
he loves sahil more than he would love his own son.
i'm grateful to you for attending my elder son's birthday party.
it's a matter of pride for every father to watch his son grow as tall as he himself is.
but the governor has poisoned the atmosphere, before i could do that.
he likes to create drama and every word of what he said was a lie.
it's a blow to his respect to accept her as his daughter-in-law.
because she happens to be isha, the daughter of his personal secretary.
to kill your father, you will first have to pierce my heart!
had he only not been your husband, i'd have dug the knife in him!
whether sahil cares for me or not, i love him with all my heart.
i will someday make a place for myself in his heart.
thanks to the guests who were present there he contained his sinful intentions!
on the night of the 30th, he found the opportunity and killed his father!
had shardadevi not interyened he'd have killed his father on the night of august 29th itself!
i was stunned to see his true colors on the night of the 29th.
this is the will of the governor sinha, which was entrusted to me.
it clearly states that the heir to all his wealth, will be not his only son, harsh sinha, but sahil sinha.
it was his lust for wealth that compelled him to murder his father.
he showed his true colors, the moment the will was prepared.
but a mother would never lie on such an occasion especially when her son is being sent to the gallows!
i'd therefore like your permission to present sharda devi in court.
in view of the testimony of witnesses and the evidence at hand this court reaches the conclusion that that sahil sinha mercilessly killed his father.
under the indian penal code 302, this court awards sahil sinha rigorous imprisonment for 1 4 years.
if you somehow manage to reach that cell there is hope for you.
exactly two feet under the commode in the toilet is the drain which leads to the sea.
but when i'm on duty, it is only duty i do.
i can spend all 24 hours in the line of duty.
the last time i worked with him, i started suffering from high blood pressure.
the next step after high blood pressure is a failure of the heart!
anyone capturing sahil alive or dead will get 10 million rupees.
perhaps the lure of money will make the public get hold of him.
his daughter and his car have been missing since last night, sir.
where have you brought me so far away from the city, isha?
it says that should something happen to me after father's death you will be custodian of all his wealth!
so you killed my father and framed me for the murder!
whoever he was, he couldn't have been a friend of your dad.
i think it's either a feud or a large gain that has motivated this murder.
since my father was a governor, a public figure somebody must surely have gained from his death!
and i'm a mere student who could frame me for murder and gain from it?
there's no saying when he will have a change of heart.
and i'm helping him only because i'm in love with him.
if the killer is not caught by tomorrow night both of us will leave the city and go away somewhere where nobody recognizes us.
but i have a feeling that i'm close to my goal.
i thought that sahil had forcibly run away with your girl.
the truth is that she has left with him, on her own.
you must take sahil and go away to some faraway place!
i made the mistake of being silent, although i knew everything.
i have a couplet for the bad condition you are in.
"why will a minister die, when the whole hospital looks after him?"
on the one hand is the path to prosperity which demands great sacrifice.
on the other, there is the path of peace and brotherhood.
i think we must adopt the path of modernization and progress, governor.
we must permit foreign companies to have free trade in our country.
we must not let foreign companies set foot on our soil!

it is conceivable that the skrill in question complies with its own theft.
so, humanity is not your first contact with intelligent life forms?
as with every texture there are degrees of contact as well as degrees of sentience.
but this life form, primitive though it may be, you reengineered it and turned it into a weapon?
if they're gonna to go the grind, it's gonna be through her.
because ms. green is not the dominant partner in this relationship.
the decision of the synod remains burdensome, but you understand its necessity, giving the threat they pose to us.
i trust that their deletion does not unduly complicate your endeavors.
all right, we have to find a nice boyfriend for luanne.
that seems like a pile of work just to get your den back.
as long as it took that river to carve the grand canyon... that is how long women have been learning to subtly manipulate relationships.
you only think it's easy... because we make it look easy.
as soon as you left, wade turned into mr. grabby sam.
i think you fixed me up with him to get your den back.
that's why i've asked my godchildren to come with me to ask for help in holding this colloquium.
holy saint michael's been following him all day long insulting and cursing him.
he appears to me in my dreams and if i turn quickly
i can almost see him behind me, trying to grab my arm.
he has to pay for the music, the fireworks, the flowers, the candles, help others with the costumes, then the booze, the food, and hound everyone to practice and learn the words and the steps,
get permits and get someone from huamantla to make the sawdust carpet and on and on and on...
land is sacred and god is listening to your lies, you thief!
fucking barefooted indian you can't even speak like a rational person.
haven't you thought of going back to a church in the city?
are you trying to take my parish away from me, so they can do as they please, as they've done for five centuries?
it was bequeathed by our forefathers to know how to pray to our saints so that they wouldn't get mad at us.
it is as if one was the saint and saint was one...
it's like a huge prayer stronger than one thousand people praying together.
it's like they devour prayers, candles and flowers, and they are bloated and content.
so god sent the first michael to fight him, but lucifer... won.
then god sent a second michael, who was defeated also then a third michael, who was a mean motherfucker and beat the shit out of lucifer.
and may i ask you, who authorized you to hold this colloquium?
with all due respect, father, we didn't believe we needed a permit to hold it.
are you going to let them do it in your church?
if i don't, you'd let them do it in yours, right?
each time i talk to you you pretend to be asleep.
now that i've learned to dance to saint michael i've noticed many things, and one of them is that it's true you're asleep.
if you'd called me before the fight there'd be no problem.
but father santos higareda was just here asking for support and i gave it to him.
they are turning an act of faith and love into something political.
knives and hostages, though they a/so say they've got rifles and machine guns.
i'm the authority, and i said i was going to burn the door down to get the rioters out.
i have the approval of father santos higareda and the authorities, and if anyone interferes, we'll kill them in self-defense.
we can't let olegario go to hell for not fulfilling his vow, even if they kill us.
we're soldiers of the chief soldier, saint michael, and we won't let delfino be disrespectful by burning the door down, even if we have to kill him!
you understand that they have to dance their colloquium in a moment.
they all promised to mr. olegario, who must be dead by now.
at this point, we can no longer leisurely wait for his tail to grow out!
we're going to use the pliers to pull his tail out!
i told you, we have to pull out that tail of yours thats just starting to grow.
it may be a bit rough on you, but this is the only way there is!
you can no longer think of me as the same person i've been up to now!
is that the sort of battle power you learned from goku?
there are times when i get so that i want to look back, just a little bit, but holding on to love and courage and pride, i fight on!
dan dan, little by little, i'm being charmed, this planet's last remnant of hope.
but unfortunately for you, you won't be able to beat me at this level!
you can no longer think of me as the same person i've been up to now!
is that the sort of battle power you learned from goku?
it doesn't feel like you even have the power of a fly!
this is smaller than the one i used when i defeated goku, but it will be enough for the likes of you!
once i finish you off, it means that there will be no one else in the entire universe left to carry out goku's will!
can oob, after uniting with boo and becoming more powerful, stand up to vegeta-baby?
will the drastic measures being taken to re-grow goku's tail be in time?
i wish the words would come to me easily, like when writing a letter to a friend.
i'd like to have more time, for us to get to know each other a little better.
your wife has an irrational jealousy, i get punished for it and all you can say is you're sorry?
i don't mean to be rude, ms. horwitz, but i just really don't understand.
though i'm legally divorced from ira, by jewish law i'm still married since he got hit by the bus before he could give me the get.
without this sort of a jewish release, i cannot remarry under jewish law.
if two people can't marry because of this silly rule, it's silly.
i don't care if you have some jewish hoopla to back it up.
i could have said you were transferred to help the corporate department.
i could have said the partners wanted to thin out litigation.
it's just that the rest of my face is more red because i'm so upset.
bad news good news and potentially horrible news, whichever order you'd like.
whenever i'm attracted to a guy, i pray he's got a crumb on his face.
i would love to talk more, but i'm late for temple.
i just meant that a person shouldn't be denied marriage because of a custom that came about before the wheel.
if you'd put it that way, i wouldn't have taken offense.
one, if made in front of a jury, would incur embarrassment to your firm.
a firm that, correct me if i'm wrong, cherishes reputation flaunts it for recruitment purposes.
it would be painful to have these allegations levied against you before a jury in an open forum.
it'd be excruciating to bear them in a room filled with colleagues who consider you a friend.
and for a man who prioritizes family money really is only money.
it becomes a smaller sacrifice to give some of it to georgia in exchange for your right to spare embarrassment to your family to spare ridicule to a firm devoted to its highbrow pedigree of principle.
old friends became embarrassed to say a dirty word in front of me.
i found it refreshing how you were so willing to be obnoxious.
i gave mouth-to-mouth to a person who thought it was a "snow white" thing in reverse.
then i met somebody i could like, and he had creamy italian.
and now i assault judaism and i get hit on by a rabbi.
i just probably shouldn't date until the world begins to make sense again.
given their outrage we can't count on practicality to ever figure into their thinking.
and as inventive as that family defense is, and again i like it we both know in the end, you'd probably lose.
the object in those cases is probably to try to keep the jury awake.
the worst thing about being a d.a. is the sense of futility, i suppose.
is common sense pinched off by that thing on your head?
did you say, "is common sense pinched off by that thing on my head"?
a firm that, correct me if i'm wrong, cherishes reputation flaunts it for recruitment purposes.
it would be painful to have these allegations levied against you before a jury in an open forum.
it'd be excruciating to bear them in a room filled with colleagues who consider you a friend.
who trusted you to preserve the integrity of a franchise they've all committed themselves to, deeply.
it becomes a smaller sacrifice to give some of it to georgia in exchange for your right to spare embarrassment to your family to spare ridicule to a firm devoted to its highbrow pedigree of principle.
you want to dismiss this meeting as a litigator's technique, do so at enormous personal and professional peril.
but i have to say what i hate about being a rabbi is how everyone tiptoes around me.
old friends became embarrassed to say a dirty word in front of me.
then i met somebody i could like, and he had creamy italian.
and now i assault judaism and i get hit on by a rabbi.
i'm just afraid you now have a client who likes ham.
and you want me to waive that "stupid little kosher thing."
in our prep school production of richard iii, he drove the entire cast crazy with his constant critiquing.
i seem to recall a delay on opening night while our richard chased frasier around the dressing room, beating him with his hump.
i've had a quick peek at your script, and i think i'd be perfect as "bull" kragen, the brutish gamekeeper.
you know, gil, i think that's just a bit too on the nose.
jennifer down in accounting is married to a professional actor who specializes in dialects.
i'm thinking of asking him to play six or seven smaller parts.
all right, now, i fear we may be running just a bit long still.
so i've asked daphne to time us this evening, and also, noel hasn't rounded up all the sound effects yet, so i'm gonna have daphne read those directions as well.
you know, that's wonderful, mel but he sounds to me just a bit more austrian than german.
i've done that accent both on broadway and the london stage.
you also told me that my gamekeeper sounded too cultured, that my irishman sounded more protestant than catholic, and that my dwarf was too tall!
let me try hans again and tell me how my german is sounding.
when the lights came back up, a smoking gun lay on the table.
the maid lay dead, unable to name her killer, and nigel fairservice lay mortally wounded.
each of us holds a piece of the puzzle to relate to you.
when we've finished, you'll know the full, dark secret of nightmare inn.
no, the trouble is he doesn't know how to stop directing.
in our prep school production of richard iii, he drove the entire cast crazy with his constant critiquing.
i seem to recall a delay on opening night while our richard chased frasier around the dressing room, beating him with his hump.
niles, it was just a little backstage horseplay to relieve tension.
after all, nigel does have that divine speech in the second act about his boyhood in surrey:
"romping with his school chums in the fens and spinneys, when the twilight bathed the hedgerows like a lambent flame."
so i've asked daphne to time us this evening, and also, noel hasn't rounded up all the sound effects yet, so i'm gonna have daphne read those directions as well.
now, that's a lot of responsibility on you, are you sure you're up to it?
i can't believe any of my guests could be a multiple murderer.
that's easy for you to say, but my job is to suspect everyone.
- i'm so, so sorry, i was tinkering with it until the last minute.
but not to worry, your natural talent will carry you through.
- now, listen, your natural spontaneity is your best asset as an actor.
what was it the yale daily news said about your tartuffe?
this is frasier crane welcoming you to kacl's re-creation of the original mystery theatre.
i already know the plot, but i'll try not to blurt out the name of the murderer.
mother and i moved here when i was a small boy after the tragic death of my father.
i kept the pain of that loss buried deep within me like a serpent coiled within a damp cave.
i caught her over brookline, flying with a full bag and trailing a lot of dust.
that warrants an emissions citation, but when i attempted to pull her over, she took off.
i think i'm gonna be 6 inches tall for the rest of my life.
you know, it's not a good idea to go to bed tiny.
i think it was back when i lived in wales and i tried my hand at coal mining.
i told you if we went deep enough we'd find a seam, bynnik.
[singing] oh, i come from alabama with a banjo on my knee
oh, i'm going to louisiana my true love for to see
look far more heroic than nature ever intended-- an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles.
and what have i, the divine leonardo da vinci, received in payment?
the iong-range probe we sent out two months ago has stopped transmitting.
at first, i thought it was a problem with the communications grid.
i've analyzed every square millimeter of the borg corpse we recovered three months ago.
i'm closer to understanding how their assimilation technology works and i might be able to create some sort of medical defense.
these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process.
once inside the skin, they release a series of nanoprobes into the bloodstream.
the tubules are capable of penetrating any known alloy or energy fieid-- which means our battle must be waged inside the body itself.
the first tissue to be attacked by the nanoprobes is the victim's blood.
i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes, but we might be able to slow them down.
let's try a submicron dissection on the probes we've collected so far, see if we can discover the assimilation mechanism.
i've been looking through the personal log entries of all the starfleet captains who encountered the borg.
i've gone over every engagement from the moment q flung the enterprise into the path of that first cube to the massacre at wolf 359-- every battle, every skirmish, anything that might give me an insight into the mind of the collective.
could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant?
i keep looking to all these captains-- my comrades in arms.
i've been aware of them for some time now-- the premonitions.
captain, it's not the borg that we should be worried about.
i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells.
that way, the probe can do its work without being detected.
there are times, catarina, when i find myself transfixed by a shadow on the wall or the splashing of water against a stone.
i stare at it, the hours pass... the world around me drops away... replaced by worlds being created and destroyed by my imagination--
but if i turn around, that would end all hope of ever getting home.
and no matter how much i try to focus my mind,
there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer.
i must deliver a bronzetto to the monks at santa croce.
normally, the answer would be no, but if what i've learned from the aliens is true, the borg are losing this conflict.
in one regard, the borg are no different than we are-- they're trying to survive.
i don't believe they're going to refuse an offer that will help them do that.
what makes you think the borg won't attempt to take the information by assimilating voyager and its crew?
there's a story i heard as a child, a parable, and i never forgot it.
a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river wondering how to get to the other side.
we don't need to give them a single bit of information-- not until we're safe.
we just need the courage to see this through to the end.
six months, a year down the road, after species 8472 gets through with the borg, we could find ourselves right back in the line of fire.
and we'ii have missed the window of opportunity that exists right here, right now.
we'd be giving an advantage to a race guilty of murdering billions.
we'd be helping the borg assimilate yet another species just to get ourselves back home-- it's wrong!

i delivered two portraits of his mindless nephew more than three months ago to be depicted in the heroic mode of an hercules or an achilles-- so specified our contract.
i complied... making that young fool of a nephew look far more heroic than nature ever intended-- an act on my part far greater than anything accomplished by hercules or achilles.
and i want to increase the magnitude of the force fields.
these injection tubules are the first step in the borg assimilation process.

maybe we can develop some type of protective shielding against them.
i doubt we can actually destroy the nanoprobes, but we might be able to slow them down.

at what point do we come about and retreat to friendly territory?
could the crew accept living out the rest of their lives in the delta quadrant?
i think i can get a clean lock on the minerals in their bone tissue.
i just came up with it, but i think it might work.
it's been 12 hours since our confrontation with the alien life-form.
there's no sign that we're being pursued and we've had no further encounters with the borg.
i tried giving him a sedative, but it was rejected immediately.
in fact, every treatment i've tried has been neutralized within seconds.
so i successfully dissected a nanoprobe and managed to access its recoding mechanism.
i reprogrammed the probe to emit the same electrochemical signatures as the alien cells.
when one's imagination cannot provide an answer, one must seek out a greater imagination.
there are times when even i find myself kneeling in prayer.
we offer them a way to defeat their new enemy and, in return, we get safe passage through their space.
in developing a treatment for harry, the doctor has found a way to attack the aliens at a microscopic level.
in one regard, the borg are no different than we are-- they're trying to survive.
i don't believe they're going to refuse an offer that will help them do that.
doctor, you're the only one on board with full knowledge of the nanoprobe modifications.
i want you to transfer all of that research into your holo-matrix.
there's a story i heard as a child, a parable, and i never forgot it.
a scorpion was walking along the bank of a river wondering how to get to the other side.
we don't need to give them a single bit of information-- not until we're safe.

you have to be careful, because the color black will absorb the heat of the sun.
now that she lost her breasts, she looks just like kyoko.
come to think of it, when kyoko was attacked it may have been a messenger spirit's warning.
i bet something big is about to happen and that kid is involved.
tonight is the first full moon after 200 years the last night for a sea spider to become a demon.
if we fail to do so then we have to kill her ourselves.

years ago... my then wife, jane, and i... were coming back from her sister's house... and we had a fight.
she had her period, and we stopped to get water for midol.

you're beautiful and we've spent a lot oftime together... and you two get along very well.

i was merely explaining to you why my choice, of necessity... is confined to your practice.
i knew you were mentally ill before i married you... but i thought because i was a trained professional... that i could help you.

you know all my secrets, every nuance of my psychic life.
there isn't a feeling or desire that i haven't admitted to you.
my need to be tied up, to watch you with other women... to feel your spike heels in my mouth.
no one can say that i didn't know... what i was letting myself in for.
from that moment on... as if she had experienced a divine revelation... she suddenly became what epstein referred to angrily... as "jewish with a vengeance."
i rue the day i listened to you and didn't have him circumcised.
can i get a red wine, exact same thing that she has?
i wanted to be the first to tell you... that i'm getting married.
i always keep hooker money around... 'cause i once paid by check years ago... and the irs killed me.
fay, when you get this message, if it's not too late...
not that i care, but it's great for hilly to see me.
the last time i saw him, he was six years old.
dolly tried putting elsie's words out of her mind... but max's dark secret plagued her.
then one day, she ran into wolf fishbein... and the truth was revealed.
do you care even about the holocaust... or do you think it never happened?
not only do i know that we lost six million... but the scary thing is that records are made to be broken.
i treat this woman and she exits... and you meet her and you fuck her!
supposing i told you that my fucking amy pollack... was a disguised plea for more closeness with you?
my first wife, i told you, i was laying in bed with her...
i turned off her because the way the light struck her.
i want you to get your goddamn stuff together... and i want you out.
you know, i cannot understand... why the most sophisticated of women... can't tell the difference... between a meaningless, hot, passionate sexual affair... and a nice, solid, tranquil, routine marriage.
so now you're blaming me... because i don't go out with you enough places... where you can meet strangers to fuck?
i was merely explaining to you why my choice, of necessity... is confined to your practice.
i knew you were mentally ill before i married you... but i thought because i was a trained professional... that i could help you.
the last thing you wanna do... is get down on yourself as a therapist.
maybe it tapered a bit after hilly was born... but you two had sex pretty regularly.
i have no idea why i took up with that patient.
i'm in the midst of writing a thing on the devil... who comes and kidnaps a man's one true love... and takes her down to hell, and he goes to retrieve her.
since it's hell, i'm able to settle a lot of old scores.
i write well, but that's a different story... because i can manipulate the characters and plots.
you create your own universe... but that's much nicer than the world we have.
really, you've given me... some of the happiest moments of my life... and you've even saved my life at times.
and now you've actually taught me things... and i'm completely grateful--
nor was the image she shared with ken... of marvin's flaccid microscopic member... jiggling up and down as he tiptoed naked... across the icy floor of their home... to close the storm windows.
it was that she had never loved him... but she wanted children to retaliate against her sister... who was not maternal, and whose every inch, leslie felt... was occupied by gluttonous self-love.
a patient of helen's, an israeli... who had come to her, depressed that his wife had left him... captured helen's heart."
i think it best... that we terminate your treatment,... give it a substantial time.
my old university is honoring me, if you can believe that.

i once paid by check years ago and the irs killed me.
fay, when you get this message, if it's not too late... don't get married... because i love you... and i want to marry you.
i was looking at... my last book... at the part where we met.
i tried to exaggerate it to make it funny... but it was actually very romantic.
so it wouldn't work, and you'd never have to give up... sport-fucking and chronic dissatisfaction and grow up.
i won't stand here and get lectured by my own creation.
you're beautiful and we've spent a lot of time together... and you two get along very well.
obviously i knew you never would in a million years... but i imagined he longed for you.
you knew when the boy grew up he would never learn to love.
i think your problem is... that you love too easily, and too much.
dolly tried putting elsie's words out of her mind... but max's dark secret plagued her.
then one day she ran into wolf fishbein... and the truth was revealed.
if i tell you why i did it, do you promise not to nudge me?
wolf fishbein said, in order to hide the bodies... you ate them!
i cannot understand why the most sophisticated of women... can't tell the difference between... a meaningless, hot, passionate sexual affair... and a nice, solid, tranquil, routine marriage.
tell me, was she the only one, or were there others?
i was merely explaining... why my choice, of necessity,... is confined to your practice.
i knew you were mentally ill before we were married... but i thought, as a trained professional, i could help you.
are you working on anything... something we can sink our teeth into?
i'm in the midst of writing... a thing on the devil who kidnaps a man's true love... and takes her down to hell... and he goes to retrieve her.
"lt was not just that leslie was numbed... with the spate of leaden perceptions... that passed forwit from marvin.

now... two years later... your latest magnum opus... emerges from this sewer of an apartment... where you take our suffering and turn it into gold... literary gold!
everyone's misery, you even cause misery... and use your alchemy... to turn it into gold, like some fucking black magician!
she's pointing a gun at me... we're out in the cold and i'm panicked.
i tell her a story i wrote when i was younger... and she found it funny, thank god.
beth kramer has never been so mortified in her entire life.
beth kramer's atight-assed, busybody cunt... and it's none of her business how i speak to my son.
it's indigestion or gallbladder or acid reflux... i've got a family history.
my dad died of heart attack... my mother died of a massive coronary.
you were a fan... and a follower... and then a pupil... and then you were a roommate.
and before i knew it... you had control ofthe channel changer.
i always have hooker money because... i once paid by check years ago and the irs killed me.

i got our usual place at the wyndham. lt's been 2 weeks ago.
we gotta be fast. i can't make it believable for so long.
years ago... my then wife, jane, and i... were coming back from her sister's house... and we had a fight.
she had her period, and we stopped to get water for midol.

i think your problem is... that you love too easily, and too much.
i think you're beautiful, and great... and too kind to me, and lovely.
not that i care, but it's great for hilly to see me.
the last time i saw him he was six years old.
and to make her unsympathetic, you used some of her,... but mostly you caricatured my religious dedication.
because it always enraged you that i returned to my roots.
if i tell you why i did it, do you promise not to nudge me?
wolf fishbein said, in orderto hide the bodies... you ate them!
my first wife. i told you... we were in bed one night.
i turned off her... because the way the light was, she looked like max schmeling.

he sent back soil and water samples that were off the charts from this town, jackson.
frank found out the hanner coal company was dumping thousands of barrels of deadly toxic waste in abandoned coal mines.
i want you to go in, find the dump find the people who're putting it there and bring me back a witness.
if we don't have a witness who'll testify, we got nothing.
that coal's been burning in that mountain for 12 ½ years now.
does it ever concern anybody that the earth's on fire underground?
i should've known you'd be a world-class screw-up public brawl like this.
you're under arrest for assault and battery and disturbing the peace.
you ever get lonely up here, just with the bees and all?
well, you know i helped my daddy gather honey until i was 16.
and then when he died in the mines, i just kept on.
so i feel like a part of him has kept on too.
we received several reports that someone has been dumping extremely large quantities of toxic waste in these hills.
it concerns me because if it gets into the aquifer it could destroy drinking water for thousands of miles and kill a bunch of people here.
why did you feel like you had to lie to me?
did you really want to come and fix my porch and get to know me?
he said if we arrest him, he'd have federal agents all over this town.
i got 50,000 barrels of cyanide rolling down there right now.
you know, the trouble with rich people is that sometimes they don't care about others.
these folks that are making the profits by dumping toxic waste, petroleum byproducts and stuff like that are making the profit.
or how about if you took the poison out of the air, out of the earth out of the water that you've left up here.
if you could do any of those, not only would i leave but i'd be impressed.
i think she never got over it because she didn't do it.
my theory is when she was a little girl, you were molesting her.
your daddy found out, went to throw you a bad beating one time and you killed him.
then you said, "little sister, this gun went off by accident.
leave my friend alone or i'll have to educate you on how to beat the shit out of somebody.
in fact, you must be a dumb motherfucker or you wouldn't be here.
you can do that because it's the only way to save your ass or because it's the right thing.
i don't really give a shit, but you're going to do it.
before we get to the brunch part of our services today...
we have a special visitor to the community, mr. jack taggert.

well, you know i helped my daddy gather honey until i was 16.
and then when he died in the mines, i just kept on.
i hear you've been asking a lot of questions around town.
where i come from, that's how people get to know one another.
i was told that somebody's dumping some dangerous toxic waste down here.
i wanted to see if i could come down and stop it.
i'll have 300 agents come up here into this hick town and crawl up every orifice you got.
then you can go to your proctologist and get an ointment to rub on the hole that hurts most.
it concerns me because if it gets into the aquifer it could destroy drinking water for thousands of miles and kill a bunch of people here.
why did you feel like you had to lie to me?
where i come from we call it betrayal, and it is no way to make friends.
i loved fixing your porch, and i'm very interested in you.
my theory is when she was a little girl, you were molesting her.

i don't understand why you brought them into this kidnappers insist the police be kept out.
otherwise, you get an ear in the mail or something like that.

that last car is a bmw with the license plate... $28.35 total.
...belonging to the still missing, kidnap victim, emily t. hope, heiress to multimillionaire, alexander hope, who was recently under investigation for security and exchange commission violations.

comrades as a soldier, i travel a lot and meet a lot of people.

if i keep going like this, i'll end up like you.
tell him his son has climbed up the fire escape and can't get down.
if he doesn't come right away, we'll call his mother, got it?
from that moment on i had no one else in the world closer than toljan.
my mother's watch and the gun were the only things left from that life.
my memory then confused... what i saw and understood after that.
but i knew i'd remember that train... for the rest of my life.
my mom said that from then on we would live with him... and that i would have to call him dad.
we walked through the city... looking for a room or a small apartment to rent.
but i have never met people... as kind and friendly as you.
for this reason... accept as a sign of gratitude... tickets for the circus!
you promised it was the last time... and then we would have a normal life!
you were the one who said you'd write me from jail!
they didn't find out about the burglaries in the apartments... but they gave him seven years anyway.
we waited in front of the prison... to see him before the long separation.
i heard some of what the doctors said... but then i couldn't understand any of the details... and they weren't important.

tim, if brad is lucky enough to get a scholarship, we're not gonna be buying any cars.
use phrases like, uh, "after the holidays" or "when things settle down."
oh, if you run into them unexpectedly, be sure that you have some emergency you have to deal with.
the networks for making every game seem like life and death.
i blame the advertisers who only care about selling beer and $200 sneakers.
the reason i wanted the scholarship so bad for you is because you have great athletic ability.
you know, i never played sports when i was your age.
i know a guy that can set you up with a bagpipe scholarship.
it's just really great that you guys finally found the time to get together
and one and two and three and four and five and six and seven, eight!
one and two and three and four and five and six and seven, huh!
you know something... pride shouldn't even be one of the 7 deadly sins.
there's nothing wrong with feeling good about yourself, especially if you look like me.
suddenly it's not quite so funny when i do it, now, is it?

what is cassidy doing that we didn't do at her age?

sources inside the department have now confirmed for me one person has been shot and is dead.

these men avoid contact by using helium balloons attached to little drug baskets.
it's also legal to sell drugs if you use a mandrill.
typically, mandrills work at night, approaching the client with a drug pouch and returning with the money.
mandrills are intelligent and vicious, capable of throwing a man over 40 feet, but mandrills have been protected by law ever since queen elizabeth i gave birth to a child resembling a mandrill by mistake.

this colour, that they thought would be a good selling point, is put in with an industrial dye, which is a pollutant, and is causing in czechoslovakia something called czech-neck.
it causes enormous water retention so that the body swells up.
the neck becomes about this wide and swells up to engulf the mouth and the nose so that the person who's on that trip dies through not being able to breathe at all.
we've got an advert from a tokyo cable channel which shows somebody taking drugs through...
it's a device in order to take drugs through a dog.

(dealer) do you think i want to hear any of that now?
drug use among children has for many an education and with obvious alarm to both parents on the increase yearly.
but the approach in schools has changed considerably since the late '70s heyday of drumlake school in hampshire.
we take students from age eight to 18 and the whole ethos of the school is to allow the children to discover their own level of drug intake... and to develop their own sense of maturity.
we do have, er, one or two problems, occasionally with extortionate prices being demanded and once the price rises above, for instance,
£15 for a quarter-ounce of moroccan hashish, then we would put a control on that price and we would then introduce our own supplies into the system.
usually, by about age 15 or 16, they're injecting themselves with heroin...

this child receives a high-impact incident, in which the addict has gone shocking.

i want you to know that when you're there, there is something about this that is quite shocking.
as is the staged funeral, with its uncompromising memorial to desiree's parents.
and when the man turned into a horse, that was good, wasn't it?
it's hard to tell whether this school will be a hit or a hash.
only time can tell and if you think about it, time's a bit of a drug, too.
if time's a drug, then big ben is a huge needle injecting it into the sky.
it comes from prague, with its own culture of boom raves, where kids wolf down vast quantities of this.

when the character i play arrives in the small french village claiming to be jean–pierre batois, a vagrant tinker, it's essential no one recognises him for who he truly is – the comte de valletta.
for the transformation from noble lord to common beggar to truly take place, it requires at least six hours in make–up.
and how many long–gone faces it must have seen come and go.
i, too, will be dead one day, like those hens we massacred last week.
although i do hope in not quite the same way of being held down by you and...having my head chopped off.
but i do hope that when i die... ..i can say that here was a man who lived, who tasted life in some small way.

one night something changed, and my relation to wade's story was different... from what it had been since childhood.
i mark this change by wade's tone of voice... during a phone call a night after halloween.
a square-faced man wearing a police jacket is driving the vehicle.
beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face.
whether it kills a deer or not, more or less up to you.
i'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of a buck first four hours of the season.
turns out to be one of these kids up for the weekend.
she says, "officer, can we make this disappear?" shows me $100 bill.
why don't you do a few things for me, and then you get bugged on your own time?
you might as well take the rest of the day off.
i just get out of bed, and you're talking about a goddamn speeding ticket?
- yesterday you passed a stopped school bus which had a flashing...
and i was ready to listen to another chapter in one of his ongoing sagas.
there was the detective story concerning the shooting of evan twombley, and the family melodrama about wade's custody fight with lillian.
he had called to tell me that some time the previous night... he had discovered our mother had died, and he'd discovered the body when he went over to visit her and our father with margie fogg.
it was left to me to tell our sister lena and her husband clyde... who'd gone overweight and made jesus christ their personal savior.
i was a careful child... and i became a careful adult.
but at least i was never afflicted by that man's violence.
you fly on automatic pilot, like i was doing all night, and you disappear.
then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who in the hell it belongs to.
i don't know what the connection is yet, but lariviere had jack take him out hunting, pretending it was an accident.
if jack told the truth, he could be free by the time he's my age.
um, i know he's been due for a couple of years.
i was thinkin' of paying it when the insurance comes in.
gordon lariviere is gonna be a very rich man because of his being a selectman.
in a year or two, you're not gonna recognize this town.
boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth, men whose best hope for connection with other human beings... lay in detachment... as if life were over.
it's how we keep from destroying in turn our own children... and terrorizing the women who have the misfortune to love us;
just as surely as jack did not kill evan twombley, even accidentally.
the link between jack and twombley, lariviere and mel gordon... existed only in wade's wild imaginings.
why not let lariviere buy it and build the condominiums he wants there?
we want to believe wade died that same november, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk.
you cannot understand how a man, a normal man, a man like you and me, could do such a terrible thing.
unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be wade whitehouse, there will be no more mention of him.
everything of importance, that is everything that gives rise to the telling of this story, occurred during a single deer-hunting season... in a small town in upstate new hampshire where wade was raised, and so was i.
one night something changed, and my relation to wade's story was different... from what it had been since childhood.
let us imagine that around 8:00 on halloween eve... comes a pale blue, eight-year-old plymouth with a police bubble on top.
a square-faced man wearing a police jacket is driving the vehicle.
jesus, lacoy, you got nothing better to do than tell stories?
the pity is, someday some college student will come in here and believe this shit... 'cause you're the only one dumb enough to talk to him.
think you're gettin' something you can use, only it turns out to be a work of art?
whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault.
lillian's been trying to nail me to a cross since the day i met her.
i'm gonna get me a lawyer from concord, and get this divorce thing rearranged.
i'd rather be deer huntin' than freezin' my ass off on that fuckin' grader.
well, you ain't the hunter jack is, and he can't drive the grader worth shit.
it'll come out that jack lied, and the kid'll hang for it.
he was scheduled to testify for a committee... investigating organized crime in new england, the construction business.
i'm positive it didn't happen the way jack says it did.
jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry.
wade was telling a different story, or so it seemed then, one in which i myself was a character.
he had called to tell me that some time the previous night... he had discovered our mother had died, and he'd discovered the body when he went over to visit her and our father with margie fogg.
please look down upon this woman, our mother and friend, and make her example known to us.

it's likely there are people in the union who don't want twombley to testify.
that probably includes his son-in-law, who's vice president, and will probably be the next president.
i've been thinkin' about that story you told me... about pop... and chopping the firewood out of the ice and after.
i don't want to disappoint you, but i don't think it happened.
no, i remember clearly because... after i heard, i became real careful around pop.
i was a careful child... and i became a careful adult.
i'll have another look at the divorce decree, see if we can get it redrawn.
but at some point, i'm going to have to interview your daughter.
have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
um, i know he's been due for a couple of years.
he was always first to receive the brunt of our father's anger.
he had no perspective to retreat to, even in a crisis.
our stories, wade's and mine, describe the lives of the boys and men for thousands of years:
boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth, men whose best hope for connection with other human beings... lay in detachment... as if life were over.
now and then i drive out there and sit in my car, and wonder why not let it go.
why not let lariviere buy it and build the condominiums he wants there?
we want to believe wade died that same november, froze to death on a bench or a sidewalk.

i suppose you think i should speed up and try to lose them.
why did we have to go down to go back up?
'cause i don't like to come and go in the same way twice.
i reached out and grabbed the first thing i could think--
i know they're song lyrics, but i know how i feel... .
that's like saying, "smoke cigarettes" or "drive cars. " lt's really generic.

the president's cutting funding to nasa, the milk cow of the aerospace industry.
so you're saying that nasa's going to kill the president with an earthquake?
you want me to talk to him, smooth things out for you?
no, i want you to go home or wherever it is that you go.
try to remember who stabbed you with the wheelchair or where it happened.
i wish i could explain it so it all made sense.

i figured, the way you drove you should be in the union.
i'd be proud to have you drive me around in a cab.
you think if anyone had the information that he's got and had a podium to shout it from, they'd actually let him do it?
no, it's quite clear that he's a disinformation junkie for him.
you get on the treadmill, turn your back to that picture like you're running away.
sometimes you sing with the music but most of the time, you punish yourself.
i reached out and grabbed the first thing i could think...
i know they're song lyrics, but i know how i feel...
"isn't there anything you can do for me, doc in 3 minutes?"
and the doctor says, "well, i can boil you an egg."
sister, i'm sure your heart's in the right place, but somebody's got to lift the festering scab that is the vatican.

sometimes you sing with the music but most of the time, you punish yourself.
i don't know where you get the energy after a full day's work.

we're meeting her and nelson for dinner, but they can't go till 8:30.
so i thought i'd fix us a little snack to tide us over in the meantime.
i wanted to talk like a country music dj, you know.
here's a fine ol' hank williams for all you broken hearts out there.
in hagerstown, police are still puzzling over the disappearance of amy lee walker, who has not been seen since thursday.
there was no evidence of a break-in at the walker home...

the authorities are prepared to grant your son, malcom... a leave of privilege to see you.

i mean, with all your expertise, do you think someone like that has human feelings?
you know... my dad will understand if you just wanna drop this... and enjoy yourself.
in all fairness, i'd like to check a few things out, if you don't mind... before i let this go.
i wanted to talk like a country music deejay, you know?
here's a fine old hank williams... for all you broken hearts out there.
just said his boy thought he'd seen a body... and, uh, gave us a general area.

but our investigation into the disappearance of amy lee walker... will continue till she's found.
i've decided to take my stake in america... lay claim to my own peculiar heritage.
the moron is gonna wander far and wide through the land... and kill and kill and kill while you and frank black... you stake out the gay bars waitin' for some slightly stupid-lookin'queer.
it's looking like cr is gonna die without ever seeing him.
all prisoners are routinely allowed to visit a dying family member. i could call someone.
you've seen many tragic situations. i thought maybe you could give him some perspective.
it's so hard on adele. lt's obvious to everyone malcolm committed this horrible crime, but she still clings to the hope that he's innocent.
when we came down from quebec i was ashamed of my accent, so i worked hard to lose it.
i wanted to talk like a country music dj, you know.
vocal patterns indicated the caller was a nervous, timid type, likely a physical coward.
he also used turns of phrase current in the dc area gay community.

- hot, dry and rocky yet built up and cut away by water.
only the toughest survive or those who have made extraordinary adaptations to life in the wild west
canyonlands is harsh, survival here is hard-won and the game never ends.
for millennia predator and prey have faced each other in this unforgiving arena.
it's a no win for the lion or a scavenging raven.
flight gives the raven the freedom of the 100,000 square kilometres of rocky landscape that make up the canyon country in the southwest of the united states.
it's a clever opportunist, ready to hunt or scavenge anything it can find as it roams the empty skies.
maybe its freedom and character inspired native americans to look on the soaring raven as a sacred spirit ¡­ and a creator of the land.
and to many this land means the wild west but its history goes back way beyond human imagination.
over hundreds of millions of years, the elements have sculpted solid stone into forms that leave us speechless in awe.
torrents of water from flashfloods, trickles from occasional rain, freezing water from snowmelt in the mountains and hidden water in underground streams.
water from primordial floods and even from ancient warm seas that covered and recovered this land a score of times, and finally left it as a desert where water is scarce and valuable.
all along, time has worked as a partner with water and 320 million years on they still shape this land.
mammals have roamed the earth for 200 million years but only those that can cope with the harsh conditions of canyonlands have made this their home
for a young bobcat, newly free of its mother, much has to be learned very quickly.
adults are solitary, and this youngster must stake a claim on a viable territory of its own.
these territories are marked out with invisible sign posts like scent and urine, and the best ones have access to all-elusive water.
water is crucial to the bobcat's survival, especially when summer temperatures can soar above 35 degrees
but to an inexperienced bobcat, water can be a mixed blessing.
flash floods from rainstorms and springtime melt-water can dramatically swell streams into challenging torrents.
and for a cat this size, about half a metre to the shoulder, the river is also a boundary, which larger mammals can ignore.
the bobcat is a small lynx and an experienced adult might take a young mule deer, but this juvenile will have to make do with smaller game.
they survive in the desert by adapting their diet to whatever is plentiful at the time so this youngster must always be on the look out for new sources of food.
the success of a bobcat will depend on its ability to find a good territory that can supply its needs for food and shelter throughout the year.
- or so the saying goes, but out here it's the key to success.
you never know what you might find around the next corner.
american badgers hunt at night when it is cool and dark and prey is more vulnerable.
a sensitive nose and very powerful claws make him a frightening foe.
it's the grasshopper or killer mouse, and it's really not as sweet as it looks.
unusually this mouse has a taste for meat and may even take on small mammals
a painful sting but the killer mouse is immune¡­ and lives up to its name.
a mouse's life may be measured in months yet the land it walks on is measured in eons.
whatever the scale, time rolls on and the cycle of the seasons rolls with it.
the mild autumn is passing and canyonlands digs in for winter and the harsh chill it brings.
in the nearby mountains snow and ice will be hoarded immobile until spring.
then it will finally melt into run-off that will feed canyonlands' rivers and streams.
once the niceties are done with, the pair will mate, and with luck in three weeks new ravens will hatch.
spring is the season when young prairie dogs emerge from their underground homes.
it's their time to grow and forage¡­ and it's also time for them to encounter their role as prey.
the golden eagle is canyonlands' largest bird of prey, and prairie dogs are a staple of its diet.
the eagle is nurturing new life in the only way it knows how, and in turn, so is the prairie dog¡­
and despite the casualties of survival, new life continues to thrive.
one trait of all life here is the ability to survive with a bare minimum.
to succeed where others cannot, honeypot ants have taken adaptation to extremes.
highly specialized workers have evolved to become living reservoirs storing nutritious nectar in their bodies for the summer drought ahead.
like stuffed diners, they are called "repletes", and their only job is to save the colony from starvation.
the repletes are too vulnerable to leave the nest, so other specialized workers take on the job of collecting nectar on the flowers and plants nearby, then bringing it back to the colony.
hanging upside down, the repletes await more deliveries but the workers' first duty is to feed the colony's queen.
now the repletes are given more to store, and their grape-size bellies distend even larger.
all the while, the queen's attendants will take her new eggs to the nursery.
the chances for the survival of each tiny egg are good, for by ingeniously storing reserves of food, one of canyonlands' smallest creatures has solved the greatest problem.
nothing here is taken for granted workers constantly scavenge for dead insects.
each nutritious carcass will be carefully dissected and placed into the chambers of developing larvae.
the next generation of honeypot ants will feed on them as they grow.
specialisation helps ensure success, and all over canyonlands insects inhabit their own unique niches.
after dusk, the evening primrose opens its flowers to release its perfume.
the scent carries on the night air and attracts the nocturnal sphinx moth.
the moths find the primrose scent irresistible, and the primrose depends on the moths to reproduce.
as the moth drinks the flower's sweet nectar, it unwittingly pollinates the plant.
once the strategy has succeeded, the flowers soon fade and die.
the desperate beetle employs its ultimate defense a foul, blinding spray from its rear.
the attacker is stunned but a killer mouse never gives up.
the mild days of spring are short-lived, and as summer approaches
canyonlands sends reminders of what a hot, parched place it will become.
but there are a few secret corners that call to mind a kinder past.
tiny rivulets of water escape the porous rock and descend to shaded alcoves called hanging gardens.
these oases are a small reminder of canyonlands' lush, wetter past when seas covered what is now a searing desert.
but a desert this is, and if any young animal is to survive here now it needs to hone its skills whenever it can¡­
the litter of killer mice has grown up, so more tiny predators are on the prowl.
grasshopper looks good to a month-old mouse, but might just be a bit ambitious.
the only problem will be keeping it away from the rest of the litter.
the transition from dependant offspring to independent adult is a crucial rite of passage for any animal and for many this vital step is imminent.
instinct tells the raven that now is the time for the chicks to fledge.
the parents fly past the nest repeatedly to urge the chicks out.
it's hardly a full-fledged flight, but the mother quickly swoops in to reward the chick with food.
once the chick is out of the nest, it cannot return.
the mother can only repeat the demonstration and wait for progress.
late spring sometimes brings wet weather, but rain here can be a false promise.
it takes a great downpour to make it to the desert floor, and when it does the drenching can be intense.
the cloudburst passes as quickly as it came, but for a moment canyonlands is refreshed.
this brief deluge can be the difference between life and death.
water is so scarce that creatures seem tuned to take advantage instantly.
the mother tries again to encourage an exit with a demonstration.
still no go, but its siblings are keen to test their wings.
it's strange to see the symbol of canyonlands' free skies having so much trouble getting off the ground.
stuck between a rock and a hard place the chick must take its siblings' lead.
at the end of a tiring day the chick passes its first test and flies to its family.
with each rite of passage the chicks will become more independent, and independence is the only way forward in this harsh desert land.
the raven has the freedom of canyonlands, but what does this freedom bring?
maybe the chance to stake a claim on one of the few wildernesses left in the modern world.
and i know this guy who lives alone and could probably use some company.
well, i don't think she and al would get along together.
and the parrot that lives in there now just doesn't appreciate it.
i should warn you i'm not the easiest person to live with.
i'm just saying i don't know how you can think about hawaii right now.
if i was in hawaii right now, i wouldn't think about being here.
told you there was a lot of good hiding places on this body.
bet you got a lot of good hiding spots on that body, too.
therefore, i am forced to hire the likes of mr. cutlass supreme whom, i might add, contributes significantly to my overhead.
i'm the real loser here, and i'm concerned about your sincerity in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt that is one week past due.
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
i can make your life fucking miserable, that's what i can do.
then i have to stay up all night trying to convince them that i have needs, too.
the point of which is, i already have a fucking miserable life so don't threaten me, you lousy bag of cat shit.
picture me under some swaying palms, sipping on a mai tai.
you got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th?
we lay down a trail, we make it nice and logical.
we're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom.
whatever the hell i was supposed to have done happened last friday night?
you better have a good alibi, james, or it's good ali-bye-bye.
when a federal undercover officer goes down it's never a fucking murder case.
look, i don't like the dea on my ass any more than you like them on yours but this is personal for them, and they want answers.
forget your other cases and get me something, anything i can give to them.
the last thing i want is the goddamn fbi on my back, too.
i don't need to get screwed up waiting for something good to happen.
i want you to know that love is important to me.
and i'm loyal to you like i am loyal to my partner.
we are closer than blood, and i trust him with my life.
and it was just two hours later, on that same friday night when the defendant, clyde dunner entered the home of george and carol beeman a.44 caliber pistol in his hand.
he entered that house with one thing in mind to kill george and carol.
george was killed instantly, hit in the face, and carol died later three bullet wounds to her chest.
and then the defendant, in an effort to cover up his crime doused them both with lighter fluid and set the house on fire.
why didn't you use the fucking gun from the kennedy murder?
listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a goddamn undercover cop did we need to find a fucking.44 for evidence.
otherwise, we would've never needed it, so don't point your finger at me.
i mean, all i want in life is a goddamn fishing boat a couple of drinks, a beach and some hawaiian music.
that's not much to ask for 20 years putting murdering assholes behind bars, is it?
we got two stiffs on the pavement, shot to shit, three more inside.
that's five chalk outlines in one day in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
you know, they don't answer a knock, and the door's open it's been my experience...
you know, i wanted to make sure there were no bodies lying around.
can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here?
i mean, what do i have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car?
i have joined the defense in the representation of mr. william daine mccall otherwise known to this court as joe doe.
i represented the mccall family for several years before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago.
the man who signed the confession as joe doe... ... is actually william dalne mccall, brother of nathan mccall.
both are sons of the founder of mccall international... ... a corporation involved in telecommunications... ... computer design and development and other related industries.
...when he pulled this gun and fired at agent hudd killing him instantly.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime:
we have the blood test report showing that he had four times the legal limit to drive.
but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for?
now, this trial is the people v. william mccall not "joe."
the name joe has never been mentioned in this trial so how did you know who i was talking about?
if you cared about seeing justice for your dead comrade you wouldn't blow this deal.
immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop.
i'm just saying i don't know how you can think about hawaii right now.
if i was in hawaii right now, i wouldn't think about being here.
told you there was a lot of good hiding places on this body.
bet you got a lot of good hiding spots on that body, too.
i cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts.
therefore, i am forced to hire the likes of mr. cutlass supreme... whom, i might add, contributes significantly to my overhead.
i'm the real loser here, and i'm concerned about your sincerity... in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt... that is one week past due.
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
i loan money at excessively high interest rates... to pricks like you who can't control their urge... to lose big money playing cards.
then i have to stay up all night... trying to convince them that i have needs, too.
as of last night, partner, i have enough to make the down.
picture me under some swaying palms, sipping on a mai tai.
look, i don't like the dea on my ass any more than you like them on yours... but this is personal for them, and they want answers.
forget your other cases and get me something, anything i can give to them.
- but more important is loyalty... 'cause loyalty is about respect.
and i'm loyal to you... like i am loyal to my partner.
they were sitting on their couch watching television... when the defendant entered the living room... and opened fire.
george was killed instantly, hit in the face, and carol died later... three bullet wounds to her chest.
listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a goddamn undercover cop... did we need to find a fucking.44 for evidence.
we got two stiffs on the pavement, shot to shit, three more inside.
that's five chalk outlines in one day... in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
you know, they don't answer a knock, and the door's open... it's been my experience...
you know, i wanted to make sure there were no bodies lying around.
can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here?
i mean, what do i have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car?
i represented the mccall family for several years... before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago.
it was assumed that he had died... but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances...
both are sons of the founder of mccall international... a corporation involved in telecommunications... computer design and development and other related industries.
the net worth of both men is estimated at over $1 billion.
...when he pulled this gun and fired at agent hudd... killing him instantly.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime:
we have the blood test report showing... that he had four times the legal limit to drive.
but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for?
now, this trial is the people v. william mccall... not "joe."

- told you there's a lot of good hiding' places on this body.
bet you got a lotta good hiding' spots on that body too.
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
- i can make your life fuckin' miserable, that's what i could do.
picture me under some swinging palms sipping on a mai thai.
- you've got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th?
♫ keep your eyes on the money and the cops nigga
♫ it's time for you to feel the real born ridahs
- so whatever the hell i was supposed to have done, happened last friday night?
- you better have a good alibi, james, or it's good ali-bye-bye.
it's only three days, this is a god damn big murder case, and we need a little god damn time.
- when a federal undercover officer goes down it's never a fuckin' murder case.
i'm fine now, i don't need to get all screwed up waiting for somethin' good to happen.
- i want you to know that love is important to me.
- why didn't you just use the fuckin' gun from the fucking kidding murder?
- listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a god damn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence.
otherwise, we would of never fucking needed it so don't point your finger at me.
- joe, you don't know very much about yourself, do you?
but you remember the night you shot the man in the car?
- i don't give a fuck about clyde, or you fuck us right now.
- look, it's like you said, he signed the confession, right?
- besides, i knew there's a good chance of beating the charges for lack of evidence.
- look, nobody can connect us to the evidence, then we're clean there.
- i mean, all i want in life is a god damn fishing boat, a couple of drinks, a beach, and some hawaiian fuckin' music.
that's not much to ask for 20 years of putting murdering assholes behind bars, is it?
- then we got no god damn witness puts him at the scene.
- yeah well then what if she testifies and nobody fuckin' believes her?
that's five chalk outlines in one day, in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
just let me fill you in on some fuckin' statistics here, okay?
yeah look, well look, she's a witness in a murder case, all right?
you know, they don't answer a knock and a door is open, it's been my experience, you know,
- when it was discovered that the man who confessed to killing an undercover dea agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years.
the man who signed the confession as joe doe is actually william dane mccall, brother of nathan mccall.
both are sons of the founder of mccall international, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development, and other related industries.
the net worth of both men is estimated at over one billion dollars.
why didn't you get the pope and pin the fuckin' murder on him?
- here, he disappeared seven years ago on september 19th, two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident.
at the same time, it was assumed that he returned to africa but that was never comfirmed.
what william mccall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel.
- look, she's our god damn witness and if she's in custody, somebody better fuckin' tell me.
- try to get at me as soon as you can, bye.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime, a smith and wesson .44 caliber handgun.
- all these .44's are starting to look the same to me.
- yeah, you remember seeing mr. mccall, you remembered a gun shot and a car crash.
i just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart.

the point of which is, i already have a fucking miserable life so don't threaten me, you lousy bag of cat shit.
picture me under some swaying palms, sipping on a mai tai.
you got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th?
we lay down a trail, we make it nice and logical.
we're the teachers and two and two can add up to five if it's our classroom.
whatever the hell i was supposed to have done happened last friday night?
you better have a good alibi, james, or it's good ali-bye-bye.
when a federal undercover officer goes down it's never a fucking murder case.
look, i don't like the dea on my ass any more than you like them on yours but this is personal for them, and they want answers.
forget your other cases and get me something, anything i can give to them.
the last thing i want is the goddamn fbi on my back, too.
i don't need to get screwed up waiting for something good to happen.
i want you to know that love is important to me.
and i'm loyal to you like i am loyal to my partner.
we are closer than blood, and i trust him with my life.
and it was just two hours later, on that same friday night when the defendant, clyde dunner entered the home of george and carol beeman a.44 caliber pistol in his hand.
he entered that house with one thing in mind to kill george and carol.
george was killed instantly, hit in the face, and carol died later three bullet wounds to her chest.
and then the defendant, in an effort to cover up his crime doused them both with lighter fluid and set the house on fire.
why didn't you use the fucking gun from the kennedy murder?
listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a goddamn undercover cop did we need to find a fucking.44 for evidence.
otherwise, we would've never needed it, so don't point your finger at me.
i mean, all i want in life is a goddamn fishing boat a couple of drinks, a beach and some hawaiian music.
that's not much to ask for 20 years putting murdering assholes behind bars, is it?
we got two stiffs on the pavement, shot to shit, three more inside.
that's five chalk outlines in one day in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
you know, they don't answer a knock, and the door's open it's been my experience...
you know, i wanted to make sure there were no bodies lying around.
can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here?
i mean, what do i have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car?
i have joined the defense in the representation of mr. william daine mccall otherwise known to this court as joe doe.
i represented the mccall family for several years before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago.
the man who signed the confession as joe doe... ... is actually william dalne mccall, brother of nathan mccall.
both are sons of the founder of mccall international... ... a corporation involved in telecommunications... ... computer design and development and other related industries.
...when he pulled this gun and fired at agent hudd killing him instantly.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime:
we have the blood test report showing that he had four times the legal limit to drive.
but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for?
now, this trial is the people v. william mccall not "joe."
the name joe has never been mentioned in this trial so how did you know who i was talking about?
if you cared about seeing justice for your dead comrade you wouldn't blow this deal.
immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop.
i'm just saying i don't know how you can think about hawaii right now.
if i was in hawaii right now, i wouldn't think about being here.
told you there was a lot of good hiding places on this body.
bet you got a lot of good hiding spots on that body, too.
i cannot rely on a late fee as sufficient encouragement to repay one's debts.
therefore, i am forced to hire the likes of mr. cutlass supreme... whom, i might add, contributes significantly to my overhead.
i'm the real loser here, and i'm concerned about your sincerity... in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt... that is one week past due.
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
i loan money at excessively high interest rates... to pricks like you who can't control their urge... to lose big money playing cards.
then i have to stay up all night... trying to convince them that i have needs, too.
as of last night, partner, i have enough to make the down.
picture me under some swaying palms, sipping on a mai tai.
look, i don't like the dea on my ass any more than you like them on yours... but this is personal for them, and they want answers.
forget your other cases and get me something, anything i can give to them.
- but more important is loyalty... 'cause loyalty is about respect.
and i'm loyal to you... like i am loyal to my partner.
they were sitting on their couch watching television... when the defendant entered the living room... and opened fire.
george was killed instantly, hit in the face, and carol died later... three bullet wounds to her chest.
listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a goddamn undercover cop... did we need to find a fucking.44 for evidence.
we got two stiffs on the pavement, shot to shit, three more inside.
that's five chalk outlines in one day... in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
you know, they don't answer a knock, and the door's open... it's been my experience...
you know, i wanted to make sure there were no bodies lying around.
can't we keep our evidence and witnesses from disappearing around here?
i mean, what do i have to do, lock them in the trunk of my car?
i represented the mccall family for several years... before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago.
it was assumed that he had died... but since he has reappeared under these tragic circumstances...
both are sons of the founder of mccall international... a corporation involved in telecommunications... computer design and development and other related industries.
the net worth of both men is estimated at over $1 billion.
...when he pulled this gun and fired at agent hudd... killing him instantly.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime:
we have the blood test report showing... that he had four times the legal limit to drive.
but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for?

immunity for her testimony is a small price for a bad cop.

therefore, i am forced to hire the likes of mr. cutlass supreme .
and i'm concerned about your sincerity in repaying the $27,942 gambling debt that is one week past due.
what can you do to reassure me of your good intentions?
picture me under some swinging palms sipping on a mai thai.
- you've got primary on the drug related this morning on 27th?
hudd was a friend of mine and i am gonna nail the son of a bitch who killed him.
- look, we're gonna do everything we can to help you.
- [rodriguez] do we look like fuckin' track stars to you?
what are we fuckin' track stars and we here to fuckin' run?
- when a federal undercover officer goes down it's never a fuckin' murder case.
look, i don't like the dea on my ass anymore than you like 'em on yours but this is personal for them and they want answers.
the last thing i want is the god damn fbi on my back too.
- [frank] all right, look, we got a few leads, all right?
you know what, you remember and i'll give you a little somethin' to drink.
joe, you've got to remember how you saw him driving towards you and you were in the street and you were afraid that he was gonna hit you so you shot him.
- [frank] listen, our shooting was supposed to be gang related and unsolved.
only because we popped a god damn undercover cop do we need the fucking .44 for evidence.
- joe, you don't know very much about yourself, do you?
but you remember the night you shot the man in the car?
- without that they're gonna put clyde back on the streets.
- [frank] i don't give a fuck about clyde, or you fuck us right now.
i swear to god, frank, if we let clyde get back on the streets he's gonna kill again.
- [frank] how did that little piece of fuckin' puke know that wasn't his damn gun?
- i mean, all i want in life is a god damn fishing boat, a couple of drinks, a beach, and some hawaiian fuckin' music.
that's not much to ask for 20 years of putting murdering assholes behind bars, is it?
- [elliot] okay, trial date is set for thursday- [joe] i've been thinking about what i did.
i don't think that it's right that i should try getting off.
we got two stiffs on the pavement shot to shit, three more inside.
that's five chalk outlines in one day, in one deal, in one neighborhood, in one city.
yeah look, well look, she's a witness in a murder case, all right?
you know, they don't answer a knock and a door is open, it's been my experience, you know,
i have joined the defense and the representation of mr. william dane mccall, otherwise known to this court as joe doe.
i have represented the mccall family for several years before mr. mccall disappeared seven years ago.
- when it was discovered that the man who confessed to killing an undercover dea agent, was actually himself thought dead for seven years.
the man who signed the confession as joe doe is actually william dane mccall, brother of nathan mccall.
both are sons of the founder of mccall international, a corporation involved in telecommunications, computer design and development, and other related industries.
the net worth of both men is estimated at over one billion dollars.
why didn't you get the pope and pin the fuckin' murder on him?
- here, he disappeared seven years ago on september 19th, two weeks after the tragic death of his wife and two young children in a multiple vehicle accident.
at the same time, it was assumed that he returned to africa but that was never comfirmed.
what william mccall has been doing for seven years is now the mystery that the court will try to help unravel.
- [frank] look, she's our god damn witness and if she's in custody, somebody better fuckin' tell me.
- [rodriguez] try to get at me as soon as you can, bye.
- [eden] we he pulled this gun, and fired at agent hudd, killing him instantly.
let the record show that this is the weapon used in the crime, a smith and wesson .44 caliber handgun.
- all these .44's are starting to look the same to me.
- [eden] so when you arrested the defendant, did he deny having killed agent hudd?
- we have the blood test report that shows that he had four times the legal limit to drive.
- [elliot] but you knew that this was the man that you were looking for?
- [elliot] where you aware that miss web disappeared after she was served with a subpoena?
- um, yes, um, my partner and i tried to contact her about the case but we were unsuccessful in our attempts.
- could you please describe for us, what you saw on the night of june 14?
- [cynthia] i was coming out of this all night mini-mart.
- yeah, you remember seeing mr. mccall, you remembered a gun shot and a car crash.
i just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini-mart.
i'm just trying to establish what the scene was like there that night.
- [judge pine] try to get there as quickly as possible.
j1 i give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
j1 roll a perfect blunt and let me spark it for ya
j1 while i'm starin' at the world through my rear view
j1 they got me starin at the world through my rearview
j1 go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
j1 i can feel your heart beatin' fast cause it's time to die
j1 who is gonna catch me when i fall or even care to
j1 while you thinkin' i see you lost up in my rear view

j1 in the cell, counting' days in this livin' black hell
j1 go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
j1 i can feel your heart beatin fast 'cause it's time to die
j1 shit's deep, turn eighteen, burn my will when i go

j1 go on baby scream to god, he can't hear you
j1 i can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
if i don't find the cause of this rash, it will be difficult to treat.
last night, i had a dream about being sick with the mendakan pox when i was nine.
we'd be happy to provide your doctor with some dna samples for comparison.
what i want to know is how i couid have gotten them.
his dna was encoded with certain instincts, including the desire to explore space.
your "accident" may have brought him here faster, but he always would have been driven to find his way back.
i want to thank you again for your help in combating the nasari.
do you have any idea why they tried to attack us?
i think eventually they'ii tire of waiting for you to come out.
in the meantime, i'd advise you to simply stay here for a while.
even if we can't wait them out, we may only be postponing another conflict.
i'd much rather find a way to convince them we're not their enemies.
with any luck, we'ii be back in a few hours with this matter resolved.
i joined the merchant fleet so i couid get into space because i wanted to explore every corner of the galaxy.
my best advice to you is to forget him, and be on your way.
do you think there's any truth to those rumors he mentioned?
do you have any idea how this new dna could have gotten into his cells?
the most likely transfer mechanism would be a retrovirus-- he was probably exposed during an away mission.
the transporter buffer performs its own version of a microcellular scan every time someone uses it.
i reviewed the logs and found the first appearance of the alien genes in his molecular pattern on stardate 50698.
our away mission to that planet where we found the voriiiium.
harry was with us and he was separated from the group for a while.
he might have been infected by something he ate or drank, even something he touched.
so harry gets infused with alien dna, which gives him the instinctive urge to come here.
you have a responsibility to your people to pass on your genes to the next generation.
if there's anything your taresian genes have given you, it's a sense of duty and loyalty.
it would have been much easier for you if you hadn't seen this.
you mean easier for you to lead me to the slaughter.
it's true male children are very rare here and that we seek out new dna to sustain our race.
we need males of other species-- iike you-- who can be transformed into compatible mates.
he told his crew to cover their ears so they couldn't hear the sirens' song.
but he also had them tie him to the mast of the ship so he could listen himself without being led astray as they sailed past.
well, i, for one, am glad to have a young ensign kim back with us.
although i still say you should have kept some of those spots.
if i don't find the cause of this rash, it will be difficult to treat.

i joined the merchant fleet so i could get into space because i wanted to explore every corner of the galaxy.
that's what my human parents used to say to me-- how special i was.
they'd been trying to have a baby for years until i came along.
do you think there's any truth to those rumors he mentioned?
i don't know, but i'll feel better when we've got harry back.
within a few days, he'll be indistinguishable from a native taresian.
do you have any idea how this new dna could have gotten into his cells?
i reviewed the logs and found the first appearance of the alien genes in his molecular pattern on stardate 50698.
our away mission to that planet where we found the vorillium.
harry was with us and he was separated from the group for a while.
he might have been infected by something he ate or drank, even something he touched.
so harry gets infused with alien dna, which gives him the instinctive urge to come here.
then the taresians tell him this elaborate story to make him believe he was one of them.
it sounds as if they're giving him every incentive to want to stay on taresia.
and by keeping us away, they're making the decision for him.
if there's anything your taresian genes have given you, it's a sense of duty and loyalty.
my loyalty is to my crew and my family back home.
if we hit the grid here, we'll have a few seconds before the patrol ship can move in to intercept us.
that doesn't give you much time to get a lock on harry.
there was also something exciting about having a new identity... being more than just "young ensign kim."
well, i, for one, am glad to have a young ensign kim back with us.
i trust your intentions, ensign, but your actions are going to need a little more justification.
i want you to analyze the sensor logs and see if there's any basis for mr. kim's hunch.
well, the good news is i won't have to quarantine you.
there's no sign of an infectious agent anywhere in your body.
no, but it's not consistent with the symptoms of the mendakan pox.
doctor, you don't think there could be any, uh... psychological effects from this disease, do you?
after the implantation process, the child begins to incorporate some dna from the surrogate parent.
you developed physically as a human, so she would have thought you were her natural child.
your "accident" may have brought him here faster, but he always would have been driven to find his way back.
you are the first to return from such a great distance.
do you have any idea why they tried to attack us?
they probably detected a taresian aboard your ship, as we did.
we have no interest in fighting with them, but they seem determined to destroy us.
our defense capabilities prevent them from attacking directly, but they do everything in their power to stop our people from returning home.
are the nasari likely to attack us again when we leave your space?
i think eventually they'ii tire of waiting for you to come out.
and he's becoming more like them every day, both physically and neurologically.
i wonder how that's going to influence him when voyager's ready to leave?
aii three ships are holding position just outside the taresian system.
even if we can't wait them out, we may only be postponing another conflict.

skinning dead mice tinker i, but dissecting cow's eyes ... i a film i saw somebody cut in one eye, but it followed him with his eyes.
he operated it in the pan so he could zoom in people with it.
over 600 got killed yesterday during the gulf war plane crashes and russian train disaster
if they had had perfect legs that can walk fast without taking trains or planes they wouldn't have died
considering my plight, i'll at worst be confined in an asylum if you arrest me
i'll get out in no time and come back to you again
(quinn) what if you found a portal to a parallel universe?
what if you could slide into a thousand different worlds where it's the same year, and you're the same person, but everything else is different?
airman cooper said you gave him orders to shoot jariabek on sight.
now, how the hell am i supposed to command a squad when i don't know what's going on, sir?
now, the beam is on all the time but you only see it as it passes through your field of vision.
(quinn) pulsars have a similar narrow beam, only their ejecta is radiation, not light.
just because i wear this uniform doesn't mean i agree with everything we do.
on my world, an officer would resign rather than perform a dishonorable act.
and i would sing as loud and off-key as i wanted.
because i knew that nobody else would hear or make fun of me.
sat 7 just picked up a globular cluster of pulsars approaching our solar system.
that pulsar that's about to hit the russians, it's only the lead piece from a collapsing galaxy.
(rickman) warning the russians would have revealed our star wars technology to the chinese.
which, in the bigger picture, would have put american lives at stake.
one of the quirks about sliding is that some worlds are almost identical to your own.
well, then maybe this is the world we've been looking for.
yeah, the only solace might be with your loved ones when it's time.
now it looks like malcolm won't even have that little bit of comfort.
just that you've had 20 people fall into a coma within the past three months.
now, i don't think that a smart man could just write it off as a coincidence.
i don't wanna be the one to cross people's names off the list.
i know it's difficult, but we must take the brightest and the best.
yeah, but the new chip should be up and running well before then.
we calculate it will be powerful enough to transport 300 people for at least one slide.
(announcer) reports out of atlanta indicate the destruction in that region is widespread.
emergency crews have been swamped with calls and local hospitals are reporting [banging] severe shortage of critical supplies.
they`ll give us more time if we hand over a first-rate witness.
i know you`ll refuse, but it`s essential we at least pretend to comply, just to gain time.
literature is a barbarian probe, slicing through all that filthy culture.
when they turn out the light, its snout still sniffs at the sunrise.
that`s not so bad if you admit it to yourself and act accordingly.
the problem is, he hid it from himself, he started to lie... to lie to himself.
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
forgive me, sir, but don't you consider this a ploy by chief holst to delay the trial?
whatever his reasons, he has a list of three military lawyers, all women.
now, i have a short time to prepare, so forgive me if you've been over this before.
as long as we get one thing straight from the beginning, major.
anything worth noting about the location in which you found ensign felker's body?
only that people go there at night to watch the submarine races, sir.
wire cutters, like most cutting devices, leave a specific signature, not unlike the marks a gun barrel will leave on a bullet.
we matched the cut on one end of the garrote wire, with a pair of wire cutters that we found in chief holst's locked tool box in the machinist shop.
at the picnic, he called me a whore in front of everybody.
i guess i decided if he was gonna call me a whore, then i'd act like one.
when ensign sims and i were helping liz holst move, we came across some letters addressed to mrs. holst from petty officer carlos.
yeah, well, it's comforting to know that holst's friends can write.
and petty officer carlos declared his love in these letters that you and sims just happened to find?
in ways that will make you blush when you read them.
especially since petty officer carlos was probably still at the bar during the murder.
so if they convict freddy, they could sentence him to death.
this photo was taken at 0134, the night of the murder.
it contains a section of beach that you're quite familiar with.
i've allowed it under the condition that this is the last time.
forgive me, sir, but don't you consider this a ploy by chief holst to delay the trial?
now, i have a short time to prepare, so forgive me if you've been over this before.
as long as we get one thing straight from the beginning, major.
if you help me, mrs. holst, i can put him away.
i say anything against him, and he'll kill me if he gets off.

the thing is, i'd seen it before at the same time.
just about the time the coroner said that ensign felker was killed.
i guess this is another one of those things you'd be just as happy not knowing anything about.
we've been working our sixes off for that miserable lying son-of-a-bitch!
it contains a section of beach that you're quite familiar with.
will you please tell the court what you see in the photo, mrs. holst?
i've allowed it under the condition that this is the last time.

i guess i decided if he was gonna call me a whore, then i'd act like one.
especially since petty officer carlos was probably still at the bar during the murder.
so if they convict freddy, they could sentence him to death.
the thing is, i'd seen it before at the same time.
just about the time the coroner said that ensign felker was killed.
i guess this is another one of those things you'd be just as happy not knowing anything about.
we've been working our sixes off for that miserable lying son-of-a-bitch!
it contains a section of beach that you're quite familiar with.
will you please tell the court what you see in the photo, mrs. holst?
look, vic walsh may have loved you, but he was grooming me to take over.
now, why would i remove the guy that's gonna make me king?
what i do care about are the other people that are gonna die if i don't get frank dwyer.
now, i need ray goetz to do that, and i don't need you under my feet hey!
joe, do you know that everybody in this joint is lookin' at ya?
oh, hey, are you sure nobody came across a wedding ring here yesterday?
oh, yeah, after you left, the chief gave us a forfeiture fund.
we now use the confiscated drug money to pay for information.
bridges would assume that i'd think he'd think we'd go south on the 101.
knowing that, we shouldn't go south on the 101, we should go east on the 92 and pick up the 880.
well, that bond was bought by another company called "tower bail bonds."
they're the ones that hired bettina to track down ray goetz.
if you take goetz back to las vegas, dwyer will kill him.
which wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would be murder.
look, i-i just made this innocent observation that women seemed more attracted to him than me because he doesn't wear a wedding ring.
oh, so you took off your wedding ring so you'd be more attractive to other women?
look, i know we have our differences, but this is no time to show anything but unity.
frankie, listen, if it's loyalty you want, you can count on mine.
i bet if it was his ring we were looking for you'd be a little bit more cooperative, huh?
if it was his ring, i'd have to think about it.
oh, well, from what we understand, uh, you're gonna pay murray here for some information.
but i'm gonna tell ya, it's gonna go to the highest bidder.
i'm trying to find a jeweler in the city that can duplicate my wedding ring.
bubba, you don't think that your wife is not gonna notice that, uh, it's a different ring than the one you've been wearing for the last 23 years?
you know what's amazing is that not only do you come up with these schemes, you actually follow through on them.
hey, you know, you can't tell the difference, and neither will inger.
vic walsh would've accomplished the play that you're tryin' to make without spilling' a drop a blood.
but now, you on the other hand, you're somewhat of a klutz, aren't ya?
the bail bond on ray goetz was issued from a company out of las vegas called "mcmillan bail bonds."
well, that bond was bought by another company called "tower bail bonds."
which wouldn't be the end of the world, but it would be murder.
and you would be an accessory, that is, if dwyer lets you live.
look, honey, i-i don't want you to think that i lie to you, because i don't.
it's just that i know how you feel about these rings.
like when she rewashes the kids' clothes... and then she rewashes the kids.
look, all that stuff my mom does, that's how she helps.
just because we are family, and happen also to be neighbors... does not give you the right to constantly interfere... in every aspect of my iife...
"from raising my children to my choice of liquid fabric softener."
that is all i want, too... is for us to be a family, a real family.
well, i always thought that you didn't like my being in your family.
¡®from raising my children to my choice of liquid fabric softener.¡¯
i want you guys to know right now that debra has a drinking problem.
a prisoner locked up in solitary confinement for a long time... began to think fondly of a fly that had somehow found its way in.
and one day... when the fly disappeared... the prisoner started to lose his mind.
just like the wind, you feel it but you can't see it.
soon the blue wind will blow, and move the big forest.
you came to kill me in order to stop the bloodshed.
every man is like his brother, that also holds true for you.
tomorrow the wind will die down... and it will brighten in the afternoon.
"tell me about lily, a japanese man, and a boy and earn $500,000 taiwan dollars.

record that the witch denies the authority of a holy inquisition.
i know this man and believe me if you were to champion her and win,
beaumanoir would simply say the devil guides your actions and burn her anyway.
may i suggest we allow bois guilbert to prove his innocence once and for all by standing as the court's champion?
then does my oath to you cancel my lifelong pledge to athelstane?
my lord, we have all seen what happens when two men strive for the same throne.
the lord is my shepherd... therefore will i fear no evil.
he makes me lie down in green fields, and with his staff and sword he will protect me.
she even had the impertinence to quote our own psalms to me.
to be fair, my lord, they were her psalms ere they were ours.
you came running to me as ever you did in your childhood when richard bested you at sport or at the hunt or wherever else your mean little spirit felt itself inadequate.
was it just to assume the throne of england when your brother had expressly forbidden you to set foot in the country in his absence?
john may be a miserable little runt, but at least he's been here.
he kept the country from bankruptcy and he dragged it from the chaos in which you left it.
i, henry bohun, earl of essex and lord high constable of england... do make arrest of albert de malvoisin.
by order of richard plantagenet, here present... you are guilty of treason and will die within the week.
appeal to whom you choose, once you're out of this country.
or would you prefer to share our english hospitality or suffer our english justice?
my body is warm and my heart is full of love.
i see his face and i think of him in the arms of that... witch.
every moment of every year that i have spent apart from ivanhoe has been a torment to me.
have you come here to remind me that so many of those moments were spent with you?
it's so good to finally meet everyone, i've heard so much about you.
well we've heard nothing about you, so we'll ask all the questions.
wow, can't remember the last time i pinged in a photo.
so gail, you were just about to tell us how you and ted met.
well i always give because i'm e negative, which is kind of rare.
so, just as the nurse sticks me she points to ted on the next cot and tells me he's e negative too.
hey if we have time maybe we could stop by the arcade.
these little flash lights were more fun when i was five.
no, i think he just didn't want to rub our noses in it.
at least he hasn't tried to have a man to man talk with me.
i mean he's fun and thoughtful and kind, and if there's a good movie on he'll let you stay up late.
i'm well aware of your father's good points, that's why i said yes when you asked if i thought we'd get married.
why don't you call her in peru, see how she's doing?
i talked to her yesterday, i just wish i could see her.
according to my analysis, there are at ieast 12 more asteroids heading in our direction.
how can we hope to destroy them all even with your help?
mr. paris, can we send a shuttle down through that turbulence?
it would be a rough ride, but i think it's possible.
i requested a place on the rescue team as part of my starfieet training and the captain said yes.
so, i thought it might be useful to bring along a few extra medical supplies.
i saw what appeared to be an orbital tether anchored nearby.
yes, we use those to lift cargo from the surface to the orbital supply stations.
maybe we can replace the coils with attitude control thrusters from the shuttle.
it would take a little creative mechanics, but i think we can do it.
it looks like a control node for some kind of guidance system.
ambassador, i have a feeling these asteroids aren't striking your planet by chance.
yes, but they were basically identical to real mag-iev carriages-- same principles, same mechanical components.
i was planning to familiarize myself with all the systems on this carriage.
captain, i'm getting more detailed sensor readings on the approaching asteroid.
it's huge-- over half a kilometer in diameter-- and it's moving faster than the others.
then if we can't fix this air supply, you may be the only one left to pilot this thing.
i'd better start showing you how to use the ascent thrusters.
now we have a choice between death by suffocation or death by poisoning.
i will conduct an investigation once we return to the ship.
you don't have any gut feelings and you don't really understand people.
but non-vuicans have feelings and they have to listen to them.
once the population has evacuated, they arrive and stake their claim.
but they didn't expect voyager to intervene, so they arrived before our colonies had been evacuated.
i thought you should know that i have submitted my mission report to the captain.
i have given you a special commendation for your endurance and bravery.

"i saw in his hands a long golden spear, and at the tip of the iron there seemed to be a little fire.
this i thought that he thrust several times into my heart, and that it penetrated to my entrails.
when he drew out the spear, he seemed to be drawing them with it, leaving me all on fire with a wondrous love for god.
the pain was so great that it caused me to utter several moans;
and yet so exceedingly sweet is this greatest of pains that it is impossible to desire to be rid of it,
it is not bodily pain, but spiritual, though the body has a share in it, indeed, a great share.
your irrepressible forms of suffering don't fit within known categories, are inexpressible in any known terms:
recurring pain that cannot be grasped, incurable pain hovering outside thought, pain of neither body nor soul, but a pain that resembles both.

the females with a series of short, dainty feminine little flashes about eight per second.

yeah, well you better get your eyes checked, cause i aint got no problems okay.
as a matter of fact, around here i am the one that makes the problems.
i am not complaining, i got the greatest boyfriend in the whole world.
but the way i look at it, most guys are more like that jurk than they are like my boyfriend.
once to dance and once with my boyfriend, just for two days he was giving a concert.
that's actually why i am here, my boyfriend lives in this building.
did he ever tell you that's the first time he put anyones picture on his piano besides his mother?
yes, because he said it made him feel like i was physically with him.
and so he figured if one of us didnt work out then the other might.
what he didnt count on was that the both of us would work out.
i mean who else has framed photographs of their mother all over their apartement
and the way he used her in stories he would tell.
it's not my dick anymore, it is attached to me yeah. but it belongs to you
i am taking it a step further, i am telling you that not only this point with you
because i am so attached to you that every other girl on earth is not exciting to me, in the slightest.
every other girl on earth to me it's like a salem.
i am not trying to excuse it, i am just alot of actors dont lie, there's alot of actors who play killers but they do not kill people when they are not acting.
not good actors. name me one good actor who doesnt lie .
i am not talking about denzel washington as an individual, i am talking generically.
i am talking about the art of acting, the nature... the life experience of me as an actor.
if i was like a supreme court justice you would expect a little on the nose straight ahead answer .
but as an actor i think that i am grand a little leeway .
oh really, you think that anita hill made up the whole coke character are you intentionnaly missing my point ?
no, i am not, you said that you're not a supreme court justice and i said that clarence thompson is exactly the same lying cheating pathetic fucking fool as you are.
this is your last chance to fucking get your shit together.
i come in, and the second i walk in the door, the ground floor, the door is open i look in there, and there's a body.
if you wanna know the truth. it never occured to me at any point to give up either one of you.
because both of you made me feel phenomenal when i was with you.
i was under the impression that i am totally inspiring both of you.
so as long that we dont know about each other then it was ok.
i am not saying it's okay, it was wrong but the rightness of it that i felt gave me a way of justifying .
a way of seeing it the way i wanna see it so i can continue.
havent you ever lied to anyone and known what it done, and felt horrible about it and known that you could never do it again?
known it meant nothing, or known that they've gone ahead and did it anyway ?
it's ok you can admit it i understand perfectly why you are attracted to her.
she is great, she's beautifull, clever, she is a good person and she knows how to take care of herself i mean what more can somebody wants?
maybe i did, maybe i said it because i knew that is what you wanted to hear.
the way everything you said to me was what you tought i wanted to hear.
listen i've talked to mom, like three four a bunch of times today and there is something in the level of her voice that's got me like frightenend.
and i just want you , could you call her, and call me back.
i just want you to call her, call me back, and tell me what is to be done.
this is turning out to be a very strange day everything is changing so fast.
are you trying to figure out how to make us forget?
are you searching for a new role to slip into because this old one doesnt work ?
do you really wanna hear names, dates places who wanted to be licked where, fucked how?
or in my estimation, what do i think your personnal defects are ?
or what you are ready to hear or what you dont wanna hear secretly?
or what if i told you what i thought about you, would devestate you to hear?
what you are saying is the reason that we're in this situation is because of our personnal defects?
what kind of girl would wanna get with a guy like me, knowing?
why did you make it into some kind of fucking romance , that you didnt believe in?
you know i thing you've been avoiding us this whole time, by calling your mother .
you are not fucking interested in us, because you're so fucking into your own head, how fucking charming and funny and everything you just fucking avoid it. and you dont care about us and our problems at all.
all you care about is fucking convincing yourself that you are so desirable by getting alot of women to fuck you.
and this is probably the most truthfull moment in your life right now, am i right?
i cant believe that you're just dumping all this shit on me .
do you wanna hear how these guys like to be degraded or how do they like being licked or touched or fucked?
do you want a comparative description of dick size, including your own?
and in fact he threatened to tell you if you dont go see him tonight.
i just know you would never do it because you would've never reacted with such anger
now you're doing it to me, with the intention of being hurtful
i am not trying to hurt you, i am only trying to get on some honest ground where i feel like the rug is gonna be pulled off from under me .
- i cant fucking believe that you came here and have driven my ass into the ground for 45 minutes
holding all this information of what you two been up to.
well i dont think that's acceptable. allright, so if you're not gonna be in the office then give me you want me to call you?
do you want me to track you down to the 9th hole?
i am telling you there's something wrong, i got to bring her in.
i am relaxed, but i dont understand why you're... what do you suggest?
i'd like to, but i dont think i can make a valid argument.
i think that regardless of whether or not you can trust me or i can trust you, when i am not with you and we trust ourselves
he said it made him feel that i was physically with him.
in front of him and inside him at the same time.
it's not like he knew one of us for years or months, then met the other one, and his life became more complicated.
he decided consciously to take a shot with two girls at the same time.
so he figured if one of us didn't work out, then the other might.
what he didn't count on was that both of us would work out.
this is not self-serving jargon or an attempt to give myself an out for the moment.
i may have been hiding parts of my life from both of you to avoid causing pain.
you used your mother with me to get free with carla.
you used your mother with carla to get free with me.
now you're using your mother with both of us to get free...
- with whoever it is you plan on going out with tonight.
you didn't find out that someone you trusted had betrayed you.
i know, but— i'm just saying— [lou] no, you know what?
denzel washington is a good actor, and a good actor persuades you of one reality and lives out another.
blake, are you gonna tell me that denzel washington isn't the most coolest person around?
i saw him at gray's papaya, like, two weeks ago, okay?
i think i got a pretty fair indication of what he's like.
if i was a supreme court justice, you would expect a literal, on-the-nose, literal-minded answer, a straight-ahead answer like that.
but as an actor, i think that i'm granted a little leeway.
i mean fuck you up and down, in and out, front and rear.
fuck you till you bleed and pus pours out of your asshole.
it never occurred to me at any point to give up either one of you.
because both of you made me feel phenomenal when i was with you, and i was under the impression that i was not totally uninspiring to both of you.
known and then not done it or known and then gone ahead and done it anyway?
i guess what i'm asking is-is- is can you forgive me?
listen, i've talked to my mom, like, three, four... a bunch of times today, and there's something in the level of her voice that has got me, like, frightened.
and i just want to know if you— will you just call her... and-and then call me back and tell me what i should do?
i mean, there's a part of me that feels like we could just tell him to fuck off... and never see him again.
but i was also thinking that we could try something else.
for love of grace, lay not that flattering unction to your soul, that not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
it will but skin and film the ulcerous place, whilst rank and corruption, mining all within, infects... unseen.
oh, throw away the worser part of it and live the purer with the other half.
good night, but do not go to my uncle's bed; assume a virtue, if you have it not.
i thought that we were beyond... this-this stage— what made you think we were beyond it?
because it's unpleasant for you to be put on the spot 'cause you'd like to be beyond it?
or what if i told you what i thought about you but would devastate you to hear?
oh, so you're saying that the reason that we're in this situation... is because of our personal defects?
why did you have to make it into some fucking romance that you didn't believe in?
i think you've been avoiding us this whole time by calling your mother.
and you don't care about us and our problems at all.
all you care about is convincing yourself that you're so desirable... by getting lots of women to fuck you, right?
you don't even know how to be, like, just a person, just a clear, simple person.
and this is probably the most truthful moment of your life right now.
not only is that what you've told me, but i just know that you're probably incapable of it, because you're so— you're so...
you think i don't even know what sexual temptation is, like i couldn't understand on your higher plane of sexual aliveness.
how they liked to be degraded or deified... or how they liked to be licked or touched or fucked?
or do you want a comparative description of dick size, including your own?
he threatened to tell you if i didn't go see him tonight when i talked to him on the phone.
i know that you would never do it, because you would never have reacted with such anger... to what i did if you had been doing it yourself.
i am an evolved woman... that realizes that you can get a lot out of a relationship from a woman— like sensitivity, trust, nurturing— that you cannot get out of a man.
there's, like, a gray area— i can't fucking believe that you came here... and have driven my ass into the ground for 45 minutes, holding on to this information of what you two have been up to.
i'm sorry that i reacted the way i did in there.
and-and i just— words are, uh, not serving me at all.
i think that there's something exceptional that could come of us, not just ditching our relationship right now, don't you?
even if i think that, i think it would— the cycle would just still continue.
we need to feel desired and to say no is like a self-mutilation.
some people, maybe they're so desperate they need to feel they're not alone... so they just pretend that they can love one person exclusively.
i'd like to, but i don't think i could make a valid argument for it.
but i think that regardless of whether or not you can trust me 100% of the time, or i can trust you when i'm not with you, or we trust ourselves, that doesn't mean that we should just can it right now.
he said it made him feel that i was physically with him.
in front of him and inside him at the same time.
it's not like he knew one of us for years or months, then met the other one, and his life became more complicated.
he decided consciously to take a shot with two girls at the same time.
so he figured if one of us didn't work out, then the other might.
what he didn't count on was that both of us would work out.
and that that was why he was being faithful to you.
it wasn't that it was a matter of choice— it was phallic incapacity.
huge and hard and thick and long and perpendicular to the earth.
not to the floor, but to the earth, and filled with oceans of come.
i'd have been gladder if you met me at the airport or outside on the street.
i can't believe that you just threw this plant through the window.
you used your mother with me to get free with carla.
you used your mother with carla to get free with me.
now you're using your mother with both of us to get free...
- with whoever it is you plan on going out with tonight.
i'm interested in why you are such a sick, compulsive liar!
you are caught in a sewer of lies and deception, and your response is to lie and deceive!
the nature, the life, the experience for me as an actor, okay?
your point is it's okay for you to lie and lead a double life because you're an actor.
i mean, the very words "the truth is" make him draw a blank.
the truth is that i meant everything that i said to each of you...
and it was... it was exciting, if you wanna know the truth.
it never occurred to me at any point to give up either one of you.
because both of you made me feel phenomenal when i was with you, and i was under the impression that i was not totally uninspiring to both of you.
so as long as we didn't know about each other, then it was okay?
haven't you ever lied to anyone and-and— and known... what it'd done and felt horrible about it... and-and— and known you could never do it again?
known and then not done it or known and then gone ahead and done it anyway?
listen, i've talked to my mom, like, three, four... a bunch of times today, and there's something in the level of her voice that has got me, like, frightened.
and i just want to know if you— will you just call her... and-and then call me back and tell me what i should do?

it will but skin and film the ulcerous place, whilst rank and corruption, mining all within, infects... unseen.
confess yourself to heaven; repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
oh, so you're saying that the reason that we're in this situation... is because of our personal defects?
what kind of girl gets involved with a guy like me knowing— but we didn't know.
all you care about is convincing yourself that you're so desirable... by getting lots of women to fuck you, right?
you don't even know how to be, like, just a person, just a clear, simple person.
i know that you would never do it, because you would never have reacted with such anger... to what i did if you had been doing it yourself.
because if you have, then you are so much more fucked up than i am.
when i did this to you, i wasn't trying to hurt you.
now you're doing it to me, like, with the intention of being hurtful.
or do you just, like, uh, play hamlet all the time and pretend to have real feelings?
look, i made my suggestion, and i thought it was a good one—
when i call you, they're gonna track you down to the ninth hole?
i'm telling you i need your help, and you're telling me not to worry, and i am worried.
i'm sorry that i reacted the way i did in there.
and-and i just— words are, uh, not serving me at all.
i think that there's something exceptional that could come of us, not just ditching our relationship right now, don't you?
even if i think that, i think it would— the cycle would just still continue.
we need to feel desired and to say no is like a self-mutilation.
some people, maybe they're so desperate they need to feel they're not alone... so they just pretend that they can love one person exclusively.
i'd like to, but i don't think i could make a valid argument for it.
but i think that regardless of whether or not you can trust me 100% of the time, or i can trust you when i'm not with you, or we trust ourselves, that doesn't mean that we should just can it right now.
did he ever tell you that's the first time he put anyone's picture on his piano besides his mother?
yes, because he said it made him feel like i was physically with him.
it's not like he knew one of us for years or even months, and then the other one came in his life and made it complicated.
he decided consciously to take a shot with 2 girls at the same time.
and so he figured if one of us didn't work out then the other might.
what he didn't count on was that the both of us would work out.
all the way from houston he said it to me on the phone last night.
he said that he couldn't even get a hard on for any girl besides me no matter how good she was or what she did.
it is attached to me, yeah, but it belongs to you.
i am taking it a step further, i am telling you that, at this point with you, because i am so attached to you, that every other girl on earth is not exciting to me, in the slightest.
and this is not some self-serving jargon in an attempt to get myself out of the moment.
i even hide little tiny parts of my life from both of you to avoid causing pain.
and i was there and i have been straight with you this whole entire...
you know this was the form that was appropriate to you.
i am interested in why you are a sick, compulsive liar.
you are caught in a sewer of lies and deception and your response is a lie.
i am not talking about denzel washington as an individual, i am talking generically.
i am talking about the art of acting, the nature... the life experience of me as an actor.
and fuck you up and down, in and out front and rear, fuck you till you bleed and pus pours out of your asshole.
you are a lying, mugging masochistic, unemployable, short, loft inheriting, piece of shit fraud.
this is your last chance to fucking get your shit together.
i come in, and the second i walk in the door, the ground floor, the door is open.
they come over, and within 25 seconds of finding this body, they call the coroners and they are grilling me, these detectives.
when you called me, they were relentless, like i did it or something.
i am just trying to make some sense of this fiasco that i've created.
obviously you made your point, which was very confusing and unsettling.
it never occurred to me at any point to give up either one of you.
because both of you made me feel phenomenal when i was with you.
i was under the impression that i am totally inspiring both of you.
so, as long as we don't know about each other, then it's ok?
knowing it meant nothing, or knowing that they've gone ahead and done it anyway?
i guess what i am asking is... can you forgive me?
like what, that i would have been with both of you together?
like that was my secret desire and i was too timid to admit it.
listen i've talked to mom, like three, four, a bunch of times today and there is something in the level of her voice that's got me like frightened.
and i just want you, could you call her, and call me back, and tell me what i should do?
i mean there is a part of me that feels like we could just tell him to fuck off and never see him again.
but then i was also thinking that we could try something else.
he had a wife and a mistress, and they did everything together, and the women really got along.
they were attracted to each other, they respected each other and there was no jealousy or possessiveness.
do you really wanna hear names, dates, places, who wanted to be licked where, fucked how?
or in my estimation, what do i think your personal defects are?
or what you are ready to hear or what you don't wanna hear secretly?
or what if i told you what i thought about you, would that devastate you to hear?
what, you're saying that the reason that we're in this situation is because of our personal defects?
what kind of girl would wanna get with a guy like me, knowing?
why did you make it into some kind of fucking romance, that you didn't believe in?
you know i think you've been avoiding us this whole time, by calling your mother.
you are not fucking interested in us, because you're so fucking into your own head, how fucking charming and funny and everything, you just fucking avoid it.
and you don't care about us and our problems at all.
all you care about is fucking convincing yourself that you are so desirable by getting a lot of women to fuck you.
you don't even know how to be like just a person.
i can't believe that you're just dumping all this shit on me.
it is really fucked up, i would never get off on just sitting out, railing into somebody and telling them their character defects.
do you wanna hear how these guys like to be degraded or how do they like being licked or touched or fucked?
do you want a comparative description of dick size, including your own?
and in fact he threatened to tell you if you don't go see him tonight.
i just know you would never do it because you would've never reacted with such anger to what i did, if you were doing it yourself.
because if you have, then you are so much more fucked up than i am.
at least i am fucking finally telling you the truth, and you don't need to pull it out of me.
this fucking last hour you've been railing into me about this bullshit.
you are eating pussy, you are fucking three other guys and vittorio.
did you ever had any real feelings, or did you just like play hamlet all the time and pretend to have real feelings?
look, i made my suggestion and i thought it was a good one.
do you want me to track you down to the 9th hole?
i am telling you that i need your help, and you're telling me not to worry, and i am worried.
ours is out of whack and i got a handball game in two hours.
i can't tell whether marie washed these£¬ or if they're still damp from tuesday's game.
when you showed me two somethings£¬ twins didn't pop into my head.
for a second£¬ i thought my son was gonna make a living winning bar bets.
your parents living across the street is the big selling point here.
listen£¬ i know that you don't see it now... but in time you'ii come to realize... what a blessing it is to have your family so close.

ice crystals formed in the lungs within 30 seconds, resulting in asphyxiation.

jx-5 gas might have seeped to the rest of the ship.

you do your job and i'll be the first to kiss your black butt.
but if you can't hack it i'll gladly fedex your worthless carcass back to the frying pan where malebolgia will be waiting for both us.
how do you address accusations from some that the cia only acts to protect the government's economic interests in regions of conflict?
i think the government has been as attentive to the sensitivities of the nations involved as possible.
and i will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.
your job is to make damn sure the public agrees with me.
we're gonna rig a fancy-schmancy device that connects your heartbeat to the heat-16 bomb so if your heart stops ticking, the bomb goes off.
we don't want any smart-ass fruitcake taking you out ahead of schedule.
as you've seen, the terrible north korean biochemical disaster unleashed a whole host of new diseases.
ten thousand people died in the first month after the disaster five years ago.
first i got wynn to kill spawn and create the heat-16 bomb.
now i get spawn to murder wynn and release the virus.
i don't know how you put up with all this crap.
you're a bigger fool than i thought if you think you're gonna wreck my plans.
either you lead the army or wynn plays pin the tail on wanda.
"hey, wanda, how about giving me some of that sweet stuff, baby?"
and they'll use it to rob you of any humanity you have left.
simmons knew that violence only makes for more pain and suffering.
don't tell me you're getting all bent out of shape over a woman.
okay, so she was the love of your life and the only thing that mattered... in this whole disgusting, putrid little universe.
- if i'm lying, i'm dying... which would be kind of redundant.
anyway, spawn, your former self... meaning one hell-bent-for-leather, kick-ass, take-no-prisoners... government assassin by the name of ai simmons... is dead.
what the hell are you trying to pull on me, huh?
i mean, we're talking about my best hit men... getting mercilessly whacked over here.
let me know what you find out about this mystery assassin.
i'll send you his liver and maybe a couple of fingers.
i'll feel free to call if there are any further complications.
of course, but tell me, how long do you intend to cover for him?
he kills a bunch of guys, leaves for a while... comes back and camps down here in rat city.
he looks like something out of goddamn stephen king, for christ's sake.
you look like a couple of smart turds with big eyes.
give me the question i'm looking for and win your lives.
now, you don't break into my room and snatch me off a woman!
you don't throw me in a helicopter to new york in the frigging night!
seems he was listening in on some very high level conversations.
i gotta figure stevens heard something huge... hoped to trade off his indictment for what he was sitting on... and use the news boys as middle men.
you should be down on your knees thanking malebolgia... for the privilege of being a ranking officer in this hell's army.
you should be down on your knees thanking me... for not killing you where you stand.
you might think you're doing good, taking out the bad element.
but you just can't go around killing without a little forethought.
next time... if i see one of your brain dead thugs so much as spit in those alleys...
i'm gonna come back and pay you a little visit, tony.
well, looking at the crime lab reports on the children... they were all sexually assaulted.
then again, the police found conclusive evidence in kyle's room... on his clothes, in his car... blood and tissue matches, semen matches, dna prelims are positive.
the media spokesperson for the new york city police department... had no comment concerning the inexplicable upswing in violence... in a specific low income area of lower manhattan.
asked to possibly reopen the kyle watson child killer case... in light of what was termed a blatant oversight by the police... defense attorney wanda blake is responsible for this revelation.
in local news, it looks like police... are gonna cut child killer kyle watson loose after all.
thanks to his attorney wanda blake, independent investigators have found... that evidence may actually have been planted.
and in the end all will be revealed... no matter how wonderful... or hideous the result.
mr. twist, i just want to say you can count on me.
- i had to grease more palms... than you'll find at a peep show, but yeah, i got it.
i've still got friends on the force, but this shit's like ebola.
as of right now, terry, your job is to track down... every instance of these discrepancies in the weapons shipment files.
i need verification and evidence if i'm going into this with an investigation.
on the national front... outspoken republican senator scott mcmillan... has unexpectedly thrown his hat into the presidential ring.
the american people want someone to step into the white house... and put an end to overinflated, underachieving... tax-and-spend government.
these government guys protect this high-tech shit like it's their balls.
but before i give this to you... you gotta promise me you won't do something stupid.
this bill is controversial because it's not concerned with the bottom line.
it's concerned with the family, which is the backbone of this country.
these cutbacks are locked in, so the entire bill must fail.
i'll have to pull in some favors to negate your vote... and save you from looking like a fool.
sir, my investigation of the weapons shipment hasn't turned up anything.
the only good news is, no other shipments are currently missing.
we have confirmation that at least one officer has been killed at this point.
also, the senate has narrowly defeated the federal relief taxation bills... spearheaded by senator mcmillan... who received much opposition from republicans and democrats.
an attempt to blackmail mcmillan obviously failed... putting stevens' life in danger.
stevens goes underground long enough to benefit from the media merry-go-round.
the battle between heaven and hell has waged eternal, their armies fueled by souls harvested on earth.
the devil, malebolgia, has sent a lieutenant to earth... to recruit men to turn the world into a place of death... in exchange for wealth and power... a place that provides enough souls to complete his army... and allow armageddon to begin.
all the dark lord needs now is a great soldier, someone who can lead his hordes to the gates of heaven... and burn them down.
like him, i killed in the name of good, but the violence of my life... pulled my soul towards the darkness.
there has been an outpouring of anti-u.s. sentiment... sweeping across the globe.
protesters in libya, bosnia, france, moscow... and the united states... are denouncing...
i hate bozo, ronald, chuckles... with their freakin' dumb noses and their lousy party hats!
i don't mind being short, fat, and ugly, but the pay sucks!
how do you address the accusations from some... that the cia only acts to protect... the government's economic interests... in the regions of conflict?
i think the government has been attentive... to the sensitivities of the nations involved.
as you've seen, the terrible north korean biochemical disaster... unleashed a whole host of new diseases.
ten thousand people died in the first month... after the disaster five years ago.
millions have contracted these fatal diseases... diphtheria, cholera, smallpox... diseases that had been virtually wiped out.
thought i was getting rid of the world's vermin, and i turn out to be one of them.
i got wynn to kill spawn and create the heat-16 bomb.
now i get spawn to murder wynn and release the virus.
they'll use it to rob you of any humanity you have left.
al simmons knew that violence... only makes for more pain and suffering.
i'll get spawn so worked up, he'll kill wynn without blinking.
when i'm done with you, they'll change your name to "stain".
the lord of darkness, malebolgia, has sent a lieutenant... to recruit men who will help destroy the world... in exchange for wealth and power... and provide enough souls to complete his army... and allow armageddon to begin.

now look, do your job, and i'll be the first to kiss your black butt, but if you can't hack it,
i'll gladly fedex your worthless carcass... back to the frying pan, where malebolgia will be waiting for both of us.
i heard that last week's peace summit between the arabs and israelis was...
fitzgerald may be a spineless bureaucrat, but he's doing a great p.r. job for me.
oh, he's just the highest-scoring killer of all time, that's all.
if we hadn't recruited him, the other side would have, musclehead.
as you've seen, the terrible north korean biochemical disaster... unleashed a whole host of new diseases.
ten thousand people died in the first month... after the disaster five years ago.
"you take the army of yours and shove it." you take that.
oh, oh, you got that, "i want to beat the fat little man"...
al simmons knew that violence... only makes for more pain and suffering, no matter which side gives the orders.
he tried to leave off killing, give himself a second chance.
i'm gonna get spawn so worked up, he'll kill wynn without blinking.
when i'm done with you, they're gonna change your name to "stite. "

and then you and the army can kick some angelic buttocks.
and in return for your services, we'll get wanda back for you.
how do you address the accusations from some... quarters that the cia only acts to protect... protect the government's economic interests... in the regions of conflict?
i think the government has been as attentive... to the sensitivities of the nations involved, as possible.
i run this organization the way i see fit, and i will do whatever is necessary to keep it that way.

we don't want any smart-ass fruitcake... taking you out ahead of schedule.
with outbreaks around the world... and the number of sick and dying children continues to grow.
it's up to us to put an end... to the suffering of these innocent children.

once again, it is time for a new warrior... to emerge from the darkness.
throughout time, the battlefields have changed... but the prize has always remained the same:
except bennett's won a pulitzer for his investigative piece... on the congressional scandal three years ago.
hey, if it ain't on espn, i couldn't give a shit.
word is you told the captain we're skimming off the top.
listen, if you can't keep your mouth shut, we'll shut it for you.
after 400 years, a new warrior takes center stage... preparing for the great battle.
and with him comes pain, death... and the vile stench of brimstone.
he kills a bunch of guys, leaves for a while... comes back and camps down here in rat city.
he looks like something out of goddamn stephen king... for christ's sake.
you look like a couple of smart turds with big eyes.
give me the question i'm looking for and win your lives.
now, you don't break into my room and snatch me off a woman!
you don't throw me in a helicopter to new york in the frigging night!

but you just can't go around killing without a little forethought.
tell me you're not the guy who took out tony's men.
tell me it's somebody with some balls... and not some no-talent asshole with a faggy outfit.
i'm gonna come back and pay you a little visit, tony.
and believe me, it won't be as pleasant... as the visit i paid your hired cyborg.
my name is wanda blake, and i'll be taking over your defense.
we're gonna need some general information during these proceedings... and i'll be recording this.
then again, the police found conclusive evidence in kyle's room... on his clothes, in his car... blood and tissue matches, semen matches, dna prelims are positive.
with this solid a case against kyle, the best i can do... is try to keep him off death row.
and in the end all will be revealed... no matter how wonderful... or hideous the result.

all units, a report of a child kidnapping on the south side of queens.
an attempt to blackmail mcmillan obviously failed... putting stevens' life in danger.
stevens goes underground long enough to benefit from the media... merry-go-round.
that special medicine of his must have cured his heart virus a iong time ago.
goku's just had his ki sucked out of him by those guys.
so that's a senzu, capable of healing great injuries and restoring energy, is it?
judging by the fact that he was all but dead, but is back here among us now, they must be for real.
here i am doing a lousy job acting hurt just so i can save goku when they aren't looking...
then vegeta, you had to butt in where you weren't wanted!
doing something like that only assures the disease will progress that much faster!
my life's goal, no matter how long it takes, is in you, kakarrot.
goku would be stricken with a disease, and all the rest of us, even vegeta, would be killed by these artificial humans.
some of the circumstances may have changed, but isn't everything still just as he warned us?
there's no reason to still think that we will all be wiped out, iike he said.
look at how the time of goku's predicted sickness was way off, for example.
you guys aren't the terrible punks you've been made out to be.
apparently you draw energy out through your palms; that's all i need to watch out for.
you may have been observing us all this time, but there's one important thing you haven't heard yet.
vegeta, i know everything there is to know about your own fighting style.
so you say, but when goku turned super saiyan, you had a look of surprise on your faces.
in other words, your data from the time before our fight with freeza up until now is mere conjecture.
i like to hang out in a quiet place where l can talk to my friends.
and so what if i like to go home, put on kenny g and take a bath?
if you must know the truth, i didn't want to lose a good assistant.
that's why i said those things about your flirting and drinking.
i want to sit in a comfortable chair, watch tv and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.
i like to hang out in a quiet place where i can talk to my friends.

mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
but by any chance, did joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened?
tony, carlos, marie please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
now, i know that monica has a lot of great ideas for this place.
so without much further ado i present to you our new head chef.
um, i just wanna say, uh, that with a pinch of excitement a dash of hard work, and a dollop of cooperation we can have the recipe...
you can put your sad little muffin back in its drawer.

oh, you mean those little colored labels you put on all the folders?
it certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.
[in strained voice] now, just to brief you i may cry.
but they are not tears of sadness or of anger but just of me having this discussion with you.
i am just going to pack up my desk and i will be gone by the end of the day.
well, i guess there's no use me sticking around till the end of the day.
hey, how do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer...?
the owner of allesandro's came to yell at me but i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef.
tony, carlos, marie please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.

i am just gonna pack up my desk, and i will be gone by the end of the day!
well, i guess there's no use to me sticking around 'til the end of the day!
how do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?
okay, the owner of allesandro's came over to yell at me, but instead i made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!
i can't hear a word you're saying, my ears are ringing so bad.
i'm just glad i brought that extra pair of socks, y'know?
mrs. lynch, i know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us.
but by any chance did joanna send any paperwork your way before... it happened.
imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.
yes-yes, just a few seconds and she'd still be with us?
i'm so excited about having monica come on board with us.
although i do feel bad about having fired chef emillio, it's like losing a member of the family.

i know that this is an emotional and difficult time for all of us.
but by any chance, did joanna send any paperwork your way before it happened?
of course, that literally is the case for several of you.
tony, carlos, marie please tell your father how much we're going to miss him.
so without much further ado i present to you our new head chef.
i just want to say that with a pinch of excitement a dash of hard work and a dollop of cooperation we can have the recipe...

you know how the women in my crowd tend to droop outdoors.
yes, well, niles, there are all different sorts of women in the world, you know.
perhaps if you'd tiptoe beyond the fringes of your precious circle, cast a wider net.
frasier, that woman by the side of the road spearing trash...
well, it's more than lilith could accomplish in five years of marriage.
you know, it's so gratifying to see your father make these little improvements.
- oh, well, you know, back in private practice i could spend months, even years with a patient, see the fruits of my labour.
now, somebody calls in, i give my advice and never know how things work out.
but i wasn't comfortable being around old people to begin with, and this hasn't helped matters.
roz, listen, if you're ever going to conquer your fear of aging, get back down there and spend some time with these people.

you told this guy who was going through the same thing that he should keep pictures of his wife around to help with the transition.
you know, it was the first time i ever got pulled over and couldn't flirt my way past it.
oh, that's almost as bad as the first time somebody calls you ma'am.
look, you're way too young to be concerned about all this.
don't waste the best years of your life worrying about something you can't control.
yes, you know, i think this just might do the trick.

what's ready for us now is our side rails and our dowels.
that's right. i'm gonna start off by shaping our shoulder bar with the scroll saw.
after al's done with that, we'll be shaping that shoulder bar in this steamer box.
get it into the right shape for us for our final preparations.
now it's time to move on to a segment of the show we call man at his leisure.
today we're gonna show you an outdoor leisure activity that's recently been brought inside:
out there they gotta watch out for the pirates of the carabiner.
now, tim, as you climb, make sure your hands and your toes are securely on your holes.
no, i'm just a regular guy who scrapes dead animals off the highway.
well, uh, why don't you tell us a little bit about what you do?
this unit has features you'll only find in the man's gym.
tired of sitting on a hard bench, you just press "number one."
you may be wondering if you're gonna take a snooze, how do you exercise?
just press "automatic" and the machine does the workout for you.
well, nothing gets the heart pumping faster than the man's exercise bike.
in the man's gym, we don't use an ordinary exercise bike.
fred is right. i think that the rowing-machine toilet made a big splash with the swedes!
not sure anything made up for the lingonberry accident and the animal control guy.
basically, it's us against the russians in a real expensive game of hide-and-seek at sea, ma'am.
i noticed some minor damage to the cayuga when we flew over, ensign.
on 16 april, 1989, the commander attacked three libyan migs over the gulf of sidra.
actually, the migs attacked my wingman and i while we were patrolling the no-fly zone.
and captain mcnamara has proven to be a great warrior in the past.
i am so hoping that he will not disappoint me this time.
i just wanted to apologize just in case i did anything that was inappropriate.
well, you did compare stalin, marx and lenin to the three stooges.
after it's over, she will be chopped up into razor blades and the captain will become a civilian.
grinkov would rather go down fighting than end his years standing in line for groceries.
now, i have been doing this a hell of a lot longer than you have.
get her off my bridge and take the brothers karamazov with her.
unfortunately, you now force me to confine you to the brig.
and i am afraid that you will not get to see the last great sea battle.
you are the one running around my ship with a loaded weapon, commander.
i am only doing what i have been trained to do.
what i don't understand is how a captain purposely puts his crew in danger.
is this where you try to appeal to my sense of honour and duty?
harm transferred to the navy's judge advocate general corps, which investigates, defends and prosecutes the law of the sea.
there, with fellow jag lawyer, major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
well, basically, it's us against the russians in a real expensive game of hide-and-seek at sea, ma'am.
i noticed some minor damage to the cayuga when we flew over, ensign.
you've been aboard my ship for less than three minutes, you've already managed to tick me off.
i can only hope that you manage to do the same to captain grinkov.
in 1985, a russian and an american warship attempted to enter the lisbon harbor at the same time.
neither captain would give way to the other and they wound up colliding.
and captain macnamara has proven to be a great warrior in the past.
i am so hoping that he will not disappoint me this time.
i, uh, kind of lost track of things right after the folk dancing started.
i just wanted to apologize just in case i did anything that was inappropriate.
after it's over, she will be chopped up into razor blades and the captain will become a civilian.
grinkov would rather go down fighting than end his years standing in line for groceries.
well, you have gone above and beyond your call of duty, major.
now i have been doing this a hell of a lot longer than you have.
unfortunately, you now force me to confine you to the brig.
and i am afraid that you will not get to see the last great sea battle.
you are the one running around my ship with a loaded weapon, commander.
i am only doing what i have been trained to do.
long enough for me to realize you are unlike any woman i have ever met.
yet, not quite long enough for me to fall in love with you.
what i don't understand is how a captain purposely puts his crew in danger.
is this where you try to appeal to my sense of honor and duty?
we know for certain that our planet, at its origins, was subject to an intense bombardment by meteorites.
we know that these meteorites, originating at the time of the formation of the solar system, consisted of complex organic molecules.
no one is really touched emotionally unless there's some disturbance involved."
flashback – we are in reims, at the very beginning of the century;
- i had a brother that was 7 years older than me.
my dad was blind, my mom was not a very cheerful person, and the house was a sad place to be.
- yeah, basically; what happened was my dad would always just sit there in the dark, since it was meaningless to him to turn on the lights.
if no one else was there besides me, nobody would turn the lamp on and so i'd just sit there,
i suppose it's possible that, unconsciously, you already had the feeling that there was something inane about directing and focusing effort on a particular goal, since your father wasn't capable of doing that.
-well and that's maybe even more true since you just said something that struck me;
"not a single line, or a ray of morning sunlight fails to contain the sweetness of anguish."
and as if misfortune attracted more misfortune, in 1914 in 1914 war broke out, darkening the tableau even more.
georges, who had just converted to catholicism, left reims with his mother, leaving his paralyzed father to be taken care of by a housekeeper.
four years later, this edifying booklet devoted to our lady of reims would bring those apocalyptic images up once more.
"i left my father there alone, blind, paralytic, insane, crying and flailing about in pain, fastened to his armchair dead."
over the ten years that followed the death of his father,
my internal irony was my answer to so many predestined horrors."
in less than ten years, his faith was turned inside out like a glove
but in the end simone withdrew from me wrenched the beautiful eyeball out of the tall englishman's hands, and with a steady and consistent effort of her two hands, she inserted it into her dripping flesh, amid the fur."
to fully understand the tragic scope of this joyous, blasphemous book, one must refer to the granero episode, page 67.
the episode is borrowed from a miscellaneous, bloody news piece that bataille himself was present for on the 7th of may 1922.
on that day, in madrid, a bull's horn popped out the right eye of bullfighter manuel granero, a providential footnote, which allowed the theme of the eye, which up to this point in the story had been withheld from the plot,
dostoyevski, proust, sade – everything came from the hallucinatory exploration of this inventory of ideas.
shit, rot, sexuality, death, and unrequited discharge, for which the sun is the major metaphor
on that occasion, doctor borel had shown him a photo of a chinese torture called the "torture of a hundred cuts,"
an image that would haunt him the rest of his life and in which he found an infinite value of reversal.
in 1928, "the story of the eye" was like a story in code.
today it is like testimony, full of biographical indications, as if bataille's replacement of his own name by the pseudonym
lord auch had revealed the documentary aspect of the work, which up to now had masked the extravagance of the fiction content.
we now know, for example, that the ruins discussed in the final chapter are the ruins seen here:
"it's the only place that still has any attachment to anything from my childhood," he wrote.
the family home is in the heart of the village, within earshot of the voices of the faithful, who go to mass at the neighboring church.
it is said that little georges shut himself up in here one night, all night long.
and in 1914, when the war had chased him from reims, he took refuge behind those walls enrolling in the little saint flour seminary.
hell is the feeble idea god involuntarily gives us of himself."
one year before his death, he confided to madeleine chapsal that the thing he was most proud of was having switched up the cards, that is, that he had associated the most scandalous kind of laughter with the most profound religious spirit.
an abundantly illustrated magazine dedicated to archeology, the fine arts, ethnography, and popular culture.
there bataille wrote his first, puzzling articles on themes that were themselves not very commonly dealt with:
at a time when breton and his surrealist friends were putting beautiful rot-proof creatures into circulation,
bataille preferred to investigate the terrifying secret people have at their feet.
on january 15, 1930, bataille's mother died, at 85 reine street, up there, behind those closed shutters.
and it was an inconceivable scene, which bataille retold many times in a veiled manner, but that he finally put down on paper 13 years later with all the dryness of a police report.
looking at bataille, you really do have to see him as a political thinker.
after the popular front failed to gather the left avant-garde around its project of a united force against fascism, he invented a new magazine, called acephale, and gathered around himself a few convinced and dedicated friends:
not just in germany, but in france, there was an extremely narrow way of understanding nietzsche.
we had those three first issues, which were really quite interesting.
this headless monster fills me with anguish because it's made of innocence and crime."
urged on by nietzsche, bataille overturned the heavens to dump out the values surrounding them.
aying atop everything is this heaven of chance, the heaven of innocence, heaven close at hand, foolhardy heaven.
and randomly it happens that is the most ancient nobility of the world;
he protested against the assignment of purpose to things, the assignment of a purpose to the world.
for him, the world has no purpose, no goal, and consequently what's left to us is to laugh at what it is.
but not to laugh like the banal laughter you get when people realize that they're superior to the thing they're laughing at, but another kind of laughter, a definitive laughter, a laughter in nietzschean conditions; a tragic laughter.
starting from nietzsche's understanding and knowledge, there's no possibility of laughter that doesn't go all the way, taking it to the limit of laughter's possibilities.
"to put the whole ridiculous universe on the same level with a naked woman and a torture device.
there's a kind of identity between a woman, a torture device, and the whole ridiculous universe.
we had some meetings in the middle of the forest, in front of a tree that'd been struck by lightning, and we would kind of pray to ourselves.
kaiva was really interested in all that, but no, it wasn't really like that.
there was a lot of things we would stage, a whole lot of staged acts!
"unspeakable secret, these lips open up to a kiss like a soft marsh, like a creek silently flowing, and their big eyes drowned in pleasure open up to a scene full of madness.
- it seems that happiness, for you, the greatest happiness, is associated with the greatest intensity of perceived sensations.
- well, let me just explain my thinking on that quickly:
intense sensation is what destroys order, and i don't think it has to do with anything but that.
it's essential that people manage to totally destroy the servile state they're kept in, due to the fact that they built their world, the human world, a world i live in... er, a world that i live off, but which either way has a kind of charge to it,
something infinitely heavy that is found in all our anxieties and that needs to be removed some way or other.
certainly, i'd much more prefer to hear a sonata than have a gun fired right next to my ear.
the intensity is however even greater if i get an enormous noise like that in my ear, on purpose, just to annoy me.
it appears to me then that it's something invariable that extremely intense sensations are very valuable as long as we can tolerate them.
"although i feel the need to say it inside me in the most terrible way."
here too there is much left unclear, which we can only guess at:
like no other book had ever given me before or since.
it is perhaps the book where i am the most myself, the book that most resembles me, because i wrote it in a kind of a rapid and continuous explosion.
"i feel like the far-off parts of my life have merged with what is in my heart today.
nothing would stop me right now from kicking the stair f a hotel to where i might even make myself bleed."
clearly had to remark that he couldn't have written "the torture device"
if he hadn't first given himself the lewd central key to it, and that key is edwarda, nude, sticking out her tongue in the middle of a packed hall full of men and women
at the other end of the walkway, the garden forms a kind of terrace.
in vézelay, bataille found diane kotchoubey de beauharnais, who was his last girlfriend.
here we have an attempt at an autobiography, the ecole des chartes which led him to the national library, to religion, to huysmans.
"i loved huysmans" he wrote, and went on: "i wanted to get to know the middle ages so as to be no longer trapped in the present."
"you must know, first of all, also has a that everything that has a manifest side also has a hidden side.
your face is quite noble, there's a truth in your eyes with which you grasp the world, but your hairy parts underneath your dress are no less a truth than your mouth is."
like "documents," from 1929, or like "acephale" in 1936, like "the college of sociology" in 1937,
"critique" satisfied bataille's need to break the isolation that the deepening profundity of his thinking was keeping him in.
however we need to go back to that thinking of his which was never so active or crucifying as it was during the war years and immediately after them.
gazing out on the forest of stones in the vézelay basilica, the traveler has no trouble imagining the worst.
bataille in saint jérôme, meditating in front of a horse skull, impregnating himself the point of madness with the burning pages of angèle de foligno and dictating his writing:
"thumb up the pussy, cigar on naked breasts, my ass dirties the hotel's tablecloth."
"i wanted to get to know the middle ages so as to be no longer trapped in the present,"
an image comes back to him suddenly, obsessive and grotesque : in the middle of a swarm of of girls, madame edwarda, nude, stuck out her tongue.
close to paris, a free apartment granted him by his job, a new dawn.
like always, in orleans, the painful freedom of his thought was accompanied by an effort of conceptualization that would for a long while be misunderstood.
philosophy in general is about content, but i for my part call upon sensibility more than upon intelligence and from that moment on it's the expression of it in all its sensitive character that counts the most.
moreover, my philosophy could in no way be expressed in an unfeeling manner, there'd be absolutely nothing left.
it is only from the moment when i give it form that it can be passed off as passionate, and could even be passed off as something dark, but i don't think my work is any darker than that of nietzsche.
around ten am, the traveler discovers a library, fallen to the ravages of time, and wandering mute memories come to him that emanate a vague stench of rats.
and here's the storeroom where the works were kept, now overrun by rats.
these rats, wrote bataille, that run out of our eyes as if we ourselves were tombs.
faced with this perfectly ordinary disaster, the traveler feels himself overtaken by the dizziness of his reading.
"the part of girls between their thighs and waists, which responds so violently to attack, indeed responds to it as it would to a rat elusively scurrying by."
towards the end of the afternoon, the traveler hastens to the end of his hike, passes across the unchanged garden overlooked by the windows on the reading room and takes a leap 35 years back in time.
in february 1961, one year before the death of georges bataille, a young journalist followed the same path:
at bottom it's basically the same thing as what happens when you become aware of what death means, what death implies, for the first time.
that is, the fact that everything we are... everything that we are is fragile and perishable.
what's valuable about religions is whatever is contrary to good sense about them.
the life of a christian mystic runs contrary to good sense to the extent that it doesn't admit im...ahem, mortality.
you know; my mind still works but there are some seams getting loose and i guess that just has to do with the state it's in.
basically, there's... for example when i have a seizure it's like a really big stitch coming undone.
i feel like i agree with everything materialist, on one condition: that is,
i also agree with a lot that people think is not materialist, and i think there's a whole wealth there, for example the emotions, which are not entirely different from madness, but which are not in any case totally different
ah, how difficult it is to say what this ferocious forest really was, this bitter and powerful forest that awakens the fear in one's thought."
the traveler salutes the poet, and opens for one last time his copy of "the story of the eye":
i'd never been able to see them all the way up to her cunt.
i'd always used that word for it around simone, and for me it's the most beautiful word for the genitals.
simone placed the saucer on a little bench, stood in front of me, and, never looking away from my eyes, she sat in it, without me being able to see her burning buttocks, dipping into the cool milk under her skirt.
i lay down at her feet without her moving at all, and for the first time i saw her red and black flesh, cooling off in the white milk."
"diane had left to go to england, so i'd invited some friends to add a little excitement
i'd invited my friends to supper, just like that, i still remember;
and we took him to the aenec, but it was too late;
he never came out of the coma, and he died at night between sunday and monday.
and only on sunday frankel said that we'd have to call
diane right away on the phone, and so she came over monday in the daytime.
georges bataille hence finally rejoined his old lady, his faithful darling with the frozen belly and jackal's teeth – death.
finally, and forever, he can now run naked, a blindfold over his eyes, and eat the dirt.
and for a long while he had been aware of the things that go along with such a hardly significant event.
the gravediggers; the pit; the caddisflies, the wind, the sun ...and the boundless horror.
each of the lights in the sky was like the announcement of another skeleton in its grave.
our bodies trembled like two rows of teeth chattering together." .

"i must be cruel, only to be kind." but don't focus on the text alone.
the delivery is the really dark stuff and that's all his own work.
there is a willow grows ascaunt a brook, that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
there with fantastic garlands did she come... of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies and long purples.
the liberal shepherds give a grosser name, but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.
her clothes spread wide, and mermaid-like a while they bore her up.
cos you'll need all the talk you can get to wriggle out of this one.
if i tell you what really happened, will you look out for me, like?
you interviewed him against medical advice while he was recovering from injuries you caused.
without informing him of his rights, you coerced a confession from him.
the thing is, andy, you're a big fish in a small pond.
the national press aren't your rugby club cronies to be bought a pint.
except your life is split between two powerful forces seeking control.
could it be a strong, older man and a determined woman?

he took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.
why don't you go ask him to just, "step lightly, please?"
she told me you said you could really fall for her.
is that true, or are you just getting over janice by groping my sister?
how will joey react to you blowing off his sister with a letter?
that's the part where you tell him that i moved to france when actually i'll be in cuba.
when whichever one she is comes to the door you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
what if mary angela comes to the door and i ask for mary angela?
but i really like this guy and i think he really happens to likes me.
maybe he's just jumping on a pogo stick and he really likes it.
all right, all right if you wanna know how i did it, i'll show you.
when you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was i looked at it so fast, it was invisible to the naked eye.
i almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
i remember the first time i saw katherine after we broke up.
you just go to the house and ask for mary angela.
when whichever one she is comes to the door you take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
he gave you his home number, as in, to his home ?
and you don't mind if i call, because you want good things for me.
the woman i interviewed with was pretty tough but thank god mark coached me.
once i talked about the fall line, she got all happy.
he took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.
well, why don't you go up there and ask him to just step lightly, please?
if you really wanna know how i did it, i'll show you.
when you handed me back the card, what you didn't see was i looked at it so fast, it was invisible to the naked eye.
i almost feel bad for whipping that kid's pretzel at them.
i remember the first time i saw that girl katherine after we broke up.
i wanna quit, but then i think i should stick it out.
then i think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in?
i'm having lunch at monica's and this guy starts talking to me and he works for a buyer at bloomingdale's and there's an opening in his department.
so i gave him my phone number and he's gonna call me this weekend to see if he can get me an interview.
she told me you said you could really fall for her.
now, is that true, or are you just getting over janice by groping my sister?
that's the part where you tell him that i moved to france when actually i'll be in cuba.
all right, look, look, you've got to do this yourself, okay?
you just go to the house and you ask for mary angela, okay?
when whichever one she is comes to the door take her for a walk, you let her down easy.
she told me you said you could really fall for her.
is that true, or are you just getting over janice by groping my sister?

well, why don't you go up there and ask him to just step lightly, please?
i have, like five times, but the guy is so charming that i go up there to yell, and i end up apologizing to him.
i remember the first time i saw that girl katherine after we broke up.
she was walking with her friend donna, just laughing and talking.
how do you think joey's gonna react when he finds out you blew off his sister with a letter?
that's the part where you tell him that i moved to france when actually i'll be in cuba.
oh, well, the woman i interviewed with was pretty tough but, you know, thank god mark coached me.
once i started talking about the fall line, she got all happy.
he took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.
why don't you go ask him to just, "step lightly, please?"

- yeah, i figure they'll love it at the new house you know?
it has that big backyard and then, when they get old, they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to...
- oh, you guys, i can't believe this but i'll leave now, or i'm gonna miss my plane.
- i'm just so glad you got to see the babies.
it's like i would have said in that sci-fi movie if i'd gotten the part.
"those are our men in there, we have to get them out!
and now i'm just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said, and i didn't.
i mean, i didn't even get to tell you that i love you too because of course i do.
he took up the carpets, and now you can hear everything.

you see, i had to pop back to pick up a couple of boxes we left behind.
then it occurred to me that if you heard noises from an empty house, you might become alarmed.
so it goes for sale and penny and stephen go after it.
no, they'd never know about it, cos it wouldn't be advertised.
stephen, we did not drive 40 miles to talk about peas.
no, i've got some bad news, and i felt it only right to tell you personally.
- and let's face it, a wife who paints toy soldiers hardly qualifies as a vibrant personality.
no, i know he's boring, but they were safe neighbours, you see.
if we were young and having an affair, you'd have sprung out and got it.
if we were young and having an affair, it wouldn't have been there in the first place.
stephen, we did not drive 40 miles to talk about peas.
no, i've got some bad news, and i felt it only right to tell you personally.
ok, now, what do you think of when you hear the peaceful grandeur of the sea?
i think how glad i am to be on dry land.
if they get control of ithaca, they'll turn it into a wasteland.
well, i think we've just proved that they can be beaten.
poseidon, if you've heard about my dealings with ares you'll know that i'm not afraid of the gods.
this man is the rightful ruler of ithaca and i plan to help him get home.
every time i've tried to run that gauntlet..., ...the storms were so bad, i had to turn back.
why don't we move along this chain of islands here and then we can leapfrog from island-to-island...
maybe you should just close your eyes and smell the seagulls.
xena, i will remember that, in my moment of misery you chose levity rather than sympathy.
well, that's all right, 'cause i have a great cook in ithaca.
i mean, if you're planning on staying on in ithaca for any time i'll make sure that you and gabrielle are well fed.
so, do you think you might be staying on for a while.
well, i don't want to get in the way of your homecoming.
the only reason i didn't shoot you down right then is because i didn't think you could handle it.
so let me lay it on the line for you, ulysses.
i now know what you were doing when you said those things.
you were giving me a fair chance to get back with penelope and i'm afraid it backfired.
ok, now what do you-- what do you think of when you hear the peaceful grandeur of the sea?
i think how glad i am to be on dry land.
those pirates we were fighting have been promised it as their spoils if they should keep me from reaching home.
if they get control of ithaca, they'll turn it into a wasteland.
poseidon, if you've heard about my dealings with ares, you'll know that i'm not afraid of the gods.
this man is the rightful ruler of ithaca, and i plan to help him get home!
every time i've tried to run that gauntlet, the storms were so bad, i had to turn back.
why don't we move along this chain of islands here-- and then we can leapfrog from island-to-island and shelter from the storms.
yep, the peaceful grandeur of the sea sure has a kick to it, doesn't it?
maybe you should just close your eyes and smell the seagulls.
so,do you think you might be staying on for a while?
well, i don't want to get in the way of your homecoming.
i mean, i haven't known you very long, and yet-- in the short time that,
i feel that we've sp-- i think i'm falling in love with you.
she believes that everyone has a soulmate on earth made just for them.
yes-- yes, that's exactly how i feel-- like i've found my soulmate.
the only reason i didn't shoot you down right then is because i didn't think you could handle it.
so let me lay it on the line for you, ulysses--
the bath is for washing in, not rinsing out your bong!
and this glue is for my submarine not putting up your noses.
if you leave it hanging around the place all the time... they're bound to take advantage.
it's probably them models that got them on in it to start with.
who needs to go to the ballet when you got that at your doorstep.
any one of these boys could play for wales one day.
i don't want to do a little gram here, a little gram there.
shifting a few microwaves and a bent old bollocks till i'm 45.
- oy fatty... your name's got bog all to do with this job, right?
just keep those boards up... take the 30 nicker i'm bunging you and try to remember... you're working for cartwright roofing not the salvation army.
he wants to be dumped in the water with his little submarine.
adie, he can't, because you need special permission and... special coffins that cost a fortune.
your father was working for himself, doing a little a little hobble.
if he goes chucking himself off the roof, that's his problem.
because my mother was very big in pregnancy and only one came out.
she had to wait another three years for the other little bastard.
and if any of you girls are feeling hungry, he's a tasty geezer.
i suppose a shag is out of the question, is it?
now our last but one contestant is a lovely girl from the mumbles.
before any of you get the wrong idea... she's a black belt in karaoke!
rip their shitty nappies off and stuff 'em up their arses.
i'll stretch their necks like pigeons, put their balls in a mincer.
cartwright was striking back at the twins for... what they did to his fucking poodle.
he probably got some other twat to do the dirty work.
the scots have got control, been running us ragged for 15 minutes...
but we receive the ball for andy irvine... in our own 25.
"when the sun goes down, you can make it good in a lay by."

by the way, corny, on a completely different subject, you ever considered a snout job?
duckman, we've been sitting here for hours, and no ghost has appeared.
your beloved chieftain has been acting in an eccentric fashion of late.
in fact, i'd consider it a great personal favor if you would try to surreptitiously determine if he is genuinely demented or just stupid.
mr. chicken asked us to ask you if you were really crazy or just faking.
but he wants us to ask in a way so you don't know what we're doing or that he asked us to do it.
it appears to have no practical application other than impressing chicks.
returning to my point, the story i recounted is from a play by william shakespeare.
duckman, there is no explanation for what i'm about to say, but you appear to be trapped inside the plot of hamlet.
listen, cornstuffing, this isn't some off-broadway flopola by a limey loser who never sold a screenplay.
now, while i wipe off the cooking oil, for what have you come here for?
to stop this evil demon from defiling the sanctity of whatever.
look them over feel them, touch them, make sure they come into contact with as much skin area as possible.
little do they know that i have coated the surface of these toys with laffindoom-- a chemical i've invented which induces laughter so ceaseless and hearty that it stops only with death.
there's something suspicious about king chicken's sudden and unlikely generosity, not to mention the way he's talking to the camera.
i wonder if these devices contain some hidden property, which could be of danger to duckman and/or myself.
i used these transparent gloves to prevent us from touching the poisoned surface.
that's right-- without these gloves, touching this would have brought certain... uh...
kramer, i am so sick of you coming in here and eating all of my food.
now, shut that door and get the hell out of here.
i need somebody to go with me to mr. lippman's son's bar mitzvah.
you know, if you don't bring a guest, they save on catering.
it was called the net, with that girl from the bus.
i did a little reading and i realized it wasn't that far-fetched.
i buy the computers myself, i store them in your apartment.
then after i win the contest, i bring them all back, i get my money back.
two months ago, i saw a provocative movie on cable tv.
it was called the net, with that girl from the bus.
i did a little reading and i realized it wasn't that far-fetched.
dad, do you know what it takes to compete with microsoft and ibm?
well, if i'm not a man, then this whole thing was a sham.
first he said i was gonna get great gifts and then somebody gives me boggle.
i'm very flattered that you found me attractive enough to lunge at me.
but the only reason you like me is because i'm a shiksa.

george, letting my emotions out was the best thing i've ever done.
sure i'm not funny anymore, but there's more to life than making shallow, fairly-obvious observations.
elaine, shiks-appeal is a myth, like the yeti, or his north american cousin, the sasquatch.
well, something's goin' on here, 'cause every able-bodied israelite in the county is driving pretty strong to the hoop.

it just bottles up the anger and then, eventually you blow.

you know, a member of my congregation has a time- share in myrtle beach.
perhaps if you're not too busy we could wing on down after the high holidays.
better if he just stays here and minds his own business.
like i don't have anything better to do than spy on her.
we've been doing some research that we think you should know about.
we checked the handbook and since you're half mortal there's only a fifty-fifty chance... that harvey will turn into a frog.

because of some silly, inconsiderate boob who took my bag i left my bread in san francisco!
pardon me, mrs. hess, but i think i'm almost, maybe possibly, probably gonna be late for my dinner.
this is the second time in two days that you've called the police.
it's a very serious matter when a person calls the police.

they need to see us doing more than running to the car.
i can't explain over the phone why we're so excited about this product.
they were ticketed under aliases but didn't board the hong kong flight.
i believe they're still in the u.s., but beyond that, i don't know.
this is the second time in two days that you've called the police.
it's a very serious matter when a person calls the police.
it says u.s. air force but you have to look under a magnifying glass to see.
kid, a lot of toys have "air force" written on it.
so you can tell the neighbors i stiffed you on a job?
is this a loaf of the famous san francisco sourdough bread?
look long enough and you'll see things, whether or not they're there.
i guess you have to be 35 before anyone listens to you.
they're grown-up criminals but this is my neighborhood and this is my house.
no matter how old they are, no matter how big they are they can't beat me here.
there is a price to be paid for being a good citizen.
in your zeal to aid your neighbor, you stepped into one of my traps.

sounds like your clients want to build a missile that can't be detected by radar.
i don't ask questions, mr. beaupre, but whoever possesses this chip...
karen-- and, charlie, i just want you to know that you're putting me in the position...
of having to choose between making a house payment and taking care of my sick child, and i really don't appreciate it.
excuse me, but i saw a man in karen stephans's bedroom.
a white male, a little older than dad, and he was wearing butt-inspection gloves.
son, this is the second time in two days that you've called the police.
it's a very serious matter when a person calls the police.
now that you've pranked the cops twice, it goes on your permanent record.
for the rest of your life, if you call for help, it won't come.
we have to fork over much-needed family cash to the stephans...

and on that terrible night, her hatred cost sally her life.
sally shine also lived in the hotel, and that night she was coming home from a publicity trip, unaware of the evil trap miss partridge had set for her.
now the hotel has been empty since then, but her book of souls must still be there.
if you could just find that book, it would make everybody see that i was telling the truth.
"i call forth the might of the starry realm... to once again bring fire energy to pierce the night."
"the spell of passion can only be counted by its contrary."
but she had no identifiers for the rest of the people on the elevator.
so instead of zapping sally, the curse kind of half zapped everyone, including miss partridge.
if i read this correctly, the spell trapped those people in limbo between this world and the next.
the ghosts are stuck in the hotel, but we can still help them.
i was gonna be on stage for the first time, singing.
but none of us made it, and we don't know why.

dad still can't work out how he got it so cheap.
it's worth almost as much today as when we bought it.
and why would you want to go out to a restaurant... when this keeps coming up night after night?
i have two brothers and a sister, all older than me.
but she still managed to come home with a tumble dryer and drill set.
she is the only member of the kerrigan family who'd had a tertiary education.
at first, the petropoulouses thought he was having a go at them.
but dad was just saying how much he thought of con.
she picked up two firsts in the country and a third in town.
dad feeds them every morning in big bowls... that steve made out of tractor hubcaps.
because, between you and me, i reckon the values around here are--
as you can see, i've put a fair bit of work into it.
we couldn't wait to hear all the stories about their trip, and we didn't have to wait all that long either.
'cause one of the good things about living next to the airport... is that it doesn't take long to walk home.
'cause it was friday, i told trace i'd take wayne's present to him.
it was an elephant, 'cause elephants bring good luck, especially if the trunks are up, and his trunk was up.
dad had a song he used to sing about going to bonnie doon.
only he sang it a lot, and it was a bit repetitive.
he bought an unfinished kit home out of the trading post, built it in the backyard and towed it up here with his truck.
he was the only bloke he knew with a holiday home.
well, okay, um, the law is supposed to be about justice-- no, fairness.
and i know that sometimes what is right and fair is not clear-cut.
they've got ripper bodies, but they let themselves down in the hair department.
you ought to contact channel nine, get a contract with them.
i want you to get on that phone right now and tell 'em where they can shove their 25 grand.
darryl, " them" is the barlow group, people used to getting their way.
- now, bob, he went off to talk to one of the stewards.
and this young fella, he comes right up to me and starts chatting to me... and he asks me out.
a man, he come to my house and he say, "stop with the court business."
if no stop, he have friend who come and beat me.
that's your classic case of big business... trying to take land, and they couldn't.
mr. denuto, the mabo decision... pertains to the specific issue of native land title and terra nullius.
well, you tell dad... the only reason i loved that house is 'cause it had him and mum in it... and like... everyone else.
wherever they go, i'll love... as long as it has them in it.
and all those lawyers and government people can go and get fucked."
ah, he wanted me to change that "get fucked" bit, but i forgot.
i know this is no longer our house, but i'll be buggered if i can sign those papers.
i just cannot physically pick up the pen and sign them.
i've done pretty well out of this law caper over the years,
- so if you're happy for me to take it further--
and so dad, or as he was called by the judge--
darryl john kerrigan-- sat in the high court of australia and put his case.
let's think about those words, "on just terms" ... and how they relate to real people.
your honor, my client built his home by the law, in full accordance with the law.
my client has adhered to the law, every law, every statute from the town planning act to civil aviation regulations.
but in what can only be described as a last desperate measure, my client is accused of breaching none other than the constitution.
in fact, there were a lot of times he didn't quite understand what was being said, but one time he knew exactly what was being said.
he's even approached the appellant with an offer of compensation, a generous offer considering the nature of the, uh, dwelling, or as it might more accurately be called, eyesore.
but dad nearly fell off his chair when mr. hammill finished by quoting dad, only better.
and somehow that's not worth as much as a big driveway.
you can acquire a house, but you can't acquire a home, because a home is not built of bricks and mortar... but love and memories.
you can't pay for it, and you're just shortchanging people if you try.
i can't speak for those who wrote this document, but i'll bet when they put in the phrase "on just terms,"
they hoped it would stop anyone... shortchanging someone like darryl kerrigan.
he reckoned it was the most satisfying victory he'd had in 47 years.
dad reckons it's important to be noble in victory, so he spoke to the other q.c. ...
first tonight, a landmark decision in the high court today... has confirmed the age-old saying, "a man's home is his castle."
when the huge air link consortium tried to compulsorily acquire a string of homes... on melbourne's outskirts earlier this year, they didn't expect a fight.
mum reckons it's real funny how one day you're not famous, and then the next day you are... famous, and then you're not anymore.
dad had one of the biggest parties ever that night back at home.
that was the beginning of a string of good luck for our family.
six months later we got notice that wayne would soon be eligible for parole.
when mr. hammill walked in, he reckons they granted him parole out of shock.
dennis became very well-known after the case, and people came from everywhere to hire him.
at first dad thought it was out of politeness, but it can't be... 'cause he goes up there all the time.
he and dad still hit it off as good as they did the first day they met.
wayne started helping dad with the tow truck and really made a go at it.
dad's even more proud of him now than when he was in jail.
and dad, well, he reckoned he'd got everything he'd ever wished for.
he often used to sit out on the patio and just smile to himself.
it will be very convenient if we ever have to fly one day.
dad still can't work out how he got it so cheap.
it's worth almost as much today as when we bought it.
our street was going to be the heart of a major housing development.
i have two brothers and a sister, all older than me.
steve is an apprentice mechanic, but he spends most of his time reading the trading post.
she is the only member of the kerrigan family who'd had a college education.
dad reckons the day she graduated as a fully-qualified hairdresser... was about the proudest day of his life.
but dad was just saying how much he thought of con.
i never thought anyone could love our trace... as much as me, sal and the boys.
all his mementos and things that remind him of something special.
so by him saying it was going straight to the poolroom... meant he thought it was special.
as you can see, i've put a fair bit of work into it.
would you like me to point out the features as we go along?
when the family starts to eat, the television is definitely turned down.
but as soon as we've finished eating, it's a different story.
it was funny how on the fun nights, part of me got sad, 'cause i'd think about my big brother in prison and wonder what he was doing.
wayne always reckoned he was doing fine, but i get the feeling he was missing us more than he was letting on.
we met them as they came off the plane with a baggage cart, which was lucky 'cause they had heaps of stuff.
we couldn't wait to hear all the stories about their trip, and we didn't have to wait all that long either.
'cause one of the good things about living next to the airport... is that it doesn't take long to walk home.
and they had these masks which you put over your eyes when you're sleeping... so that you can't see anything.
it's a beautiful place, especially this time of year when the water levels are down.
dad could not believe his luck when he found this place.
and he reckoned we were the luckiest family in the world.
- dale, i reckon we're the luckiest family in the world.
i need to get to the torana out so i can get to the commodore.
i'll have to get the keys to the cortina if i'm going to move that corolla.
mr. kerrigan, air link, as a federal authority, has the right to purchase property compulsorily.
and, as far as i can see, you have offered no evidence to refute that right.
but, you know, i never heard that one you say before.
"a man's home is his castle." well, that's an old saying.
darryl, " them" is the barlow group, people used to getting their way.
now, they want to expand the airport, and there's one bloke who's a pain in the ass.
he put on all my bets, and he was just sweeping me off my feet.
and i wouldn't have been at all surprised if he'd popped the question.
it's because you're too much of a tight-ass to fill in the quarry.
it's easier to knock down people's houses than it is to fill in a hole.
this is a blatant violation... of the constitution of the commonwealth of australia.
and when it comes to violations, they don't come any bigger.
i think he was lookin' forward to the day you came back to the house.
well, you tell dad... the only reason i loved that house is 'cause it had him and mum in it... and like... everyone else.
wherever they go, i'll love... as long as it has them in it.
and all those lawyers and government people can just go and get fucked.
"the parliament shall have power to make laws... with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms."
let's think about those words, "on just terms" ... and how they relate to real people.
dad reckoned it was in the bag, even though they had five times more lawyers than we did.
my client has adhered to the law, every law, every statute from the town planning act to civil aviation regulations.
i refer the court to his honor mr. justice dixon's decision... in grace brothers and the commonwealth.
as much as dad hated to admit it the other lawyer was good, and he was gonna give us a real run for our money.
the interpretation of "on just terms" was considered in the tasmanian dams case.
the court took into account the interests of the community, such as, uh, job creation--
what this principle fails to take into account... is that competing rights cannot be weighed one against the other.
is a family's right to live freely in their home outweighed--
...not that our children will have a place to live, but whether they'll have prompt delivery of their parcels.
dad thought it was real funny, even though he didn't get it.
and i trust that your client will, in the meantime, compose himself.
mr. lyle, i'll thank you not to make any further value judgments in this court.
i mean, that-- that just goes to show that they don't get it.
i mean, they're judging the place by what it looks like, and if it doesn't have a pool or a classy front or a big garden--
it's a place for the family to turn to, come back to.
but that doesn't seem to mean as much as a big fuckin' driveway.
and somehow that's not worth as much as a big driveway.
you may think our appeal is based on emotion rather than law.
sure, the kerrigans built a house, then they built a home, and then a family.
you can acquire a house, but you can't acquire a home, because a home is not built of bricks and mortar... but love and memories.
you can't pay for it, and you're just shortchanging people if you try.
i can't speak for those who wrote this document, but i'll bet when they put in the phrase " on just terms,"
- it was a case of darryl versus goliath... in the high court of australia today.
mum reckons it's real funny how one day you're not famous, and then the next day you are... famous, and then you're not anymore.
six months later we got notice that wayne would soon be eligible for parole.
dad rang mr. hammill, who was more than happy to come out of retirement again.
dennis became very well-known after the case, and people came from everywhere to hire him.
he won a very big case, a class action against people who put lead in the landfill 15 years ago.
he and dad still hit it off as good as they did the first day they met.
coco never won another race, but she had a son which dad called son of coco.
he often used to sit out on the patio and just smile to himself.
and they still live at 3 highview crescent, even though it's only them two living' in it.
dad still can't work out how he got it so cheap.
it's worth almost as much today as when we bought it.
and why would you want to go out to a restaurant... when this keeps coming up night after night?
i have two brothers and a sister, all older than me.
but she still managed to come home with a tumble dryer and drill set.
she is the only member of the kerrigan family who'd had a college education.

but dad was just saying how much he thought of con.
she picked up two firsts in the country and a third in town.
dad feeds them every morning in big bowls... that steve made out of tractor hubcaps.
all dad's most prized possessions are in the poolroom – all his mementos and things that remind him of something special.
so, by him saying it was "going straight to the poolroom"
because, between you and me, i reckon the values around here are--
as you can see, i've put a fair bit of work into it.
we couldn't wait to hear all the stories about their trip, and we didn't have to wait all that long either.

and mum, well, mum got him a big german beer mug from franklin mint.
dad couldn't believe his eyes. lt was too good to even drink beer out of.
as you can see, i've put a fair bit of work into it.
would you like me to point out the features as we go along?
well, we should have the official notice in a couple of weeks.
but just quietly, i reckon we could be in for a little surprise.
[ dale ] but dad was never one to bring worries home.
even in the down times he'd still tell us funny stories about his day.
[ dale ] trace and con had a great honeymoon in thailand.
we met them as they came off the plane with a baggage cart, which was lucky 'cause they had heaps of stuff.
we couldn't wait to hear all the stories about their trip, and we didn't have to wait all that long either.
'cause one of the good things about living next to the airport... is that it doesn't take long to walk home.

mr. kerrigan, air link, as a federal authority, has the right to purchase property compulsorily.
and, as far as i can see, you have offered no evidence to refute that right.
well, okay, um, the law is supposed to be about justice-- no, fairness.
and i know that sometimes what is right and fair is not clear-cut. lt's a bit iffy.
but, you know, i never heard that one you say before.
"a man's home is his castle." well, that's an old saying.
- they just said-- l want you to get on that phone right now and tell 'em where they can shove their 25 grand.
darryl, " them" is the barlow group, people used to getting their way.
- now, bob, he went off to talk to one of the stewards.
and this young fella, he comes right up to me and starts chatting to me... and he asks me out.
this is a blatant violation... of the constitution of the commonwealth of australia.
and when it comes to violations, they don't come any bigger.
that's your classic case of big business... trying to take land, and they couldn't.
[ judge ] mr. denuto, the mabo decision... pertains to the specific issue of native land title and terra nullius.
[ dale ] dad reckons he must have sat there for an hour.
he said it was like being kicked in the guts with the back end of a bus.
i think he was lookin' forward to the day you came back to the house.
well, you tell dad... the only reason i loved that house is 'cause it had him and mum in it... and like... everyone else.
wherever they go, i'll love... as long as it has them in it.
and all those lawyers and government people can just go and get fucked.
i know this is no longer our house, but i'll be buggered if i can sign those papers.
i just cannot physically pick up the pen and sign them.
"the parliament shall have power to make laws... with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms."
let's think about those words, "on just terms" ... and how they relate to real people.
[ dale ] dad reckoned it was in the bag, even though they had five times more lawyers than we did.
my client has adhered to the law, every law, every statute from the town planning act to civil aviation regulations.
i refer the court to his honor mr. justice dixon's decision... in grace brothers and the commonwealth.
[ dale ] as much as dad hated to admit it the other lawyer was good, and he was gonna give us a real run for our money.
the interpretation of "on just terms" was considered in the tasmanian dams case.
the court took into account the interests of the community, such as, uh, job creation--
[ dale ] dad reckoned dennis got the hang of things real quick.
the main job of the senior counsel was to provide backup for the q.c.
what this principle fails to take into account... is that competing rights cannot be weighed one against the other.
is a family's right to live freely in their home outweighed--
...not that our children will have a place to live, but whether they'll have prompt delivery of their parcels.
- [ chuckling ] - [ dale ] dad thought it was real funny, even though he didn't get it.
it's a place for the family to turn to, come back to.
but that doesn't seem to mean as much as a big fuckin' driveway.
and somehow that's not worth as much as a big driveway.
you may think our appeal is based on emotion rather than law.
sure, the kerrigans built a house, then they built a home, and then a family.
you can acquire a house, but you can't acquire a home, because a home is not built of bricks and mortar... but love and memories.
you can't pay for it, and you're just shortchanging people if you try.
i can't speak for those who wrote this document, but i'll bet when they put in the phrase " on just terms,"
he reckoned it was the most satisfying victory he'd had in 47 years.
dad reckons it's important to be noble in victory, so he spoke to the other q.c.
first tonight, a landmark decision in the high court today... has confirmed the age-old saying, "a man's home is his castle."
when the huge air link consortium tried to compulsorily acquire a string of homes... on melbourne's outskirts earlier this year, they didn't expect a fight.
[ dale ] mum reckons it's real funny how one day you're not famous, and then the next day you are... famous, and then you're not anymore.
dad had one of the biggest parties ever that night back at home.
six months later we got notice that wayne would soon be eligible for parole.
dad rang mr. hammill, who was more than happy to come out of retirement again.
at first dad thought it was out of politeness, but it can't be... 'cause he goes up there all the time.
he and dad still hit it off as good as they did the first day they met.
he often used to sit out on the patio and just smile to himself.
and they still live at 3 highview crescent, even though it's only them two living' in it.
roz, do you really think that anyone could miss your glow?
so, i tell him, and he says fine, it's not a problem.
currently she's trying a case in seattle defending "the butcher knife killer".
sam, do you think being in the public eye, dating some of the world's most famous men, affects the way jurors perceive you?
normally a troll like me has to trick a woman to get a date.
i once dated a man who had gone out with several of the top british actresses but got sick of their vanity and insecurity.
but it's the only thing i want to do right now.
i'm flattered and the thought is very tempting, but on my show i'm constantly preaching that people should get to know one another, have things in common before taking that kind of step.
they had this great exhibit where you climb into this boat, put on a life jacket and they simulate what it's like to be caught out at sea in a hurricane.
niles, why did you ever agree to go on a ride like that?
i might venture a theory at which you're sure to hoot.
what may be making you uncomfortable is that you find yourself in the more submissive role.
bob flanagan, artist, masochist and one of the longest living surv--
bob flanagan, artist, masochist and one of the longest-living survivors of cystic fibrosis lost his battle this week with the killer disease, a genetic disorder of the lungs and pancreas, that both plagued and empowered the provocative performer
flanagan was in and out of hospitals most of his life.
doctors gave him little chance of survival past the age of six or seven years, but survive he did, well beyond anyone's expectations.
started humming to the tune "supercalifragilistic", so i wrote this song.
i know that any disney people here, they'll probably tell me to cease and desist, and believe me, i will... but not yet.
he's tied up by his ankles and he's hanging upside down
a lifetime of infection and his lungs all filled with phlegm
from the time he came over from the hospital he was literally in pain.
when he was 18 months old, they discovered that he had pus between the chest, all over the lung.
and every day for a week they took this baby into the surgery room
and they would put needles into his chest, draw out the pus,
so i decided my visible man, to mirror me, would have green mucus coming out of the mouth, and of course sperm, 'cause coming and coughing is about the only two things i do on a consistent basis.
and also shitting-- with cystic fibrosis, shit-- bad digestion has been with me all my life, and bad runny bowels is a constant thing, so i figure my visible man should shit all the time.
the next question was, "what should i use for the fluids? "
so i start with the sperm, that's the easiest thing to do, it just comes right out of the bottle.
i want him to be able to go plop, plop, all day long, real slowly.
finally, i came up with the idea of good old alberto vo5 and just went back to the old tempera paint.
and when i have to go on antibiotics they access it with a needle into this little portacath up here.
so i have a central line which basically goes into my vein right to the heart.
i would be going at it in the bedroom and the bed would be squeaking, by myself.
the door would be open and he's sleeping in the bedroom across the hall.
by the time we got into early adolescence and early puberty it was like, no, he was this absolute puritan- the first one that told my parents i was doing drugs;
the first one to, you know, to sort of rat on me about everything that i was doing wrong.
i'd be trussed up by 3:00 in the morning by these plant hooks.
i used to get off the chair for a while and swing.
so i ruined almost every door at my parents' house by tying belts to my wrists and suspending myself from the door as i was lifting my feet off.
so the hinges would just pull-- nobody could understand why the doors never closed.
to me he was the most normal, the most-- he had a weird sense of humor, i knew that.
but i didn't know there was another side to him, that he kept very well hidden from us.
what she does to a piece of meat would make a grown man cry.
i don't know whether it was the clothes she wore, the sound of her voice, or the look in her eye, but i knew right then and there, i was hooked for life.
i don't know how good i am, but with the loving hand of rose to prod me along i know i'm bound to get better.
i know you're busy, so i won't tie you up any longer.
because there are so many out there who have-- maybe not as highly evolved thoughts about it as bob did, but certainly who have the same kind of yearnings.
right off the bat, i showed her i had a pierce in my penis, and i said i wanted to be a full-time slave to a woman, to do everything she wanted and to wait on her and have sex in whatever way she wanted or didn't want.
that got to be a chore, and that's why i don't have dogs.
i don't get turned on by slamming my hand in a car door.
of my own free will, i, bob flanagan, grant you, sheree rose, full ownership and use of my mind and body.
i will obey you at all times and seek your pleasure and well being above all other considerations.
i will answer truthfully to the best of my knowledge any and all questions you may ask.
i understand and agree that any failure by me to comply fully with your desires shall be regarded as sufficient cause for severe punishment.
she whips my ass with a studded strap until blood comes.
wild spontaneous fuck on the black vinyl couch while watching "network" on tv.
we fuck even though she says she didn't want to give me the pleasure of fucking too much.
and even though i was an insensitive crazy bastard last night, she's on her period and i come out all bloody.
you don't give me a chance to be nice to you.
the day i got married to you you were not nice.
i thought, "well, it's not that much of a body but i'll do the best i can with it."
and i've done a lot over the years, we both have.
i never slapped anybody before, just seen it in movies, but with bob, that's what we got into.
so it was sort of fun to start to slap him.
didn't want to go by the eye, didn't want to go too low, just right here, in the nice fatty part of the cheek.
even before i met bob i had seen a japanese movie called "the realm of the senses."
one of the things they do is she chokes him-- she gets on top of him and she chokes him with this cord.
i always wanted to do that to somebody, never had an opportunity to do that-- but then again, here came bob.
and his orgasms-- even though he didn't come very much, which was fine with me-- he had incredible orgasms.
to get the idea of just how far you could go-- not to kill them.
and every time he thinks about them he'll remember-- he'll look at bruises that i gave him.
we'll talk about that and get very hot and all excited.
after three hours of writing i asked for permission to come back to bed where we slapped and licked each others' assholes.
and i get spanked and bleed a little and we fucked, boy, we did fuck.
he had told me a fantasy he had of being hit with a lot of different implements and photographing that.
so we set up this whole elaborate set-up with camera and bulb release.
sometimes bob had the bulb and each time he got hit that's when we snapped it.
overall i think we did 15 different implements-- 36 shots each.
i find that i don't have that power over him anymore.
he is now sort of coming to his own as a visual artist.
in the video scaffold we shot hours of footage of each part of bob's body, and assembled the footage into continuous loops that played over the seven hanging monitors.
bob added various audio clips from film, television and commercial video gathered over the years.
but he said he felt lucky that he found someone who was interested in his art career.
but he said if i wasn't, if i didn't want him to, he would've been glad to spend the whole life in my dungeon, underneath my house, in the basement with the dead cats.
fantastik, snuggle, cheer, joy, pledge, and all the other janitorial aphrodisiacs-- keep up-- that not only clean and shine, but also declare my eternal servitude and dedication to the one i love.
but as in all fairy tales, midnight comes, hard-ons go flaccid and everything gets dirty again.
i like to lie in bed, as long as i can, let people in the gallery come and see me.
nothing like the chris burden on the shelf thing, it's a derivative extravaganza.
people come to the museum and say, "hey, there is a derivative."
and i want to begin by asking bob flanagan, "how do you feel? "
"don't touch your body, don't think about your body, think of the body of christ."
do you find, bob flanagan, that your genitalia has acquired sort of a calloused feeling and your level of pain experience has grown higher over the years with this kind of work?
with all my heart and soul, all i ever wanted was to be strung up, spanked, splayed, saddled, stuck, strangled, split open, spreadeagled, shit on, spat at, sewn up, shoved, shackled,
shaved, shocked, sucked, sapped, soaked, screwed, stripped, scratched, suffocated, sacrificed, strait-jacketed, squelched, stifled, scorched, straddled, stoned, smothered, smashed, screamed at, shouted at, snapped in two, sawed in half,
people don't think of the masochist as being a strong person.
the stereotype that the masochist is sniveling and weak is actually not true.
and bob is not so well, lord, so i put him in your hands.
i'm asking you to touch him, lord, from the crown of his head to the sole of his feet.
then i come into the hospital and i feel okay and i wonder what i'm doing in the hospital.
then i go out of the hospital and i feel like shit.
the hospital where she is being treated has referred her to our foundation for a wish.
when i contacted sara about a wish, she knew immediately what she wanted-- it is something she has always wanted-- it is to meet you."
and then when i was in the hospital, she approached me and she said,
"if you still really want to meet this guy, we can go through the wish foundation."
i don't know, because like i said before... bondage is, to me, that's-- i don't know what you'd call it, but i can relate to that.
i guess-- it's the same thing, i think, with bob-- being able to control your body for a change, and being able to control something.
and i'll go out of the house with collars wrapped around my neck and stuff, but not to the extreme.
but it certainly attracted me, because, you know, you don't hear about people with diseases being like that.
i'm like, "once i'm 25, i'm not going to be around."
and i believed that and i almost wanted it, 'cause what can you do after 25?
but now, especially seeing everything that bob and sheree have done, now i'm looking more towards-- i want to go into journalism.
and i want to write-- not just about cf, but i want definitely to get more known.
and then i can go on and on and never think about it.
but despite what everybody says, i know it's gonna kill me.
but then, it was his life-- maybe he saw it that way.
but he was in pain so much at the time, of course, maybe that is the way he would see it.
this is my way of telling you to go fuck yourself."
i have to apologize-- my body is kind of thin and there isn't much to work with.
and i learned to say, "well, i'm not gonna get another one.
so i'm gonna use this one until it's all used up."
one of the things i'm gonna try and do is a posthumous piece where i want to be buried with a videocamera just like this, encased in a tomb or something.
and someplace in the museum, or one of my crazy collectors that i'm gathering-- this is a good way to make money beforehand, you say,
i'll have to spend money to have a satellite, i guess-- connection to the video monitor.
and every now and then, whoever wants to walk in this room- turn on a switch-- they can see how i'm progressing or decomposing.
i nailed the head of my cock to a board the way i saw in a magazine the other day.
i got so excited by it that i had to try it.
and seeing that being the end of me and sex the way i know it.
i pulled the nail out as quick as i could, using alcohol swabs to stop the bleeding.
after extracting the nail, and stopping the blood, and putting ice on the throbbing knot,
i tied myself up on my stomach, wrists attached to my ankles-- don't ask how, it's too complicated--
because i had the attention, because i was a loner a lot, because i was different.
because kids beat me up on the way to school, because i was humiliated by nuns, because of christ and the crucifixion, because of porky pig in bondage, force-fed by some sinister creep in a black cape.
because of stories about children hanged by their wrists, burned on the stoves, scalded in tubs, because of "mutiny in the bounty,"
because of cowboys and indians, because of houdini, because of my cousin cliff, because of the forts we built and the things we did inside them.
because of what's inside me, because of my genes, because of my parents, because of doctors and nurses, because they tied me to the crib, so i wouldn't hurt myself, because i had time to think, because i had time to hold my penis,
because i had awful stomachaches and holding my penis made it feel better.
because i thought like i was going to die, because it makes me feel invincible, because it makes me feel triumphant, because i'm a catholic, because i still love lent and still love my penis and in spite of it all, i have no guilt.
because my parents said "be what you wanna be", and this is what i wanna be.
because i ' m nothing but a big baby, and i wanna stay that way and i want a mommy forever, even a mean one, 'specially a mean one.
because of all the fairy tale witches, and the wicked stepmother and the stepsisters, and how sexy cinderella was, smudged with soot, doomed to a life of servitude.
because of hansel, locked in the witch's cage until he was fat enough to eat.
because of "o", and how desperately i wanted to be her.
because of my dreams, because of the games we played, because i've got an active imagination, because my mother bought me tinker toys, because hardware stores give me hard-ons, because of hammers, nails, clothespins, wood,
padlocks, pullies, eyeballs, thumbtacks, staple guns, sewing needles, wooden spoons, fishing tackle, chains, metal rulers, rubber tubings, spatulas, rope, twine, "c" clamps, "s" hooks,
razor blades, scissors, tweezers, knives, push pins, 2 x 4s, ping-pong paddles, alligator clips, duct tape, broomsticks, barbecue skewers, bungee cords, sawhorses, soldering irons.
because of tool sheds, because of garages, because of basements, because of dungeons, because of "the pit and the pendulum,"
because of the tower of london, because of the inquisition, because of the rap, because of the cross, because of adam's family playroom, because of morticia adams and her black dress with its octopus legs.
because of motherhood, because of amazon, because of the goddess, because of the moon, because it's in my nature, because it's against nature.
because it's nasty, because it's fun, because it flies in the face of all that's normal-- whatever that is-- because i'm not normal.
because i used to think i was part of this vast experiment and there was this implant in my penis that made me do these things and allowed them, wherever they were, to monitor my activities.
because i had to take my clothes off and lie inside this giant plastic bag so the doctors could collect my sweat.
because once upon a time i had such a high fever, my parents had to strip me naked and wrap me in wet sheets to stop the convulsions.
because i learned to take my medicine, because i was a big boy for taking it, because i can take it like a man, because as somebody once said, "he's got more balls than i do."
because it is an act of courage, because it does take guts, because i'm proud of it, because i can't climb mountains, because i'm terrible at sports, because no pain, no gain,
but then i got to know you real well, and... l-- l came to realize... that you´re a fat idiot.
-l got ya. i got ya. i got ya. i got ya.
if the shoe fits i want you to wear it and wear it good
sulkin´ about them times when i was by myself i was always lookin´ for somebody else
and i´m sayin´ call me a fool ´cause you only rub it in
- and i´ll never see you if i had known - l´ll never see them again
friends and enemies around me every day i can´t believe the things they say
takin´ me for granted give me no credit at all i´ll just keep bouncin´ like a bouncing´ ball
and i´ll never see you if i had known i´ll never see that again
´cause, well l know the difference just stay in my own business
no-- l haven´t taken these to the focus group yet. i´m still working on that part.
but i just wanted to let you know these are just preliminary sketches.
nick beam is the master of his fate... the ruler of his destiny.
so if you wanna cry on somebody´s shoulder, why don´t you cry on superdick?
l-l-l just see a weak, desperate little man... that probably grew up torturing little animals.
some puny, little uncoordinated... can´t-make-the-football-team- so-l´ll-pick-on-third-graders- and-steal-their-lunch-money... punk, jerk-off bully... that one day wakes up and realizes he´s nothing.
but once i did have this nightmare where sheila and marcy are sitting... right next to each other, and this eskimo guy comes over and says, "pick."
i thought i was gonna die. i mean, an eskimo guy.
and so i thought i´d take her to a party and show her a good time.
and she meets this guy and goes home with him instead.
money don´t make my world go ´round i´m reaching out for the higher ground
to a warm and peaceful place i can rest my weary face
pressure´s on i have to choose i´ve got nothing to lose
i close my eyes i take a chance l-l, i now dance a different dance
so, i´m bringing it back, and i expect a full refund.
and if you do not give me a full refund, you will not... be doing business with myself or my company.
now i seen places and faces of things you ain´t never thought about thinkin´ lf you ain´t peeked then you must be drinkin´ and smokin´
pretendin´ that you´re locin´ but you´re broken, let me get you open
now, little timmy got his diploma and little jimmy got life
and tamica around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
the other homey shot the other homey and ran off with his money
and when the other homeys heard about it they thought that it was funny
and though i got love for ya l know i can´t trust ya
´cause my crew is rollin´ numbers and your crew is rollin´ dusters
and just because of that you act like you don´t like a brother no more i guess that´s just the way you go i ain´t tryin´ to preach, i believe i can reach but your mind ain´t prepared
i see ya when you get there i´ll see you when you get there lf you ever get there
more temptation and fate i guess we livin´ for today i seen a man get swept off his feet by a bull with an ak
the situation´s so twisted everybody gettin´ lifted i´m just tryin´ to take care of my kids and handle my business
´cause it´s way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
so you don´t get caught slippin´ when they come to do all the gettin´
life is a big game so you gotta play it with the big boys
some of us gotta run a little faster ´cause we gotta lay the straw
and we gonna set a time somebody up there still love us l´m gonna scuffle and struggle with ya l´m breathless and weak i done strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak
always keep reachin´ sure to grab onto somethin´ l´ll be there when you get there waitin´ with the sounds bumpin´ l´ll see you when you get there lf you ever get there

so if you wanna cry on somebodys shoulder, why don't you cry on superdick?
as for nick beam, i'm fit, lit... and i damn sure ain't taking no shit.
at night, there's only two guards and a personal security system.
now, in this case, i happen to even know the code.
i mean, they both think they're my best friend, which is okay by me.

that's what a character out of a maverick comic would say.
he knows, that the police will look at this, and that there are people like me.
the man looked a bit mean but the woman had style.
they came in and went directly into the room over there.
the neighbours describe her as being inconspicuous, friendly and living a very secluded life.
as it appears to be, none of the tenants remember talking to her, not even once.
nick beam is the master of his fate... the ruler of his destiny.
so if you wanna cry on somebodys shoulder, why don´tt you cry on superdick?
at night, theres only two guards and a personal security system.
now, in this case, i happen to even know the code.
well, you got a funny way of not robbing a motherfucker.
nick, lets get out of here, man, before he calls the cops.
- i-i just see a weak, desperate little man... that probably grew up torturing little animals.
some puny, little uncoordinated... cant-make-the-football-team- so-i´lll-pick-on-third-graders- and-steal-their-lunch-money... punk, jerk-off bully... that one day wakes up and realizes hes nothing.
i mean, they both think theyre my best friend, which is okay by me.
but once i did have this nightmare where sheila and marcy are sitting... right next to each other, and this eskimo guy comes over and says, ´ppick. "´
and so i thought id take her to a party and show her a good time.
and she meets this guy and goes home with him instead.
so, im bringing it back, and i expect a full refund.
and if you do not give me a full refund, you will not... be doing business with myself or my company.
now i seen places and faces of things you aint never thought about thinkin´
if you aint peeked then you must be drinkin´ and smokin´
pretendin that you´rre locin´ but you´rre broken, let me get you open
now, little timmy got his diploma and little jimmy got life
and tamica around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
the other homey shot the other homey and ran off with his money
and when the other homeys heard about it they thought that it was funny
but whos the dummy ´ccause now you done lost a hustler
cause my crew is rollin´ numbers and your crew is rollin´ dusters
and just because of that you act like you dont like a brother no more
im just tryin´ to take care of my kids and handle my business
cause it´ss way too serious so you gotta pay close attention
so you dont get caught slippin´ when they come to do all the gettin´
life is a big game so you gotta play it with the big boys
some of us gotta run a little faster cause we gotta lay the straw
but id be a fool to surrender when i know i can be a contender
and we gonna set a time somebody up there still love us
im gonna scuffle and struggle with ya i´mm breathless and weak
i mean, antonio can do this thing with his tongue, and william's stamina is amazing.
and as far as hands go, well, your father's hands are...

i mean, they both think they're my best friend, which is okay by me.

we better find this crime scene quick before we get kicked out of here.
in fact, accelerant from your still ignited the fire where the body was found.
i don't know nothing about no accelerant, but i haven't fired a single round today, and that's the truth.
we know that you were out trying to buy alcohol, 190 proof.
i heard about this guy in the glades who was selling it cheap, you know?
sir, a jury is going to hear evidence that your family buckshot killed this man.
you put that shotgun in either of our hands, you let me know.
this bedroom is more secure than any other part of the house.
so he was more concerned about people already in the house coming into his bedroom.
so he fakes an escape in the water, doubles back and hides.
when he spotted alexx's van, he knew she was his way past the roadblock.
we'll transport you back to the hospital as soon as we're finished.
i... you said on the phone you want to talk about paul?
that's the only way the wadding could've ended up in your hair.
it was made of high-strength beverage packaging, the same substance our trace lab found in your hair sample.
yeah, i've installed security systems for all the big fish in miami.
a- list clients, big money people you never even heard of.
but then i got to know you real well, and... l-- l came to realize... that you´re a fat idiot.
-l got ya. i got ya. i got ya. i got ya.
if the shoe fits i want you to wear it and wear it good
sulkin´ about them times when i was by myself i was always lookin´ for somebody else
and i´m sayin´ call me a fool ´cause you only rub it in
- and i´ll never see you if i had known - l´ll never see them again
friends and enemies around me every day i can´t believe the things they say
takin´ me for granted give me no credit at all i´ll just keep bouncin´ like a bouncing´ ball
and i´ll never see you if i had known i´ll never see that again
´cause, well l know the difference just stay in my own business
no-- l haven´t taken these to the focus group yet. i´m still working on that part.
but i just wanted to let you know these are just preliminary sketches.
nick beam is the master of his fate... the ruler of his destiny.
so if you wanna cry on somebody´s shoulder, why don´t you cry on superdick?
l-l-l just see a weak, desperate little man... that probably grew up torturing little animals.
some puny, little uncoordinated... can´t-make-the-football-team- so-l´ll-pick-on-third-graders- and-steal-their-lunch-money... punk, jerk-off bully... that one day wakes up and realizes he´s nothing.
but once i did have this nightmare where sheila and marcy are sitting... right next to each other, and this eskimo guy comes over and says, "pick."
i thought i was gonna die. i mean, an eskimo guy.
and so i thought i´d take her to a party and show her a good time.
and she meets this guy and goes home with him instead.
money don´t make my world go ´round i´m reaching out for the higher ground
to a warm and peaceful place i can rest my weary face
pressure´s on i have to choose i´ve got nothing to lose
i close my eyes i take a chance l-l, i now dance a different dance
so, i´m bringing it back, and i expect a full refund.
and if you do not give me a full refund, you will not... be doing business with myself or my company.

pretendin´ that you´re locin´ but you´re broken, let me get you open
now, little timmy got his diploma and little jimmy got life
and tamica around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe
the other homey shot the other homey and ran off with his money
and when the other homeys heard about it they thought that it was funny
and though i got love for ya l know i can´t trust ya
´cause my crew is rollin´ numbers and your crew is rollin´ dusters
and just because of that you act like you don´t like a brother no more i guess that´s just the way you go i ain´t tryin´ to preach, i believe i can reach but your mind ain´t prepared

three other agencies in addition to ours have been invited to participate in the review.
the pitch is on friday... and we don't leave this room until we're solid on a concept.
in comes a picture of cindy, and beneath that, a little log line that says,
"cindy crawford graduated second from podunk university, a b.s. in biochemistry."
i've been going over my expense report, and, uh, i want to let you know, in case anyone from accounting should ask, that i had dinner with you on the ninth, on the 11th,
a humdinger on the 23rd, and a light lunch yesterday, okay?
as the power vested in me by the state of new york,
i now pronounce you, sajit, and you, susan, as man and wife.
they're there because we want all of you to be our wedding photographers.
feel free to keep any pictures you want or give them to us or to other guests.
yeah, he likes you, but he's got a real point of view about your career path.
so just, you know, let him get that out of the way, and then-
now, unlike anyone else who works for me, you're the only person i know who lives like they're still in college.
i mean, you're, uh, you know, you're as free as a bird, which is fine... for you.
oh, by the way, there's a reception for the gulden's people tomorrow night, and mercer asked me to ask you to be there.
he also asked me if you owned any nice dresses he hadn't already seen at work.
and she's behind the bowl of mustard... and i don't know if she has to be nude or not.
i mean, maybe she wouldn't actually have to be nude, but because of the way the bowl is in the picture and given the parts of the model you would actually see, she would appear to be nude.
i was with a really beautiful man... who, up until last night, never even noticed me.
and then all of a sudden he wanted to be with me, and i really wanted to be with him... so we slept together.
and you know, the thing that really kills me is she loved the lie so much better than she liked the truth.
i mean, even when i had to fudge a little bit, you know?
you know, normally this would be about the time that i'd leave.
most of the women i get involved with are either married or have a boyfriend.
it's sunday night, you're videotaping an out-of-town wedding, when suddenly a fire alarm goes off.
everyone's evacuating, but as you leave, you hear what sounds like a child crying.
figure out what night is best for you because i'm pretty flexible, you know?
so if you want to bring a friend or people you work with, that's up to you, and it's good we ran into each other again like this.
i'm afraid he's gonna come here, take one look at you, and say to himself,
"what the hell am i doing marrying the junior version when the real thing is still available?
i'm sorry, i didn't know we were on the clock yet.
okay, just grab my ass, kiss my neck, and pull me into the office, okay?
yeah, this is the fight that we're gonna have tomorrow night.
um, so i sort of- i wrote it out like a play, so...
no, but as long as you get the basic point across, you know, like you've had it.
i'm always at work, my mind is always on my work.
it's an honor that these people asked me to be there for those moments... and i get paid for it.
i'd like to propose one last toast... to our new friend nick... definitely someone i'd like to have in my lifeboat.
i'm going to look into that surrogate mother thing we talked about, okay?
i mean, a man's gotto do what a man's gotto do, you know?
that you were gonna leave and i wasn't gonna have a chance to say good-bye.
you know how you said, um, last night about coming down on the weekends-
i mean, no one more so than you, i'm sure, but everyone here is working under the assumption that this part of your life is over, that this person is out of your life.
i mean, with this big account, we're all gonna be eating a lot of dinners, going to a lot of functions, maybe picking up a clio or two, and he is not someone anyone wants to see again... certainly not with you.
i mean, you know, as you can see in front of you, it's, um...
i'm gonna be working like mad, you know, and it means a lot of late nights and, uh, deadlines and, uh, migraines, and, um...
i went and i found him and offered him money to come and have dinner with us.
i asked him to make a fool out of himself, and he didn't want to, uh, but he did it for me.
he did it to please me, and i did it to please you, and i'm sorry.
and i'm sorry most of all, i think, that i convinced myself that whatever talent i had meant nothing unless it came in this package that everyone liked.
you know, when i-when i applied for my first job at young rubicam,
i told them that i graduated in the top 10% of my class.
three other agencies in addition to ours have been invited to participate in the review.
the pitch is on friday... and we don't leave this room until we're solid on a concept.

"cindy crawford graduated second from podunk university, a b.s. in biochemistry."
a humdinger on the 23rd, and a light lunch yesterday, okay?
you know, i think i would really feel a lot better about this if we actually did have dinner onetime.
as the power vested in me by the state of new york,
i now pronounce you, sajit, and you, susan, as man and wife.
they're there because we want all of you to be our wedding photographers.
feel free to keep any pictures you want or give them to us or to other guests.
basically what i'm doing is, uh, putting together a video testimonial for susan and sajit.
just, you know, all their friends wishing them the best of everything, eternal bliss, truckloads of happiness, et cetera, et cetera.
yeah, he likes you, but he's got a real point of view about your career path.
so just, you know, let him get that out of the way, and then--
uh, you know, i think you're doing a hell of a job for us, kate.
and i'm sorry if your role at the agency isn't all you hoped it would be, but, uh, you know, i suspect in time--
and like you, i felt that my talents and my hard work weren't being appreciated.
anyway, i finally get my 10 minutes with the boss, and he says to me, "alan, in business we dress for the job we want, not the job we have.
i mean, you're, uh, you know, you're as free as a bird, which is fine... for you.
but i'm not about to encourage you to develop a relationship with one of my largest clients when i know there's nothing keeping you from picking up and going to work for one of my competitors and maybe taking my big client with you.
i didn't do it to you, i did it for you.
and only because i knew you'd never work up the courage to do it for yourself.
'cause that's the feeling... that you feel... right before... it feels incredible.
you know, normally this would be about the time that i'd leave.
you know, i was just talking to davenport over at gulden's, and when i told him that this guy was your guy, well...
we'd like to take you two kids out to dinner, just the 6 of us.
so if you want to bring a friend or people you work with, that's up to you, and it's good we ran into each other again like this.
so think about what i said, and i'll give you a call tomorrow.
i'm always at work, my mind is always on my work.
so i thought that would be sort of a nice touch, if our breakup sort of reaffirmed my commitment to the firm.
okay, great, so i'll be at this place called man ray.
it's in the phone book if you need me, but i really-
what if, um, what if i didn't pick a fight with you tonight?
you know, what if we finished our meal with these people and...
if you like him so much and he likes you, then why isn't he your boyfriend?
because, technically, i'm unavailable because, technically, you are my boyfriend, okay?
i'm going to look into that surrogate mother thing we talked about, okay?
i mean, a man's gotto do what a man's gotto do, you know?
that you were gonna leave and i wasn't gonna have a chance to say good-bye.
you know how you said, um, last night about coming down on the weekends--

he did it to please me, and i did it to please you, and i'm sorry.
and i'm sorry most of all, i think, that i convinced myself that whatever talent i had meant nothing unless it came in this package that everyone liked.
i guess you could say i was dressing for the job i wanted.
i told them that i graduated in the top 10% of my class.
well, the truth is i was lucky to graduate at all.
look, i know i don't deserve it, but i would love another chance.
you know, i'm not asking for, like, a ring or anything, you know?
three other agencies in addition to ours have been invited to participate in the review.

a humdinger on the 23rd, and a light lunch yesterday, okay?
i bet there's an ob-gyn out there who's just waiting for me to come walking into his office, you know?
that would explain all those damn yeast infections, don't you think?
well, for once i want your hair out of your eyes.
i want your eyes and your ears open at this wedding.
uh, in the center of each table, you'll find a polaroid camera and boxes of film.
they're there because we want all of you to be our wedding photographers.
basically what i'm doing is, uh, putting together a video testimonial for susan and sajit.
just, you know, all their friends wishing them the best of everything, eternal bliss, truckloads of happiness, et cetera, et cetera.

no, but as long as you get the basic point across, you know, like you've had it.
i'm always at work, my mind is always on my work.
i mean, you know, you've been the topic of a lot of conversation and speculation around here.
i'm very sorry that i monopolized your fiance's evening, but i've just come to realize that she's...
what if, um, what if i didn't pick a fight with you tonight?
you know, what if we finished our meal with these people and...
if you like him so much and he likes you, then why isn't he your boyfriend?
because, technically, i'm unavailable because, technically, you are my boyfriend, okay?
i mean, a man's got to do what a man's got to do, you know?
excuse me just for a second, 'cause i'll be right back.
that you were gonna leave and i wasn't gonna have a chance to say good-bye.
you know how you said, um, last night about coming down on the weekends-
uh, darce, i really got to talk to you about something.
well, mr. mercer and i, we have something we'd like talk to you about.
i mean, no one more so than you, i'm sure, but everyone here is working under the assumption that this part of your life is over, that this person is out of your life.
i mean, with this big account, we're all gonna be eating a lot of dinners, going to a lot of functions, maybe picking up a clio or two, and he is not someone anyone wants to see again... certainly not with you.

you know, when i-when i applied for my first job at young rubicam,
i told them that i graduated in the top 10% of my class.
they're convinced that if they can get people to try their product, they'll keep on using it.
three other agencies in addition to ours have been invited to participate in the review.
the headline reads "if you never gave number two a try, think what you'd be missing."
in comes a picture of cindy, and beneath that, a little log line that says,
"cindy crawford graduated second from podunk university, a b.s. in biochemistry."
then on the facing page, a beauty shot of gulden's mustard.
a humdinger on the 23rd, and a light lunch yesterday, okay?
you know, i think i would really feel a lot better about this if we actually did have dinner onetime.
and our creative team is going to be headed up by my good friend sela here.
she has asked-she has asked for dominic, nancy, and jim to assist.
as the power vested in me by the state of new york,
i now pronounce you, sajit, and you, susan, as man and wife.
they're there because we want all of you to be our wedding photographers.
feel free to keep any pictures you want or give them to us or to other guests.
yeah, he likes you, but he's got a real point of view about your career path.

so i thought that would be sort of a nice touch, if our breakup sort of reaffirmed my commitment to the firm.
okay, great, so i'll be at this place called man ray.
it's in the phone book if you need me, but i really-i should just be an hour.
it's an honor that these people asked me to be there for those moments... and i get paid for it.
i'd like to propose one last toast... to our new friend nick... definitely someone i'd like to have in my lifeboat.
i'm going to look into that surrogate mother thing we talked about, okay?
i mean, a man's got to do what a man's got to do, you know?
also-and this is a little complicated for me, but don't let it spoil your good fortune-
davenport has asked me to move sela out of the way and to make you creative leader on the account.
i haven't been around nearly as much as you, kate, but, um...
i'm pretty sure you're supposed to leave that on the night table.
i asked him to make a fool out of himself, and he didn't want to, uh, but he did it for me.

you know, i'm not asking for, like, a ring or anything, you know?
once upon a time in a forest, there lived a man and his beautiful daughter.
one day a golden carriage drawn by six horses stopped before their house.
apart from this, there was no fault to be found with him.
blaubarc bluebeard helmurt barz what does to kill a woman you love mean?
will a person cut someone up like that because the devil made them do it?
what if they all had some similar trauma in their childhoods?
but even if you manage to hypnotize someone, you can't change their basic moral sense.
a person who thinks murder is evil won't kill someone, through hypnotic suggestion.
it's guys like you who have my head about to split open!
lunatics like you have it easy while citizens like me go through hell!
i must spend my whole life taking care of that wife of mine!
if it weren't for you... things would be fine with my wife and me.
that phony lawsuit that lady filed against the shop would have busted me...
- if you hadn't stepped in, but, still, i can't let you...
last night is one thing, but somewhere... somebody's looking for this baby.
i've been monitoring every police channel, every television station, every newspaper.
look, i don't know if you guys missed it, but, uh... the only people who know about this sl 27 thing are either dead or comatose.
and those people are important to us... like your daughter is to you.
no, it's against the law... to prematurely place a child without the signature of a biological family member.
i realize you love the baby, but this is the way it has to be handled.
6.32 million cubic feet of dirt... was carted off for the centre's underground construction.
but the centre's 26 sublevels only occupy... 6.16 million cubic feet.
i got out of little rock and moved in with axe.
i want to be able to think about christine for a while.
me and my old man used to watch hoops on the tube.
i figured someday, me and my kid would do the same.
we just got in the car, and the next thing i knew...
i'm being dragged out on the bridge, and all i could hear was my michael crying.

there's another five i have not had a chance to read yet.
i've lettuce in my refrigerator with better chances of becoming conscious than this guy.
people often disagree about these things, but as time goes on...
then the physicians and the family members usually come to a mutual decision.
i know you're skeptical, but i'm absolutely certain my father hears everything i say.
and furthermore i've discussed his care with him and he wants us to put in the feeding tube.
as my sister doesn't want that my father should be receiving life support...
i don't think it's appropriate to allow her to be alone with him.
this thing with my father has been so hard for me.
i just have been so confused about what to do with him.
when my dad was a signalman, in the navy, he almost died in an explosion.
and he decided then that if anything ever happened to him...
listen, anything i may have said to felicia was said in confidence.
if you bring it up, i'll deny i ever said it.
you know, doctors and technicians from around the world, work for dr. hofstadter.
the only people working here that are memorial staff are me and poindexter.
she also wants us to stop all invasive procedures and treatments.
her half sister constance wants us to do everything we can to keep the old guy alive.
for unauthorized medical treatment, battery, fraud and everything else hers lawyers can think of.
and if the bed five dies, constance potter is gonna sue us for medical malpractice.
i've heard... nurses and technicians laughing and telling jokes in my father's room...
as if he was not there, as if there wasn't a living person in the room.
we'd be going forward with surgery to insert a feeding tube within 48 hours...
when you see him, maybe you could remind him of that.
i started thinking that maybe she's right about not proceeding with the gastrostomy.
i mean, why should we feed him if he's not gonna get any better?
with those babies we get paid - not- to perform medical procedures.
it's a little like when the government pays the farmers not to grow crops.
dripping thousands of dollars a day in nutrition medication into him.
people are afraid to die, so they pay us to keep them in suspended animation.
if it was your fault, then you don't deserve to be on my team.
and if it wasn't your fault, then you are not lucky...
what'd you think would happen if i got in my car one sunday and drove over to this kid's house...
and said, "hey, kid, come next door, cut my grass, and...
and if you want service in a service economy, you pay for it.
and if you don't pay for service in a service economy...
dr. miller, i tried to get dr. ernst down, but dr. butz took the call.
he started asking if the patient got medical coverage, then said that dr. ernst is too busy.
you know, this is the very best part of my job!
i get to talk to people who, at long last, know what's important!
divine justice is based not only on what you did, but on what you did not do.
and you did not do anything for anybody unless they could do something for you.
when i wake up in the morning, he is being suctioned...
and when i have dinner at night, a nurse is moving around to see if he has bed sores....
you know one of those daughters had an outside neurology expert in here today?
he tried to tell us that bed 5 tremors were purposeful attempts at communication.
because nobody ever believes that an insurance company cares about anything...
except getting paid the premiums and honoring as few claims as possible.
but i'd like the opportunity to talk to felicia and constance.
i feel it's in the best interest of the patient to find a common ground...
the reason you'll sign is because 5 million dollars is better than nothing.
if one of you doesn't sign, i'll make sure that person doesn't get a dime.
don't forget, i can keep your father legally alive almost indefinitely.
actually with modern medical technology i could probably give a glass of water...
be a doctor who doesn't have prestige or make much money...
also, your father will have vital signs for a very long time...
can't have any fluids because you don't have any kidneys, so you can't pee.
[ coughing ] i can give you some ice chips every so often.
people often disagree about these things, but as time goes on, the physicians and family members usually come to a mutual decision.
but in this case one of the family members is totally bonkers!
[ laughing ] now you wanna tell me that's just some kind of seizure?
well, if there's nothing else, i've got to start my morning rounds.
and i wrote it 30 years ago, before i started drinking... and chasing women and having some fun.
now i think i'm entitled to relax and enjoy my life a little bit.
i know you're skeptical, but i'm absolutely certain my father hears everything i say.
i've discussed his care with him, and he wants us to put in the feeding tube.
since my sister doesn't believe my father should be receiving life support,
i don't think it's appropriate to allow her to be alone with him.
when my dad was a signalman in the navy, he almost died in an explosion.
and he decided then that if anything ever happened to him, he did not want to hang around, paralyzed or comatose.
i don't wanna go back on that fucking ventilator and that fucking dialysis...
tell those fucking doctors they can go on those fucking machines.
i mean, your problem is that your illness... makes you absolutely useless to other people.
from now on, you're nothing but a burden to the living.
people have, uh, nothing to gain from being nice to you.
well, your loved ones may continue to, uh, display an instinctual affection, but even they will ultimately shun you.
[ moans ] is in what we call a persistent vegetative state.
[ whimpering ] the gastrostomy, the feeding tube, helps keep him alive.
[ dr. hofstader ] the patient arrived 12 weeks ago with pulmonary hemorrhage, severe hemoptysis, dyspnea and hematuria.
kidney biopsy shows linear deposition of immunoglobulin and complement... in the glomerular basement membrane.
well, to help this man and his daughter put an end to this suffering.
under state law, i need the testimony of two doctors... that the patient's in a persistent vegetative state.
all you have to do is say in court exactly what you told felicia.
listen, anything i may have said to felicia potter was said in confidence.
doctors and technicians come from around the world to work with dr. hofstader.
the only people working here on memorial's staff are me and...
felicia potter is seeking injunctive relief to stop us... from putting the feeding tube in her father.
she also wants us to stop all invasive procedures and treatments.
now her half sister constance wants us to do everything we can to keep the old guy alive.
both sisters have retained big expensive law firms, so there's gonna be real carnage before this is over.
if we keep this guy alive, felicia potter is gonna sue us... for unauthorized treatment, battery, fraud and everything else her lawyers think of.
if bed five dies, constance potter is gonna sue us for medical malpractice.
just because he's unconscious doesn't mean he can't hear and understand everything we say!
have you spoken with any of the chaplains or nuns in our pastoral care program?
people have to giggle or tell a joke to break the pressure.
you can't spend 12 hours a day dejected because you're working with the terminally ill.
but why should we prolong the inevitable by putting a tube in?
well, you think just because someone's gonna die, soon, we don't need to feed them.
[ man on phone ] this is the cafeteria, dr. butz.
as long as i've got you on the phone, let me be the first to tell ya:
with those babies, we get paid not to perform medical procedures.
it's a little like when the government pays farmers not to grow crops.
just make sure you don't have money for health care, and you'll die a happy fella... with a big smile on your face in your own king-size bed!
this poor schmuck in bed five didn't load up on insurance... so he could go gently into the good night.
we could have fed and vaccinated every kid in brooklyn on this guy's tab.
dr. ernst, i'm getting some bizarre wave forms from the swan-ganz.
your father is in what we call a persistent vegetative state.
he's always going to be just the way he is now.
that's the ten million... stays in the trust for five years.
if after five years bed five has not remarried and is still alive, he gets the money.
what do you think would happen if i got in my car one sunday... and drove over to this kid's house and said, "hey, kid."
"come next door, cut my grass, and if i ever get any money, i'll pay you.
if you want service in a service economy, you pay for it.
if you don't pay for service in a service economy, you ruin the whole country.
if we sew up this kid every time somebody whacks him... over the head at a disco, we're gonna run this country into the shitter.
dr. miller, i tried to get dr. ernst down, but dr. butz took the call.
call him back and tell dr. butz... that we have a 76-year-old male who's had a stroke.
you tell him that he has major medical insurance, catastrophic insurance and medicare.
your lawyer sent the hospital a subpoena ordering me to testify at the hearing.
i spent most of the day being interrogated by the hospital's lawyer.
divine justice is based not only on what you did, but on what you did not do.
and you did not do anything for anybody unless they could do something for you.
when i have dinner at night, a nurse is moving him around so he doesn't get bedsores.
when i go to bed at night, he is still hooked up to that ventilator!
you know one of those daughters had an outside neurology expert in here today.
tried to tell us that bed five's tremors were purposeful attempts at communication.
in eternity, i will still be here holding this man's hand and praying.
you'll still be here asking me these questions and struggling to love me... and to love this man and to love yourself.
however, if dr. ernst is going to make a statement of his own, we can no longer represent him.
we've had great concerns about dr. ernst ever since... he received a subpoena from the plaintiffs.
we are no longer sure whether his interests in this case are the same as ours.
- dr. ernst, do you understand what mr. payne just said?
and the doctors and hospital have a lawyer, and they should all care about the patient.
but what they really care about is patient turnover, occupancy rates, expensive tests, overpriced drugs, profits.
while the patient does not have a voice here, it is the court's responsibility to protect his interests.
and to be honest, i'm not sure whether we hurt or help that situation.
i feel it's in the best interest of the patient to find a common ground... on how to proceed with caring for their father.
and i think it would be best if it was just the three of us.
you also each sign releases for the hospital and all the doctors.
and finally, each of you will sign a power of attorney, giving me sole and complete authority... for medical decisions on behalf of your father.
and i can end his life anytime i want just by turning a knob.
why do you want power of attorney over his medical decisions?
i'll get kicked out of my residency program, and i'll be a doctor who doesn't have prestige or make much money.
also, your father will have vital signs for a very long time, and connie will get $10 million.
she wants that feeding tube in, even if it means more suffering for my father.
people often disagree about these things, but as time goes on, the physicians and family members usually come to a mutual decision.
"for we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against powers,
"against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
dr. ernst, if i was someone like you, about to go on morning rounds with someone like me, i would be on time.
dr. hofstader wants to see you in his lab tomorrow, right after rounds.
i know you're skeptical, but i'm absolutely certain my father hears everything i say.
i've discussed his care with him, and he wants us to put in the feeding tube.
since my sister doesn't believe my father should be receiving life support,
i don't think it's appropriate to allow her to be alone with him.
this thing with my father has been so hard for me.
i've just been so confused about what to do with him.

kidney biopsy shows linear deposition of immunoglobulin and complement... in the glomerular basement membrane.
listen, anything i may have said to felicia potter was said in confidence.
if you bring it up, i'll deny i ever said it.
felicia or i will call you again soon, all right, doctor?
she really would appreciate your help and, um, so would i.
we like to think of patients as information that can be digitized.
then we can build computer models for surgeons to practice on... that are identical with any patient.
one daughter has hired a lawyer to fight against further invasive procedures.
they've already served us their lawsuit for permanent injunction, and by the end of the day, they'll have a temporary restraining order.
she also wants us to stop all invasive procedures and treatments.
now her half sister constance wants us to do everything we can to keep the old guy alive.
if bed five dies, constance potter is gonna sue us for medical malpractice.
no matter what you say, you're supplying one of them with evidence.
just because he's unconscious doesn't mean he can't hear and understand everything we say!
have you spoken with any of the chaplains or nuns in our pastoral care program?
people have to giggle or tell a joke to break the pressure.
you can't spend 12 hours a day dejected because you're working with the terminally ill.
he's supposed to be scheduled for gastrostomy, and the family won't consent to it.
you see, bed five is called a patient, and we're called the doctors.
why should we feed him if he's not gonna get any better?
the man needs a tube put in him because he can't eat, right?
if the patient were a part of an h.m.o., then i could understand your dilemma.
with those babies, we get paid not to perform medical procedures.
this poor schmuck in bed five didn't load up on insurance... so he could go gently into the good night.
he wanted us to put up a fight, and he wanted us to be paid in cash.
we could have fed and vaccinated every kid in brooklyn on this guy's tab.
dr. ernst, i'm getting some bizarre wave forms from the swan-ganz.
your father is in what we call a persistent vegetative state.
he's always going to be just the way he is now.
that's the ten million... stays in the trust for five years.
if after five years bed five has not remarried and is still alive, he gets the money.
it has my phone number, my office number, my car phone number.
if you think of anything you haven't told me, call me immediately.
dr. miller, i tried to get dr. ernst down, but dr. butz took the call.
he started asking questions about medical coverage, then said dr. ernst was too busy.
you tell him that he has major medical insurance, catastrophic insurance and medicare.
you tell dr. butz that's the patient we need dr. ernst for.
your lawyer sent the hospital a subpoena ordering me to testify at the hearing.
i spent most of the day being interrogated by the hospital's lawyer.
divine justice is based not only on what you did, but on what you did not do.
and you did not do anything for anybody unless they could do something for you.
when i have dinner at night, a nurse is moving him around so he doesn't get bedsores.
when i go to bed at night, he is still hooked up to that ventilator!
not with poindexter on duty and all those lawyers sniffing around.
you know one of those daughters had an outside neurology expert in here today.
the hospital neurologist came in right after the first one and said... this guy's cerebral cortex is like cottage cheese.
these tremors are just patterns of disturbance... caused by neurological deficits.
if he's dead, then my prayers and god are with him.
and if he's not dead, then my prayers and god are with him.
you'll still be here asking me these questions and struggling to love me... and to love this man and to love yourself.
god will still be here... and everyone who ever lived will still be here too.
your honor, i represent dr. ernst as part of a joint representation agreement... between memorial hospital and medical center.
however, if dr. ernst is going to make a statement of his own, we can no longer represent him.
we've had great concerns about dr. ernst ever since... he received a subpoena from the plaintiffs.
we are no longer sure whether his interests in this case are the same as ours.
and the doctors and hospital have a lawyer, and they should all care about the patient.

also, your father will have vital signs for a very long time, and connie will get $10 million.
this patient will be gone when you come back tomorrow, but there'll be a new patient in his place, and everything else will be the same.
disease, injury, old age, all the same old problems will be here.
if it had been up to me, i'd have cut their penises off !
i will cite that case and other laws to combat immoral acts or material offensive to women.

um now, mr. harding, do you really want to look at this ladies stuff, i mean... -

mr. harding, you and your body police say that no one should endure pain in a sexual context.
see the spiked cage, the weights attached, attached by that woman there.
there are a further 37 instances of flagellation, - piercing, branding, ritual cutting... known as scarification.
i heard you listening at the door once, after i swished a couple of the lads.
i'd never stand for anything - the slightest bit risque, kinky...
not long ago, a number of perverts were gaoled for nailing their penises to plaques and even sicker acts.
if it had been up to me, i'd have cut their penises off!
i will cite that case and other laws to combat immoral acts or material offensive to women.
conservatives, christians, and feminists, such as these ladies, all agree that the degrading of women has gone far enough.
i haven't any firm plans, except to serve the public good if i can, mr. harding.

and if the defendant displays her bosom in such a wanton manner tomorrow,
how much ass do i have to kiss to make partner?
- tell her i broke my leg and i had to be shot.
maybe we can stop at the park on the way home and play catch.
then tonight we can rub oil in it and wrap a big rubber band around it.
because if i take you to court, it'll drain eight hours out of my life, and you won't show up, and if i got the judgement, you'd just stiff me anyway!
so i'm gonna piss and moan like an impotent jerk... and then bend over and take it up the tailpipe!
i lost you, but please don't make me lose max too.
give me a chance to be the father i started out to be.
do you know what your son was doing at 8:15 last night?
he was making a birthday wish that for just one day... his father couldn't tell a lie.
max, no one can survive in the adult world if they have to stick to the truth.
i could lose my case, i could lose my promotion, i could even lose my job.
- and the company wouldn't give me one... and i asked if you would give it to me out of your own pocket...
and you said the company would not allow it, because it would create jealousy... among the other secretaries.
several years ago, a friend had a burglar on her roof.
he fell through the skylight, landed on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.
thereafter mrs. cole would frequently have... a male visitor arrive and stay from one to four hours.
i was able to take several photographs of the male visitor.
[witness] well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn, but i was able to make a recording of one such session.
your honor, as you are aware, under the terms of the prenuptial agreement, if mrs. cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing.
well, in that case, i better take a little break myself.
but you get back here immediately so we can finish this.
young man, having my judgement mocked in my own court... is not something i'm prepared to tolerate!

then your mom told me you were moving to boston, and i started thinking.

do you know what your son was doing at ·:15 last night?
he was making a birthday wish that forjust one day his father couldn't tell a lie.

was that true, or did you just not want to pony up the dough?
several years ago, a friend had a burglar on her roof.
he fell through the skylight, landed on a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.
during that period, i noted that mr. cole left each day between 7:40 and 7:50.
thereafter mrs. cole would frequently have a male visitor arrive and stay from one to four hours.
do you know what mrs. cole and her male visitor did during these frequent visits?
well, they were pretty good about keeping the shades drawn, but i was able to make a recording of one such session.
your honor, as you are aware, under the terms of the prenuptial agreement, if mrs. cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing.

what i'm getting at is kate mctiernan... appears to be suffering from posttraumatic shock.
you make it sound like he ain't cooking on the front burner.
