yeah, i went in to the nursey for a "hi, dad,"
and he said to me, "you know, dad, mom's really looking terrific."
and i said, "you're right." he said, "a real trouper, huh?"
not even 2 years old, and he's getting more precocious by the day.
well, i'm not gonna forget about it, you can be sure of that.
and until you can deal with this, until you can talk about it, i don't know-
oh, kystle, i know you thought i was over that, and i did too.
but today's not just any day, it's matthew's and my wedding anniversay.
and i can't help thinking, that there's somebody out there that knows all about matthew and me.
somebody who's tying so hard to destroy my peace of mind.
and you proved the value of that education when you worked as an interpreter for adam at colbyco.
and your value to my company did not go unnoticed by me.
i've made up my mind to belong wherever i say i belong.
before you make your transition, i think there's something you should know about your past.
well, check your own bloodline, kirby, because if i were you, with your background, i'd adopt a child.
my father was lust as good as anyone in this family.
and i hope you are too, because i think mrs. gunnerson packed enough food for five people.
did you leave your office to come over here and have a picnic with me?
when you left, cleaned out your desk, i think you cleaned out mine too.
you'll have to excuse me, steven, but i have something else on my mind.
the china sea evaluation report, the one i prepared, i've been looking for it all morning.
i have a feeling i would have found it hours ago if i had looked in here.
but don't you ever come in here accusing me of stealing something that was legitimately mine in the first place.
now, why don't you trot on back to colbyco and see if you can find where you put that file?
but what's important, father, is that i initiated this entire project.
and that's why i feel i have the right to hand it to you.
i've been tying to think of something appropriate to say but i'm not sure that anything is appropriate at a time like this, fallon.
all i can say is that before me sits a young woman who has been a handful all her life.
i told you that i didn't want to talk about it and i'm not going to.
i'm sory, i'm so rude, i didn't offer you a drink.
you were younger, but i'll take you the way you are.
steven, matthew took this picture of me on our first anniversay.
the south china people's resistance has engaged the alien third corps... and fierce fighting is raging along the great wall, as we go to press.
meanwhile, heavy fighting is also being reported from caracas, venezuela... over control of lake maracaibo and the many oil refineries there.
here at home, there has been no change in the stalemate... going on in the gila river, east of yuma, arizona.
paul savage and his band of resistance heroes... continue to hold the wilderness high ground... against attempts of alien armies of the west to dislodge them.
we need the right to pursue suspects anywhere in the city.
i may have been born at night, diana, but i wasn't born last night.
it is not the girl alone that bought the matter to my attention.
i'm told in the end, she rode off with your son.
speaking of the law, diana, do you still have donovan's son, sean?
there isn't no one with us who doesn't want to be there.
i'll be sure to tell him as soon as he gets back.
would you like me to make you something in the bender?
with luck, the visitors were so interested in finding the horse... they left my bike alone.
i just wanted to let you know... that in a weird kind of a way i've really enjoyed all of this.
i was in the safe, i was looking for you, found your kid.
he told me they killed you and he hit me with something.

this week, the freedom network honors anna horowitz... who heroically lead a contingent of gray panthers... into the visitor armory at charleston, south carolina... where they reworked the control panels of 16 skyfighters... with baseball bats before getting away.
the right to send a goon squad into my city is hardly self-defense.
not a goon squad, a single, discreet, security officer would suffice.
the young girl is reported to have displayed... some rather extraordinary talents.
beating out three men without even laying a hand on them.
i was talking about it last week, but that isn't the point.
the point is that we are sitting in the middle of a traffic jam... the proportions of which would astound you.
based on last year's figures, at today's prices, i'd say about five or six million pounds.
they're the equivalent of-- they're the be all and end all.
- i must remind you that in this case... there are certain other agreements to be taken into consideration.
such as the arrangement entered into with mr. william rath of rathbone industries.
talking about running the business, what i'd like to know is... how did we get so heavily involved with this rath character?
yeah, well, he's part of that group that arranged the bank loan last year.
why don't you come over to my place, and i'll play you some tracks.
we can talk more, 'cause you'll know what we're talking about.
you'd think that people would have had enough of silly love songs
but i look around me and i see it isn't so

it conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution - perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill wheel.
a year when france and england... capitulated to hitler's territorial demands.
it was a year when nazi and italian fascists helped general franco overthrowthedemocraticgovernment of spain into a bloody civil war.
- a year when the french people formed uneasy alliances... in an effort to halt fascist threat.
it was a year when whispers and shadows dominated every day life.
i had no idea... what my purpose in life is... but now i do.
marcel and the others... they are not coming here, are they?
but first it would be helpful if someone with influence could put in a word...
that's all very well, but who's going to fight the germans... if everyone is posted to paris?
fellow frenchmen, at the request of the president of the republic...
i will assure the leadership of the government... assure that the affection of our admirable army... which has been fighting with the heroism...
...far superior in numbers and armaments... assured of the support of our veterans whom i had the honor of commanding... assured of the confidence of the entire population.
i hereby offer myself to france in order to alleviate its suffering.
it would be easier if we could just give them back to you.
the officer at the hospital said that no french prisoners... would be returned until all german troops had left france.
strange, isn't how... ones whole life can be changed by an accidental meeting.
if not for this war, i wouldn't be sitting here with you now.
the concierge spat on me when i got out of your car!
is it stupid to think that when you see someone with a german?
you know, you two are like... you are like family to me.
they say the detention camp is somewhere in the south of france.
picked by the germans to organize some sort of national militia.
he relieves the ss of some of their more distressing duties.
the trouble with being stationed here is, we forget there is a war.
one of them could be the one who brought the gun in.
i was a little afraid the first time, but i'm not afraid anymore.
you're going to be in danger, and i won't be with you.
the old man was preoccupied... hunting secrets in his canvas in its colors and forms;
with an intensity that made him feel young and a bitter certainty of finding nothing that made him feel very old.

irene believed in palmreading as much as in mad love, romance, and the stars' influence on human fate.
her father accepted her departure with a courage so strong it coudn't be hidden.

like all men, he put a high price on the virginity of girls dear to him.
irene was as discreet as her father when he had insisted on remaining igorant of her first affair.
after much self-searching he'd concluded that they'd married because that's what everybody does.
this answer made little sense but it at least ended speculation.

around the equator, where those two essentials for life, sunshine and moisture, are most abundant, great forests grow, and here plants and animals proliferate in such numbers that we still have not even named all the different species.
here, animals and plants, insects and birds, mammals and man live together in intimate and complex communities, each dependent on one another.
two thirds of the surface of this unique planet are covered by water, and it was here indeed that life began.
from the oceans, it has spread even to the summits of the highest mountains, as animals and plants have responded to the changing face of the earth.
this river, the kali gandaki, has cut its way, in the most remarkable fashion, through the highest range of mountains in the world, the himalaya.
to the east of me rises annapurna, over 26,000 feet high.
beneath the rhododendrons live several species of those most splendid of asia's birds, the pheasants.
the blood pheasant, for all its delicate beauty, is a plainer member of the family.
the impeyan's hen, like those of all pheasants, is comparatively dull.
this deepest of all valleys in the world enables you to walk within a few days from the tropics, in its lower reaches, to the equivalent of the poles on the slopes high above, and to see as you make the journey
how closely animals and plants are matched to the changing circumstances.
as you walk higher, the rhododendron forest gets thinner and hung with moss.
on the ground beneath, flowers appear in close-packed bunches, protecting one another from the night frosts.
the little himalayan panda is certainly very well protected against the cold.
not only does it have warm, dense fur, but, like many animals that spend time in the snow, it has hair on the soles of its feet.
that keeps its feet warm on the snow and stops it from sliding on ice.
now, in the summer, it also helps in getting a grip on wet, slippery branches.
it's primarily a vegetarian, collecting buds and leaves and fruit, but it also takes eggs from a bird's nest, if it can find one.
on the ground, and scarcely bigger than the panda, one of the shyest animals of the himalayan forests, a musk deer.
in these tangled trees, antlers would be a considerable handicap, and the musk deer doesn't develop them.
a male fights instead with the sharp tusks in his upper jaw.
they feed on moss, lichen and leaves, and are so agile and well-adapted to a mountain life that they can climb steep cliffs in search of food.
when a musk deer or any other animal of any size dies, the vultures come.
these are griffons, similar to those that circle the skies above indian villages down in the hot foothills.
they are common in this forest up to 7,000 or 8,000 feet.
so the lives of all these creatures are connected, one with the other, either directly or indirectly, and all are ultimately dependent upon the vegetation.
but both animals and plants are also greatly affected by the physical environment.
i've climbed several thousand feet now and things are beginning to change.
it takes fruit on occasion, catches insects now and then, but it relishes small rodents, like mice and squirrels, and there are quite a lot here.
even in winter, when the forests are deep in snow, it will remain active.
its thick fur protects it against severe cold, but its range is not limited by temperature so much as food supply.
in spite of its size, it seldom tackles any animal bigger than a mouse, and it lives for most of the time on ants, grubs, nuts and leaves, so it seldom goes any higher than the forest can grow.
and now, getting on for 10,000 feet up, the forest is beginning to thin.
in summer, there's not much rain here, for most has fallen at lower altitudes.
remarkably, and mysteriously, it doesn't rise from the flanks of these giant mountains but cuts right through them.
the people of the foothills have long since recognised the value of this extraordinary corridor that leads right through the himalayas, and all summer trains of mules trudge up the valley, taking barley and buckwheat to trade with tibetans for wool and salt.
to help plough the fields, they use the yak, a domesticated creature that once roamed wild on the plains of tibet, the only large mammal that lives permanently as high as man.
the people, bhotias and sherpas, grow not only barley but potatoes, a crop that was first cultivated by the incas in the andes and was introduced here a century or so ago.
certainly, when it comes to walking at these high altitudes, they're very much better adapted than i am.
so, all the living creatures in these high valleys are adapted to their environment, both their biological environment and their physical environment.
and yet, in terms of biological history, those adaptations are very recent indeed.
these immense mountains, the eternal hills, are in fact far from eternal.
they are younger than the plains of india to the south or the plateau of tibet to the north.
they were raised to their present height about 65 million years ago from the bottom of the sea.
although there are no molluscs alive today exactly like this one, there are some which are sufficiently similar for us to be sure that it lived in water.
and if we analyse the rock in which it's embedded, it's clear that that was mud laid down at the bottom of a sea.
but i am as far as i can be from the sea.
i am in the middle of asia, miles from the sea, and over two vertical miles above it.
what forces could possibly have raised the seabed to these heights?
we now know that those forces are still in action, that these mountains are still rising and that land is still being created.
fine ash is falling all around, there are gusts of choking, poisonous gas, and it's so hot that this is just about as close as i can get to it.
the sheer weight of these molten ingots of rock prevents them being swept away from the vent by the gale, so there's little danger of them suddenly coming our way.
less dramatic than the fire fountain but perhaps more sinister is this tide of black slag that is slowly creeping over the surface of the land.
in parts it's red-hot and molten and flows like treacle, but on the edges it's cooled enough for me to handle it.
then the centre layers of it cool exceptionally slowly and very evenly, and this is the result.
here, at the giant's causeway, the top of the lava flow has been eroded away, for the eruptions took place 50 million years ago.
the cooling contractions have produced the effect you see in drying mud, though here the cracks extend to a greater depth to produce six-sided columns a foot and a half across.
in the hebrides, there's another lava flow that erupted at about the same time and formed fingal's cave.
the layer of lava that slowed down the cooling of the interior is still uneroded, and beneath it the near-perfect basalt columns rise almost 20 feet high.
basalt that doesn't contain very much gas wells out from below almost quietly.
but if the lava has been extruded under great pressure, it may be full of gas, and then it behaves very differently.
sometimes a flow sweeps down over a forest, incinerating the trees in its path.
most dramatic of all, the lava sometimes wells up inside a crater and can't escape.
then it forms that most fearsome of nature's spectacles, a lava lake, like this one in nyiragongo in africa.
basalt more usually comes to the surface in a rather different way.
these icelandic volcanoes erupt from huge cracks or fissures which regularly open up in a line which runs right across the width of the island.
but that line itself is only the northern end of a huge line of weakness that runs for thousands of miles southwards from iceland right round the side of the globe.
iceland lies between norway and greenland, south of the arctic circle.
the crack, ridged over by lava, is mostly underwater, which is why its existence wasn't known until the beginning of this century.
it runs between europe and africa to the east and the americas to the west.
in places, it rises above the sea to form volcanic islands:
the azores, the cape verdes, ascension, st helena, tristan da cunha.
but the basalt forms not only the ridge itself but the sea floor on either side.
by dating it chemically, we know that the farther it is from the centre of the ridge, the older it is.
basalt is welling up in a molten state at the ridge and then, as it solidifies, is moving away on either side.
we still don't fully understand the forces that power the process, but 50 to 60 miles below the earth's surface it's so hot that the rocks are molten and currents in them are welling up beneath the ridge, causing eruptions,
and then flowing away on either side, pulling the plates of the ocean floor with them.
it was this movement that dragged apart africa and south america and created the atlantic ocean.
but where it meets the continent, it dives downwards, perhaps pulled by the descending current in the crust below, producing a deep trench in the ocean floor.
as it goes down, it takes with it sediments from the bottom of the ocean and also some water.
these new ingredients melt and interact with the rocks of the interior to produce a mixture crucially different from the lava that erupted at the ridge.
for one thing, it contains much more dissolved gas and steam.
as it rises up on the edge of the continent, it cools and solidifies, choking the vents.
the effect is like screwing down the safety valve of a boiler.
on the northern side of the volcano, there were not even trees to be seen.
a huge avalanche of rock, blown out by the blast, had slid for 15 miles down the side of the mountain, burying everything.
almost a century earlier, on the opposite side of the pacific, another catastrophic eruption had taken place on the tiny island of krakatau, in the straits between java to the east and sumatra to the west.
in 1883 it was an island five miles long and three miles wide, with three volcanic peaks on it, the highest rising to almost 3,000 feet.
the column of smoke rose up until it was five miles or so up into the sky.
ships that were sailing nearby had their decks covered in ash and pumice, and at night electric flames played over the rigging.
because on the morning of august 27th, monday, at 10 o'clock, the roof of that lava chamber collapsed.
millions of tons of sea water poured onto the red-hot lava.
3,000 miles away on the small island of rodriguez in the south atlantic, the commander of the garrison heard it and thought it was distant gunfire at sea.
the explosion also produced a tempest of wind, which swept out entirely round the globe seven and a half times before it finally died away.
but most catastrophic of all, the explosion produced a tidal wave.
it swept towards the coasts and became a wall of water over 100 feet high.
the two nearby islets were buried beneath massive deposits of ash.
and where the tallest peak had stood, the sea was 900 feet deep.
all volcanic eruptions spew out sulphur in one form or another, including those underwater.
here it doesn't form yellow crystals, but reacts with the sea water to produce clouds of black sulphides.
until this bizarre colony was discovered, we had believed that all creatures on earth derived their energy through plants from the sun.
even the deep sea creatures fed on fragments falling from the sunlit surface.
eventually, there is some shift deep in the earth's crust and the focus of the intense heat moves away slightly and the eruptions come to an end.
but if water percolates down through the rocks to the magma chamber, it's still so hot that the water is superheated and forced up again, like water in the spout of a boiling kettle.
on the way, it may dissolve minerals from the rocks through which it passes, and then, as it emerges as hot springs, the minerals will be deposited in terraces, like these in rotorua, in new zealand.
in some parts, the superheated steam on its way to the surface has dissolved the softer rocks and brings them up as boiling mud.
elsewhere, the boiling water shoots spasmodically into huge fountains, and the whole area is wreathed in steam.
such a place is typical of land where volcanic fires are on the wane.
the famous hot springs of yellowstone in the rocky mountains are also heated by a vast chamber of molten rock some distance down beneath the surface.
the water welling up from these crystal-clear, chemically rich pools is so hot that no creature can live in them.
when they trickle over the brim, they cool, and there rich colonies of bacteria and mats of algae begin to grow.
they can flourish so thickly that they break the surface and divert the flow of water so that in parts they're cool enough for brine flies.
they lay their eggs directly in the warm mat of the algae.
each has a long white thread to its case, like a seed.
the hot volcanic springs of the rift valley in africa also support their own crops of bacteria and the small algae that feed on them.
but here the creatures that come to harvest them are bigger.
flamingoes, sometimes as many as a million of them on this one lake.
these lesser flamingoes feed entirely on single-celled algae that proliferate in vast quantities in these steaming soda-rich waters.
flocks like these remove 150 tons of these microscopic plants from this lake every day.
their bills have sieves inside them which strain off the algae as the water passes through them.
it's easy to see how creatures can benefit from the chemical riches of volcanoes dissolved in the waters of hot springs.
it's more difficult to imagine how any living thing could derive nourishment from a basalt lava flow.
its surface in many places is as smooth and as hard as glass, and neither frost nor roots of plants can initially make any impression on it.
centuries may pass after an eruption before there's any sign of the surface of such a flow beginning even to weather.
this flow on the flanks of mount kilauea in hawaii is some 3,000 years old, and yet still it shows the rippled, ropy surface that formed when it was liquid.
but in the end the surface does erode and plants do get root in the cracks.
they in turn can support all kinds of other life, and so the lava flow is eventually colonised, not only on its surface but in its depths.
for these basaltic lava flows are often not as solid as they seem.
when the lava first flows out of the vent like a river, that on the outside of the flow will cool quicker and solidify, forming walls on either side of the flow.
the top too cools quicker, and that causes a crust to form over the flow, so that eventually the lava is flowing down a long tunnel.
when that happens, the walls and ceiling of the tunnel act as insulation, keeping the heat in, so that the lava flow remains liquid and so continues for mile after mile.
when eventually the supply of lava stops, that tunnel may drain, leaving a long cavern like this one.
out of the reach of rain and frost and even dust, the surface of the lava looks as it did when the last trickle was draining away and the floor was so hot that anything touching it would be turned to a cinder.
molten lava had dripped from the ceiling, it had swilled round the sides and spurted out in little dribbles from cracks in the newly congealed walls.
they've found their way down through the cracks, and here they dangle, catching water as it percolates through the lava and trickles down them.
among the rootlets, there are animals that live nowhere else in the world.
many of them have also lost their wings and their eyes.
in the blackness, they find their way about by touch, and, like many cave insects elsewhere, have developed long legs and antennae.
i'm some three miles from the crater, and still the scene is one of devastation and sterility.
it's not just that this unweathered ash is not very fertile, but it's also so loose that it's difficult for plants to get root.
its flanks too are covered with ash, and they're still buried regularly with new layers from fresh eruptions, yet the process of colonisation is already under way.
not only are there giant grasses, like this wild sugar cane, but trees:
ten years later there were twice that number, and over 100 species of birds and insects as well.
some seeds must have floated here from java, some 20 miles away, and they still continue to do so.
other smaller ones were probably carried here by birds, either on their feet or in their stomachs.
but the ash is still here beneath the lattice of roots of the jungle trees.
somehow or other, rats and lizards and pythons have all reached here.
there are now many hundreds of different species of plants, and the winds have assisted the passage of many flying insects, whose descendants now form large and permanent populations, pollinating the flowers, feeding on their fruits,
but as far as smaller creatures are concerned, the number of species is increasing all the time.
and on the flanks of volcanoes all round the world, men clear fields and plant crops, even though they know they may be sitting on a time bomb.
only 20 years ago it erupted, killing 2,000 people and leaving 150,000 homeless.
but the balinese will not leave fields that are so fertile they can produce two or three rich harvests of rice every year.
this junction already existed 65 million years ago, when india was an isolated island in the middle of that ocean.
since then, as the ocean floor has continued to spread, the continents have shifted and india has moved towards asia.
as the two continents approached, the sediments between them crumpled and eventually piled up over the junction, so instead of the line between them being marked by volcanoes, it's buried deep beneath an immense range of mountains, the himalaya.
so these great peaks of sandstone and limestone rising five miles into the sky are not only the highest mountains in the world, but among the youngest.
and that is how this ammonite, this sea-living creature, came to rest over two miles high in the himalaya.
that too is the explanation of how the kali gandaki river managed to cut its way clean through the highest range of mountains in the world.
it was flowing south from the ancient plateau of tibet even before the great mass of india collided with asia.
as the sediments between the two land masses buckled and rose over millions of years, the river maintained its course, cutting down through the rocks as swiftly as they rose.
so we have begun our portrait of the planet up on the roof of the world, and we will go from high altitudes to low, from the poles to the equator.
and in the next programme we'll go even higher, to the most inhospitable environment of all, the world of snow and ice.
... there's quite a few of them when i sailed home wounded.
had a good record out in india, did wonders during the mutiny.
dr. john watson, formerly medical officer attached to the royal berkshires, now in civilian practice.
murphy, second in command, temporarily in charge of the royal mallows, following the, tragedy of our colonel's death.
the body was found by private bates, his batman, lying in the morning room.
there was a ragged cut, two-inches long, on the back of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt instrument.
and upon the floor by the body was a singular hand-carved wooden club.
also, stretched out on the sofa lying in a dead faint, was nancy bar -
the servants had been alerted to the tragedy by the sounds of a quarrel between the colonel and mrs. barclay.
they tried to enter the morning room but found it locked.
from private soldier to commanding officer in the same regiment, that's a rare achievement.
i was his gallantry in the indian mutiny that got him his commission, and then quite rapid promotion over the years, more rapid than mine, for instance.
her father was the regimental sergeant major, rsm devoy, and therefore quite a formidable father-in-law for any soldier.
i remember that all the men in my company thought her quite the prettiest girl in the garrison.
as a junior officer i had little to do with her, but i was aware that she was a most charming, most vivacious and spirited girl.
it was quite understandable that barclay was not the only man in the regiment who sought her hand.
and this expression of jealousy occurred within seconds of you, major murphy, leaving the barclays' house.
tell me about the colonel, was he a violent man in any way?
but he'd clawed his way to the top, you need to be ruthless to do that.
surely he didn't still feel out of place as an officer?
you mentioned a carved wooden club found by the body, one of the colonel's indian souvenirs?
i believe the servants deny ever having seen this club before.
i was about half past seven, sir, and i was waiting a table.
once a month, mrs. barclay spent the evening doing charity work in aldershot.
there was thunder in the distance, and i was just saying to mrs. fenning that there was a storm brewing, when the morning room bell rang.
i came up here to find that mrs. barclay had returned.
someone has recently crossed this lawn, the marks are just visible.
he entered and left through those windows, watson, we're on the right search.
these claw marks are not those of a cat, nor of a monkey, nor of any creature that we are familiar with.
i would think from hind foot to forefoot at least 15 inches.
add to that the length of neck and head, you have a creature no less than two feet, more if there's a tail.
the length of its stride is odd, it indicates a creature with a long back and short legs.
miss morrison, when mrs. barclay left her house to come here two nights ago, she was happy and content.
when she returned two hours later, she was a changed woman.
you must tell me what happened last night that so changed her.
very well, i shall break my promise of silence if what i can say can really help her.
not only had he a crooked back, but he was lame and walked with his knees bent.
his face was darkly tanned, crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.
i thought to myself that truly there are some of us on this earth who are burdened with more than their fair share of misfortune.
this vision was made more unusual by the oriental garb the man was wearing.
i pointed this person out to nancy as someone especially deserving of help.
nancy had indeed been in good spirits that evening, and i saw her go towards the man and ask him if he needed assistance.
but although i had her heart, her father didn't approve of me.
i was a harum-scarum, reckless sort of lad, but i was always honest and plain dealing as well.
besides, barclay had had an education, he was already marked for the sword-belt.
rsm devoy naturally thought barclay the better match for his daughter.
there were 10,000 rebels round us, pinning us down like terriers round a rat cage.
we'd run short of food and ammunition, we had to communicate with general neill's column that was moving up-country.
his directions were perfect and soon i was wading through icy water that only the day before had been snow in the himalayas.
i could see the lights and fires in the rebels' camp but i kept well down, out of sight of their sentry posts.
something hard cracked down on my head and everything spun around.
when i came to, i was trussed up like a chicken and hanging from a tree.
my arms felt as though they were being wrenched out of their sockets.
i didn't mind the pain, but i was sick at heart for having failed in my mission.
the very man who had shown me the way to take had betrayed me to the enemy.
barclay had got rid of me to make sure he could have my girl.
my captors fled north, further into the hills, and used me as a sort of slave.
i was treated worse than a dog and they damn near broke every bone in my body.
what use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to get passage back by ship to england and make myself known to my old comrades in the regiment?
even my desire to have my revenge on jim barclay didn't make me go.
i preferred my nancy and my old pals in the royal mallows to go on believing that harry wood died a hero's death with a straight back, than see him crawling about the world more like a chimpanzee than a human being.
but you did return, and to aldershot where your old regiment was stationed, why?
i just wanted to see the old country once more before i died.
i saved what i could and eventually i got a ship.
i could earn my keep going around the canteens doing my tricks to entertain them.
i no longer wanted to kill barclay, the fires of revenge had burned low over the years... until i saw her.
i went outside, then i saw her come out of the mission and i followed her home.
i saw her go into the house, a light came on.
i took the key to the door from nancy's hand, intending to open it and get help.
i thought i'd better get away or things might look black against me.
if the colonel's name was james, and wood was called either henry or harry, then who the deuce was david?
my dear watson, that name david should have told me the whole story had i been the ideal reasoner, which you are so fond of depicting.
there's quite a few of them when i sailed home wounded.
had a good record out in india, did wonders during the mutiny.
they scent a mystery, that much is clear from the little they have been able to say.
surely, it would be wrong to repeat, to draw attention to...
colonel james barclay, was found dead in his villa at about 1 0 o'clock the night before last.
the body was found by private bates, his batman, lying in the morning room.
there was a ragged cut, two-inches long, on the back of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt instrument.
and upon the floor by the body was a singular hand-carved wooden club.
the servants had been alerted to the tragedy by the sounds of a quarrel between the colonel and mrs. barclay.
they tried to enter the morning room but found it locked.
her father was the regimental sergeant major, rsm devoy, and therefore quite a formidable father-in-law for any soldier.
i remember that all the men in my company thought her quite the prettiest girl in the garrison.
as a junior officer i had little to do with her, but i was aware that she was a most charming, most vivacious and spirited girl.
it was quite understandable that barclay was not the only man in the regiment who sought her hand.
i'm glad you're still here, i left my cigar case on the table.
i think the colonel and mrs. barclay have gone to bed, sir.
i believe the servants deny ever having seen this club before.
certainly i've never seen it on any of my visits. it was quite long
it was about half past seven, sir, and i was waiting a table.
once a month, mrs. barclay spent the evening doing charity work in aldershot.
i was in the kitchen helping the cook with the dishes.
there was thunder in the distance and i was just saying to mrs. penning that there was a storm brewing when the morning room bell rang,
i came up here to find that mrs. barclay had returned.
she was walking up and down this room, sir, very pale, upset.
i would think from hind foot to forefoot at least 1 5 inches.
add to that the length of neck and head, you have a creature no less than two feet, more if there's a tail.
no, i can't, i cannot betray a friend, please don't ask me to.
miss morrison, when mrs. barclay left her house to come here two nights ago,
you must tell me what happened last night that so changed her.
vvery well, i shall break my promise of silence if what i can say can really help her.
yet, the other night, i saw the most extraordinary creature i have ever seen.
not only had he a crooked back, but he was lame... and walked with his knees bent.
his face was darkly tanned, crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.
i thought to myself that truly there are some of us on this earth who are burdened with more than their fair share of misfortune.
this vision was made more unusual by the oriental garb the man was wearing.
i pointed this person out to nancy as someone especially deserving of help.
i naturally made a few inquiries among some of the regulars such an unusual looking creature has of course attracted attention.
it appears he is an old soldier recently back from india, and no one knows anything else about his background except that he makes a living by entertaining the troops,
there is no cause for me to be ashamed of it.
you see me now with my back like a camel, my ribs all awry,
she... you'll laugh when you look at this poor thing huddled in front of the fire
and hear me say that it was for my good looks that nancy loved me.
he was careful to keep out of trouble, always did the right thing.
not like me who took nancy to places her father didn't like.
besides, barclay had had an education, he was already marked for the sword-belt.
rsm devoy naturally thought barclay the better match for his daughter.
there were 1 0,000 rebels round us, pinning us down like terriers round a rat cage.
we'd run short of food and ammunition, we had to communicate with general neill's column that was moving up-country.
so, just after then, while my comrades gave me covering fire, i set off.
barclay had told me to follow a stream which would lead to a gully.
when i came to, i was trussed up like a chicken and hanging from a tree.
my arms felt as though they were being wrenched out of their sockets.
i didn't mind the pain, but i was sick at heart for having failed in my mission.
what would be the fate of those i had been trying to save?
the very man who had shown me the way to take had betrayed me to the enemy,
barclay had got rid of me to make sure he could have my girl.
my captors fled north, further into the hills, and used me as a sort of slave.
i was treated worse than a dog and they damn near broke every bone in my body.
i wandered back to the punjab, and lived among the natives, picking up a living by the conjuring tricks i'd learned from the street magicians.
what use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to get passage back by ship to england and make myself known to my old comrades in the regiment?
but you did return, and to aldershot where your old regiment was stationed, why?
i just wanted to see the old country once more before i died.
i thought i'd better get some english tongs, i looked comical enough without wearing these foreign clothes the whole time.
at first, i was more interested in finding a thick overcoat than looking at the charity ladies who were doling them out.
i took the key to the door from nancy's hand, intending to open it and get help, i thought i'd better get away or things might look black against me.
in haste, i thrust the key into my pocket whilst i was chasing teddy who'd escaped from his box and run up a curtain.
if the colonel's name was james, and wood was called either henry or harry, then who the deuce was david?
my dear watson, that name david should have told me the whole story had i been the ideal reasoner, which you are so fond of depicting but alas, my powers of deduction failed me.
don't you remember how king david sent uriah the hittite into the forefront of the battle to die so that he might steal his woman, bathsheba?
i think you will find the story in the first or second book of samuel.
...there's quite a few of them when i sailed home wounded.
had a good record out in india, did wonders during the mutiny.
dr. john watson, formerly medical officer attached to the royal berkshires, now in civilian practice.
murphy, second in command, temporarily in charge of the royal mallows, following the, tragedy of our colonel's death.
the body was found by private bates, his batman, lying in the morning room.
there was a ragged cut, two-inches long, on the back of his head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt instrument.
and upon the floor by the body was a singular hand-carved wooden club.
also, stretched out on the sofa lying in a dead faint, was nancy bar -
the servants had been alerted to the tragedy by the sounds of a quarrel between the colonel and mrs. barclay.
they tried to enter the morning room but found it locked.
from private soldier to commanding officer in the same regiment, that's a rare achievement.
i was his gallantry in the indian mutiny that got him his commission, and then quite rapid promotion over the years, more rapid than mine, for instance.
her father was the regimental sergeant major, rsm devoy, and therefore quite a formidable father-in-law for any soldier.
i remember that all the men in my company thought her quite the prettiest girl in the garrison.
as a junior officer i had little to do with her, but i was aware that she was a most charming, most vivacious and spirited girl.
it was quite understandable that barclay was not the only man in the regiment who sought her hand.
and this expression of jealousy occurred within seconds of you, major murphy, leaving the barclays' house.
tell me about the colonel, was he a violent man in any way?
but he'd clawed his way to the top, you need to be ruthless to do that.
surely he didn't still feel out of place as an officer?
if there had been anything between major murphy and mrs. barclay, would he have related the incident of his forgotten cigar case?
i was about half past seven, sir, and i was waiting a table.
i was in the kitchen helping the cook with the dishes.
there was thunder in the distance, and i was just saying to mrs. fenning that there was a storm brewing, when the morning room bell rang.
i came up here to find that mrs. barclay had returned.
she was walking up and down this room, sir, very pale, upset.
i would think from hind foot to forefoot at least 15 inches.

no, i can't, i cannot betray a friend, please don't ask me to.
miss morrison, when mrs. barclay left her house to come here two nights ago, she was happy and content.
his face was darkly tanned, crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.
i thought to myself that truly there are some of us on this earth who are burdened with more than their fair share of misfortune.
this vision was made more unusual by the oriental garb the man was wearing.
i pointed this person out to nancy as someone especially deserving of help.
the man, too, seemed to be strangely affected by the sight of her, and i saw him gesticulating wildly.
well, nancy and the man went to a quiet corner of the hall and they talked together for a few moments or so before i heard an angry shout from the man and saw him storm out, waving his fists in the air.
there is no cause for me to be ashamed of it.
you see me now with my back like a camel, my ribs all awry, but there was a time when corporal henry wood was the smartest man in the royal mallows.
there were two men who loved her, but only one whom she loved.
she - you'll laugh when you look at this poor thing huddled in front of the fire and hear me say that it was for my good looks that nancy loved me.
he was careful to keep out of trouble, always did the right thing, not like me who took nancy to places her father didn't like.
besides, barclay had had an education, he was already marked for the sword-belt.
rsm devoy naturally thought barclay the better match for his daughter.
but she remained true to me, and we would have married had it not been for the mutiny.
jim barclay volunteered to advise me on the best route to take.
so, just after then, while my comrades gave me covering fire,
when i came to, i was trussed up like a chicken and hanging from a tree.
my arms felt as though they were being wrenched out of their sockets.
it was to be many a long year before i saw another white face.
my captors fled north, further into the hills, and used me as a sort of slave.
i was treated worse than a dog and they damn near broke every bone in my body.
sometimes i'd wish they'd just killed me, but my thoughts of hatred and loathing for the man who destroyed my life kept me going.
i had no means of knowing whether she was alive or dead.
i wandered back to the punjab, and lived among the natives, picking up a living by the conjuring tricks
but you did return, and to aldershot where your old regiment was stationed, why?
i just wanted to see the old country once more before i died.

and upon the floor by the body was a singular hand-carved wooden club.
they tried to enter the morning room but found it locked.
bates had to go around by the garden and get in through the french windows.
she's in hospital, being looked after, with a police constable standing by.
nancy barclay is a handsome woman now, but you should have seen her as a young girl in india, 30 years ago.
i remember that all the men in my company thought her quite the prettiest girl in the garrison.
as a junior officer i had little to do with her, but i was aware that she was a most charming, most vivacious and spirited girl.
but, nancy carried it off with dignity and charm, and they gained acceptance in no time.
barclay's career flourished, and the regiment returned from india some five years ago.
surely he didn't still feel out of place as an officer?
no, i don't think so, but he was subject to a peculiar form of depression.
if there had been anything between major murphy and mrs. barclay, would he have related the incident of his forgotten cigar case?

i came up here to find that mrs. barclay had returned.
someone has recently crossed this lawn, the marks are just visible.
he entered and left through those windows, watson, we're on the right search.
these claw marks are not those of a cat, nor of a monkey, nor of any creature that we are familiar with.
i would think from hind foot to forefoot at least 15 inches.
add to that the length of neck and head, you have a creature no less than two feet, more if there's a tail.
the length of its stride is odd, it indicates a creature with a long back and short legs.
miss morrison, when mrs. barclay left her house to come here two nights ago, she was happy and content.

you must tell me what happened last night that so changed her.

this vision was made more unusual by the oriental garb the man was wearing.
i pointed this person out to nancy as someone especially deserving of help.
nancy had indeed been in good spirits that evening, and i saw her go towards the man and ask him if he needed assistance.
but although i had her heart, her father didn't approve of me.
i was a harum-scarum, reckless sort of lad, but i was always honest and plain dealing as well.
besides, barclay had had an education, he was already marked for the sword-belt.
rsm devoy naturally thought barclay the better match for his daughter.
there were 10,000 rebels round us, pinning us down like terriers round a rat cage.
we'd run short of food and ammunition, we had to communicate with general neill's column that was moving up-country.
his directions were perfect and soon i was wading through icy water that only the day before had been snow in the himalayas.
i could see the lights and fires in the rebels' camp but i kept well down, out of sight of their sentry posts.
something hard cracked down on my head and everything spun around.
when i came to, i was trussed up like a chicken and hanging from a tree.
my arms felt as though they were being wrenched out of their sockets.

i would think from hind foot to forefoot at least 15 inches.
add to that the length of neck and head, you have a creature no less than two feet, more if there's a tail.
the length of its stride is odd, it indicates a creature with a long back and short legs.
miss morrison, when mrs. barclay left her house to come here two nights ago, she was happy and content.
when she returned two hours later, she was a changed woman.
you must tell me what happened last night that so changed her.
very well, i shall break my promise of silence if what i can say can really help her.
not only had he a crooked back, but he was lame and walked with his knees bent.
his face was darkly tanned, crinkled and puckered like a withered apple.
i thought to myself that truly there are some of us on this earth who are burdened with more than their fair share of misfortune.
this vision was made more unusual by the oriental garb the man was wearing.
i pointed this person out to nancy as someone especially deserving of help.
nancy had indeed been in good spirits that evening, and i saw her go towards the man and ask him if he needed assistance.
but although i had her heart, her father didn't approve of me.
i was a harum-scarum, reckless sort of lad, but i was always honest and plain dealing as well.
besides, barclay had had an education, he was already marked for the sword-belt.
rsm devoy naturally thought barclay the better match for his daughter.
there were 10,000 rebels round us, pinning us down like terriers round a rat cage.
we'd run short of food and ammunition, we had to communicate with general neill's column that was moving up-country.
his directions were perfect and soon i was wading through icy water that only the day before had been snow in the himalayas.
i could see the lights and fires in the rebels' camp but i kept well down, out of sight of their sentry posts.
something hard cracked down on my head and everything spun around.
when i came to, i was trussed up like a chicken and hanging from a tree.
my arms felt as though they were being wrenched out of their sockets.
i didn't mind the pain, but i was sick at heart for having failed in my mission.
the very man who had shown me the way to take had betrayed me to the enemy.
barclay had got rid of me to make sure he could have my girl.
my captors fled north, further into the hills, and used me as a sort of slave.
i was treated worse than a dog and they damn near broke every bone in my body.
what use was it for me, a wretched cripple, to get passage back by ship to england and make myself known to my old comrades in the regiment?
even my desire to have my revenge on jim barclay didn't make me go.
i preferred my nancy and my old pals in the royal mallows to go on believing that harry wood died a hero's death with a straight back, than see him crawling about the world more like a chimpanzee than a human being.
but you did return, and to aldershot where your old regiment was stationed, why?
i just wanted to see the old country once more before i died.
i saved what i could and eventually i got a ship.
i could earn my keep going around the canteens doing my tricks to entertain them.
i no longer wanted to kill barclay, the fires of revenge had burned low over the years... until i saw her.
i went outside, then i saw her come out of the mission and i followed her home.
i saw her go into the house, a light came on.
i took the key to the door from nancy's hand, intending to open it and get help.
i thought i'd better get away or things might look black against me.
if the colonel's name was james, and wood was called either henry or harry, then who the deuce was david?
my dear watson, that name david should have told me the whole story had i been the ideal reasoner, which you are so fond of depicting.
(jazz) so megatron got away with all those energon cues, huh?
-yes, but he still has to find a way to get 'em back to cybertron.
we must go to the cave and destroy the space bridge immediately.
-and we'll have a surprise waiting for them when they arrive!
maria knows how tough it is to raise a family on the kind of bread cops make.
hell, eddie, a baby carriage alone will put you back a week's take-home.
they'd already gotten the word that i was a legit runner with a fast boat down at the marina.
after eddie flashed the cash, me and corky were supposed to make the pickup... off a panamanian shrimper eight miles off bal harbour.
the last time i requested a backup, i nearly got shot to death... by bluto and lee harvey oswald over there!
and as for progress reports, i'd just as soon buy radio time.
are you implying that i've got a bad cop in my department?
all i know is, every time i've gotten within 20 blocks of this colombian,
people get blown away all the time in this town... tryin' to go into business for themselves, so lighten up.
you also blew away my end of a $200,000 deal, man.
i can handle four times the weight that my friend could.
i got 200 grand in my "shaving's" kit alone... and unlimited resources in new york city.
two weeks of legwork i put in on this bust, and three-fourths of the dealers turn out to be cops!
me, scottie wheeler and dr. voodoo here... putting in a surprise guest appearance direct from fun city.
i'd sort oflike to keep it that way, if you catch my drift.
hey, no offense, but when it comes to security leaks, this town of yours ain't exactly pentagon south.
the guy's in town for three days- already he's an expert.
that "dude" you showed up with tonight works undercover for the d.e.a., pal.
with a hundred thousand dollar cigarette boat... and a sideline of recreational stimulants.
this cop that bought it up in new york- friend of yours?
currently, he's a watchdog and resident dope-sniffer of the st. vitus dance.
he got benched his senior year for takin'a little chomp out of a georgia free safety.
they practically needed a tow truck to get leon out of that courtroom.
eight-to-five, he'll be on the horn within the hour... screamin' for protective custody and begging' to roll.
i think we might have to consider some sort of temporary... working relationship.
shouldn't i be asking you for a search warrant or something?
i mean, you must have had half the scouts in the nfl on your tail.
traded it all in on two years in the southeast asian conference.
and you wouldn't have come along tonight if you hadn't had trudy along to block tackle.
my father always told me, crockett, never to get involved with a man on the rebound.
now, i may seem somewhat unorthodox to the untrained eye, but when it comes to being a cop, i am strictly business, pal.
and i'll be damned if i'm gonna put my life on the line with some outlaw cop... on a personal vendetta.
i got him low-profiling it on my boat till the party starts.
lieutenant, you've got a call from a sister agnes at immaculate heart.
hoban, dibble, and gorman in the 39-foot cigarette out of fisher island.
two metro choppers and the c.g. cutter won't be given final coordinates... until 30 minutes before blastoff.
okay, weapons check and final pep rally back here at 18:00, girls.
that's big hand on the 12, little hand on the six.
didn't wanna bust up the lecture with any phone calls, sonny, but a guy named tubbs called about 20 minutes ago.
he said he's rushing out for a meeting with a trini desoto or something.
and me clearing a lousy 30 a year, getting shot at by guys who blow that much in a restaurant in a month.
six months ago, a guy comes up to me outside of a club in little havana.
can't his people just hire some crooked judge to cruise on up to the suburbs and spring him?
nobody will know he's in the suburbs, not even calderone himself.
i'll be lucky to get back on payroll as a meter maid.
hey, tubbs, you ever consider a career in southern law enforcement?
i was up till 5:00 this mornin' trading shots of tequila with the little bozo just to close the deal.
it'd be well worth it if he leads us to this colombian.
hell, eddie, a baby carriage alone will put you back a week's take-home.
no wife of mine ought to have to work for a living.
i just wanna let her know how much i appreciate the effort.
maybe take her out on the town tonight for a little, uh, romance.
the last time i requested a backup, i nearly got shot to death... by bluto and lee harvey oswald over there!
and as for progress reports, i'd just as soon buy radio time.
are you implying that i've got a bad cop in my department?
all i know is, every time i've gotten within 20 blocks of this colombian,
you also blew away my end of a $200,000 deal, man.
now, you tell the colombian i want to meet with him about my commission.
i can handle four times the weight that my friend could.
i got 200 grand in my "shaving's" kit alone... and unlimited resources in new york city.
what i'm trying to tell you is there was a foul-up...

he got benched his senior year for takin'a little chomp out of a georgia free safety.
they practically needed a tow truck to get leon out of that courtroom.
eight-to-five, he'll be on the horn within the hour... screamin' for protective custody and begging' to roll.
you know, not that vice isn't the most glamorous gig in the world, crockett, but what happened, huh?
i mean, you must have had half the scouts in the nfl on your tail.
i'm saying that the only people who knew leon was there were cops.
you know, buddy, you got a leak in your department the size of the east river.
after that little fiasco last night, i'm through dealing with a middleman.
you tell calderone he wants his cash, he deals with me, teddy prentiss, personally.
i consider to be one of the most righteous cops in the entire country... and who i've worked with for six years, which is six years longer than i've known you, my friend.
well, since you know him so well, maybe you wanna explain an $18,000 deposit... he made at first national 10 days ago.
it can handle a good 80 keys and still outrun anything that the coast guard's got.
in that case, you might wanna have a second one of the same on call.
i don't know who that joker is, crockett, but according to the readout,
detective rafael tubbs has been dead and buried over three weeks now.
"she left me at sears and i cried all the way to walgreens."
you can play that beach bum, cowboy routine with the football lingo... and the beer commercial mentality from now till doomsday, but i don't believe it.
well, why have you tossed four dinner invitations in three weeks back at me?
and you wouldn't have come along tonight if you hadn't had trudy along to block tackle.
my father always told me, crockett, never to get involved with a man on the rebound.
and as far as i'm concerned, you're bouncing so hard, you're practically out of the ballpark.
i got him low-profiling it on my boat till the party starts.
lieutenant, you've got a call from a sister agnes at immaculate heart.
funny thing is, is you know i almost believed you till this morning.
nothing like having some guy roll over at sunup and whisper his ex-wife's name in your ear... to boost your self-image.

at this hour, the fire rages out of control... and it is said that you can hear the rebel yell in the streets of dixie tonight.
the most recipient of the freedom network's medal of valor... proves that one man can make a difference.
look, lady, i don't know who you are, or where you come from.
you come waltzing in here off the street, talking to me about the resistance... for all i know, you could be a lizard.
kyle, please don't tell me whether i can go or not.
i'm tired of hiding and running... while other people are putting their lives on the line for me.
do you know the commercials you're starring in now... are all because of my work?
if i were not a close friend of the boss, you wouldn't have got the present price.
he just wants to finish the installments on his truck as soon as possible.
on that day, he bought a dvd from china for my son.
she locks herself up in her room and refuses to eat.
i thought she'd been having a love problem, we'd like to talk to her, god knows...
that's why i have to ensure the ratings of the programmes.
if there is anything wrong or bad, i must change it.
the older one is named lam, the young one is named yeung.
he graduated and returned from a religious school in tainam 10 years ago.
it's for the audiences to call in and chat with us.
last night, a lady told us that her daughter has been possessed.
for example, if a person died, his family wants to know him more.
after death, one's soul will stay on earth for a certain time.
i know you always wanted to show us a strong appearance.
but i know michelle's death was a great blow to you.
my husband always played mahjong with his coworkers in our old neighborhood
we moved out because i didn't want my husband messing around with that lot
it's the same whether you have a boy or a girl, what old fashioned thoughts you have
if i had a boy my husband would be nicer to me
i hate people who won't face up to their own mistakes
stop that, stop crying, or you'll be accused of killing my child!
time goes by and never comes back, only memories remain, recalling our sweet childhood
we've been at this all day, i'll head up there now.
a good flat should face south, but this one is facing north
incidentally, this month is the time when evil is the strongest, so injuries and death are inevitable
sadly, it's only 20 years later that you come to collect it
please read it to me, it's half in english and half in chinese
a shame we have to be back in los angeles in two days on important business.
two days with the great remington steele is better than none.
i also talked to a woman who lives over the alley.
she said there was a black motorcycle parked there this evening... about the time the robbery occurred.
the hapsburg dagger was gonna be sold there... but, uh, our old friends the palermo brothers got wind of it.
they said they would mutilate my beautiful joelle if i didn't help them to steal it.
it was a stupid plan, amply demonstrated by our present circumstances.
it was an excellent plan, and i would have been in the clear... if you hadn't been so intent on playing nancy drew.
i suppose it's also my fault... that the palermo brothers didn't fall for your little scheme.
at the moment, the palermo brothers are easier to cope with than you.
i'm more like the errant schoolboy who needs your guiding hand.
no matter how many times i prove myself, i always get the same look from you- this gazed veiled look of suspicion.
- what does that boat have to do with what we were talking about?
regardless of who actually swiped the bloody dagger, we now know who it was stolen for.
you saw the palermo brothers approach henri... and you tapped his phone and learned about mr. steele's plan.
that must have been about the time when you contacted freddie smith... and told him you could supply his long-sought prize.
it was your plan all along to enlist mr. steele at the glee club reception.
that way you could hold him as close as you wanted and monitor his progress.

that way you could hold him as close as you wanted and monitor his progress.
when we first took him in, we were amazed at how well mannered he was.
however, even after half a year, he would not warm up to us.
we only found out after he started living with us ...
that his former foster parents had given him up after 3 months also...
you wanted a child, so you adopted one, but he wasn't what you expected.
so you're returning him like you would return a puppy to a pet store.
do you have any idea how much dad was worried about you?
you're the one that made him worry when you got divorced!
but you're the one that suddenly decided to turn this place into an orphanage.
on top of that, you dragged sis into it as well!
neither she nor her parents want to raise her, so that's why she's here.
she continues to cry up a storm if she's not held like this.
people always say to treasure your family because a family is the best thing to have...
but what are those who don't have one to begin with suppose to do?
perhaps what we needed here most was a guy like him.
why do i have to drive this stupid broken down bus?
"we'll do it tomorrow." the engines had decided to go on strike.
you look so much like a woman i used to know.
if you have some idea that your old friend is going to simplify your life... by easing me out of it, then you're playing a very dangerous game.
ah, laura,just think of the beauty... the inspiration that surrounds us here- picasso, matisse.
i'm not so sure how resounding her trust is... in the security system we've installed for the exhibit.
ah, then this unbounding step is apprehension, and not one of joie de vivre.
almost any museum in the country would have given their endowment... in order to show the patton collection.
[ laura ] this is mrs. welles's first coup as a new trustee, isn't it?
it seems our mystery woman isn't such a mystery after all.
[ laura ] her name is lydia vanowen... and she's going to marry walter patton.
he showed up after the engagement... to remind me that, whether dead or alive, we were still man and wife.
he offered to share walter with me... if i shared walter's wealth with him.
i may have given you your name, even decided your line of work... but your past, your damned past, i always knew you had that over me.
i was hoping your present had come to mean as much to you.
do you honestly believe that all the time we've spent together means so little to me, hey?
how can i answer that when i have no idea what came before or what you're feeling now?
i just can't bear to let you out of my sight.
he forced me to go to him last night... for the same reason he was here today.
i know there's something between us, and i know he feels it too.
it's as if we're groping towards each other... but every time our fingers touch, something happens.
and if his past can just blow in and wipe out the present, maybe i should forget him.
oh, from what i've just heard, that sounds like the last thing you wanna do.
mildred, mr. steele and i have gone out... we've had our fun, but we've never done anything more.
[ scoffs ] so why should i care if he wants to see someone else?
oh, well enough to know she has walter patton completely smitten.
imagine, one of the richest men in the world... and he fawns over that girl like a schoolboy in short pants.
i end up filling her in on my comings and goings with mr. steele.
did you happen to tell her mr. steele and i... were dining with you at the club the other night?
oh, from everything i hear about the man, you are very fortunate.
it's a little late in the game for that tact, miss vanowen.
you have more than marriage to walter patton on your mind.
perhaps i found someone else i'd rather spend my life with.
before or after he gets rid of the man who's threatening you?
what can someone possibly have that could frighten a woman... about to marry one of the wealthiest men in the world?
the minute we got in that room, she started saying things, laughing at me.
it was like she had some kind of plan or something.
something that would make you put raymond out of the picture completely.
so she set up an unsuspecting cowboy at a western bar this afternoon... and ridiculed him into hitting her.
that's persuasively put,young lady, but i'm afraid it doesn't change anything.
i've invested too much to allow either of you to walk away from this.
the first was to say that i had sent raymond packing.
and the second, and more painful, was to say that i-
oh, laura, if this were some normal case we were working on...
i'd blithely come up with a string of movies to explain it all.
i may have given you your name, even decided your line of work... but your past, i always knew you had that over me.
if you have some idea that your old friend is going to simplify your life... by easing me out of it, then you're playing a very dangerous game.
we can understand your apprehensions, mrs. welles... but the remington steele agency has an extensive knowledge of security systems.
in fact, mr. steele has tested... any number of systems around the world.
i take it this was an unexpected event for both of us.
i had no idea he was here, raymond, in this city, in this country.
raymond, if you're so concerned about it... why don't you go and get the car so we can get out of here.
- # [ soft dance ] - [ woman laughing ]
[ laura ] this is mrs. welles's first coup as a new trustee, isn't it?
[ herbert ] yes, but she kept after patton until she got it.
i feel like the only person in the room who doesn't know the punch line.
the woman in the club, uh... is the mirror image of someone i used to know.
oh, laura, if this were some normal case we were working on...
i'd blithely come up with a string of movies to explain it all.
i was still waiting the next morning when i read the paper.
i mean, all i can remember, all i can see were the words...
i think there's something in this morning's paper you might find interesting.
it seems our mystery woman isn't such a mystery after all.
that's why i died, to collect on the policy he took out on my life.
oh, i wanted to tell you about it, believe me, i did.
one day i grew too tired of running and had to stop.
i became lydia vanowen... in a third-class coach to st. moritz.
i was content to go through with it... until you came along.
but now if i don't, if raymond should see us together... he'll know that you're a threat to his plans... and he'll make it his business to get rid of you.
you knew lydia and anna were one and the same when you walked into the office.
laura, please, let me understand the facts of my own life... and then i'll give them to you, okay?
you dole out pieces of your past... and i'm supposed to be grateful for your trust.
i may have given you your name, even decided your line of work... but your past, your damned past, i always knew you had that over me.
i was hoping your present had come to mean as much to you.
do you honestly believe that all the time we've spent together means so little to me, hey?
oh, from what i've just heard, that sounds like the last thing you wanna do.
mildred, mr. steele and i have gone out... we've had our fun, but we've never done anything more.
oh, then we both know i don't have to tell you anything.
[ clears throat ] you really ought to let more people know about... the wide array of merchandise you have here.
we were in the process of working that out when you came along.
if i was a better person, i'd wish you good luck.
perhaps i found someone else i'd rather spend my life with.
before or after he gets rid of the man who's threatening you?
but she needed something that would drive you over the edge.
something that would make you put raymond out of the picture completely.
so she set up an unsuspecting cowboy at a western bar this afternoon... and ridiculed him into hitting her.
that's persuasively put,young lady, but i'm afraid it doesn't change anything.
uh, when i went to anna's, it was for two reasons.
the first was to say that i had sent raymond packing.
well there may be caves around here but i don't see any way in.
a minor snag, we thought we found a way in but it turned out to be a dead end.
a base here will complete the necessary network for those tests.
someone committed this site without first securing a place to transmit?
and to practice freestyle diving, that last one was a beaut.
hell of a gentleman you are, you could've jumped in here to save me.
- i'm from richmond, it's a little town in the northern part of missouri.
like i say it's a small town, it's in a really beautiful part of the state.
hey, i'm not taking civilians down there, we don't know what we're dealing with.
- dammit wolf, i feel the same way that you do but we can't do this...we can't do this alone.
we'll have to split up, search as many passages as possible.
and stay with your group, after a while these formations are going to start looking alike.
we stay here much longer, we're going to end up like that clown ourselves.
feel free to press on ahead if it'll make you feel better.
george, take newman and set up a marker where we found our dead friend.
leslie, what you saw, could that have been white or lopez?
right, we have to decide whether to go on or not.
- we must, that other poor man is still down there.
he lived on elephant island but preferred to live with us.
i still see him walking in the rain untouched by a single drop.
the best players in the world had come to try and beat her.
without leaving her room, marylina beat all of them at once in exactly 10 minutes.
poor wretches, fools who run around, dashing in all directions, forever parading their indignation...
think of it: only a few months ago, i was stupid, too and now i'm condemned to understand everything.
the flight of birds is news from the london stock exchange.
and those clouds are good tidings from my aunt mary, miss world.
in the forbidden garden, the voices hide behind the howling wind.
just then he sees the light where the sheep used to sleep before the earthquake.
he pretends to go there, for he knows his mother's watching.
but, after crossing the bridge of winds, he turns and heads for the garden where he's forbidden to play.
when he was 20, he left to do his military service.
he was assigned to the air force, in command of a helicopter.
i like having a son in the air force, and a helicopter pilot.
then he spoke to manuel as if he'd always known him:
what i'm about to do will hurt me more than it will hurt you, believe me.
your mother and i have decided to give you 10 ruler blows on the hands.
"we were in sight of the cape of good hope, formerly called the cape of torments, thinking of all the terrible effort, of all the blood spilled, the dead..."
years went by, and after failing in school, he dropped out and went to the city to seek work.
we'll go to the sea to make a man of you.
the smell of salt water is good for the lungs and the health.
your mother and i have discussed about you and we think you deserve a reward.
i don't approve of these methods, but sometimes an earned reward must be given.
you'll go to a good school on the mainland, then to high school in paris.
you'll study medicine in london and do your specialization in south africa.
without illusions, manuel goes back to sea but my aunt was a bigot, too.
with no surprise, he watches the capture of the reborn fish.
maybe we can try here to do the same if we concentrate on the same dream.
but, since a sailing ship is useless, let's dream of something useful.
next time, a little closer and so on until gravity hook into it, and it come crashing down.
you hear some noise on your roof, and you got a sputnik sizzling in the living room.
every time i come in here, i bring that whole damn folder.
birth certificate, death certificate doctor's certificate, job certificate landlord certificate, tax form receipts, bills.
mrs. brown, i'll take over your recertification if you want me to.
man wanted my folder, but i wouldn't give it to him.
you mean, what do i want or what do i want that you can cook?
well, in that case, where are you taking me for dinner?
i got a few ideas on jobs if you can really fix things.
if this doesn't pan out, i'll take you to the men's shelter.
next thing you know, i'm big as a house with little earl.
bobby's sweet if he doesn't get bored with you or see something better across the street.
my philosophy is, you got complaints, you go eat somewheres else.
my mama made us clean our plates every night and she couldn't cook worth shit.
that's the one thing bobby gave me that he didn't take back later.
i gotta stay and keep little earl safe from all that mess outside.
government officials attribute the ufo sightings to commercial air traffic and clear atmospheric conditions.
if big earl was still living, he'd straighten that boy out fast.
more power to him if he can do it without us.
the girls and i had our first hit with this one.
every time, she was in danger of being captured and sent back to the people who had owned her.
men and women who had been slaves made their way with harriet's guidance through hostile country.
if you're looking for bobby, i have no idea where he is.
we have reason to believe that this man has been living with you.
listen, i'm gonna sit here for a minute, but don't get any ideas, all right?
the man that owns this club has been on my ass since i opened here and i'm trying to keep him off of it.
i remember when rodney decided to go on the road with me.
as long as he didn't have to carry my bags, he said.
my partner upstairs has been handing me all kind of horror stories.
like how they're gonna cook me and eat me alive up here if i don't look out what i'm doing.
so i say to him, "barry, i wouldn't call what we have a relationship."
he says, "what would you call it?" i said, "we're seeing each other."
he says, "to me, that's a relationship." i said, "call it what you want.
to me, we're just seeing each other." i can't believe this guy.
it solves some cash-flow problems solves some problems on the books.
you tell me who sent you, and i'll cut you in.
next time, a little closer and so on until gravity hook into it, and it come crashing down.
you hear some noise on your roof, and you got a sputnik sizzling in the living room.

to me, we're just seeing each other." i can't believe this guy.
it solves some cash-flow problems solves some problems on the books.
you tell me who sent you, and i'll cut you in.
the first time we missed him, he was leaving with the godiva papers.
and then, last year, when he got by us again, it was with the danzig formula.
look, i have really had it with this whole bulgarian number, okay?
now, the next guy that mentions viktor or what billy said is gonna be wearing this bowl of chili, you got it?
boy, this guy looks like he came in second in a godzilla movie.
yeah, or they had a very poor school lunch program in those days.
hey, you wanna go out with a guy that's got more scalps on his belt than geronimo, be my guest.
if you didn't want me to go, all you had to do was say, "no, don't go."
the thing that is burning you is that now you'll be home growing your roses and reading the news not making the news anymore.
why wouldn't blue leader have you with the contenders for mole?
no, you don't have to answer these questions but these are the questions of the united states government.
if you don't answer them for me you'll just have to answer them for my superior or my superior's superior...
thanks to monica, amanda now knows about the alimony being paid in cash.
i guess she just didn't have the time to lay it out for you.
viktor ignatiev was taken off flight 707 last evening and is comfortably in custody.
nightlight was arraigned early this morning and sends both of you his best.
i'd always kind of hoped my lucky number would be seven.
amanda, it was more than luck when you picked out that coffee can.
but the riebaden gang has drawn up a hit list of prominent americans.
i don't know who's on it, but i know i've been elected to complete the first hit.
if what you're saying is true, amanda, then the clock is really ticking.
not only do we have to get haddy out, now we have an assassination to stop and we don't know who's going to be assassinated.
we'll still get haddy kemp out of this country as planned.
now, i'm arranging for a united states army transport plane to be put on standby alert.
deliver the second message and continue to act like a tourist.
because they would never do anything to hurt a tourist, would they?
all those times i've protested against the army and now they're gonna save my hide.
do you have any further information about the intended assassination victim?
i can't believe i've associated myself up with the likes of you.
if i hadn't suspected your stupidity, i wouldn't have followed you two all day.
you see, i didn't know that i was here on agency business.
if i had known i was here on agency business i probably would have brought a gown, but i....
well, as the song says, it's nice work if you can get it.
but unfortunately, one of the drawbacks is there's so much to do, so little time to do it.
as a matter of fact, i have to prepare a speech for tomorrow night.
if you'll excuse me, i'll say good night to the baron.
did it ever occur to you that we might get some valuable information from them?
i assure you, when the time has come to kill them, you may have the pleasure.
make sure their binds are tight, ortiz, and lock the door from the outside.
they won't be going anywhere in the short time we're gone.
i guess i was just so busy with the house... and getting mindy to ballet and tennis lessons after school- and danny has soccer and his allergist- that i guess that i just didn't pay enough attention to donald.
so he just went out and he found himself somebody who did.
i'm not exactly the size six i was when we got married.
as much as donald says he likes to have something to grab on to, it doesn't mean a thing.
[ chuckles ] actually, a friend of mine got me started.
why don't you take my car, go back to the loft... while i go to the hotel and take a look around?
- now, laura, what you just saw- it is not what you think.
you mean what looks to me like a half-dressed woman on a half-made bed... in the middle of my sister's husband's hotel room is not what i think?
yes, but it seems there's been a terrible fire... and one of donald's patients died- wendell whittaker.
the fire was so bad that the police called donald for the dental records.
i don't see you quitting your job and signing up for carpool.
i don't wanna quit my job... but that doesn't mean i've ruled out a husband and family.
you don't wanna tell her because it's something she wants you to do.
the only thing i know my mother has wanted me to do all my life... was be exactly like you.
i could've used a little relief from being the perfect one.
you don't know what it was like, laura- never doing what i wanted to do... not even knowing what it was i wanted to do.
now, what the hell were you doing running around a hotel... masquerading as a dentist?
it looked as if you were dealing with a case without telling me.
when i arrived at the hotel and observed you and donald in intimate conversation... his hands all over you...
i began to suspect that it was more than a business relationship involved.
you'll be able to roam around, people will pour out their life stories to you... and you get to answer that age-old question-
what's a nice girl like you doing in an outfit like that?
the police called for his dental records... to make a positive identification.
they can't possibly make a positive identification... without the impression of his teeth.
even brought an impression of his teeth to use as sort of a visual aid.
that's all very fascinating, but why would this man kill for those teeth?
the police called me for the dental records to make a positive i.d.
if wendell whittaker is officially declared dead, he becomes a very wealthy ghost.
what better way to formulate a plan to save your life and capture whittaker?
that's the one where doris day sings "que sera, sera. "
you really enjoy seeing me wear these outlandish- not to mention demeaning- costumes, don't you?
laura, you told me yourself the secret of surveillance is to blend in.
something hot, something cold... uh, something sweet- even a loud sound- could, uh... send the mouth into excruciating pain.
supertooth is here with a super brush... for a super people, for a super-dontic tooth.!
for 1 5 years, we have been married... and, for 1 5 years, i have gone to every single one of his conventions-
1 6 if you count the time i was engaged and i didn't tell mother.
so he just went out and he found himself somebody who did.
frances, are you sure you're not jumping the gun on this?
howie, i don't want to get involved in your personal life.
but you don't cheat on your wife, and you think i'm a lowlife because i do.
do you remember when you came up to the office with your tic douloureux?
well, howie and i, tomorrow, are presenting a paper on it.
the only thing i know my mother has wanted me to do all my life... was be exactly like you.
all my life, i've heard, " why can't you be like your sister frances?
the least you could have done was try a little harder.
i could've used a little relief from being the perfect one.
mother came up to me, and she took her engagement ring off.
i remember she was crying at the time... and she said that she would keep it off... until she saw one on my finger.
judging from the shrill tone, i'd say they were husband and wife.
you couldn't take me to the convention because you had a paper to write.
the way you jumped every time i came to the office.
i was afraid that you'd find out about them, then tell myrtle.
frannie, how could you doubt me... when the evidence of my undying faithfulness is everywhere.
could a man who's having an affair dig a new cesspool?
frankly, i was a little embarrassed to bring you in on this one.
when i arrived at the hotel and observed you and donald in intimate conversation... his hands all over you...
the burning question seems to be, why would anyone want to kill a dentist?
whatever the reason, i think the hotel is our only starting point.
frances, you gotta seek help... if not for yourself, for the children.
it is not a pretty sight to find your mother hiding in a garage... stuffing her face with malted milk balls.
we were gonna do a paper on it for the convention.
even brought an impression of his teeth to use as sort of a visual aid.
if control were aware of the morale on this station, the captain wouldn't be in command.
it's been tried before, usually by inexperienced new boys like you.
you'd still be in prison or dead if it weren't for my men.
you speak as though my daleks are no longer capable of war.
i'm hoping that i'll find a little of your mother's dignity and strength.
so far, i'm as frightened as a child who fears the dark.
but we must fight this darkness that is threatening to engulf us.
each of us must be a ray of hope and do our part...
so we just hang in there for a couple more years, right?
but the reality we have to face is that help may never come.
we've monitored all transmissions between the resistance in la... and the wlf in new york.
it's clear they intend to move elizabeth within the next two weeks.
then, in the interest of peace, i suggest you make certain... that he doesn't become a brakal.
i've never heard of a brakal... but i'd bet my bottom dollar you're about to explain it to me.
if you need to enter the room, slip one of these around your neck.
the holographic generator has been programmed... so you appear to be someone he knows.
all i know is what happened when i got to donovan's.
do you have any idea where they could have taken him?
god knows where we'd all be without the red dust keeping them at bay.
i'm just trying to bide a little time till i find a way to win this war.
- the child is a hybrid... the only product of our successful mating with the humans.
her genes contain information that could help us end the war in weeks.
surely you didn't come here to lecture me on aesthetics, diana.
or is there some refinement to your personality... that i'm missing?
it's come to my attention that your son is perhaps aiding the resistance.
i've told you before that i cannot be held responsible for my son's actions.
i've never heard of a brakal... but i'd bet my bottom dollar you're about to explain it to me.
on our planet, mr. bates... a brakal is a creature so mesmerized by fire... that it eventually consumes him.
i'm not so sure sending elizabeth to new york is a very good idea.
with robin missing, we're the only people that she really knows.
you haven't been fighting this war as long as i have.
i want the humans to know who's in charge when they come here.
the drug will prevent him from getting out of bed for at least 24 hours.
by then he will have told us every detail of the star-child's rendezvous.
meanwhile, why not send someone for donovan's appointment calendar... in case he asks for it again.
okay, i've got your fake birth certificate and your driver's license.
how did the liberation front tell you where they'd pick her up... without diana ever finding out?
we decoded a secret message sent by courier and the rest was easy.
we both know there's a free world out there, fighting for its life.
god knows where we'd all be without the red dust keeping them at bay.
i'm just trying to bide a little time till i find a way to win this war.
but i can't do that if the peace is constantly jeopardized... by groups of dissidents, like the resistance.
we've monitored all transmissions between the resistance in la... and the wlf in new york.
it's clear they intend to move elizabeth within the next two weeks.
then, in the interest of peace, i suggest you make certain... that he doesn't become a brakal.

do you have any idea where they could have taken him?

i'm just trying to bide a little time till i find a way to win this war.
well, whoever did it left her lying alone in the street.
i'm gonna make sure i find out who it was... and make sure he gets what he deserves.
it stands for either you walk out of here right now... or i call security and they bounce you out.
take a little picture of this and trace it, will you?
you're ready to be crucified on a billboard on sunset boulevard.
now all confessing is going to do is drastically lower both our lifestyles.
(kitt) you plan to race me against one of those banzai baboons?
what better way to get us in tight with the men who caused stacy's accident?
by the way... anything on the analysis on that paint chip from the accident site?
it's a special high-lead racing paint from a factory in italy.
with his money, anything is possible... although i can't find a registration to prove it.
then maybe we'll just have to find another way to prove it, pal.
how did you know i could find my way around here with my eyes closed?
only two people knew that this was on my rookie beat.
knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
come, voodoo... we must take our newts out of the oven.
if you ask me, michael, she has newts in her belfry.
why don't we just sit down here and have a little talk?
norman... did you go to denise's party in a gorilla suit?
but i didn't kill her... and you can't prove that i did, now get out of here!
you know, some of your illusions are a lot more convincing than you are.
louis xvi was beheaded... for what they said was his tyrannical treatment of his subjects... his insensitivities toward his fellow men... his blind arrogance, his...
and this must be the young man i've heard so much about.
yeah, and a lot more imagination... than to bury the body in the house he owns and then lead us right to it.
give me what you got on grant's personal history, will you?
norman, i'm sure no one would mind... if you took your mask off just to drink your champagne.
it's quite all right, bonnie, i've been practicing for this all year.
hardly the fat of the land, but at least in england it's fair shares for all.

you can have bacon, ham, sausage, pork pies, tripe, pig's feet, liver, kidneys.
you can pig yourself on pork if you want, just ...

- because, clown, the other pigs are all licensed and listed!
i'd like to see you drummed out of whatever miserable association you chiropodists belong to and i'd like to see you hounded out of this town with your tail between your legs.
however ... in westminster abbey, tomorrow morning ... young couple are getting married of a purity and a nobility ...
i gather there's been some silly silly misunderstanding about this ... this animal.
well, we're all civilised people and i'm sure we can talk it over.
i think little veronica is going to startle us one of these days.
i'm going to throw caution to the winds and have a sweet sherry.
emily dumont, with my unlisted phone number... and a description of me and my... specialties.
as a result, every pervert and sex maniac... in the dialing area has given " flaming emily" a jingle.
if some of the people in here can provide what they promise... they won't be lonely for long.
mr. steele, i don't mean to ground your flight of fancy- and i'm sure it's very fancy- but could we take a moment to discuss our m.o. on this case?
therefore, i'm prepared to offer you... a handsome fee for your list of classified advertisers... in your magnificently prurient publication.
a thousand dollars and five percent of the profits on the book.
yes, but you wouldn't do that unless you thought i was in serious trouble, huh?
now that muller's dead, there's nothing more for you two to do.
the fact that muller was blackmailing your wife... gives her a prime motive for killing him.
as of now, the police are saying his death was an accident.
let's go to muller's, find out who his last customer was.
in case you hadn't noticed, laura, we've been relieved of our duties.
apparently, mrs. dumont isn't the only client... where he, as they say, wore two hats.
the young lady that you identify as anne montague- three tune-ups in one month.
if her 450 required half of these repairs... she has the sourest lemon that ever rolled out of stuttgart.
all three of those loving couples are neighbors of the dumonts.
[ whispering ] they wouldn't have to move the body that far.
well, tomorrow prince charming, if you'll excuse my lack of modesty... shall take the glass key and try to find cinderella's ignition.
his appointment book details the dates, the times, and the charges.
i know he tried to blackmail one of you... so i have to assume he may have tried on all of you.
don't tell me one of us knows how to fly this thing.
amazing what you can pick up when your life's at stake.

now i can understand why she used to be silent and sad.
everybody is bad-mouthing her now, and mom is angry as well.
i waited and waited, but there was still no news... even after i gave birth to my child.
i didn't believe meng bin would fool me, but i couldn't see any hope in my future.
i don't know if our child is a boy or a girl, but do kiss him for me.
if your loss can be compensated by money, feel free to tell me what you demand.

there are such caves, where you don't go there in any direction, but into the truth.
that little hole through which god tries to give us a hand.
i don't know which of your mindless bimbi left that in your apartment.
if she paid money for it, she should be seen to and chemically altered.
i'm going to tell you straight and you'd better listen to me.
before you do, could i ask a very special favour of you?
maybe i could send her a relief map of my body.
or you could send her a life-sized portrait of your brain.
but you're not supposed to see the bride before the ceremony.
no, but you're supposed to know whether or not she's in the country.
but i know how to get in touch with her daughter, miss frost bottom.
i'll give her a message to pass on to her mother and she can keep a little of it for herself.
i thought that's what you'd say, but before you hang up on me here, this doesn't have anything to do with you.
it's about your mother and the way she's treated the coach. lt stinks.
i don't know which of your mindless bimbi left that in your apartment.
if she paid money for it, she should be seen to and chemically altered.
no, but you're supposed to know whether or not she's in the country.
sam, will you stop worrying about every little thing, like countries?
diane, you of all people should realise how painful it is to love somebody who doesn't love you back.
yes, your sobbing, your whimpering, your moony-eyed sighs have not gone unnoticed.
i'll give her a message to pass on to her mother and she can keep a little of it for herself.
a message about how a couple of women that don't know the first thing about being decent to folks...
it's about your mother and the way she's treated the coach. lt stinks.
i don't want to say how enraged i am over the phone, so how about dinner tonight?
up until a few moments ago, i, too, was a holdout for a happy ending.
but even this seemingly incontrovertible evidence hasn't shaken your faith a fig.
no, i think it's a tall ex-baseball player who clings for...
how about the three of us go out and get something to eat, like old times?
an arab on a yellow motorbike will at some point show up somewhere, in order to bring him his son.
mr. harvey gave peter pacard a tracking device to take along.
an american spy plane spots the location of father and son.
patrik risks going blind, because he was accidentally struck in the eye by the laser beam when the formula was encoded.
but maybe one day we'll sit together in a jeep... and pass by hundreds of miles of american wheat fields.
or your impoverished farmers will be with us as guest workers in siberia... helping with the harvest.
let's continue to look at it as a friendly match, coach.
yes, but only as long as it takes till they're all back home.
with patrik goes the promise of paradise, and the formula as well.
the misfortune which has struck my people is far greater than yours, mr. dimitri.
he wiped out my mind, but also made me free so that i can think realistically again.
i stayed down there in the fjord for 3 years like an idiot, because of this formula!

at first i couldn't make any sense of your call, then i understood it.
the doctor and the fabulous technology on board make it possible.
now you have the formula in black and white, don't lose it!
exactly what i didn't want, the formula's still under your foot.
he wiped out my mind, but also made me free so that i can think realistically again.
i stayed down there in the fjord for 3 years like an idiot, because of this formula!
as long as i go on improving roquemaure's plays, the rat will be successful...
as long as the columns hold up the building, it won't fall down!
so what about the crime that took place during the feast?
is it true that you have nothing to do with it?
well, i am going whether you are coming with me or not.
so i was in prison for about a year and you are already thinking of having a new husband.
it's just i don't want to have enemy, especially a police officer.
also, i have a duty to attend to and i don't want to go back to prison that i just got out.
i don't have a birth certificate so again i am an illegal person.
i was still very little when my mom dumped me with a grandmother.
and it wasn't your fault that you had been sent to prison?
according to the sentence of the judge, your son has to be in the detention home for five years;
what do this has to do with getting my son out of here?
it is because according to our rules whoever wants to take the child out of the detention home must have a permanent job and a place to stay.
i had been in prison and i know how it was like to live without freedom.
how can i live like a free man when my son does not have that chance.
if the accident happens with someone else, he probably would claim me a lot for the compensation.
also, nobody would tell that he has just got out of the prison.
we will save money together, bring my son to live with us and then find a job in udon.
in udon, we might not have enough food to eat or enough water to drink but there is plenty of love and tendering care.
i was wrong to leave home to find a job in bangkok.
now i know there is no place like home for me, for my son and for you, lamai.
call the police and tell them that my life has been threatened.
what i don't understand is that why mr. poung doesn't tell us who is threatening his life?
it is not important who plans to threaten his life but it is our duty to protect him.
mr. poung is one of the important person in the society.
you can't assume that a person who had been in prison before is always a bad guy.
but i have to think like that because my captain has sent me to protect you as you requested.
if i can take your son of a detention center, will you work for me?
those who are in the outside world don't know how it is like to live without freedom.
just take only the necessary things and then go and wait for me at the north transportation terminal.
i'll meet you there very late in the night when the coach leaves.
i know it from the very beginning that you would do such a thing.
an ex-prisoner like you shouldn't be let out because you a risk to the society.
you have done wrong if you do not conform orders ,you go to jail
all the city in chaos the people want to die ninja
i thought they chased you around your desk, not your stove.
i don't find that very amusing and i don't have to explain my behaviour to a male mary poppins.
from now on, if you feel tempted to butt in, please butt out!
next time i see somebody crawling on you on the floor i'ii know that's how you entertain friends.
you'd never catch me doing something dumb like sleeping with my employer.
aii right, egg fans, iet's show those chickens they have not laid in vain.
hey, jim peterson's up for it too, and i didn't invite him.
well, grant, you know, i think we ought to put the weekend on hold until after the board makes its final decision.
it's kind of funny... how the years can sometimes creep by on you... two or three at a time and nothing much changes.
you're in a routine and all that you really get is a little older... until whammo!
i mean, i had a very tough insurance adjustment claim just the other week and...
i mean, there were three cars and a pineapple truck and...
see, i need someone right now who can keep me in one piece for 10 days.
see, i'm entered in the 1979 north shore surf-out in haleiwa.
a violinist, the first time he steps out on the boards at carnegie hall... and a surgeon the first time he takes out tonsils by himself.
and, of course, i remember... my first gainfui employment as a private investigator.
i thought you would be about seven-feet tall... and come riding up here in a big, white horse.
well, i think maybe i shrunk, but my horse is outside.
who drives all the way to the north shore after work... because my buddy tells me that he needs my help.
when i get here, i find out that all he wants me to do is... is, is... is run down a license plate number!
so, there's no reason you shouldn't want to grow up to be humphrey bogart.
but i think you should know that unless you want the entire city of honolulu... to know your real name, you are going to-
but even though rick almost always came through, i knew i couldn't wait for him.
so i left karen and sandy at chun's reef... where she usually practiced with leah and her friends.
by this time, goldilocks was real hungry, so... she tries the first bowl of porridge and it's too hot.
then she tries the second bowl of porridge and it's too cold.
"someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up."
well, they didn't know what to do, so they decided to go upstairs and catch some z's.
goldilocksandthe three bears wasn't the only story... that was left unfinished in karen's cabin.
and what was nagging about it... was that i hadn't the slightest idea how either of them wrapped up.
because i don't have any evidence that joe soames... is the guy that ran karen off the road.
they're not going to arrest him on a license plate from rick.
then what do you plan on doing to him, if i may ask?
i'm simply going to persuade him... to leave karen alone and let her compete.
so now you feel like you're running out of time... and you can't live with that.
and you decide you want one more moment of glory... and to hell with joe soames... and to hell with the truth.
see, i thought if maybe i could... stack the deck that...
i could have my surfing career and... maybe you'd stick around this time.
i'd organized the competition to boost the unit's morale... bogged down in rabat for six months as we were.
at any rate, i was unable to win the trophy... finishing sixth, i believe, behind corky bostwick, binky farnbush-
at any rate, even though i was unable to win anything...
i think that competition was possibly one of the most memorable moments of my life.
i was able to tempt death... without actually killing in the process.
just the feeling of being inside such power and strength... and controlling it was indescribable.
i believe that just the opportunity to test the fates in such a manner... gives one the ability to put one's whole life into perspective.
for the better one feels about one's self... the better the rest of the world looks, indeed.
(magnum) it's kind of funny... how the years can sometimes creep by on you... two or three at a time and nothing much changes.
you're in a routine and all that you really get is a little older... until whammo!
i mean, i had a very tough insurance adjustment claim just the other week and....
l mean, there were three cars and a pineapple truck and....
see, i need someone right now who can keep me in one piece for 10 days.
see, i'm entered in the 1979 north shore surf-out in haleiwa.
a violinist, the first time he steps out on the boards at carnegie hall... and a surgeon the first time he takes out tonsils by himself.
and, of course, i remember... my first gainful employment as a private investigator.
i'm sorry, but from what karen had said... i thought you would be about seven-feet tall... and come riding up here in a big, white horse.
well, i think maybe i shrunk, but my horse is outside.
you see, i'm just a joe who manages a gin joint.
who drives all the way to the north shore after work... because my buddy tells me that he needs my help.
when i get here, i find out that all he wants me to do is... is, is... is run down a license plate number!
thomas, what do you think i am, the dmv or something?
how am i supposed to know which one's the right one?
well, you know, rick, how you're always saying you know people.
i mean, i grew up wanting to hit like hank greenberg.
so, there's no reason you shouldn't want to grow up to be humphrey bogart.
meanwhile, i thought i'd cruise the north shore for the guys in that dune buggy.
but then i was suddenly reminded... there was more to that buggy than just a license plate.
(magnum) by this time, goidiiocks was real hungry, so... she tries the first bowl of porridge and it's too hot.
then she tries the second bowl of porridge and it's too cold.
"someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up."
well, they didn't know what to do, so they decided to go upstairs and catch some z's.
(magnum) goldilocks and the three bears wasn't the only story... that was left unfinished in karen's cabin.
and what was nagging about it... was that i hadn't the slightest idea how either of them wrapped up.
thomas, maybe the reason i'm being so negative is... i don't own this chopper that you're asking me to fly into god-knows-what.
well, we'll be back in an hour, t.c. i mean... they'll never miss it.
they're not going to arrest him on a license plate from rick.
then what do you plan on doing to him, if i may ask?
karen, you know, all through this case... i've had a pretty good run of beginner's luck.
but i just feel like some kind of fairy tale hero and now--
he left me with sandy and a former career as a world surfing champ.
so between the baby and waitressing at the curl... i was effectively through.
so now you feel like you're running out of time... and you can't live with that.
and you decide you want one more moment of glory... and to hell with joe soames... and to hell with the truth.
of course, there was a war on... and we didn't actually have surfboards as you know them.
more like the wing assemblies of a couple of messerschmidts... our lads had managed to shoot down.
just the feeling of being inside such power and strength... and controlling it was indescribable.
i believe that just the opportunity to test the fates in such a manner... gives one the ability to put one's whole life into perspective.
and, i you know, he can't help it he's got a bad heart.
nobody with a bad heart looks at my ellie the way
well, let's just take it easy and play a game or two.
the way you are playing with my heart, i could fall for you.
but if you laugh and run away, i'll come a running too.
the way you're playing with my heart, i could fall for you.
maybe we're just playing games, but i could fall for you.
maybe we're just playing games, and i could fall for you.
is that why you're showing off with your gun to impress me?
if i want to impress you, i got a bigger gun than this.
if loving you ain't nothing but a pain in my past.
why can't i find my freedom from the bottom of this glass?
'the mild light from the sun, in a tranquil sunset, like a blaze that calls you, songs that summon you, a proposal of love.

translation and subtitles by jorge casas lópez and stuart lindsay, september 2011.
like a blaze that calls you, songs that summon you, a proposal of love.
the fisherman sails in his boat, bow towards the red light.
island of alcohol and fire, strong pleasure and fear, and that sad, soft voice.
times that lie in the past, the light from the lantern has faded,
i come to the pier, as though i am curious about the world around me, but to be honest, there is nothing.
i have no expectations, as the boats sail past, not even they mean anything to me,
i look through this window to the sunset, and reflect on my life.
the wooden boards of the pier creak underneath my footsteps, like the bones inside my body.
the light from the torch has been dying for a long time.
the torch no longer attracts the sailors, or the fisherman, who used to come to my place to drink, when they had finished their work.
when a pathologist makes an autopsy, he reads the body like a book, but you didn't know that did you?
of course i didn't know that, i'm very ignorant, but thank god i've got you here, to tell me and shed some light on the situation.
that race is degenerating, how can a respectable lady's grandson be associating with this riff-raff?
then again if your grandmother was here herself, she would doubtless be enchanted by this island.
she would feel the call of these mysterious islands surrounding us.
these islands are doomed, they have this strange and frightening allure, especially the island of deer.
the oldest legends say of this area, say of the island of deer,
that it seems uninhabited, but strange women appear at night, coming out from the bottom of a crater, they attracted fishermen with a strange light, and with their magical songs.
these women would seduce any men stupid enough to approach, then kill them.
you can laugh you fools, but that is how pocho martin died.
no, no, she's fine, but she was caught red-handed in a police raid in our brothel.
she was actually only being looked after by me, but the police thought she was one of the prostitutes.
i tried to explain this to them, she had nothing to do with the business.
she was just a kid, but the police didn't listen, they took no notice of me!
and casts spells on them until she gets fed up with them, then kills them.
the only one who's cast a spell on me is you.
don't worry too much about what she says, do what i have always done.
if a woman rejects me, just find another, who will help forget.
like a blaze that calls you, songs that summon you, a proposal of love.
the fisherman sails in his boat, bow towards the red light.
island of alcohol and fire, strong pleasure and fear, and that sad, soft voice.
times that lie in the past, the light from the lantern has faded,
i will lock myself in my room, as i do every day.
i wait for the day that destiny has chosen to be my last.
the fisherman sails in his boat, bow towards the red light.
island of alcohol and fire, strong pleasure and fear, and that sad, soft voice.
times that lie in the past, the light from the lantern has faded,

i have no expectations, as the boats sail past, not even they mean anything to me,
i look through this window to the sunset, and reflect on my life.
the wooden boards of the pier creak underneath my footsteps, like the bones inside my body.
the light from the torch has been dying for a long time.
you do so much for your children, and they treat you like this!
you'd better get used to it father, because i'm not just seeing him as a friend, we are going to get married.
don't be silly, all fathers are like this, didn't you know?
not really, my father died when i was just a child.
then again if your grandmother was here herself, she would doubtless be enchanted by this island.
she would feel the call of these mysterious islands surrounding us.
these islands are doomed, they have this strange and frightening allure, especially the island of deer.

ramiro, the doctor from madero, he's going to rip apart pocho's body.
pocho is dead and that's it, he drowned the other day.
there he is, trying to put on a good impression, but i know better.
i told him to wait outside in case he takes one of my bottles.
you do so much for your children, and they treat you like this!
you'd better get used to it father, because i'm not just seeing him as a friend, we are going to get married.
don't be silly, all fathers are like this, didn't you know?
not really, my father died when i was just a child.
of course i didn't know that, i'm very ignorant, but thank god i've got you here, to tell me and shed some light on the situation.
i know you are not taking me seriously, but i can tell you a lot of things about this crime.

if you knock on one door looking for pleasure, and you are not welcomed, try another.
having a man makes us feel, as women, stable, and secure.
when you have a man at home, it doesn't matter if he's rude or smart, or scruffy like you.
do you know that you are getting more beautiful every day?
i think that living in the wild is good for you, it's your thing.
i'm sacrificing the good years ahead of me, to look after this invalid.

but i'm not laughing, ray bob, so you know it's no fucking joke.
well, don't you think it's a little odd, them leaving town when his circumstances are so precarious?
if you're trying to get any information from me, mother, forget it.
or some other such misguided phrase designed to placate those who are not rich.
steven, there is nothing in my life more important than my children.
but i do value money, because money can help protect the people that i love.
i value it just as much as i resent this trial that's coming up.
if you're so certain that that man at the hostel was lying to you about fallon, why didn't you offer him some money to get him to talk?
because if the prospect of a $200,000 reward couldn't get him to talk, how much would?
i've got a feeling, a positive one, that our friend waite is going to say yes to our loan before the end of the week.
i wanna keep talking to him and talking to him about that loan, every chance i get.
even drunk, you're too smart to jeopardise your standing with a man like ballard.
your eyes are too focused on your brilliant future for you to risk it.
other stories, all of which can be counterpointed by mother's involvement in different charities.
ever since blake carrington banished me from denver and from my children, my main charity, unfortunately, has been alexis carrington colby.
i've been spending as much time as i can with little blake.
i've also noticed that this house is in a very shabby condition these days, definitely run-down, in case no one's had the nerve to tell you.
okay, next time i'll have the doorman let you know i'm on my way up.
you show up here after disappearing for weeks at a time, you don't phone me, you don't even bother to return my phone calls and then you just appear.
well, sam dexter may have had a stroke, but that doesn't make him any less stubborn than he always has been.
it wasn't easy trying to convince him not to buy a string of refineries at this particular time in oil history.
if trying to save dexter lnternational from ruin is boring you, it was even more so for my sister, marin.
in fact, she decided to liven things by smashing up another car,
in other words, my trying to keep busy, my trying to act cheerful, my trying to maintain some sanity in the midst of this emotional upheaval, that's not caring in your book.
well, damn it, i can accuse you of the same thing, you know.
no, i mean his financial plight is so abysmal right now that it's seriously affecting him and not only him, but our children too.
now, as a good mother, i can't just sit back and watch them all being ruined, can l?
and then maybe after lunch, a siesta in one of the cool recesses of my hot hacienda, as you used to call it.
oh, billy, we tried that once and it wasn't such a good idea then.
hey, come on, i was in court on a case, a heavy one.
and besides, what's a few days after what my people have dug up, huh?
upon your arrival in miami, you will be met by federal officials and taken to the county jail.
then you will be served with extradition papers from the state of colorado and taken to denver in custody.
senora, we will ride to the airport in mr. waite's car.
i believe it will be more comfortable for the two of us.
young man, what i have to say to you now is very painful indeed.
if you want corroboration, you may talk to the police, but...
the construction of the temple of the sagrada familia was started by a man named bocabella, a bookseller.
he was very religious and wanted more than anything to build a church.
i believe one reason for this was that gaudí wanted to cleanse himself of the frivolous behavior of his youth.
when he was young, he enjoyed a luxurious lifestyle of fine dining and stylish clothing.
after gaudí passed away and the spanish civil war broke out, the model he'd made was destroyed.
so we spent time and effort restoring his model as if piecing together a jigsaw puzzle.
we did research for a long time to figure out the best way to continue construction.
in its growth, a tree branches out in the form of a spiral.
i can 't think of a time when i didn 't know his name.
i was playing games when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
as i wandered through the salon i played a little game with myself.
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 his first symphony at 7, a full-scale opera at 12!
my dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
there on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold raised from the dead!
through my influence, i saw to it don giovanni was played only five times in vienna.
but, in secret, i went to every one of those five.
i can 't think of a time when i didn 't know his name.
i was playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
as i wandered through the salon i played a little game with myself.
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 his first symphony at 7 a full-scale opera at 12!
my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts.
he had simply written down music already finished in his head.
page after page of it as if he were just taking dictation.
i want you to come back to salzburg with me, my son.
you can only give a penalty that can be performed in the room!
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
they'll be paid for by a great admirer of yours who wishes to remain anonymous.
in that case, gentlemen, i think we should help him all we can.
and do our best to protect him against the emperor's anger.
i don't need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor.
i went to the theatre to tell mozart something, anything when suddenly in the middle of the third act to my astonishment, the emperor who never attended rehearsals suddenly appeared.
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre conferring on all who sat there perfect absolution.
god was singing through this little man to all the world.
there, on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
and i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold raised from the dead!
through my influence, i saw to it don giovanni was played only five times in vienna.
but, in secret, i went to every one of those five.
i admit, i was jealous, when i heard the tales they told about him.
none of the brilliant little prodigy, but of his father, who had taught him everything.
one minute i was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town.
the next i was here... in vienna, city of musicians... and emperor joseph, the musical king.
no, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
do you really think that subject is quite appropriate for a national theater?
and i swear to you, i never laid a finger on her.
all the same, i couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.
there are just as many notes, majesty, as i required, neither more nor less.
my dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in a course of an evening.
my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
for the first time in my life, i began to know really... violent thoughts.
one piece with your breath in it, so i know that you love me.
show me one sign of your favor, and i will show mine to mozart.
but you are going to be so proud of me, papa.
it`s going to be the best thing that i've ever done.
my own dear sister, antoinette, writes me that she is beginning to be frightened of her own people.
sire, i swear to your majesty, there's nothing like that in the piece.
in a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time it´s... just noise, no one can`t understand a word.
but with opera, with music... with music, you can have 20 individuals, all talking at the same time.
i went to the theater ready to tell mozart something, anything.
when suddenly, in the middle of the third act to my astonishment, the emperor, who never attended rehearsals, suddenly appeared.
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theater, conferring on all who sat there, perfect absolution.
god was singing through this little man, to all the world.
so rose the dreadful ghost, from his next and blackest opera.
there on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
i admit, i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him.
not of the brilliant little prodigy but of his father, who had taught him everything.
i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna.
it should infuriate the archbishop if that is your majesty's intention.
no, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.

through my influence, i saw to it "don giovanni" was played only five times in vienna.
but, in secret, i went to every one of those five.
and out of the flies came this huge american flag that unrolled on the stage.
and 600 czechs stood up and sang the u.s. national anthem and knew the words.
"if the second act is as good as the first, i will make a movie of it."
i called mr. zaentz only to find out he already had the play on his list of what to see.
monday to friday we were locked into what we came to regard as our prison.
and then we would go back to new york on the friday and instantly separate.
and not exchange a word for a blissful saturday and sunday till he would come to my flat to collect me and drive me back to prison for the next almost unendurable five days when we slowly hammered out the whole script, moment by moment.
they had some bumpy bumps in the road along the way.
i spoke to both of them at different times, and both used terms you don't use in mixed company about each other.
well, no, we had a big conflict, you know, big conflict.
on the other hand, we had an enormous advantage to have the music before.
for example, every day, we spent a couple of hours just listening to the music, to mozart's music.
i think possibly the first film that has music as its leading character.
we met in the airport in new york to discuss it:
i had an hour to think about it because i was moving on to catch another plane.
immediately, apart from being slightly flattered they thought of me i thought of it as a project which, so long as it didn't develop into a hollywood scenario, i would be very interested in.
my ideas mean nothing if what i see on the screen, i don't believe.
it was an interesting situation because a lot of big names wanted to play especially salieri and mozart, right?
so he couldn't be a leading-man type, you know, a leading-hero type.
but he has to be a wonderful actor, and he has to master the music.
on one day i spent maybe six to eight hours in a screen test.
other actors came in, and i played opposite them all day.
and then i began to understand that the people who i was assuming he was most interested in because it was clear from their work he was treating the same as me.
and the people you felt weren't gonna be the right combination...
i think the small parts are as important as the main characters.
in a certain way, i pay more attention to casting the small, bit part because once you see them, you will never forget them.
nothing drives me more crazy when i am watching a film and somebody appears, then disappears and then reappears.
and he looks like the guy who was just there, and i'm mixing...
milos called me and said, "vinnie, i would like you to be in 'amadeus'.
it is not a big part, but i would love you to be in it."
and then i had a young actor come in reading for mozart and i asked f. murray, "listen, would you just help me here."
"this is just to help, read salieri for this young man."
he read so beautifully that it started to bug me, you know?
he called and said, "i want you to know you're my first choice".
while on the set of "scarface", i got the word that i was gonna do "amadeus".
and everyone's attitude, the stars on the show, changed toward me.
i was no longer this hardworking actor f. murray abraham like so many other hardworking actors.
i was the man who got the part that every actor in the english language was trying to get.
when i went the first time, which was, more or less, to negotiate the making of the movie, that was very emotional for me.
because before, i didn't hope that i would ever see my native country and places where i kissed my first girlfriend ever again in my life.
when i got to prague in the beginning of "amadeus" there's the scene where his assistant comes with the muffins in the snow.
and so i had written a 13-page snow alert in english and in czech.
i had the lemons and oranges or the oranges, the pineapples and the lemons.
and i gave her the stuff and half the crew was secret police, and everybody knew it.
afterwards, i don't remember his name but he was sort of a smarmy cop, and obviously cop.
he said, "so tell me, so, what is this woman you meet?
and i played, like, idiot and i said, "she's the daughter of a roommate of a friend who's from here, used to make movies here."
"he asked if i would bring his daughter some pineapples and lemons."
i think they were the only two pineapples in prague that january.
when they go down the corridor of the insane asylum, that was a war museum.
there was a panic when they learned that they showed us the ground-floor corridors.
we were questioned very closely as to what our connections were.
the first three weeks of shooting was salieri in the hospital room.
i was the guy that went out with him in the morning and dick smith, our makeup artist, at 4:00 every morning for hours of makeup before the crew came.
and when we would start working in the morning, it was 4:00.
i would get up, i'd get to the studio by 4:30.
we'd work on the makeup for four and a half hours.
as much preparation as i had made for the old man, gestures and so on the fact is after sitting for hours, at that hour in the morning you are kind of tired and slow.
i also had lenses in my eyes which had to be removed, and my eyes had to be sprayed.
so that the pain, which was always there, would not be too much.
once i looked into a mirror at my face i felt like it was completely convincing.
all i had to do was believe this guy, and it was not hard.
i'm not denigrating my work, i'm a very proud actor but with dick smith there, and the words of peter shaffer...
they've got be the most beautiful descriptions in music ever written whether on film or in literature.
because of the schedule, the first thing that was filmed in the shooting schedule was all of salieri, old.
that breathtaking section of murray's performance most breathtaking was done in the first weeks.
basically, at one point, milos had said he felt like we'd done it, because the work was going so well up to that point.
and the day before meg was to appear on camera for the first time, she got hurt in a soccer game.
she's playing soccer with some kids in the street and she tore the ligament in her leg so badly that the doctor told us we would have to wait five weeks before she could start.
and we couldn't because saul put together all independent money and we just couldn't afford it.
so in a very short amount of time, they had to find an actress to take over the part.
the casting director who was brought on to hire the new constanze...
and i went over there on monday, went back with the two girls monday.
and that was some ushering job, being with two girls up for the same part.
"thank you so much, and bye, and good luck with your movie."
and milos said, "essentially, you both have the part, you know it's impossible to decide between you and one of you is simply too pretty to play constanze."
so i got to stay and had packed clothes probably for three days.
i was there for six months and started work the next day.
tom had a piano in his room and he worked on it all the time.
the keyboards that i played on in front of the camera were all silent.
i began, as the months went on, to believe the illusion a bit.
it was always distressing to hear what i really sounded like on a sounded keyboard.
it's one thing to play to a playback it's entirely different to do it upside down behind your back.
in the way of stunt work, you learn what the assignment is and some chemical gets released, and you actually can do it.
it was a big thrill for everybody that we were going to film in practically the only wooden opera house left in central europe and also the most perfectly preserved.
it had undergone many alterations, but they were minor and architecturally, the place was intact.
we found him in the corridor, hidden, crying because there he learned that he is standing exactly at the place where mozart himself in person, conducted the world premiere of "don giovanni".
i tell you, we felt awed the first time we stepped on that stage and realized that our hero had been in that very spot.
i think this fact gave a lot of humility and respect for the place to every actor, dancer and everybody there.
there's something that happens when you do it in the place, the atmosphere.
when the chandeliers were lit, i held my breath for what seemed like days.
and there we were, all these extras, all these wigs and all this flammable stuff in this tinderbox-dry theater where "don giovanni" had had its premiere.
imagine the trust of the opera house, allowing us to be there.
we had every day like 30 or 40 firemen everywhere, standing there.
at a certain moment, don giovanni moves to the table, does this:
and he has a hat with huge plumage, you know, a feather like a peacock feather, right?
on "amadeus", after this incredible journey to get to prague through the night and all of this remarkable stuff i'm suddenly standing in 18th-century costume, in the snow in prague, in the middle of the night.
then i have to walk down the street and he says to me, "vinnie, television is ruining you!"
if you cast wrong then you have to work and usually, you're in trouble anyway.
a director is little bit of everything, but a good director always for every part of his work, must choose people who are better than him.
but they had an ingenuity, a humor, and a force to their imagination that more than repaid the lack of materials.
i really enjoyed and had great fun shooting the parody in the theater the parody of mozart's operas.
the guy who is in the back of the horse, right?
because he has to reach out and give out a dove.
they lived in these clothes for as long as it took to complete this scene, just as they did in the 18th century.
and i think there is a great deal of authentic life in them and in the clothes.
what surprised me was that because my hair had gotten dyed a kind of gold color i'd get up and that image was so different to me that it actually triggered the part of me that was more extraverted.
as people would show up for their sequences in the film i found that i had an urge to take them out and to be the kind of social director in a way that isn't my natural inclination.
what i didn't realize was that this was infecting how others felt about me.
whenever there were parties i wasn't invited because i wasn't there.
but during the film, we were living a little bit like those two characters.
there was always that element where we never knew each other so well that we could tell exactly when the other one was telling the truth or not.
it's daring to have a whole sequence of composers dictating music to each other.
and they had set us up, before we started filming with neville marriner and his assistant.
in reality, what happened on that day is there's a little...
john strauss is in the corner pressing the buttons on a cassette player.
we have little hearing aids in our ears which are playing like an am radio the musical phrase, so that we can be on tempo and pitch for when all the music gets laid in afterwards.
and there was some mishap, so there's a moment where i'm...
consequently, he began to lose certain things and i would guide him.
it was a real symphony between the two of us, a duet.
you can do that because there were cameras on both of us and also because of a superb partnership between two players.
the thing that most amazed me was the artistry of every person in every job that worked on this film and the extraordinary storytelling that happened from every point of view.
i have the deepest gratitude to that crew because they gave everything, everything they had.
in most cases, the film would be a biography of mozart and it would be what happened and what happened.
to take the circumstances of that incredible life and put it in the context of this other man and his argument with his god, is genius, i think.
i don't really care what it is about because it moves me and makes me think.
it's a timeless story, and it's beautifully told and beautifully shot.
i'm sure you'll hear this again and again but we were part and parcel of something that was greater than we were.
then the applause at the end as if they'd been to a concert.
and then you got the first sense that perhaps this was going to be an unusual movie and that perhaps the music had won.
the thing that pleases me almost more than anything else about the whole enterprise is the number of people, young people who discover the man i think is the greatest composer in the world.
so many people were introduced to mozart as a composer, compared with just doing it in concert halls.
i adm¡t, i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about h¡m.
not of the br¡ll¡ant l¡ttle prod¡gy but of h¡s father, who had taught h¡m everyth¡ng.
after i d¡e let people speak my name w¡th a love for what i wrote.
in return i w¡ll g¡ve you my chast¡ty my ¡ndustry my deepest hum¡l¡ty every hour of my i¡fe.
one m¡nute i was a frustrated boy ¡n an obscure i¡ttle town the next i was here ¡n v¡enna, c¡ty of mus¡c¡ans and emperor joseph, the mus¡cal k¡ng.
in a few years, i was h¡s court composer. lsn't that ¡ncred¡ble?
as i wandered through the salon i played a l¡ttle game w¡th myself.
th¡s man had wr¡tten h¡s f¡rst concerto at the age of 4 h¡s f¡rst symphony at 7 a full-scale opera at 12!
i th¡nk ¡t's an ¡nterest¡ng not¡on to keep mozart ¡n v¡enna.
it should ¡nfur¡ate the archb¡shop beyond measure ¡f that ¡s your majesty's ¡ntent¡on.
there are just as many notes as are requ¡red, ne¡ther more nor less.
my dear fellow, there are ¡n fact only so many notes one can hear ¡n an even¡ng.
he had s¡mply wr¡tten down mus¡c already f¡n¡shed ¡n h¡s head.
page after page of ¡t as ¡f he were just tak¡ng d¡ctat¡on.
i want you to come back to salzburg w¡th me, my son.
you can only g¡ve a penalty that can be performed ¡n the room!
i was asked to come here and offer my serv¡ces to you.
they'll be pa¡d for by a great adm¡rer of yours who w¡shes to rema¡n anonymous.
the end of the second act, for example.... lt's a s¡mple duet just a husband and a w¡fe quarrel¡ng.
suddenly the w¡fe's schem¡ng l¡ttle ma¡d comes ¡n. lt's a very funny s¡tuat¡on.
no one doubts your talent. lt's your l¡terary judgment that's ¡n quest¡on.
even w¡th the pol¡t¡cs taken out of ¡t, ¡t would st¡ll rema¡n a vulgar farce.
in that case, gentlemen, i th¡nk we should help h¡m all we can.
and do our best to protect h¡m aga¡nst the emperor's anger.
i don't need to tell you i sa¡d noth¡ng whatever to the emperor.
i went to the theatre to tell mozart someth¡ng, anyth¡ng when suddenly ¡n the m¡ddle of the th¡rd act to my aston¡shment, the emperor who never attended rehearsals suddenly appeared.
i heard the mus¡c of true forg¡veness f¡ll¡ng the theatre conferr¡ng on all who sat there perfect absolut¡on.
god was s¡ng¡ng through th¡s i¡ttle man to all the world.
so rose the dreadful ghost, from h¡s next and blackest opera.
there, on the stage, stood the f¡gure of a dead commander.
and i knew only i understood that the horr¡fy¡ng appar¡t¡on was leopold ra¡sed from the dead!
wolfgang had summoned up h¡s own father to accuse h¡s son before all the world!
i admit,i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him.
not of the brilliant little prodigy but of his father, who had taught him everything.
"after i die let people speak my name with love for what i wrote."
"in return i will give you my chastity my industry my deepest humility, every hour of my life."
one minute i was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town.
the next i was here in vienna,city of musicians and emperor joseph, the musical king.
i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna.
it should infuriate the archbishop if that is your majesty's intention.
and i swear to you, i never laid a finger on her.
all the same,i couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.
there are just as many notes as i required,neither more nor less.
my dear fellow,there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
for the first time in my life, i began to know really violent thoughts.
one piece with your breath in it,so i know that you love me.
show me one sign of your favor,and i will show mine to mozart.
i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor,mozart.
however i know a distinguished gentleman i can recommend,and he has a daughter.
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
they'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain anonymous.
i can't think of a time when i didn't know his name.
i was playing childish games when he was playing music for kings and emperors.
as i wandered through the salon i played a little game with myself.
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 his first symphony at 7 a full-scale opera at 12!
my heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.
for the first time in my life i began to know really violent thoughts.
he had simply written down music already finished in his head.
page after page of it as if he were just taking dictation.
i want you to come back to salzburg with me, my son.
you can only give a penalty that can be performed in the room!
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
they'll be paid for by a great admirer of yours who wishes to remain anonymous.
in that case, gentlemen, i think we should help him all we can.
and do our best to protect him against the emperor's anger.
i don't need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor.
i went to the theatre to tell mozart something, anything when suddenly in the middle of the third act to my astonishment, the emperor who never attended rehearsals suddenly appeared.
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre conferring on all who sat there perfect absolution.
god was singing through this little man to all the world.
there, on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
and i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold raised from the dead!
through my influence, i saw to it don giovanni was played only five times in vienna.
but, in secret, i went to every one of those five.
i admit, i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him.
not of the brilliant little prodigy but of his father, who had taught him everything.
after i die let people speak my name with love for what i wrote.
in return i will give you my chastity my industry my deepest humility, every hour of my life.
one minute i was a frustrated boy in an obscure little town.
the next i was here in vienna, city of musicians and emperor joseph, the musical king.
i think it's an interesting notion to keep mozart in vienna.
it should infuriate the archbishop if that is your majesty's intention.
no, my dear fellow, the language is not finally the point.
do you really think that subject is appropriate for a national theater?
and i swear to you, i never laid a finger on her.
all the same, i couldn't bear to think of anyone else touching her.
my dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in an evening.
i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?
i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor, mozart.
however i know a distinguished gentleman i can recommend, and he has a daughter.
i was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
they'll be paid for by an admirer of yours who wishes to remain anonymous.
in a play, if more than one person speaks at once it's just noise.
but with opera, with music you can have 20 individuals all talking at the same time.
i don't need to tell you i said nothing, whatever, to the emperor.
i went to the theater to tell mozart something, anything when suddenly, in the middle of the third act to my astonishment, the emperor who never attended rehearsals, suddenly appeared.
there on the stage, stood the figure of a dead commander.
i knew only i understood that the horrifying apparition was leopold raised from the dead!
through my influence, i saw to it don giovanni was played only five times in vienna.
but, in secret, i went to every one of those five.
i admit, i was jealous when i heard the tales they told about him.
not of the brilliant little prodigy but of his father, who had taught him everything.
as i wandered through the salob i played a little game with myself.
this man had written his first concerto at the age of 4 his first symphony at 7 a full-scale opera at 12!
i heard the music of true forgiveness filling the theatre conferring ob all who sat there perfect absolution.
god was singing through this little man to all the world.
and suddenly, instead of mozart's music the american national anthem starts to play.
and out of the flies came this huge american flag that unrolled on the stage.
milos said to me, "you' re now in czechoslovakia, forget logic."
only in a taxi did i learn we were going to a play about a composer.
and he said to me, with the marvellous directness that characterizes him:
"if the second act is as good as the first, i will make a movie of it."
what we ended up doing was spending four months together in his house in connecticut.
monday to friday we were locked into what we came to regard as our prison.
and then we would go back to new york on the friday and instantly separate.
and not exchange a word for a blissful saturday and sunday till he would come to my flat to collect me and drive me back to prison for the next almost unendurable five days when we slowly hammered out the whole script, moment by moment.
they had some bumpy bumps in the road along the way.
i spoke to both of them at different times, and both used terms you don't use in mixed company about each other.
for example, every day, we spent a couple of hours just listening to the music, to mozart's music.
and then picking pieces which would fit here or would fit there.
"listen, the music is becoming the third character of this film."
i think possibly the first film that has music as its leading character.
we had no idea what the film was going to look like.
although i knew the play, i'd seen the play i knew that once milos got his hands on it it would be a completely different animal.
casting is enormously important because that's finally whom the audience sees.
my ideas mean nothing if what i see on the screen, i don't believe.
it was an interesting situation because a lot of big names wanted to play especially salieri and mozart, right?
and i somehow felt, "i don't want to see known faces.
he must have had a very nondescript face that you wouldn't notice him in the crowd at all.
so he couldn't be a leading-man type, you know, a leading-hero type.
but he has to be a wonderful actor, and he has to master the music.
he was very hard on me, and he was quite gentle with the others.
other actors came in, and i played opposite them all day.
and so i got to watch milos working with a different set of actors.
i think the number we had at one time was 1263, and we weren't finished.
i know someone ran a tally, but we were not finished.
but in that time i thought, "this is a wonderful project and he's a great director, and i'm lucky to be still here."
of course you start with the main characters and then you go down.
in a certain way, i pay more attention to casting the small, bit part because once you see them, you will never forget them.
nothing drives me more crazy when i am watching a film and somebody appears, then disappears and then reappears.
it is not a big part, but i would love you to be in it."
one day, i was reading f. murray abraham for a small part in the movie.
this is just to help, read salieri for this young man."
and f. murray probably because, you know, now it doesn't matter gave a wonderful performance.
he called and said," i want you to know you' re my first choice."
and i had been around for a while, and i said:
tell me what i have to do next because i'm busy painting my kitchen."
some time went by and they said, "we want to see you for this improv group."
while on the set of scarface, i got the word that i was gonna do amadeus.
and everyone's attitude, the stars on the show, changed toward me.
i was no longer this hardworking actor f. murray abraham like so many other hardworking actors.
i was the man who got the part that every actor in the english language was trying to get.
when i went the first time, which was, more or less, to negotiate the making of the movie, that was very emotional for me.
because before, i didn't hope that i would ever see my native country and places where i kissed my first girlfriend ever again in my life.
when i got to prague in the beginning of amadeus there's the scene where his assistant comes with the muffins in the snow.
and so i had written a 13-page snow alert in english and in czech.
i had the lemons and oranges or the oranges, the pineapples and the lemons.
and i gave her the stuff and half the crew was secret police, and everybody knew it.
afterwards, i don't remember his name but he was sort of a smarmy cop, and obviously cop.
he said, "so tell me, so, what is this woman you meet?
and i played, like, idiot and i said, "she's the daughter of a roommate of a friend who's from here, used to make movies here.
he asked if i would bring his daughter some pineapples and lemons."
when they go down the corridor of the insane asylum, that was a war museum.
the central hall where all the mad people were kept was part of a military hospital for the wounded from the 30 years' war.
up in the second and third floor were secret archives of the secret police.
there was a panic when they learned that they showed us the ground-floor corridors.
when we went there the first time, that corridor had 75 two-ton cannons all looking at each other.
and milos says, "i love it." i say, "yeah, i love it too.
the first three weeks of shooting was salieri in the hospital room.
i was the guy that went out with him in the morning and dick smith, our makeup artist, at 4:00 every morning for hours of makeup before the crew came.
and when we would start working in the morning, it was 4:00.
i would get up, i'd get to the studio by 4:30.
we'd work on the makeup for four and a half hours.
as much preparation as i had made for the old man, gestures and so on the fact is after sitting for hours, at that hour in the morning you are kind of tired and slow.
i also had lenses in my eyes which had to be removed, and my eyes had to be sprayed.
so that the pain, which was always there, would not be too much.
once i looked into a mirror at my face i felt like it was completely convincing.
all i had to do was believe this guy, and it was not hard.
i'm not denigrating my work, i'm a very proud actor but with dick smith there, and the words of peter shaffer...
they've got be the most beautiful descriptions in music ever written whether on film or in literature.
because of the schedule, the first thing that was filmed in the shooting schedule was all of salieri, old.
that breathtaking section of murray's performance most breathtaking was done in the first weeks.
basically, at one point, milos had said he felt like we'd done it, because the work was going so well up to that point.
and the day before meg was to appear on camera for the first time, she got hurt in a soccer game.
she's playing soccer with some kids in the street and she tore the ligament in her leg so badly that the doctor told us we would have to wait five weeks before she could start.
and we couldn't because saul put together all independent money and we just couldn't afford it.
so in a very short amount of time, they had to find an actress to take over the part.
the casting director who was brought on to hire the new constanze...
milos went back to prague sunday so he could shoot on monday.
and i went over there on monday, went back with the two girls monday.
and i was preparing to, "okay, how do i say thank you for having me and for considering me and for this first-class ticket to prague.
thank you so much, and bye, and good luck with your movie."
i had to learn to play the piano accurately, and badly.
even though the harpsichord- the piano was unhooked the hands had to be in the right place.
tom had a piano in his room and he worked on it all the time.
the keyboards that i played on in front of the camera were all silent.
i began, as the months went on, to believe the illusion a bit.
it was always distressing to hear what i really sounded like on a sounded keyboard.
it's one thing to play to a playback it's entirely different to do it upside down behind your back.
in the way of stunt work, you learn what the assignment is and some chemical gets released, and you actually can do it.
it was a big thrill for everybody that we were going to film in practically the only wooden opera house left in central europe and also the most perfectly preserved.

when the chandeliers were lit, i held my breath for what seemed like days.
and there we were, all these extras, all these wigs and all this flammable stuff in this tinderbox-dry theatre where don giovanni had had its premiere.
imagine the trust of the opera house, allowing us to be there.
we had every day like 30 or 40 firemen everywhere, standing there.
he leans and suddenly we see that this feather caught fire.
the fire is going up and up and up, but he's in the ecstasy of performing.
on amadeus, after this incredible journey to get to prague through the night and all of this remarkable stuff i'm suddenly standing in 18th- century costume, in the snow in prague, in the middle of the night.
then i have to walk down the street and he says to me, "vinnie, television is ruining you!"
"no, you' re doing fine." i said, "you haven't said anything."
he said, "if there was anything wrong, i'd have said so."
if you cast wrong then you have to work and usually, you' re in trouble anyway.
a director is little bit of everything, but a good director always for every part of his work, must choose people who are better than him.
but they had an ingenuity, a humour, and a force to their imagination that more than repaid the lack of materials.

and there was some mishap, so there's a moment where i' -
and most of that is improvisational because he was acting as though he were very sick.
consequently, he began to lose certain things and i would guide him.
it was a real symphony between the two of us, a duet.
later on, i don't know if told murray, but i would skip information.
the thing that most amazed me was the artistry of every person in every job that worked on this film and the extraordinary storytelling that happened from every point of view.
i have the deepest gratitude to that crew because they gave everything, everything they had.

i'm sure you'll hear this again and again but we were part and parcel of something that was greater than we were.
i remember the stunned silence of those long, long main titles at the end while the piano concerto was still playing.
and then you got the first sense that perhaps this was going to be an unusual movie and that perhaps the music had won.
the thing that pleases me almost more than anything else about the whole enterprise is the number of people, young people who discover the man i think is the greatest composer in the world.
so many people were introduced to mozart as a composer, compared with just doing it in concert halls.
it'd have taken 100 years to reach as many people as the film did.

there must have been a civilization that mastered the stars energy control!
of course, we can take more energy from the sun than it gives us now.
but this means to interfere into the life of the entire star system!

on the very next day, another ship set sail from a spanish harbor, this one commanded by christopher columbus.
a door was opening onto a new world for europe, but all the doors seemed to be closing for the jews.
king ferdinand and queen isabella, under the pressure of their advisor tomas de torquemada, ordered all jews to leave the kingdom within 4 months on pain of death.
the glorious institutions of spanish jewry, like this great synagogue at toledo- now santa maria la blanca- were doomed.
now, expulsion was not a new experience for the jews of europe.
jews had been expelled from england, france, and many a town in germany during the preceding 5 centuries.
but those events had nothing like the dramatic effects that marked the expulsion of the jews from spain.
jews had never made themselves at home anywhere more deeply, more intimately than in spain.
one out of every 10 spaniards had been jewish or of jewish origin.
and now this jewish community, the largest and most prosperous in the world, was doomed to destruction by a single stroke of the pen.
the traumatic effects were not felt by the jews of spain alone.
no event since the destruction of judea by the romans 14 centuries before, had so shaken the security of jews everywhere or brought them to so sharp a realization of their exile and their vulnerability.
they settled in the jewish communities of these lands, and they prospered.
but wherever they went- to morocco, to istanbul, to italy, or to the eastern mediterranean- the jews of spain carried with them a burden of sorrow that no material well-being could relieve.
the fate of the refugees from spain stirred within the jewish heart and mind a profound self-examination.
it forced upon jews everywhere a deep sense of exile, and they reached for ways to redefine their place in the world.
he who saw safed 10 years ago and observes it now, has the impression of a miracle, for more jews are arriving here continually.
hatred of the jews is unknown here, and the turks hold them in esteem.
in the books they studied lies the key to their mystical vision.
the mishnah, the talmud, and the midrashim were books traditionally studied by jews everywhere for the previous thousand years.
in safed, the kabala would take a place in the forefront of jewish thinking.
the greatest of the mystical scholars of safed was the rabbi isaac luria.
part of the divine spirit, in the form of celestial sparks, had been scattered and lost.
for the divine spirit to be made whole again, the scattered sparks would have to be recovered.
according to luria, the jews had a special role in this cosmic drama.
if every jew were to obey the commandments of god in every action- no matter how small or seemingly insignificant- the sparks would be recovered,
the world restored to holiness, and the people of israel redeemed.
while the jews of safed studied and prayed and waited for the restoration of the world, across the mediterranean, another sort of restoration was taking place.
the rise of a money economy meant a new respectability for merchants, traders, and financiers.
the jews who practiced these trades would share in this new acceptability.
in their desire to rediscover the achievements of the past, the men of the renaissance studied greek and even hebrew texts.
in their painting and sculpture, they portrayed mythological and biblical subjects.
it seemed that the thousand years since the fall of rome had been nothing but a sojourn in darkness and ignorance.
for the men of the renaissance, wisdom was to be found in the classical world.
books, once rare and costly- some of which, incidentally, were in hebrew- were now being published in all the major cities of that day.
a generation of scholars began to examine the world around them with new eyes.
i believe in neither pope nor councils alone, for it is perfectly well-established that they have frequently erred as well as contradicted themselves.
i must be bound by those scriptures which have been brought forward by me.
for the first time since its founding, the church in rome was unable to suppress a major heretical movement.
the unity of christian faith in the west, although often fragile, had lasted for almost a thousand years.
jews were regarded and considered as the allies of the protestant reformation.
so in 1553, the papacy endorsed the burning of the talmud, imposed a censorship on jewish texts, and in 1555, pope paul iv revived the segregationist policies of the church and ordered the jews of rome into a ghetto.
across the centuries, the word "ghetto" came to mean the segregation of any people.
but originally, the word ghetto was a venetian word meaning "iron foundry. "
the new meaning of ghetto was created here in venice some 40 years before pope paul issued his encyclical.
once upon a time, there was an iron foundry in this place.
but at a specific date- to be exact, march 1516- it was decreed that the jews of venice could live only in this place, surrounded by a wall, closed in at night by a gate that was shut at sunset.
it was not at first a place of deprivation or persecution.
the intent of the venetians was perhaps only to limit jewish competition with their own commercial activities.
but this ghetto set the pattern that was soon followed by city after city throughout italy and eventually by cities across all of europe.
it's very hard to paint the reality of ghetto life, the social or the intellectual reality, in one single color.
yes, the jews were separated geographically from their neighbors, but there was a great deal of intermingling with non-jews on the social level.
there were periods of repression and persecution, but there were also periods of relative toleration.
and if in some places the ghetto had a stunting effect on intellectual life, in others, and especially here in the ghetto of venice, there was a vibrant social and religious life.
and so we find jewish composers like salomon rossi composing music for the synagogue in the renaissance style.
and so we find jewish poets like sara coppio sullam, whose fame transcended the limits of the ghetto.
but for a brief spasm of time, something of the brilliance and glitter of the renaissance illuminated the life of the jews.
the dynamism of the renaissance passed now to the nations along the atlantic coast.
in spain, for 60 years since the expulsion of the jews,
spanish rulers had waged a bloody campaign to root out all vestiges of jewish and islamic worship among their subjects.
the spanish inquisition had tortured and burned at the stake thousands suspected of deviating, however slightly, from strict catholic orthodoxy.
now with the nederlands under spanish rule, the spanish inquisition would deal with the dutch.
the english, under sir francis drake, sailed out to meet it.
when the two fleets met, the lighter and swifter ships of the english quickly outmaneuvered the armada and broke up its formation.
at the dedication ceremony of this majestic building, there was a choir and an orchestra.
this reflected the taste, the culture, and the practice of the spanish and portuguese jews who founded this community and who built this synagogue.
who pretended to be christians in order to avoid the cruelties of the inquisition, but who maintained their fidelity to the jewish faith and the jewish tradition.
and who secretly practiced that faith and made their allegiance to that tradition.
the son of a portuguese marrano, he had studied descartes and others of the new philosophers.
although gentle and unassuming, he shocked jews and christians alike by questioning the truth of miracles, treating the bible as a historical document, and denying the accepted idea of god.
cursed be he by day, and cursed be he by night;
cursed be he when he lies down, and cursed be he when he rises up.
they accused him of atheism, but later generations would recognize in his writings a foundation of modern philosophy, and see him as a "god-intoxicated man. "
the jews who first came to amsterdam were called sephardim, those of spanish and portuguese background.
in the city of prague in bohemia, caravans were assembled to carry manufactured goods to russia.
other caravans returning from the east unloaded their cargo of russian grain, lumber, and cattle for reshipment to the west.
the world of the ashkenazim was unlike that of the spanish jews in many ways.
in spain, jews had felt that they were spanish at least as much as they were jewish.
as much as possible, the ashkenazi community sought to be self-sufficient, a world apart.
the jewish quarter within a city was a town within a town.
jews had their own internal government, their own courts, their own schools and guilds.
they cared for each other in times of hardship, trying not to depend upon the christian world around them.
blessed art thou, o lord our god, king of the universe, who hast made a distinction between the sacred and the profane, between light and darkness, between israel and the other nations, between the seventh day and the 6 working days.
blessed art thou, o lord, who hast made a distinction between the sacred and the profane.
goods that were produced were turned over to jewish merchants for sale.
in this new land of opportunity, jews became innkeepers, traders, artisans, and financial agents.
this people, who had come from germany, found in poland a land on a crossroads between europe and the orient.
and from its culture, they relearned elements of an eastern heritage and created a blending of east and west that was uniquely theirs.
we are tired of tolerating the growing audacity of the jews.
not satisfied with engaging in occupations interfering with the livelihood of christians, they raise their heads as enemies of christian religion.
in all jewish communities dwelling in and near the cities, the elders should warn their members to be careful neither to ridicule nor to assault any gentile.
we all see that the bitter exile is getting more and more intense.
the ukrainians were members of the eastern orthodox church, their language and culture distinct from that of the polish rulers
they hated the poles with their roman catholic priests and their jewish arrendars.
in 1647, bogdan chmielnicki, a ukrainian cossack chieftain, called upon the peasants of his land to rise against their polish masters.
cossacks and peasants swept across the ukraine, burst unchecked into poland burning, looting, annihilating.
the cossacks had been followed by the russians and then the swedes.
what had started as a rebellion had ended as a deluge.
throughout the world of judaism there was shock- shock at the fate of the polish victims, shock at the recurring pattern of violence to which jews everywhere were subject.
the turmoil and violence of the times seemed proof that the end of days was near.
it is not to the person of shabbetai zvi that we must look for an explanation of this outpouring of emotion.
most jews had never seen him and had little direct knowledge of him.
my good father-in-law left his home in hameln, abandoned his house and lands and all his goodly furniture.
he sent on to us in hamburg two enormous casks packed with linens and with every manner of food that would keep, for the old man expected to sail any moment from hamburg to the holy land.
he assumed the name aziz mehmed effendi and accepted a government pension of 950 piastres a day.
shabbetai zvi's betrayal seemed to mock the deepest hopes of the jewish people.
in poland, in the wake of physical ruin, there was now spiritual desolation.
in the early 18th century, a man left his home in the polish ukraine and went into the mountains, to meditate on the condition of his world.
he was known as the baal shem tov, the master of the good name.
the inspiration that he found would revitalize the judaism of eastern europe through a movement known as hasidism.
unlike the rabbis of his day, he believed that even a simple, unlearned man could approach god directly through prayer and worship.
and in coming closer to god, a man could bring divine influence through himself into the world.
followers of hasidism appeared throughout poland and lithuania among the poor who felt that the traditional community had failed them.
in the years following the death of the baal shem tov,
worthless and wanton men who call themselves hasidim have deserted the jewish group.
they worship in a most insane fashion which does not conform to the religion of the holy torah.
while in eastern europe jews were turning to hasidism, in the west judaism would find a different direction.
in the netherlands, in england, and in france and germany, the early 18th century saw unprecedented growth in trade and commerce, and with it a new attitude toward the jews.
the jews are so disseminated through all the trading parts of the world that they are become the instruments by which the most distant nations converse with one another.
they are like the pegs and nails in a great building, which, though they are but little valued in themselves, are absolutely necessary to keep the whole frame together.
it was from these early hofjuden, or court jews, that there arose the great families of european jewry- the oppenheimers, the wertheimers, and the rothschilds.
wealth, influence, prestige- the rewards of the court were manifold for these jews.
they lived in elegant surroundings, rode in carriages with large retinues, and gave parties that even christian nobles would attend.
but spiritually and intellectually they remained part of jewish society, all but unaware of the changes that were transforming western thought- for europe was entering an age that would be known as the enlightenment.
voltaire, rousseau, locke, hume- excited and optimistic, turned to examine human society with the reasoned techniques of science.
they called for an end to all social oppression, an end to religious intolerance.
and those who embraced haskalah believed that western education was the way to a full and equal partnership with the christians of europe.
we must remember that with all the talk of scientific rationalism and equality and enlightenment, the experience of the jews had been one of separation.
they had recently given birth to the hasidic movement, which seemed to offer a way of spiritual fulfillment within exile.
to give up their particular identity by merging it with the lives of the society around them seemed a frightening idea.
after all, the enlightenment principles of freedom and equality were still only principles, and christian europe carried with it a dark heritage of resentment towards the jews.
it was not until the end of the 18th century that these enlightenment ideals were expressed in the politics of nations.
there was the sense of a world on the threshold of a new age.
the central political vision of the late 18th century was of a state in which religious differences would count for little;
these walls stand today as a reminder of the long ages of jewish isolation.
for centuries in this city, as in other cities of western europe,
the jews would break free of their ghetto isolation and join in the creation of a modern world.
at the end of the 18th century, two great revolutionary forces burst upon the european world.
revolutions in politics and in industry would drive and draw all of europe through a century of dramatic change- the 19th century.
in the closing years of the 18th century and the early years of the 19th, both shores of the english channel were shaken by some of the most profound and convulsive forces in recorded history.
the clearest manifestations of this upheaval were the industrial revolution, which had begun in england in about 1780, and the french revolution, which began in 1789.
out of the turmoil of revolution, the enlightenment ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity were shone as a beacon for all the world.
at last, in 1791, the national assembly accepted the jews as fellow citizens of the french nation.
the french armies under napoleon bonaparte marched across europe, carrying with them the ideals of the french revolution.
in country after country- in italy, germany, austria, hungary- medieval restrictions were swept aside, and political rights were granted to all.
for the first time, jews were offered political equality and citizenship in these nations of europe.
but the jews entered this new age with their own ancient sense of separate nationhood.
for centuries, each jewish child had learned that he was part of a separate nation... [children reciting]
the spirit of nationhood had sustained the jews, bound them together in adversity, and given meaning to their trials and sufferings.
the prospect of citizenship in the nations of europe raised a troubling question.
now that jews were frenchmen, germans, and austrians, were they still a separate nation?
and if they were not a separate nation, what did it mean to be jewish?
reactionary rulers throughout europe tried to undo what the french revolution had done.
but even as governments tried to restore the old ways of life, economic forces were transforming european society.
peasants and farmers flocked to the cities, some of them driven off the land, some of them attracted by the new opportunities of the industrial economy.
and the agricultural world, in which people had lived for hundreds of years, was replaced by a dynamic, urban, industrial society.
the products of the industrial revolution flowed to busy markets in london and in all the major cities of europe.
this expanding trade gave new power to the rising middle classes, to merchants, manufacturers, and professionals.
mayer amschel rothschild of frankfurt-am-main was a financial advisor to the ruler of one of the many german states.
in 1805, rothschild's eldest son, nathan, went to london, where he made his fortune as a stockbroker and banker.
his 4 brothers established branches of the family bank in paris, vienna, naples, and berlin.
within 20 years, they became one of the most powerful banking families in europe.
the rothschilds were a dramatic symbol of jewish success in the modern world.
for jews like the rothschilds, social acceptance was possible, but for the majority of jews, legal restrictions and ancient prejudices were still barriers to social equality.
in most places, jews were excluded from government, excluded from posts in universities.
they needed permits even to reside in certain cities such as berlin.
the reformers sought to create a modern expression of jewish values and beliefs.
we are not a separate people, said the reformers, we're europeans, different from others only in our religion.
first the rights of all citizens, afterwards our rights as jews!
in frankfort and elsewhere throughout europe hastily gathered assemblies created liberal constitutions.
a vision that could not be ignored, even by the most powerful of monarchs.
in vienna, the failure of the revolution of 1848 was followed by the accession to the imperial throne of the youthful franz joseph.
he ruled here in the hofburg palace for 68 years while the foundations of his austro-hungarian empire were being undermined by the diverse national aspirations of his many subject peoples.
the idea that political boundaries ought to encompass a people with a common language and culture- the idea of the nation-state- had sprung from the french revolution, together with the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity.
jews and other minorities were, in most respects, full equals of the protestant majority.
but here in the house of commons, every new member of parliament was required to take an oath
in 1847, lionel rothschild was elected to the house of commons.
he presented himself at parliament but refused to take the oath.
he placed his hand on the old testament and took his oath as a member of parliament.
the last major obstacle to jewish participation in the political life of britain had been removed.
the vast russian empire lay a thousand miles to the east of france and england.
it was a land as incomprehensible to most western europeans as it was remote.
at the end of the 18th century, russia annexed large parts of poland, lithuania, and the ukraine.
with this expansion, russia brought under its rule most of the great jewish community of poland.
jews were a minority- living in the lands of other peoples- living among the peasants of the ukraine or of poland, of lithuania or of moldavia.
christians and jews lived side by side, depending upon each other in a rural economy centered on the local market town, called in yiddish the "schtetl".
the peasants come from many miles around, bringing their livestock and vegetables, their fish and hides, their wagonloads of grain.
in exchange, they buy the city produce which the jews import- dry goods, boots, oil, and spades.
the hasidic jews of today inherit a legacy of dress, of belief, of custom and tradition from their eastern european past.
among the most respected jewish communal institutions of eastern europe was the yeshiva, the advanced academy of religious education
the great yeshivas of the pale were famous for their scholarship among jews everywhere.
families made great sacrifices so that their sons might devote themselves entirely to the study of the sacred texts, the torah and the talmud.
a man who puts out his hand to beg does so because he is poor.
unfortunately, in our times, the poor are forced to put out their hands.
but this distinctive culture was deeply alien to the russian world.
the russian government wanted the jews to abandon their study of torah and talmud, to abandon their separateness.
at the beginning of the 19th century, the jews of eastern europe would come face to face with the autocratic power of the russian state.
the tsar of russia, the emperor, was absolute in his authority.
he, too, became an autocratic ruler, but he was a man of more generous spirit.
he freed the 30 million russians who were bound to the land as serfs.
to stimulate commerce, he allowed a few thousand of the most successful jewish businessmen and professionals to leave the pale and settle anywhere in the empire.
their children were able to enter the great universities in moscow and st. petersburg.
the russian government would begin to use pogroms as a tool of policy:
to turn the anger of the populace away from the state and toward the jews.
until now, we thought of ourselves as russians, not as jews.
the events of these last weeks have shown us how tragic has been our mistake.
but the vast majority of those who left eastern europe headed west through the great ports of germany, through bremen and hamburg, bound for america.
in the 40 years following 1881, about 2 million jews, a third of the jews in eastern europe, would pass through these halls clinging to their few belongings, headed toward what they hoped would be a better life.
to commemorate the anniversary, the french erected a structure that rose over the city.
the eiffel tower was a tribute to science, to optimism, and to the future of mankind.
thousands who had prospered in the old economy were threatened by the new.
the modern world seemed to bear down on them with implacable force.
those who had lost in the new economy turned their anger and frustration against those who had gained.
by the 1880s, most jews in western europe had become middle class.
at one time, there were quite a number poor jews in the community.
those who still remember those earlier days must acknowledge that a transformation took place before their very eyes which the new generation cannot even imagine.
they brought their tradition of literacy and scholarship to the liberal professions, helping to shape modern law, medicine, and journalism.
those who were accustomed to look down upon the jews and to despise them were astonished by the extent of their achievements.
their new visibility was, in itself, an affront to their enemies.
to those who hated and dreaded the rapidly changing modern world, the jews became the symbol for everything that they feared and could not understand.
the word was new, but the hatreds it reflected were ancient.
and from those hatreds, the anti-semites created a dangerous political movement.
by the 1890s, the forces of anti-semitism had reached as far as these chambers of the austrian parliament.
here in vienna, as elsewhere, political parties sought to gain electoral support by pandering to popular anti-semitic attitudes.
liberal anti-semites saw them as a backward, oriental people, incapable of absorption into the nations of europe, while conservative anti-semites saw the jews as rootless, lacking in tradition, dangerously modern.
clearly, it was not the real content of jewish life and character that mattered to the anti-semites.
their jews were the creation and the reflection of their own terrors, fantasies, and neuroses.
to attack the jews was to attack whatever it was that they disliked in the modern world.
in france by the 1890s, the jews had become fully integrated in the life of the nation, sharing equally in the rights and duties of citizens.
it was here that one of the most notorious anti-semitic episodes took place.
it found that the evidence against dreyfus had indeed been forged by officers of the french army.
a second court-martial again found dreyfus guilty, although this time with "extenuating circumstances. "
a few jewish settlers from russia had already made their way to palestine.
now with herzl's inspiration, the zionist idea became a political movement.
the zionist movement had it strongest appear in russia where jews were seeking to forge a better way of life.
by the end of the 19th century, many jews in the pale lived in cities rather than market towns.
the bundists joined with other socialists to fight for the rights of workers.
through revolution, they hoped to cure the ills of russian life and end the oppressive poverty of the pale.
jewish women, putting aside their traditional role, joined in the new movements- in zionism, in bundism, joined in the struggle to reshape jewish life.
yiddish, the ordinary speech of the jewish masses, had never been taken seriously by educated jews.
its combination of hebrew characters and german dialect had seemed common and uncultivated.
now it became the vehicle of a renaissance in jewish culture.
new industries appeared as if overnight, new sciences, new art forms, new ways of life.
at the beginning of the 19th century, most people had expected to live in a world very much like that of their parents.
by the end of the century, everyone knew that in his own lifetime, the world would be transformed beyond recognition.
every aspect of society and of life was open to question, was filled with possibilities.
being jewish no longer restricted them to a separate jewish world.
what they contributed was not to a body of jewish culture but to the common heritage of all europeans.
a revolution in russia and a world war in europe would bring an end to these last vestiges of the old political order.
the russian pale of settlement came to an end as armies marched back and forth across the region.
for the jews as for all others, the world of established truths was gone.
100 years before, the ghetto, the closed community, the religious laws, had formed the jewish identity.
each jew would have to find his own place in a world both promising and precarious.
in november 1917, after british forces gained control of palestine, the zionist leader chaim weitzman secured a pledge from the government of great britain.
his majesty's government view with favor the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people.
eban: 30 years later, the promise of the balfour declaration would be fulfilled in the creation of the state of israel.
the diversity of jewish life was now to find expression in new lands, where new opportunities awaited.
to many it seemed that the greatest hope lay in a land to the west, across the atlantic.
through this great hall of the ellis island immigration center in new york bay passed gentile and jew, the poor and the dispossessed, the hungry and the disenfranchised.
the beacon that drew them here was the vision of an america where a new tradition would be forged- based on universal dreams of justice and equality.
the story of civilization is the story of our origins- of how we came to be the way we are.
it is a family tree of lost nations, ruined empires... buried cultures... and a surviving strain of ideas that inspired our ancestors, values that ruled our history and shaped the modern world.
i'm abba eban, a jew, a citizen of israel, educated in england, by training, a scholar of history and language, in recent decades, a diplomat and member of my country's parliament.
in the 9 one-hour episodes of this series, we are going to show you history through a microscope, focusing on the experience of a single small people, small in size and space and power.
we tell their story not just because of its constant drama, but because their ideas have played a central and influential role in human affairs.
because their history is a link between our origins and our present.
about 6 million of them living in the united states, over 3 million in israel.
a few million more scattered throughout the world, but acknowledging a common heritage, a common history that spans time and place.
where does their unique story fit into the larger epic of mankind, into the history of empires and civilizations?
when and how did they conceive the idea that has been their greatest and most lasting contribution as a people:
the idea of god that most of the world's great religions have come to share.
that idea is one of the great reaches of the human mind.
it evolved, like the jewish people themselves, over the course of many centuries.
the development of that idea, this people, the civilization in which they originated, that is our subject in the first episode of heritage:
3,800 years b. c. e. - before the common or christian era.
archeologists, tracing the human past, have arrived back at this same place, at about the same time.
civilization developed out of agriculture, out of irrigation, which earlier people had devised as a way to temper the droughts and floods of the rivers.
to turn chance vegetation into crops they could depend on, turn barren clay into "eden".
cities first arose in mesopotamia between 4,000 and 3,000 b. c. e.
this restored temple is a fragment of one of the earliest cities, a place called ur, which is mentioned in the bible as abraham's ancestral home.
it was build long before the jews as a people entered the story of civilization- built by a mesopotamian people called the sumerians.
in outward appearance, those earliest cities probably resembled this one, called taourirt in north africa.
they were mud-brick complexes, their walls enclosing a nucleus of public buildings- the temple and the palace- and housing for a population of thousands.
mud-brick construction doomed these places to crumble into ruins- doomed the sumerians to be forgotten, their very identity buried beneath the ruins of peoples who followed them.
in the cities of mesopotamia, there were weavers and wool merchants, brewers and bakers, metal workers, dyers, tanners.
the wheel was a basic device of civilization and the sumerians were the first to make use of it.
they moved their products in carts pulled by donkeys- vehicles of commerce that soon evolved into a vehicle of war, the military chariot.
the sumerians were the first people known to field an organized army.
devised by the sumerians about 3100 b. c. e., before egyptian hieroglyphics... before chinese ideographs...
after various transformations, it emerged as a system of wedge-shaped symbols called cuneiform.
all of life, in the ancient view, was at the mercy of the gods- their all-too-human whims and rages, their perpetual conflicts with each other.
the god who appeared as wind fighting the god of vegetation...
but in the ways of the gods, they could see no moral pattern, nothing to count on or live up to.
that rather chaotic view of the human condition was one that dominated the life and thought of early civilizations.
it would begin to change- dramatically, permanently- only with the emergence of a jewish people onto the scene.
according to the best evidence of archeology, that would not begin to happen until some time after 1500 b. c. e.
by 1500, the cities of mesopotamia have developed into thriving city-states.
rich and potent nations ship their surplus grain and wool and hides across overland trade routes that pass across the countryside of canaan, towards cities along the mediterranean coast.
ports that maintained contact with other mediterranean cities like troy, and with mediterranean islands like cyprus and crete.
in land beyond the coastal plain there were walled citadels guarding the trade routes that stretched east to mesopotamia.
the architecture of this cities was indigenous to canaan- instead of mud-bricks, there was plenty of durable stone.
but the culture of the canaanite cities was, in many respects, an extension of mesopotamia- their art, their legal codes, their religious outlook.
this huge stone platform may have been an altar used for animal sacrifices in the worship of nature gods, deities identified with the cycles of planting and harvest, death and renewal.
the chief of the canaanite deities was baal, revered as the source of bounty, of fertility.
in the canaanite city-states, power was concentrated at the top of the feudal structure.
the king, the royal family, the class of warrior knights... they owned most of the farmland beyond the city walls.
the civilization of canaan produced the alphabet, which became the basis of all western written languages.
it was an advance beyond the system of cuneiform symbols, which the canaanites had learned from the mesopotamians.
by the year 1500, generations of travelers had arrived from mesopotamia-
whole families, tribes, clans had settled, in their way, among the peoples of canaan, in a land that was still inhabited by lions, its coastal marshes by the hippopotamus.
further centuries would pass before any of the peoples of canaan could be identified as hebrews, or israelites, or jews.
that would only happen as the consequence of another significant traffic that connected canaan with a society to the south- a civilization almost as old as mesopotamia and equally powerful.
egypt, a stable, ponderous society, quick to flourish and slow to change, through dynasty after dynasty of absolute rulers, the pharaohs.
the pharaohs reigned as incarnations of the gods, the many complex deities of egypt.
the pharaohs spent their lives preparing to join the gods after death, building tombs like fortresses to preserve their bodies for the journey... into eternity.
the skill of egypt's architects and engineers kept pace with the ambitions of the pharaohs.
in ancient times, the dependable harvest of this delta were a lure to immigration.
tribes from canaan came across the border when their own lands were parched by drought, as jacob's family did in the bible story.
many of the foreigners stayed to enjoy the rich life of this society.
some rose to positions of authority, as in the story of joseph.
aten expunged from the heavenly hierarchy, the old system of belief restored.
a few decades later, in the reign of a pharaoh called rameses the second, the pace of egyptian history seems to quicken.
with shipments of granite from the quarries of the upper nile, a vast new building program is undertaken.
the pharaoh orders additions to the great temple of karnak, the religious capital of the country, a temple to prepare for his own death.
but the fact of the exodus and its impact are hard to dispute.
in the story of mankind, the emergence from egypt into this wilderness sanctuary would become a universal metaphor, an everlasting symbol of the human need and right to be free.
in jewish tradition, it would be celebrated by generation after generation in the springtime holiday of the passover, a festival of liberation as fervent as any nation's independence day.
it evokes the feelings of the liberated tribes, leaving the labor camps of the nile delta behind them.
to them, the exodus must have seemed nothing less than a miracle, a deliverance so implausible, so incredibly dramatic, that it could only be a divine act.
it was evidence of the power of their own special god, not a universal god.
tradition calls this towering peak the mount sinai of exodus, the landmark of the whole western religious heritage.
at its base, for the last 12 centuries, a greek monastery has sat in humble attendance.
the meaning of this place is commemorated in the words of the torah.
for this is the place tradition identifies with the covenant, the agreement by which the people calling themselves israel, accepted god's law, and god promised his blessings.
the god of moses is not without connections to earlier religions.
he visits a kind of spell on israel's enemies in the form of plagues.
if not the only god in the universe, then he is the only god of this particular people.
and there is no mystery to be divined by omens or averted by ritual magic.
yahweh promises to deal with his people, not on the basis of divine whim or passion, but of law, open and explicit.
other peoples have elevated their kings to the status of deities.
mankind's view of the human condition has begun to undergo a remarkable change.
the god-driven people, who entered the sanctuary of canaan with the vivid memory of the sinai experience, merged into the established canaanite population.
most of them, after all, were originally canaanite by language and culture.
it was around this nucleus that a new people would be formed, and out of that people, a nation.
they fled to the back-country, where they joined with another group of refugees- those god-enlightened people of the exodus from egypt.
two groups of apiru- which may be the source of the word "hebrew".
stone pillars supported some sort of roofing, which sheltered the family members and sometimes the animals.
life in those places was simple and egalitarian, like the character of israel's belief, in which the only authority was god's, and everyone had equal access to his law.
as it spread, its adherents formed a league, a federation of little communities.
their only authority was a temporary leader they called a shofet, or judge.
they carried tablets inscribed with god's laws into battle when they fought with neighboring peoples for control of the countryside.
their greatest adversaries proved to be the philistines, those descendants of the formidable sea people, with a newly discovered source of power:
their burial cases may look benign, but their iron weapons made the philistines the scourge of canaan.
about the year 1020, faced with a losing war against this enemy, the israelites adopted a course often taken by ancient peoples in times of crisis;
this decision transformed the federation of believers into a unified people, the league of villages, into a nation.
but it would have a drastic impact on their simple form of society.
i'm standing on the site that became the very center of israelite nationhood, its capital, in fact and in sentiment, over the centuries.
this ancient place now being uncovered outside the southern walls of jerusalem, is the city of david, the citadel built by israel's second king.
here the modern nation of israel seeks out its origins, assembles the buried fragments of ancient israel's brief golden age, that era of fateful and dramatic change, of rise and decline, ushered in by the reign of king david.
david, a popular hero who staved off the philistine threat and unified the scattered communities of israel.
in the city of jerusalem, he installed his government and provided a permanent home for the tablets of the law, the powerful symbol of his people's belief.
david himself was one of the voices of that faith, a poet credited with some of the loveliest psalms in hebrew literature.
when i consider your heaven, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, what is man that you are mindful of him?
you have made him little lower than the angels, and crowned him with honor and glory.
you gave him dominion over all the works of your hands.
all sheep and oxen, yes, and the beasts of the field, the fowl of the earth, and whatever passes through the paths of the sea.
israel's dominion extended north to the euphrates, south to the borders of sinai.
the nation of refugees was now a ruler of subject peoples-
in trade with the corners of the empire, luxury goods of all sorts were imported.
they found a market among a new class of urban rich.
gezer was the dowry of a foreign princess, one of solomon's wives.
israel was now tied to a system of foreign alliances, bound to an imperial style that was undermining the old communal way of life.
the imperial style could be supported only by a heavy burden of new taxes.
this fell crushingly on the ordinary people, the small farmers and tradesmen.
the egalitarian life of the early settlements had been corrupted by power and affluence.
in a society ruled by rank and privilege, who would speak for the ordinary people?
they preached against foreign alliances, against the spread of foreign cults.
the prophets spoke as caretakers of the religion, recalling the israelites to their origins, recalling them to god's law.
the empire of the pharaohs being challenged by a dynamic military force from assyria.
in the course of this conflict, the northern kingdom of israel was reduced to a vassal state, surviving only by paying tribute to the assyrians.
the year was 586 before the common era, one of the bitterest years in jewish memory.
the life of the independent nation was ended, its unifying symbol, the temple, was in ruins;
what emerged in this book- these books- what had been emerging over the centuries, from the exodus to the exile, was a new and larger vision of life.
in the tragedy that had overtaken them, the exiles saw the hand of a universal god.
had not the prophets warned them that violating the covenant would bring on a terrible punishment?
was it not their god yahweh who had sent the mightiest empires of the world to punish the israelites?
so, israel, and the enemies that had brought about its downfall, were all the instruments of a single god and his universal law;
a law in which goodness was required and in which wrong doing was doomed to failure.
all the world's nations were linked in a common destiny, bound together by a moral law with inescapable consequences.
at the center of this vision was no mere god of nature, but the god of all history.

found in it the joy and hope they needed to continue.
by the first century of the present era, all the lands of the mediterranean had been brought together in the greatest political and military enterprise the world had ever known.
the military power of rome reshaped the governments, the nations, and the peoples of its empire into a single international order.
100 different traditions and cultures were brought together in this vast experiment of rule.
its effect on the jews, its effect on all peoples, would be profound.
no one could have foreseen the long-range impact of the great roman conquest- least of all the romans themselves.
the world as all men had known it was coming to an end, brought to a close in part by the power of rome.
rome, itself, would be swept up by it, helpless in the face of forces greater than its own.
but the vast proportions of the roman empire would contribute to an international dialogue whose effects would be far-reaching.
new religions and forms of belief would arise and capture the minds and souls of millions of people from the atlantic coasts of europe to the farthest reaches of china.
a spiritual revolution was about to sweep the world, and the jews were to have a central role in the drama.
at the beginning of the present era, the jews lived scattered throughout the roman empire.
centuries of trouble in their native land of judea had driven many of them to find homes in other countries of the eastern mediterranean.
in this greek-speaking world, the word for the dispersion of a people was "diaspora. "
"diaspora", it was a fundamental and inescapable element of jewish life.
at least 3 out of every 4 jews lived outside of judea.
there were jewish communities in egypt, greece, and asia minor, in babylonia, and in north africa.
home for the jews might be a rich seaport on the coast of the mediterranean or a remote outpost of trade in the desert of what is now morocco.
the ancient world had never known a people quite like the jews.
on the island of jerba, in what is now tunisia, is a jewish community said to date back more than 2,000 years.
some of its members still wear black leg bands in mourning for the destruction of solomon's temple more than 2,500 years ago.
the image of jewish life revealed here is one almost untouched by time.
each moment of life was regulated by the sacred law, each action was seen as dedicated to god.
the masses have been for a long time filled with enthusiasm for our pious customs, and there isn't a city in greece or a people among the barbarians which does not practice our custom of weekly rest, our fasts, our lighting of lamps,
or many of our dietary laws, and thus, god i the world over.
its teeming streets and marketplaces were a magnet that drew people from all over the mediterranean.
the city embraced them all, tolerating the customs and gods of 100 foreign peoples.
the jews alone among all the peoples under roman rule did not warship roman gods, nor could they obey roman laws if doing so meant violating their own sacred customs.
rome was powerless to change their ways, powerless except by force of arms.
but the issue seemed a minor matter, a question of custom and belief, and so the roman government granted them the right to be different.
with official toleration came increasing acceptance of jewish ideas as well.
the ground was laid for an upheaval in the beliefs of the western world.
in the early years of the first century, a man called jesus, said to be from nazareth, began his preaching here on these shores of the sea of galilee.
this synagogue at capernaum was built, perhaps, on the ruins of the one where jesus told his parables as he sought a following amongst the major jewish centers in galilee.
those who followed the teachings of jesus were known among other jews as "nazarenes".
these are the words of saul, better known to history as saint paul, the apostol.
he and others of his group carried the message of jesus to the cities of greece and asia minor, and to rome.
where fields of grass now lie, once there was a harbor crowded with ships.
the road that once carried cartloads of produce to and from the docks now stands empty.
for two years he gathered followers among the jews and among the greeks who were sympathetic to jewish teachings.
this city, the second largest in the eastern mediterranean, became a major center for the nazarenes.
so many converts did he make in ephesus and other cities that local citizens thought that their traditional gods were being abandoned.
in this theatre, about the year 55, an excited crowd gathered to protest the spread of the new sect.
a man named demetrius stood before them, a jeweler who built statues to the goddess artemis.
fearing that the new religion would destroy his livelihood, he called upon his audience to attack the nazarenes.
he may have gone, but he left behind a nazarene sect firmly rooted in the greek-speaking world of asia minor and the aegean.
while jewish beliefs were influencing other peoples, the world of judaism itself was about to undergo a transformation.
in the year 66, the people of judea rose in arms to liberate themselves from roman rule.
after 4 years of struggle, they were utterly and hopelessly defeated.
only two jewish sects would survive- the nazarenes, most of whom lived outside judea, and the successors of the jewish scholars known as pharisees.
in the countryside of judea, the sage johanan ben zakkai had found refuge from the war that ravaged jerusalem.
here in sardis, in what is now turkey, is the largest of ancient synagogues to be unearthed in modern times.
its rich mosaic floors and elegant proportions give witness to the affluence of the jewish community of the late second century.
with the temple in jerusalem gone, synagogues became the central focus of jewish life.
with the priests gone, the rabbis, and the laws that they preserved, would guide the people.
this most remarkable of early synagogues was discovered in dura europus in what is now syria.
its illustrations of biblical stories and legends speak of an eclectic and colorful jewish world.
they had no patience for the details of worship and ritual considered by traditional jews so important to the service of god.
they could not forgive the other jews for refusing to believe that the messiah had come.
he proposed to build a roman city on the site of destroyed jerusalem, a shrine to jupiter on the ruins of the temple.
in 132, the people of judea, encouraged by the rabbis, rose in revolt.
they were led by simon bar kochba, believed by many to be the messiah come at last.
rome sent in its legions from syria, from egypt, and arabia.
slowly, over the succeeding centuries, it would sink into poverty and neglect.
gone was the hope of a jewish nation restored by force of arms.
but now, in devastated judea, if there was any hope remaining, it lay elsewhere.
if no government could establish the sacred rule of jewish law, then another way would have to be found.
60 years before, following the first judean revolt, a group of scholars had founded an academy of jewish learning and ordained the first rabbis.
now, in galilee, the rabbis of this same academy continued the work of gathering and editing the traditions of their people.
about the year 200, a text of sacred study was produced that would come to be accepted everywhere throughout the diaspora.
it would be known as the mishnah, literally that which is repeated, for it was memorized and recited by its students.
with judea destroyed, with the central authorities of the jewish world gone, it was the mishnah that helped define the duties of jewish life.
throughout the far-flung cities of the diaspora, it was the mishnah and its study that would keep the jewish community together.
christians who refused to worship the roman gods were torn apart by wild beasts.
during the reign of septimius severus, in carthage, alexandria, rome, and corinth,
the roman empire was the greatest state structure the classical world ever produced.
despite its complexity and far-reaching size, it remained dominant and vital for more than 300 years.
but like most products of human endeavor, it could not last forever.
some states may suffer sudden and cataclysmic downfall through invasion or revolution.
he abandoned rome as the capitol for what he called military reasons.
he took the drastic step of dividing the empire into two, the eastern and the western roman empire.
he appointed a ruler of each to be called augustus, each of them with a caesar under him.
but these desperate measures could only postpone, they couldn't avert the collapse.
after the abdication of the emperor diocletian, there took place a chaotic struggle for the succession.
the victor that emerged was constantine, the son of one of the rulers whom diocletian had appointed.
now, when constantine needed dedicated support to rebuild the empire, he turned to the christians for assistance.
he made christianity his own religion, the christian movement an ally of the state in reestablishing order throughout the roman world.
in the year 330, on the site of the ancient city of byzantium, the emperor constantine dedicated nova roma, new rome, as eastern capital of the empire.
it was from new rome, soon to be called constantinople, that constantine's successors were to reach out and force obedience to the state.
their religious services were parallel in many ways, with readings from the scriptures and psalms sung to "jewish" music.
it is perhaps remarkable that the emperors did not outlaw judaism altogether.
their hordes broke upon europe, driving other tribes before them in terror.
ostrogoths, visigoths, and huns ravaged the balkans from italy to the black sea.
and in the year 410, it was sacked by the army of the goths.
there was nothing left that could be called the roman empire.
its eastern half withstood the onslaught and survived- but with a new identity and a new name, the byzantine empire.
its western half was fragmented and destroyed, broken into areas of rule that would eventually shape the map of modern europe.
they ceased to be romans and became instead franks, burgundians, britains- local peoples.
the one group that stood apart in this european world were the jews.
in the few communities where they lived, they were considered roman citizens, living with the privileges and disabilities given them by a rome that no longer existed-
a rome whose only remaining representative was a bishop affectionately known as the "father"-
and with it, there also remained the recollection of rome as the capital of an empire.
as in the present time, the papacy had a great symbolic influence.
by this, i mean a capacity to exercise authority without coercive power.
but from 590 onward, the influence of the papacy became much more than symbolic.
gregory came to power as the last vestige of roman rule slipped away in the west.
the bishops of far-off constantinople could no longer enforce their will in europe.
this was to be the central institution of european life, keeping alive the remnants of roman knowledge and culture in a time that would come to be known as the middle ages.
in the east, near the banks of the tigris and euphrates rivers, life continued, unaffected by the disasters that had struck imperial rome.
while rome struggled against wave upon wave of invasions, the persian empire reached a golden age of art and culture.
near the ancient city of babylon was the major center of jewish life in this day.
half a million jews maintained a presence began more than a 1,000 years before.
here the descendants of the jews deported by nebuchadnezzar had established major centers of learning and rabbinic study.
the jews of babylonia shared in this rich culture, and they flourished.
in the babylonian academies of jewish learning, rabbis discussed and analyzed the ancient texts of their people.
in galilee, other academies of scholars carried on a similar process.
what resulted was a body of literature like no other ever produced.
the scholars in galilee and babylon created a monumental source of jewish culture known as the talmud.
they wrote commentaries on the bible, and then commentaries on the commentaries, and then they commented on all of that.
and thus, they produced a rich, copious, voluble, chaotic, but vivid body of writing, containing literature, legend, and law.
a page of the talmud in hebrew and aramaic goes on and on, forever, without any periods or commas or points of punctuation.
surrounding it is a running dialogue of the rabbis' remarks and their arguments, along with stories, legends, and miscellaneous teachings.
there are precise legal discussions of ceremonial, civic, and moral duties.
there are maxims, popular proverbs, prayers, parables, and fables of jewish and heathen folklore.
it is a storehouse of information on law, history, medicine and astronomy, on science and magic, on commerce and agriculture.
this very original and unsystematic way of teaching was described by one of the rabbis in a commentary on genesis, bra'shit rabba.
i quote, "it is all like an impenetrable thicket of reeds.
the talmud become an entire culture in itself and although one group of jews, the karaites, rejected its authority, for orthodox jews everywhere, it became the central theme of life and thought unto this very day.
in the course of time, the study of the talmud became consecrated as an act of virtue, a symbol of devotion to god.
their central idea had triumphed, the idea of the unity of god, and therefore, the coherence of nature and of human destiny.
that idea lived on in their biblical texts and talmudic writings.
a vigorous militant assertion of it would spring out of the blazing desert sands of the arabian peninsula.
arabia- this arid land extended eastward beyond the reach of empires.
across its wastes, caravans passed, carrying goods from india and africa to the settled lands of the mediterranean.
its tribal people combined the worship of their ancient deities with judaism and christianity.
at the beginning of the 7th century in the city of mecca in arabia, a merchant named muhammad had a vision.
in it, the angel gabriel commanded him to spread word of the one god to all the arab peoples.
the armies of islam fought their way to the gates of byzantium before being stopped.
throughout asia minor, christian communities fled before the invincible sword of islam.
the mountains of cappadocia in modern turkey still bear scars inflicted in that day.
here, christian refugees carved homes for themselves out of the raw rock of remote cliff sides.
christianity, once the official religion of the entire mediterranean, was forced into retreat.
here, in a final hiding place, people of what had been the eastern roman empire found holy solace in the darkness of their caves.
a portion of the byzantine empire would survive for centuries to come, but it had lost forever its sway over the southern and eastern mediterranean.
the age that was now dawning would be known as the arab age.
by the early 8th century, 100 years after the death of muhammad, his faith, islam, dominated vast areas from india all the way to spain.
across the transformed lands of syria, arabia, egypt, and persia, the successors of muhammad sought to unite all men in a single community of islam.
there was to be no priesthood, no hierarchy, no central capital.
the mosque, the place of worship, was to serve as the one gathering point for all men.
jewish communities from persia in the east, across north africa, to spain in the west were linked by this international culture.
a new age was about to begin for the jews of arab lands.
it was they who took over the trade routes that the christians left behind.
jewish merchants were the only ones permitted to travel freely in both islamic and christian lands.
merchants traveling between them relied upon this communities for assistance and support.
the jews of these communities benefited, in turn, from the trade the merchants brought them.
jews joined enthusiastically with muslims in developing what would become one of the great ages of jewish and islamic life.
jews would share in the government, the scholarship, the arts and sciences of this new world.
to the north, christian europe was about to burst forth with creative energy, drawing upon the resources and scholarship of jews from mediterranean lands.
a new chapter of history for the jews and for all the world was about to unfold;
they had endured because their sense of purpose as a people remained undimmed.
they had adapted to life without a land of their own, and they had preserved their customs as an act of devotion to the one god, the god whose covenant in sinai they still remembered, the god whose nature they still proclaimed to all the world.
but throughout this period, one thing had survived and advanced with inevitable force:
the belief in one god and in a moral law that applied to all mankind.
starting as the unique concept of the jewish people, it had come to be accepted in varying forms by most peoples throughout the mediterranean region.
the paradox was that although judaism, christianity, and islam were united by profound ethical and spiritual convictions, these 3 great religions remained in competition, sometimes in bitter competition, as the brilliant and troubled times of the middle ages
for me, there is a sense of wonder in this place.
one can almost hear within it, reflected by its vaulted ceilings, the sound of jewish prayer...
the jews had followed the conquest of islam across north africa and into spain.
to the north, christian europe was beginning to awaken and was on the verge of profound changes.
the cultures of 3 great faiths would meet on the continent of europe.
the jews would join in the transformation of that continent and would themselves be transformed.
the land is rich, abounding in rivers, springs, and aqueducts- a land of corn, oil, and wine, and all manner of delicacies.
it has pleasure gardens and orchards and fruitful trees of every kind.
in these precincts, as in all of andalusia, the southern part of spain, for more than two centuries,
arabs and jews lived together, side by side, bound to each other despite other differences by a common love of beauty and knowledge, poetry and music, art and philosophy.
in jewish history, despite intermittent waves of persecution and violence, that spanish era is known as a golden age.
the great wave of moslem conquest that swept across north africa had broken upon the shores of europe, leaving spain in the hands of moorish rulers.
jews had followed in the wake of the moslem conquests, joining in the development of new lands and sharing in the first great florescence of culture since the days of the roman empire.
arab civilization had built upon a foundation laid by other cultures before it, among them that of the jews, and in reaching outward to greece and india and rome, the arab renaissance synthesized a luminous vision of the world.
in delicate patterns, the words of the koran, the holy book of islam, were carved upon the walls of moslem palaces.
everywhere, in a profusion of detail, beauty and faith were intertwined.
it was they who developed a system called, in arabic, "al-jabr"-algebra.
they read the works of classical greece and were enthralled, exploring in their own minds the paths and byways of philosophy...
and in their age of greatest creativity, they tolerated and respected the ideas and beliefs of other peoples.
by the ninth century, the vast majority of all jews lived in arab lands.
they could hardly escape the influence of this new and energetic culture.
in many of the lands of islam, an ideal would emerge among the jews of living and sharing in the larger society.
nowhere was this ideal more fully realized than in the moslem lands of spain.
here in the great mosque of cordoba, early in the tenth century,
abd ar-rahman iii established the independent caliphate of moslem spain, and invited to his realm arab poets and scientists, scholars and philosophers.
here the jewish linguist and statesman hasdai ibn shaprut served in the court of abd ar-rahman and founded a jewish court of his own.
in so doing, he created a center of jewish culture unique in the world of his time.
a new world of judaism would be born in this land- the world of the sephardim, the spanish jews.
over the years, they would play a conspicuous part in the government, in the statecraft, and in the scholarship of moorish spain.
here in granada, as elsewhere in spain, the sephardim rose to positions of great power.
here, samuel ibn nagrela, a jew, could become prime minister and commander in chief of the moorish armies.
his son joseph would succeed him and plan, it is said, the construction of the great red palace-the alhambra.
it was a land of abundance- rich in opportunity, rich in possibilities.
from the fruitfulness of spain, the moorish and the jewish cultures drew sustenance, growing side by side and learning from one another.
but to his people, who revered him, he was, and is known, by other names-
rambam, the great eagle, to signify his soaring intellect, and most simply, the second moses.
maimonides, who would be remembered as a scholar, philosopher, and moralist, became first a mathematician, an astronomer, a physician.
as one of the greatest physicians of his century, he was appointed to attend the sultan saladin.
in the synagogue of ben ezra- his synagogue- the mind and spirit of the second moses are alive today.
maimonides searched out the heart of jewish tradition and codified it in the mishneh torah.
let us say that whenever anything in the world seems absurd, ridiculous, or evil, it is because we have but a partial knowledge, and we want things arranged according to our taste and reason, but when we look at life and the world
from the aspect of the eternal scheme of things, we will find that what seems to us bad and shocking does so only because of our lack of knowledge and wisdom.
in the closing days of the golden age, it was a beacon light that would illuminate the work of scholars of other faiths for centuries to come.
but the age which had produced maimonides was soon to vanish.
moorish spain fell apart in the 11th and 12th centuries, and christian armies from the north of the iberian peninsula launched a campaign of reconquest- in spanish, the "reconquista."
over the next 400 years, they would drive inexorably southward and westward into moslem spain until the moors were forced to yield every piece of territory they had ever possessed.
northern europe remained little more than a fragile outpost of civilization.
it was a primitive land, with a population barely clinging to the remnants of a culture brought to them by rome centuries before.
the first jews to penetrate to this land were traders bringing goods from the mediterranean.
but in time, as stability and peace were ensured by feudal lords,
everywhere new lands were cleared as peasants lived and farmed under the protection of feudal lords.
villages grew into towns, and where once stockades and wooden huts had served, stone walls now rose.
the jews were the connective link between this frontier society and the sophisticated world of the moslem lands.
eager to develop commerce in their domains feudal lords in northern europe sought to attract jews to their towns with offers of special charters and privileges.
it was the charters granted by feudal rulers that permitted the jews to settle in the land.
the terms might vary, but, without exception, jews were allowed to practice their faith and live according to their own laws as written in the talmud.
from the 10th and 11th century on, there were established jewish communities in most of the major cities of germany and france.
the jews excelled in commerce, and their relations with their neighbors were relatively tranquil.
the great talmudical academies in germany and france were able to develop an intense intellectual activity.
the most conspicuous figure is rashi, the great commentator on the bible and talmud who lived in troyes in northern france.
rashi and other scholars of europe devoted themselves to the study of jewish laws, answering letters from rabbis who needed help in judging difficult cases among their people.
and difficulties did arise in this new environment, forcing the scholars to modify the laws of the talmud to accommodate life within a christian world.
because they were isolated from the large jewish communities of the east, the jews of northern europe developed an identity that was uniquely theirs.
in time, they came to view themselves as a distinct branch of judaism.
they called themselves ashkenazim after a land in the distant north mentioned by the bible.
in many ways, the jews were but one people among the peoples of europe.
in a world where every event of nature was a mystery, a man's religion provided the only path of understanding.
and where men disagreed about religion, they disagreed about the world.
judaism was often portrayed as a beautiful woman wearing a blindfold because she refused to see that jesus had been the messiah.
across from her, christianity was shown triumphant- the noble possessor of the truth.
the church accused the jews of having lost the way, and, worse than that, it accused them of having caused the death of the messiah.
these accusations, repeated in sermons throughout europe, were meant primarily to keep christians from listening to jewish ideas, but in the minds of the poor and the uneducated, they planted the seeds of hatred.
i thought i would increase the importance of the place a thousandfold by bringing in jews.
accordingly, i located them outside of the community and habitation of the other citizens, and i surrounded them with a wall so that they might not be disturbed by the insolence of the populace.
envy of jewish prosperity was one motive, but religion was the critical ingredient.
it would be the fervor of religion that, in only a few years, would launch a war.
a horrible tale has gone forth that an accursed moslem race has invaded the lands of the east.
you who are endowed with the badge of knighthood and are arrogant with great pride advance boldly as soldiers of christ.
before the nobles could organize their armies, however, masses of paupers began to assemble.
for these, the poor of europe, the crusade seemed a great adventure- a chance to escape the misery of their lives.
most of them hardly knew where the holy land was nor indeed who exactly their enemies might be.
their ignorance at this moment of zealous enthusiasm could lead only to disaster.
the paupers now engaged in a war that pope urban had never intended.
at the end of april 1096, in the rhine valley, groups of rabble crusaders assembled into armies.
on the morning of a jewish sabbath in the beginning of may, they attacked the great jewish community of speyer.
the jews fled to the bishop, who used his own troops to fight off the crusaders.
the rabble armies now turned against the jews of other towns.
jews were threatened with death unless they would abandon their judaism and convert to christianity.
for the time being, the enemy will slay us, and yet we shall live.
happy will everyone be who dies for the sanctification of his name.
the jewish communities of the rhineland recovered and reestablished themselves, but the memory of those events would not die, even in the prosperous days that followed.
the 12th century that now began ushered in a period of expansion and development for the christian lands of europe.
"burgs" they were called in german- a new class emerged, the burghers- in french, the bourgeois.
for each of the trades in a town, there was an association, or a guild, with its insignia and its meeting hall.
there were guilds for merchants, for tanners, vintners, weavers, glaziers... for every imaginable occupation.
the craftsmen of the guilds were of humble origin- peasants from the countryside or simple villagers.
they feared to include in their ranks any men of different background.
almost without exception, the guilds were closed to jews, excluding them from most aspects of the new economic order.
but the growth of trade and commerce also offered new opportunities.
and as shipments of goods swelled and laborers had to be paid, one thing came to be needed in great quantity - money.
currency was necessary for economic growth, and coins became such a valuable commodity that men paid interest of more than 30% to borrow them.
christians were forbidden by the catholic church to lend money to other christians for profit.
nowhere in europe were jewish moneylenders more prosperous and useful than in 12th-century england.
from his home in lincoln, a man known to history only as aaron of lincoln controlled a network of investments that extended to 25 counties.
he and other jews helped finance the construction of buildings across all of england, including dozens of abbeys and monasteries and at least two cathedrals.
the role of jews in financing the new economy was a productive one everywhere.
in many of the german towns, jews were accepted as citizens and in some places they were even granted public office.
the ashkenazim, once almost insignificant in number, now expanded more rapidly than any other jewish community in the world.
the heart of their settlement was in germany, and german became the everyday language for most of the ashkenazic jews.
they mixed with it elements of their ancient language, hebrew, to create a dialect that would come to be known as yiddish.
in the spirit and vitality of their customs, in their separateness as a community, they found fulfillment.
jews everywhere shared in and stimulated the growth of christian europe.
in spain, christian armies continued to reconquer the land from its moslem rulers.
by the middle of the 12th century, thousands of spanish jews had been brought under christian rule.
their knowledge would help to save the heritage of moorish spain from the flames of destruction.
their golden age would now be kept alive in the lands of christian spain.
jewish scholars from moslem spain were welcome to this city and they made it a gateway of knowledge for europe to the north.
they became the great translators of the works of arab philosophy and science into hebrew and latin.
an age of technological advances, of mechanical clocks, water mills, and spinning wheels.
the 12th and 13th centuries exploded with creativity and a spirit of exploration.
new knowledge broke upon christian europe with the force of revelation.
the church had to face the probes and questions of philosophy and respond to them not out of faith alone, but with reasoned and philosophical argument.
church scholars turned to arab and greek and jewish philosophy, searching eagerly to infuse the doctrines of the church with the new spirit of rationalism.
thomas aquinas, the most luminous mind among the church scholastics, found in the works of maimonides, the great jewish philosopher, a means of reconciling faith with reason, and he set about constructing a philosophical stronghold to the medieval christian faith.
but in this complex era, the church was sometimes threatened with movements of revolt.
when reason and persuasion could not prevail over those who questioned its doctrines, the church began to respond with force.
feeling its position threatened on many sides, the church hardened its policy also toward the jews.
the church sought to isolate them, lest jewish beliefs draw christians away from the church, for the competition between the faiths had never really stopped.
in certain provinces, such a confusion has arisen that jews and christians cannot be distinguished.
we hereby order that the jews in every christian province shall be marked off in the eyes of the public through the character of their dress.
since the talmud is said to be the main reason the jews remain obstinate in their mistaken faith, we herewith order that on the first saturday of the lent to come, in the morning, while the jews are gathered in the synagogues,
you shall seize all the books of the jews who live in your districts.
jews felt themselves threaten as never before, threaten in their very identity, for it was the talmud that held the jewish people together from generation to generation and through all the lands of their dispersion.
in paris, the talmud was subjected to a public trial and judged guilty of defaming christians.
as jewish onlookers wept, 24 cartloads of handwritten manuscripts were burned.
but the laws and edicts of the church could not be enforced without the approval of the local rulers, and while some rulers applied the anti-jewish regulations, most did not.
their interests lay in the well-being of the jews and the prosperity they brought to their realms.
life in the castles of the middle ages would grow more luxurious as time went by and more costly.
it was a life sustained, at first, by lands and holdings and the peasants who worked those lands...
but as the need for money grew, the nobles turned to taxation- taxation of the moneylenders and taxation of the people through the moneylenders.
the people who were taxed in this manner were often those who could least afford to pay- a peasant who needed money to tide him over a bad harvest or an aristocrat who had to mortgage his lands to pay off his debts.
the jews who provided loans found themselves forced by rulers to charge ever-increasing rates.
in england, the kings had been taxing the profits of jewish moneylenders since the days of the norman conquest.
the jews had come to serve as tools of the royal treasury in raising money from local aristocrats.
by the late 12th century, many lords were unable to repay their debts to the jews.
in 1189, a group of nobles instigated riots against the jews.
kings and nobles protected the jews for a time and borrowed heavily from them in order to be able to govern.
they then taxed the jews heavily in order to recoup a part of their expenses.
the burden of this tax was passed on to the people.
as taxation grew heavy, the bourgeois of the cities and the peasants of the countryside began to rebel against both the nobles and the jews.
in 1290, edward i banished the jews of england, 16,000 in number, and confiscated their property.
they would not be allowed to return for almost 4 centuries.
16 years later, philip the fair expelled the jews of france and seized their goods.
later, they would be readmitted when it seemed profitable to the king and expelled again when he had gotten from them all he could.
only in germany, where the land was broken into countless territories, and where town governments shared in the profits of money lending, did jews remain, but in great insecurity.
the 14th century world in which thousands of jews now found themselves adrift still retained many elements of the dark ages.
for the unlearned, it was still a world ruled by magic and miracles.
people thought fireflies were the souls of infants who had died before they could be baptized and that heart attacks were the work of demons.
phenomena not otherwise accounted for were attributed to the influence of the planets or finally, to the will of god.
but in 1347, there occurred an event so terrifying, so devastating, that no explanation, not even the will of god, seemed adequate.
in october of that year, a genoese trading ship drifted into harbor at messina in sicily.
its sailors were slumped over their oars, all of them dead or dying.
on board was a terror known as the black death, the bubonic plague.
in january of 1348, infected sailors carried the plague to france via marseilles and then to north africa via tunis.
it spread westward from marseilles to spain and then northward up the rhone.
it spread to rome and florence, to paris and normandy, and then across the channel to southern england.
people would drag them out of their homes and pile them in front of the doors.
it was not uncommon to see a single bier carrying husband and wife, 2 or 3 brothers, father and son, and others besides.
the disease began as swellings in the armpits or groin that sometimes grew to be the size of eggs.
the swellings quickly spread over the entire body and turned to black and livid blotches.
it shredded every legal and human bond that held medieval society together.
in despair, people looked everywhere for an explanation, looked everywhere for a way to halt the plague, before it killed them all.
social order disintegrated, and the number of jews murdered by the mob grew steadily.
it is a dangerous platitude to say that the jews of europe were made a scapegoat.
in the course of the middle ages, the jews had come to be resented by the common people for complex religious and economic reasons.
religious resentment was born of the unfortunate competition between the jewish and the christian faiths that had started more than a thousand years before.
those in germany continued, subject to constant attacks and expulsions until they were decimated and impoverished.
only in the east of europe, in lithuania and in poland, could the jews find lands where they were protected, lands where the future offered hope.
the east was still a frontier, and settlers were needed to develop its trade and commerce.
it was here that the ashkenazim would find a home to shelter them once again.
spain had not been immune to the horrors of the black death, nor was it immune, in the aftermath of the plague, to the turmoil of social upheaval.
toward the end of the 14th century, the virus of anti-jewish attitudes born in northern europe began to make its way into the mainstream of spanish culture.
the pressure and violence became so intense that thousands of jews converted to christianity.
here and throughout spain, it was a tidal wave of conversion, and when it receded, it left behind as many as 100,000 converts whom the spanish called "the new christians."
this proud community, the sephardim, so integrated into spanish life, was suddenly torn apart.
many converted in public but continued to observe their own faith in private.
thousands were burned at the stake, but 11 years of terror and torture were unable to destroy the bonds between the converts and their jewish heritage.
the spanish inquisition now demanded a further and more radical action.
in this majestic hall of the ambassadors in the alhambra on the 31st of march 1492, the long and illustrious history of the jews of spain came to a tragic and fateful end.
it was here that king ferdinand and queen isabella, responding to the pressure of tomas de torquemada, the grand inquisitor, issued the edict of expulsion requiring all the jews of spain to convert to catholicism or to leave the country by the end of midsummer.
throughout the spring and early summer of that year, more than 150,000 refugees clogged the roads of spain, leaving behind their homes and vineyards, their workshops, their synagogues, their places of learning, their memories of triumph and of trial
in the unforgettable centuries they had lived under arab and christian rule.
and so on a certain summer day in august, in the very month that christopher columbus embarked on his voyage of discovery, the last jewish refugees set sail from spain.
the memory of that tragic moment persists, but even in that moment of despair, there were the seeds of hope, for they carried with them a legacy of faith that would sustain the jews of spain and of all europe in other lands
"given are they as signs to jacob's seed that they shall ever be.

the nearby docks and empty ferry slips speak of a time when thousands of men, women, and children arrived here each day and first set foot on american soil.
80 years ago, millions of immigrants passed through these halls and crossed the threshold to a new life in a new land.
past the statue of liberty they came, and on to ellis island, in the closing years of the 19th century.
by the thousands, by the millions, and also one by one:
the poor, the disenfranchised, the hopeful, the adventurous, the persecuted, the oppressed.
one by one, from italy, ireland, germany, and russia, and among them, nearly two million jews from eastern europe.
to the tapestry which was america, more than 100 ethnic groups would bring their special threads of color and of culture.
it was not only the size and the richness of the continent to which they came that made america different.
it was what they brought with them and how they interacted with each other that made america different.
america was a nation peopled by immigrants, a nation whose very foundations had been laid by immigrant settlers as early as the 16th century.
many of the first settlers in america had crossed the atlantic seeking a refuge from political and religious intolerance in europe.
the atlantic was a road of escape, open to anyone who could raise passage.
in 1654 a small group of portuguese jews sailing from brazil to amsterdam were blown off course and stranded without money.
23 jewish men, women, and children made their way to the dutch colony of new amsterdam, hoping to find in this place the toleration their kinsmen enjoyed in amsterdam itself.
many of america's first colonists had brought with them the prejudices of europe.
in massachusetts, the puritans forbade other forms of worship than their own.
in virginia, the anglican church was state-supported, and heresy was a crime.
but other colonies were run as commercial ventures, and anyone was welcome who could develop their land or contribute to their trade.
without the leadership and structure of a separate jewish community, they were free to set aside their jewishness if they wished, and many of them did.
and even if they wanted to remain jews, with whom could they pray or socialize or, most importantly, marry?
there were so few jews that it was almost impossible to live a jewish life in colonial america.
what kept the jewish community alive in these early years was a continuing but small infusion of new jewish immigrants from abroad.
by the 18th century, the bustling ports of the new world were a vital link in the trade routes of the british empire.
but british rule and british taxes soon came to be resented by many of the prosperous colonists.
in these quiet streets of philadelphia, a storm of protest was unleashed.
delegates from all the colonies gathered and, in july of 1776, proclaimed their defiance of british rule.
the fragile union of american forces was constantly on the verge of collapse, but it held for long enough to defeat the british.
here in this room, in 1787, delegates gathered to write a contract that would bind the states together for their mutual defense.
to bring together the diversity of interests and peoples that was america, toleration had been made a fundamental principle of american law.
in 1790, george washington visited this synagogue in newport, rhode island.
the jews, a small fraction of the population- only a few thousand in number- were fully integrated in the nation, joining even in the government of the land.
the constitution guaranteed the equal rights of all citizens, though it could not do away with their prejudices.
within 5 years, the adventurous were being advised of regular service from the eastern seaboard into the wilderness of ohio and kentucky.
the news of opportunities on the american frontier reached as far as europe.
it was the beginning of a substantial jewish presence in america.
leaving behind the close-knit jewish communities of europe, these jews discovered in the backwoods of this continent a solitary way of life unlike any they had ever known.
throughout this frontier region were thousands of remote farmsteads, hundreds of isolated settlements that had only one tie to the outside world- the itinerant peddler.
for many of the young jewish men who came to america, a horse and a cart full of goods were an early step on the road toward fortune.
on the american continent, with its frontier ways and scattered settlements, the immigrant had to take life as he found it.
he had to leave behind his old language, his old customs and experiences.
the general store frequently became the focus of a permanent settlement.
because he was an early settler, the storekeeper frequently became the sheriff or mayor or leading citizen of the town.
other jews might join him there and form a small jewish congregation.
the german jews became part and parcel of the epic opening of the american west.
jewish merchants were among many immigrants who contributed in these years to the development of a new america.
communities all over the land were under construction to keep pace with a growing population.
americans dreamed of one nation reaching from the atlantic to the pacific.
but this land full of hope and ambition was also a land deeply divided.
an intractable quarrel between north and south over slavery and states' rights was tearing the country apart.
1861... immigrants arriving at new york, atlanta, or baltimore were enlisted to fight on the battlefields of the civil war, to give their lives for a cause they barely understood.
more than half a million americans died in the civil war, more than in any other war america has ever fought.
it was at great cost that the united states were reunited.
over the next 40 years, the continent was spanned by a network of iron rails.
it was a time of brash individualism, of the discovery and exploitation of seemingly endless natural resources.
jay gould- a country store clerk from upper new york state who rose to control many of the nation's railroads.
john d. rockefeller- an oil man from cleveland whose father had been a petty tradesman.
he pumped them out and discovered, to his disappointment, that they contained little silver, but a low grade of copper ore instead.
with his 7 sons, he developed refining processes that would make that ore profitable.
in doing so, they established a foundation for the entire american copper industry.
from remote mining centers and cattle towns in the west, livestock and minerals were shipped by rail to the east.
in return came manufactured goods to fill the shelves of general stores in towns and villages throughout the nation.
as the economy grew, as towns became small cities, the jewish shopkeepers prospered.
sears, roebuck... throughout the country, most department stores were owned and created by jews.
by the 1870s, a new group of immigrants began to come from germany, attracted by the flourishing economy.
they were german jews whose families in europe were involved in finance and banking.
jewish businessmen turned to these jewish financiers for the loans and investment capital they could not easily obtain from gentile bankers.
german jewish immigrants- the loebs and kuhns and schiffs and seligmans- joint in the task of financing a nation and shared richly in the fruits of their labors.
the jews of german origin were, to all outward appearances, fully integrated in american life.
they had left behind the jewish communal life of europe to live as individuals in this new land.
but they wished to preserve the intimacy and fellowship of the past, to preserve their religious heritage.
their rabbis, all of whom were trained in europe, struggled to help them find an american expression of jewishness.
throughout america, the german jews built synagogues of great beauty, like this one, b'nai yeshurun in cincinnati.
but jews in america were not certain what the content of their judaism ought to be.
there were no central authorities to define the rules of jewish life.
all the jews wanted their synagogues to be american houses of worship, but practices varied widely from congregation to congregation.
in some synagogues, men and women were allowed to sit together so that families would not be separated.
among those who sought to bring the community together was rabbi isaac m. wise of cincinnati.
in 1873, he created a union of american hebrew congregations and, shortly thereafter, a seminary where american rabbis could be trained.
in so doing, he laid the foundations of an american jewish movement called reform.
wise had hoped to unite all american jews in a single movement, but there was too much diversity of opinion, too much disagreement.
rabbis trained at this new institution- the jewish theological seminary- would eventually establish the american movement known as conservative judaism.
whatever approach they took, the jews of this country were defining a judaism that was distinctively american.
the place of arrival for most, starting in 1892, was ellis island.
they were examined, questioned, and tagged, submitted to a process they could not understand, thousands every day.
you could arrive at ellis island with one name and leave with another, particularly if your name was hard to spell or your accent difficult for an american to understand.
you might be detained for medical or other reasons, not knowing if you would be allowed into the country.
for thousands, the crossing from ellis island to manhattan was only the first stage in a journey that took them to chicago, detroit, pittsburgh, or other american cities and towns, but many jewish immigrants landed in lower manhattan
and made their way by foot to the crowded streets of new york's lower east side.
it was congested beyond belief, racked by illness and exhaustion, impoverished beyond description.
the first thing the immigrant had to do was to find a place to live.
among those who set out to help this troubled community was the journalist abraham cahan.
in the newspaper he created, the jewish daily forward, he spoke to the people in their own language, yiddish, answering their questions, giving practical advice.
my husband deserted me and our 3 small children, leaving us in desperate need.
it breaks my heart, but i have come to the conclusion...
i read the troubles of family life in your letter column every day very attentively, but my own troubles are so great, so enormous, that i ask you right on the spot-help!
from the moment of their arrival, the immigrants looked to each other for help- first to relatives, or to townspeople from the old country.
people from the same towns formed groups known as landsmenschaften, where among their old neighbors they could find fellowship or help in times of need.
there were fraternal lodges, benevolent and free loan societies, burial societies, and, in makeshift quarters, hundreds of small orthodox congregations where immigrants came to worship and to study.
most important of all, they came to be among their old townspeople.
in small "schuls," as they were called, the orthodox traditions of eastern europe were preserved.
but many of these immigrants, like the german jews before them, found it difficult to hold to the traditional ways.
some orthodox jews believed that a new set of standards were needed in this new land, flexible standards yet faithful to the spirit of the eastern european tradition.
by 1915, a new generation of orthodox rabbis was appearing, familiar with the world of general history, literature, and science, while preserving the traditional knowledge of torah and talmud.
it was a development that would ultimately lead to the creation of yeshiva university.
out of the materials of their european past came a vigorous new expression of jewish culture.
in cafes and meeting halls of the lower east side, there were free lectures, free concerts, and, for a nickel, that marvelous escape from the wretchedness of daily life- the yiddish theatre.
to many americans, this yiddish culture was a strange and unwelcome arrival on the shores of the united states.
many jews of german origin looked askance at the immigrants from eastern europe.
jacob schiff, with others, established the henry street settlement and the educational alliance on the lower east side, where new arrivals could puzzle out the intricacies of the english language.
there were free public libraries, and public schools where, by the thousands, the children of immigrants found a path to achievement in american life.
italians, irish, scandinavians, poles, hungarians, jews- all were struggling to find their way in the new country.
in towns and villages across america, year after year, crowds gathered in celebration of the fourth of july.
they gathered to celebrate a country they knew and understood, not a land inhabited by aliens, not a land whose city streets were filled with a babble of incomprehensible tongues.
for many americans, the immigrant world seemed un-american, a danger to the old-fashioned values of american life.
since the 1880s, there had been repeated attempts to stop immigration.
but america was growing, and its appetite for new goods and the products of industry seemed insatiable.
there was no western frontier left for new immigrants to settle.
the wilderness they faced was one of slums and noise, of industry and grinding labor.
beginning in the last decades of the 19th century, workers throughout america began to organize themselves into unions.
a generation of working men and women endured bitter strikes, privation, and even violence as they struggled to gain some control over their own destiny.
it came to be known as the great revolt of 1910.
the jewish workers were joining together to demand decent working conditions, fair pay- to demand that they be accepted as americans with an equal right to secure and dignified lives.
and below, screaming and howling, thousands of laborers from surrounding factories.
eban: 175 workers lost their lives, most of them young jewish and italian women.
a groundswell of public concern would ultimately lead to laws governing the sanitary conditions and safety of the workplace, but it was not only sympathy that the immigrant workers earned in these troubled years.
out of the cloak-makers strike of 1910 came a document called the protocol of peace, an agreement unprecedented on the american scene.
drafted by louis brandeis, who would soon become the first jewish member of the united states supreme court, it established procedures of outside arbitration, a pattern that would become a model solution to all future labor conflicts in america.
meanwhile, however, american attitudes toward immigrants and all things foreign were being complicated by conflicts of greater scale far beyond america's shores.
in the fall of 1917, the bolsheviks, led by lenin, seized power.
they saw their victory as the first of a series of revolutions that would sweep the world and overthrow established governments everywhere.
its goal-to fight back the immigrants, to control the negroes, the catholics, the jews.
in this atmosphere of hatred and fear, the congress of the united states in 1924 voted to slam shut america's open door.
the mass migrations that had given the country its special character were over.
the new law was designed to halt immigration from europe's poorest regions.
for the jews in america, it was a time of confusion.
they had every reason to believe that they or their children might find success and acceptance in america, but they also had reason to fear.
there were many americans who resented the success of anyone who was not white, anglo-saxon, protestant, and in the 1920s, it seemed that intolerance might gain the upper hand.
intolerance had been growing since the last quarter of the 19th century.
successful german jews had been excluded from hotels, resorts, clubs, and private schools, but they were not content to remain silent in the face of discrimination.
by the beginning of the 20th century, they established organizations dedicated not only to the protection of their rights, but to the defense of jewish communities in other lands as well, organizations such as the american jewish committee
in the 1920s, german and east european jews alike faced a resurgence of american-style intolerance.
it was expressed through discrimination in housing and employment, through admissions quotas at universities, and through exclusion from the elite social institutions of america.
but elite society was only a small part of the american world.
25 million immigrants had come to the cities of america since 1880.
it drew on the energies, the experiences, the dreams of many people.
out of the jewish neighborhoods of new york, chicago, and dozens of other american cities came a bursting forth of talent and achievement in every phase of american life.
the jews had come to america with dreams of a new life.
they went on to reflect and to shape, in the films they made, the dreams of all america.
but the majority of the jews took other paths into the mainstream of american life.
if their fathers had been students of the talmud given to poring over the intricacies of religious law, the children took their love of study and discussion and gave it new form.
through the colleges and universities of america, they made their way into new careers in law, in medicine, in the sciences, in government, and in teaching.
the impoverished jews who had come from eastern europe had passed through the crowded slams of america's cities and, within two generations, had reached a place of distinction in american life.
it was not a uniform culture, as in england, france, poland, germany.
if you are different in america, so were many other people.
the jews were just one group among many who joined in this new world, and in the rich and diverse society of america,
jews found a kind of acceptance they had never experienced anywhere else.
the jews became an integral and creative part of american civilization.
with all others who had come to these shores, the jews had helped to shape and had themselves been shaped by the america they called "the golden land. "
joseph k., the hero of franz kafka's novel the trial, goes to his death without ever knowing what his offense might have been.
his enemy is the unbridled, irrational, emotionless power of a modern totalitarian state.
we have, in this century, too often seen this legalized nightmare occur in reality, a nightmare that we now call kafkaesque, with its street policemen, street thugs, and concentration camps, where death can become an industry of the state.
it is fitting that kafka, the prophet of this horror, shouldn't be born a jew, for the jews of europe were to experience the first half of the 20th century as a kafkaesque ordeal...
he came to symbolize not only the new intellectual order, but also the final and complete emancipation of west european jewry.
like freud, he became one of the jewish patriarchs of the modern world.
the numbers of jews in scientific, artistic, and public life increased as formal barriers against them fell away.
the steam of modernism in art and its role in the sophistication, the symbolized general license and decadence to those who needed stability and certainty in their lives.
believing in the disciplines of a vanished past, he adopted the sticks and axes of ancient roman authority as the symbol of his regime- the fasces-fascists-fascism.
it was an age without consensus, an age of extremes- individualism versus conformity, liberty versus subservience to the state.
and for the jews, inevitably caught up in this conflict, the consequences were to be tragic.
the vast majority of jews lived in eastern europe- far from the world of the few privileged
but the appearance of tradition was, to a certain extent, deceptive.
by the early thirties, there were 9.5 million jews in europe-mostly yiddish speaking.
they were increasingly secular and increasingly urban, living in the cities of poland,
lithuania, romania, and hungary- communities poor in worldly goods, but rich in vitality and diversity.
whatever road they took, the jews paid for the freedom, creativity, and prominence which some- a very few of them-achieve.
this limited success fueled traditional hatred of the jews as aliens and competitors.
in hebrew and polish, as well as in yiddish, the jewish press thrived.
there was a vigorous debate about what being jewish meant- from the traditionalists to the socialists to the zionists.
the revolution reached into every corner of life, and although it broke the walls of czarist oppression, it also directly threatened and although it broke the jewish traditions.
but the central threat to traditional jewish life in europe developed in the west, in the state with the most modern, most assimilated jewish community-
germany was now embodied in a faltering democracy- the weimar republic.
inflation and then depression destroyed the value of her people's savings and wages.
on the far right, the national socialists, the nazis, made a bid to turn all of germany's discontents to their advantage.
although the nazi platform might of been deranged it was as coherent in its way as any other political program of the day.
by appropriating and distorting all of german history, they mounted a successful appeal across the deep divisions of weimar society.
the nazi party began as a revolutionary gang, terrorizing all opponents.
a fantasy of total conformity and subjugation fed the nazis' dark dream.
all the liberal ideals of the modern world were to be cauterized, burned out, put to the flame.
the ideas in the books were to be destroyed, and all who persisted in believing in those ideas were to be destroyed as well.
dachau... a quiet community, a few miles from munich noted only for the ferocity of its local brown shirts.
it was here that the nazis set up their first concentration camp, to test the limits of their new power.
they rounded up communists and churchmen, liberals and social democrats- all who opposed them.
on the street, the nazis presented the jew as the enemy who moved all other enemies.
they used the radicalism of a few jews and the wealth of a few more as sticks with which to beat the whole community.
i didn't know what it was all about until i came to the tobacconist.
and i saw a very large crowd standing in front, yelling on top of their voices, "juden raus.
legislation denied the jews all those rights which normally only the law can guarantee.
the nazis twisted every institution of government regarded then and still seen today as vital to the protection of the citizen.
jews would be excluded completely from universities, beaches, sleeping cars and dining cars on trains, forbidden to drive private vehicles, subject to arbitrary eviction by landlords or divorce by non-jewish partners, restricted to certain shopping hours.
gradually, the modern totalitarian state was taking shape, and within it, the jew was becoming the ultimate outcast.
all this was for less than one in 100 of the population...
for there were only some 520,000 jews in a reich of 60 million.
far from being the most civilized of centuries, the twentieth had begun to reveal the terrifying effects of new technologies.
wars raged around the globe- from china and ethiopia to spain.
in such a world, it is not surprising that the jews were being left to their fate.
in the courts and on the street, the jews were constantly threatened.
from kazimierz, a suburb of the polish city of krakow, the jews were herded together across the river into the poorest sections of the town.
facing the all-encompassing power of the nazis, the jews were doubly imprisoned- held in the ghettos and surrounded by occupying armies.
millions died, but contrary to the records made by the nazis, they did not all die without protest, for despite the starvation and brutality and the unbridled power of their guards, some rebelled.
in auschwitz, in the lowest circle of hell, the special squad charged with the disposal of the dead attempted a revolt.
nevertheless, they offer witness to the strength of the human spirit, for here, too, resistance, when weapons could be found and preparations made, became rebellion.
in bialystok, in vilna, in 105 ghettos, there was armed resistance.
from the ghetto of minsk alone, 10,000 fled to reinforce the fighters in the forest.
all in all, one estimate says, as many as 40,000 jews were under arms in the east.
although these episodes had limited strategic significance, for the jews they were a crucial step away from their traditional behavior.
the responses of european jewry to this persecution had been to no avail.
the danes hid all but 477 jews in factories, in hospitals, in private homes.
over the next several nights, the jews were placed in boats, any boats, and ferried over the narrow waters to safe and neutral sweden.
the danish jews were blessed with neighbors who abhorred persecution of any kind.
others across europe also found ways of protecting their jewish neighbors.
but each life is a testament to what might be called the danish spirit.
in contrast, the governments of the unenslaved world witnessed the genocide of the jews almost in silence.
here, in oradour in central france, on the morning of the 10th of june 1944, the nazis murdered the entire population.
they shot the men and then killed 500 children and women in the village church.
for all free people, the war became something more- a crusade against a terrible evil.
beyond the usual claims of justice and right, the allies- roosevelt and churchill- argued that the nazis were an uncommon breed of evil- antihumanistic, the very antithesis of civilization.
the cost of the conflict was enormous- more than 30 million dead- the majority, civilians.
the allies ruthlessly pursued victory in response to the nazis' total war.
for the millions of soldiers, among them hundreds of thousands of jews in the allied armies, the time had come to go home.
but in europe in the summer of 1945, 11 million prisoners of war and displaced people were uncertain where home might be... none more so than the remnant of the death camps.
100,000 jewish survivors fled into the british and american occupied areas of germany from the east.
some jews tried returning to the polish cities, but within a year, there was another pogrom.
the jewries of central europe were, as the nazis had desired, very nearly wiped from the face of the earth.
and the secular yiddish culture that flourished here has disappeared forever.
the jewish presence, which had contributed to the history of these lands for more than 8 centuries, was savagely cut off.
but the nazis attacked far more than the communities of one small european ethnic minority.
they offered a grim plan for the future- a world in which doubt was forbidden, a world of absolute truths, a world of obsessive order and rigid conformity, a world without human diversity.
and they were willing to go to any lengths to achieve their purpose.
but in the end, at a cost almost too great to bear, they were defeated.
none can know the meaning of that narrow victory so well as those who witnessed the very eye of the storm.
they thought they could kill 6 million jews and go on as though the 6 million jews didn't die.
well, together with the jew, the image of man was destroyed.

but it is not for his scientific works that he is best remembered.

nebuchadnezzar, king of babylonia, destroyed jerusalem, and burned the temple- the holiest place of the jewish people and the center of their worship.
in this tragedy, the prophets of israel saw a divine purpose.
their people had violated the sacred laws of their god, and they had been punished.
but now if they returned to the ways of the law, they could win forgiveness.
through every trial they would survive, preserving their identity as a people.
they understood that upon their survival depended the survival of their revolutionary ideas about god and about the purpose of human existence.
in this place, the jews came to believe more profoundly than ever before that there was a universal dimension to their faith, that the dominion of their god extended to all lands, to all time.
and yet, in their exile, the jews still yearned for what they had lost.
for there, they that carried us away captive required of us a song.
if i forget thee, o jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
babylon the great, it was called- the center and the envy of the civilized world.
in remote regions of iraq and in mudbrick cities of morocco, there is an image today of that once great place.
in most ways, it was a nourishing climate for the jewish exiles.
portions of the great gate of babylon survive today, a gate dedicated to ishtar, queen of heaven.
its richly tiled walls covered with beasts, real and imaginary, confronted anyone who entered this city.
in this land, between the tigris and euphrates, the jews followed their familiar pursuits.
now he would be worshiped by individuals, by the people in their way of life.
they sanctified the smallest details of life, thus creating a jewish identity that would grow and develop to this very day.
their traditions defined the foods they could eat, defined the way those foods must be prepared.
they limited themselves to those that were proper according to sacred law, that were fit- the hebrew word was "kasher".
in a hundred ways- in the food they ate, in their ceremonies of purification, of circumcision, of blessing, they reinforced their separate identity.
in remaining separate, they guarded their belief in their universal god and his laws.
babylon was to remain a home of the jews for centuries.
but in the end, all its ingenious and immense constructions crumbled into desert dust.
what the jews had nurtured there- their beliefs and their unity as a people-survived.
toward the end of the sixth century, barely two generations after the jews had arrived captive in babylon,
its palace was perhaps the most beautiful building in the ancient world.
to restore order in their vast domain, the persian kings allowed exiled peoples to return home.
cuneiform records show that the imperial treasury was turned to reconstructing cities and temples throughout the empire.
in the jewish memory, the persian kings seemed the bearers of divine forgiveness.
many stayed on in what would remain the largest jewish community outside judah.
but others-the hopeful, the dedicated- headed toward the holy land, headed toward a place that had lived on in their dreams as the land of milk and honey.
home now in judah, the jews were still subject to an alien rule.
they needed something of their own which would bind them forever to their god.
he brought with him the code of law that the scholars had edited in babylon- the torah.
it is said that ezra brought the people together in solemn assembly and read them the book of the law.
within the torah, the first books of the bible, were set out the marriage customs, property laws, the ethical standards, the civil regulations, and the religious requirements of the jews.
each individual could now judge his own acts, for the sacred law was written down and available to everyone.
they were a people of poets- homer and sappho... and playwrights-
sophocles, euripides, aeschylus, aristophanes... and above all, of philosophers- socrates, plato, aristotle.
the gods the greeks served were believed to dwell beyond the mists of mount olympus.
they were capricious, as likely to loose a thunderbolt as to tune a lyre.
by the fifth century, the influence of greek culture was felt throughout the mediterranean.
the greeks were also formidable soldiers- well-disciplined, ruthless, and not reluctant to fight.
in time, they might even set a greek architrave above corinthian columns to enclose the scrolls of the torah.
so great was the hellenistic influence on the jews that their torah, the histories of their nation, their psalms, and the words of their prophets- all of these had to be translated from hebrew into greek because so many jews now spoke only greek.
many jews now lived in foreign lands throughout the hellenistic world.
over the next two centuries, large communities would develop at sardis and ephesus in asia minor, at antioch, and at alexandria in egypt.
one of the largest of all jewish communities outside judah was that of alexandria in egypt.
several hundred thousand jews lived in the great port city, a haven for all the shipping of the mediterranean.
like all greek cities, there were palaces and theaters, places for sport, for burial, for the arts... for the good life... for learning.
there was the museum, organized like a university for the study of science, literature, and the fine arts.
students came there from all over the world to hear lectures from such as euclid, the mathematician, and pythias, the geographer.
and there was a library, the trustee of 700,000 manuscripts, together representing the accumulated wisdom of most of mankind.
in alexandria, the hellenistic way of life and its intellectual concepts met the ideas of the orient- principal among which was the singular jewish concept, the profound and revolutionary belief in one god and a universal morality.
the tension created by this meeting had enormous consequences for the jews.
one of the sons, judas maccabee-the hammer- took command of the jewish resistance.
judas maccabee's command grew from a desperate band hiding wherever it could to an organized force... to an army, resolute and expert.
after 3 years in the wilderness, it was strong enough to storm jerusalem.
the maccabees defeated the troops garrisoned in jerusalem and liberated the temple.
they were supported by a conservative group who wished only to observe the strict letter of the law as defined in the torah.
the priests and their supporters became a single party known as the sadducees.
they believed that the laws of the bible were open to interpretation, open to discussion and analysis.
perhaps through them greek civilization had its greatest influence on the jews.
for they admired greek logic- the subtlety of greek thought- and they applied it to their own studies.
it was the pharisees who first proposed the resurrection of the dead and life after death as articles of faith.
in many ways, they were the first community of monastics in the mediterranean world.
the legacy of these solitaries was a vast collection of religious and theological documents now known as the dead sea scrolls.
they built in judea, as they built in all their conquered territories, as if they meant to stay.
they brought with them their impressive talents as organizers, settlers, makers of permanence.
herod never ceased trying to win the sympathy of the people.
in times of famine he even sold the crown jewels to buy grain for a starving populace.
although herod was jewish, he was never accepted by the people.
they saw him as an ally of rome, a usurper of the jewish throne.
herod took a minor anchorage and made it into a great port.
the streets of the town and its drains were flushed by the movement of the tides.
the city boasted a racetrack, an amphitheater for 20,000 people, a courthouse, a theater, and-rising above the city- a temple to augustus that could be seen far out to sea.
caesarea was cosmopolitan and elegant, but it was a city in contention between pagan and jew.
herod's construction of pagan cities in the land further fueled the people's resentment against their king.
under herod, even the priesthood of the temple in jerusalem was corrupt... the office of high priest itself was bought and sold.
the sanctuary itself, of course, was the exclusive province of the priests.
herod's temple could claim its place among the wonders of the world.
it was said that from a distance, because of the profusion of its white marble, it glittered like a snow-covered mountain.
what the temple really stood for was something herod could not comprehend, or chose not to.
understanding... this could be arrived at only through learning and the study of their sacred texts.
in the land of judea, there were many academies of holy learning.
the pharisees- the scholars and teachers- brought study to the people.
the greek ideal had been for universal education of the people.
his words would be cherished by generations of scholars to this very day.
judea in the years following king herod's death was a land beset by difficulties.
the tumultuous years of that century would be long remembered, written about, portrayed, debated.
it is in times of suffering like these that the dreams of a people become most vivid.
in judea, the hope for a god-appointed savior began to stir the populace.
they waited expectantly for the leader promised by the prophets... an anointed one, a messiah.
but the spirit of revolt in judea could not be quelled.
rebellion broke out again in the year 66 of the common era... with devastating consequences.
in the summer of the year 66, a band of revolutionaries, called sicarii, seized the fortress and massacred its garrison.
herod had built a palace complex there, well-supplied with water and fortified with masonry to withstand a siege.
the details of what later happened there are nature of conjecture, but masada's resistance made it a legend forever.
all of judea had followed masada into revolt, driven by the desperate hope for independence.
the most extreme- the zealots- fought anyone they thought might yield to roman might.
they seized the temple, and from behind its sacred walls they attacked both romans and their fellow jews.
on the ninth day of that month, on orders of the roman general, the temple was burned to the ground.
the temple, the center of the nation, the center of the faith, was turned to ashes.
systematically, the legions reduced the city, that had been so great, by fire.
they destroyed houses, meeting places, public buildings... everything but 3 of the towers that herod had built.
titus, in triumph, carried off the sacred objects of the jews- among them the holy menorah, the symbol of the people.
he had put judea in chains... he gloried in his success and proclaimed it to the roman populace with a triumphal arch.
life returned, very slowly, in modest ways, but it did return.
in the countryside of judea a scholar, jochanan ben zakkai, established a small academy.
it was a humble place, a place where teachers and scholars might gather, where the learning of the people might be preserved.
with no temple in judea, no priests, no center of worship, the task of preserving the jewish heritage fell to the scholars known as pharisees.
it was the rabbis who, in time, became the shapers of judaism, the leaders of the jews.
from the destruction of solomon's temple more than 600 years before to the roman destruction of the temple that herod had built, the jewish people had not only survived conquest, they had sanctified a body of knowledge and custom,
for now there were more jews living and working and worshipping outside of judea than there were left in the promised land.
in a sense, the dispersion strengthened the jewish people and kept judaism alive after they had once more seen their temple reduced to ashes.
it was the jews of the diaspora- congregations in north africa, far south in egypt, in greece and anatolia and in rome itself- who demonstrated the overriding and everlasting force of the word.
it was they who passed its message of a universal god and a universal moral code to the rest of mankind.

fortunately the ocean provided its bounty, which nigel would catch every day.

on the oceans of australasia, courage, strength and youth are sacrificed, sacrificed to barbarians whose only honour is atrocity.
but even as we grasp at victory, there is a cancer, an evil tumour, growing, spreading in our midst.
byline two should read "miniprod forecast increase choco ration, april 1984, from 20g to 25g per week."
(man) i confess to spreading the rumour on orders from goldstein that the war is not really with eurasia, but with eastasia.
i forged government announcements and falsified figures quoted for agricultural and industrial production.
as a result of mental disturbance dating from my experiences in the atomic wars,
it was at this time that i made contact with the resistance.
i was personally contacted by the arch-traitor goldstein and ordered to assassinate inner party officials.
and that by use of these documents my agents travelled freely throughout airstrip one, encouraging insurrection and organising a huge counterplot to destroy the innermost faction of the oceanian leadership.
furthermore, i used my position of privilege within the inner party to pervert and betray the truth at all times and to suggest, wherever possible, that our traditional allies in eastasia were, in fact, our deadly enemies...
to the past, or to the future, to an age when thought is free.
from the age of big brother, from the age of the thought police... from a dead man, greetings.
in 1976, coal output was 605 million tonnes, an increase of 4.1 per cent.
5.3 million tractors were produced, an increase of 17.6 per cent.
so the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect?
the secret is to move from translation to direct thought to automatic response.
completed returns show that the standard of living has risen by 20 per cent over the last year.
all over oceania, spontaneous demonstrations of party workers have been voicing their gratitude and joy.
(man) i accuse myself of sabotage, embezzlement of party funds, sale of military secrets, of being in the pay of the government of eurasia, of being a sexual pervert and a thought criminal.
i exploited my position at the ministry of peace to mislead our allies in eastasia, and also to corrupt youth by means of seditious literature and drugs.

when the orgasm has been finally eradicated, the last remaining obstacle to the psychological acceptance of the principles of ingsoc as applied to artsem will be overcome.
in other words, the unorthodox tendencies towards ownlife, which threaten the natural erosion of the family unit, will no longer have the biological support of the organism.
as we all know, the stimulation of the family leads to private reflection outside party needs and to the establishment of unorthodox loyalties which only lead to thoughtcrime.
(winston) it's folly, as though deliberately we move one step nearer the grave.
i can't understand why she accepted the idea, she who is so careful.
a vast military build-up has been reported in the sahara desert, sectors 17 and 18 of the war zone.
14 heavy tank divisions... (winston) there's truth and there is untruth.
that concludes the list of known agents of goldstein actively engaged in the latest conspiracy...
not much of this gets to the outer party, i'm afraid.
until now, the war has been conducted with honour and bravery, with the ideals of truth and justice in the best traditions of mankind, until this moment.
brothers and sisters, the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities which will ensue from this appalling act must, can and will be terminated.

you can see that the numbers on this dial run up to 100.
will you please remember that i have it in my power to inflict pain on you at any time, and in whatever degree i choose?
neither the past nor the present nor the future exists in its own right, winston.
reality is in the human mind, not in the individual mind, which makes mistakes and soon perishes, but in the mind of the party, which is collective and immortal.
not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain.
you will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future.
power is inflicting pain and humiliation, otherwise you cannot be sure.
power is tearing human minds apart, and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.

the forces of oceania in south india have won a glorious victory.
i am authorized to say that the war against eurasia... is within measurable distance of its end.
the improvement in sewerage and drainage systems... has resulted in better health, overall.
state rodent operatives report a 50-percent reduction... in the number of vermin in the central proletarian zones.
i just want to finish by saying a few words... about the impact of this imminent neurological breakthrough.
when the orgasm has been finally eradicated... the last remaining obstacle to the psychological acceptance... of the principles of ingsoc, as applied to artsem, will be overcome.
in other words, the unorthodox tendencies towards ownlife... which constantly threaten the natural erosion of the family unit... will no longer have the biological support of the organism.
as we all know, the biological and social stimulation of the family leads to... private reflection, outside party needs... and to the establishment of unorthodox loyalties... which can only lead to thoughtcrime.
a vast military buildup of armored divisions... missiles and floating fortresses, accompanied by a fourfold increase... in the number of radio-controlled rocket bombs... directed at the most densely populated areas of airstrip one....
it is folly... as though deliberately, we move one step nearer the grave.
i knew what i had done... and i couldn't help myself.
when i went back, hours later... my mother and sister were gone.
that concludes the list of known agents of goldstein... actively engaged in the latest conspiracy....
not much of this gets to the outer party, i'm afraid.
in the face of the thought police... they cannot act collectively.
lndividually, they cheat... forge, blackmail, corrupt children... spread disease and prostitution... in the name of spreading knowledge from generation to generation.
brothers and sisters... the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities... which will inevitably ensue from this appalling act... must, can, and will be terminated.
the forces of darkness and treasonable maggots... who collaborate with them, must, can, and will... be wiped from the face of the earth.
you know perfectly well what is the matter with you, winston.
you've known it for years, though you've fought against the knowledge.
you never tried to cure yourself of it, because you did not choose to.
it was a small effort of will, which you were not ready to make.
and then... when there is nothing left but sorrow and love of big brother... we shall lift you clean out of history.
we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
if you want a vision of the future, imagine... a boot stamping on a human face forever.
you are thinking that my face is old and tired... that while i talk of power... i'm unable to prevent the decay of my own body.
how can i do it if i don't know what it is?
in the proletarian areas, they will attack a baby... and within five minutes, strip it to the bone.
i press the first lever... and the rats move into the front compartment.
i press the second, and the door of the cage will slide up.
i deliberately contracted syphilis in order to spread the disease... to my wife and other party members.
together with other agents, i have counterfeited banknotes... wrecked industrial machinery, polluted the water supply... guided eurasian rocket bombs to targets on airstrip one... by means of coded radio signals.
a vast, strategic maneuver to outflank... the eurasian forces on the african front has been successful.
perfectly coordinated, it has resulted in the utter rout of the eurasian army.
i confess to spreading the rumor, on orders from goldstein... that the war is not really with eurasia, but with eastasia.
that, for years, in fact since the days of our glorious revolution...
it was at this time that i made contact with the resistance.
i was personally contacted by the archtraitor, goldstein... and ordered to assassinate certain inner party officials.
so the revolution will be complete when the language is perfect.
the secret's to move from translation, to direct thought, to automatic response.

(announcer)... named after sublieutenant ogilvy, hero of the state of oceania, recently awarded posthumously the order of conspicuous gallantry for his actions in the recent glorious victory over the forces of eastasia on the malabar front in south india.
i knew what i had done, and i couldn't help myself.
when i went back, hours later, my mother and sister were gone.
i forged government announcements and falsified figures... quoted for agricultural and industrial production.
as a result of mental disturbance from my experiences during the atomic wars...
i did counterfeit important party documents... including ex-london permits and travel passes.
and that by use of these documents... my agents traveled freely throughout airstrip one... encouraging insurrection and organizing a massive counterplot... to destroy the innermost faction of the oceanian leadership.
completed returns show that the standard of living... has risen by no less than 20 percent over the last year.
all over oceania there've been spontaneous demonstrations of party workers... voicing their gratitude and joy!
i accuse myself of sabotage... embezzlement of party funds... sale of military secrets... of being in the pay of the government of eurasia... of being a sexual pervert and a thoughtcriminal.
i exploited my trusted position at the ministry of peace... to mislead our allies in eastasia... and also to corrupt youth by means of seditious literature and drugs.
state rodent operatives report a 50-percent reduction... in the number of vermin in the central proletarian zones.
i just want to finish by saying a few words... about the impact of this imminent neurological breakthrough.
when the orgasm has been finally eradicated... the last remaining obstacle to the psychological acceptance... of the principles of ingsoc, as applied to artsem, will be overcome.
in other words, the unorthodox tendencies towards ownlife... which constantly threaten the natural erosion of the family unit... will no longer have the biological support of the organism.
as we all know, the biological and social stimulation of the family leads to... private reflection, outside party needs... and to the establishment of unorthodox loyalties... which can only lead to thoughtcrime.
the introduction of artsem, combined with the neutralization of the orgasm... will effectively render obsolete the family... until it becomes impossible to conceptualize.
it is folly... as though deliberately, we move one step nearer the grave.
i can't understand why she accepted the idea... she, who is so careful.
until now, the war has been conducted with honor... and bravery... with the ideals of truth and justice, in the best traditions of mankind... until this moment.
brothers and sisters... the endless catalogue of bestial atrocities... which will inevitably ensue from this appalling act... must, can, and will be terminated.
you know perfectly well what is the matter with you, winston.
you've known it for years, though you've fought against the knowledge.
you never tried to cure yourself of it, because you did not choose to.
it was a small effort of will, which you were not ready to make.
and then... when there is nothing left but sorrow and love of big brother... we shall lift you clean out of history.
we shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere.
if you want a vision of the future, imagine... a boot stamping on a human face forever.
you are thinking that my face is old and tired... that while i talk of power... i'm unable to prevent the decay of my own body.
how can i do it if i don't know what it is?
in the proletarian areas, they will attack a baby... and within five minutes, strip it to the bone.
i press the first lever... and the rats move into the front compartment.
i press the second, and the door of the cage will slide up.
i deliberately contracted syphilis in order to spread the disease... to my wife and other party members.
together with other agents, i have counterfeited banknotes... wrecked industrial machinery, polluted the water supply... guided eurasian rocket bombs to targets on airstrip one... by means of coded radio signals.
a vast, strategic maneuver to outflank... the eurasian forces on the african front has been successful.
perfectly coordinated, it has resulted in the utter rout of the eurasian army.
on the oceans of australasia, courage, strength and youth are sacrificed, sacrificed to barbarians whose only honour is atrocity.

if you sense you need a weapon or are threatened the visor goes down and the system makes the weapons available.
pat, the cooler temperatures here today certainly have not stopped people from showing up.
we're expecting people from every corner of the city here in detroit to come out and show their support for detective alex murphy.
rumor has it he is in the building preparing to come out...
alex, we're gonna upload the entire dpd database into your brain.
mayor durant is about to take to the stage and introduce detroit's newest weapon in the war on crime.
i'm actually getting word that he's ready to go right now.
i looked in his eyes and i couldn't see my husband.
and then he just shoots a man in front of our son.
there is no doubt omnicorp created a sensation but this bill is not about alex murphy.
it's about whether america's willing to give robots the authority over human lives.
this sea change we're witnessing, and it is a sea change, shows that americans don't really care if our law enforcement systems are manned or unmanned.
what they care about is efficiency and they care about safety.
if i tell you where vallon is, he'll kill my wife and kid, man.
your wife left you in 2019 after filing charges for domestic abuse.
and in so doing, you shed light on an invaluable truth.
even the police, the men and women who swore to keep us safe, they can be bribed.
how many times does detective murphy have to give his life for his country?
i sincerely hope the senate makes the right vote tomorrow so that alex murphy's sacrifices will not have been in vain.
he has been my mentor and my strength in times of difficulty on this floor.
but despite all that, i work for the state of ohio, and the safety of its citizens is my top priority.
he's never gonna be a normal man, a father, a husband.
by the time we put the other units on the street, he's just...
and have the fool wreck a scientific project of vast consequence?
and it's debatable who the fool is, if you intend to blow up this corner of the universe.
i'm not having your sluggy eggs spread all over the universe causing havoc.
nor will i allow you to destroy what was once a very beautiful planet.
and i would suggest, peri, that you wait a little before criticising my new persona.
you may well find it isn't quite as disagreeable as you think.
... this is a compass, and the way you use it is... you put in a sharpened pencil lead and you push it around and it draws a circle.
on this one, both points are metal and it's used to measure how big...
- i sure am, i just don't have an army yet.
hey, we can make an army and hold a war game during the holidays!
everyone has to bring a donation to be put in the bounty chest.
the army that claims victory, claims the chest as its spoils.
if some people keep putting sandwiches in, i don't want to win!
right, chabot, in two weeks those things will probably kill somebody!
it might be a lot smarter just to pick teams, you know?
in a real war, you pick your leader, so we should do it the same way.
you have to learn to control yourself better if you want to stay in the house.
i know, you think we're ignoring you now that there's a baby around.
he couldn't walk, so i took him home and put on a splint... and kept him in the shed for a month and then i brought him back.
i've seen him twice since then, but he won't come back to me now.
it`s residents for years,wish so much,that the city,their own,becomes a metropolis.
at the time when story begins, are big chances that belgrade becomes one of those.
belgrade for centuries represents the bridge between eastern and western civilization.
notwithstanding, one metropolis is best determined by it`s chronicals of crimes.
but he is not a hero of our story,although he was taking the breath away of belgraders with his crazy driving in a stolen white porsche in which night by night was making crazy the impotent police.
liftman was one push forward in developement of belgrade on it`s way to be a metropolis.
there is also tragicomic pavle siljak, who, by his handmade pistol, was shooting at women pass-bys which were dressed in fur.
there are numerous rapes,murders of revenge, jealousy and similar banal motives, as well as many larger and smaller heists.
but all of that would not be good enough, to make belgrade a metropolis.
for that was needed to be a king of all criminals,
sure it hurts, `cause you were laying with the sun upon you up to the 15 hours during the last summer!
moms scolds because of late returnings home were getting pera back to normal condition but was bothering him all over again, because he never could recall what was happening before.

i`ve said hundred times i dont want carnations in my dressing room!
there are no any indications that is a case of some sort of a strangler.
isn`t it strange to you, that only in last few days, has been murdered few persons, all three women?
dad, i am spiritually connected with the strangler.is it possible ?
if you love, carmen, like i do love you, encourage me in fight, i will be, the pride of yours.
-we won`t play, until we dont know, what we are playing.
we have perfect mediabusting project, and you behaving like a savage.
really it was, thinking of the new words, spiridon was roaming thru the city imagining strangling women.
this girl is prettiest, this girl, of which i`m thinking of now.
baybe, baybe, close eyes of yours , here comes the kiss.
whole life he was searching for her, whole life he was waiting for her, now he squeezing his arms around her neck and whispers:
that`s why this was his last chance, to restore his disputed reputation.
hello, devoted listeners, again you are with us on our frequent waves.
go home, and then choke your dad with that puberty madness.
- look in the morning papers tomorrow, then you will see what is puberty madness.
sense of guilt of rodoljub`s death was tearing apart inspector strahinjic.
it seemed to him , that life has no meaning anymore.
even since sex pistols and late sid vicious evil became popular trend.
as always, with delay, our pseudoavantguard rockers are offering us, their version of other people ideas.
unfortunately our audience fall to those bizarre ideas, with which kopicl and people similar to him are hiding their own artistic impotence.
"brewery" was crowded this time, everyone had great time, probably not thinking of implications.
for god sake shpeery,until when you will play with that terrible doll?
i`m sure that many girls would like to be instead of her there.
like in some trance he decides, to directly get involved in the happenings.
he is taking scissors and starting to cut letters from the newspapers.
at the beginning it seemed like he wants to compose the anonymous love letter.
but letter, started to be as letter to host of rock-o-lada, it turned to be a letter to the inspector ognjen strahinjic.
and what if, strangler with his letter just wanted to trick us?
mitrovic, dont fudge the sticks into my wheels, and let me on peace to make plan of the action.
how he will even behave when finds out that he is taken off the case?
no way.no way.in this delicate moment he must not find that out.
also is obvious, that letter has nothing to do with it.
neither are four first strangulations were announced nor murder in confectionery matches with announcement in letter.
it is obvious that letter was sent by some charlatan.-and totally made crazy poor ognjen.
-i claim, that the letter is total nonsense and no murder will happen tonight.
kissing the spiridon`s lips, from which was pouring pera`s blood, sofija realized, that her future lies in spiridon`s arms.
she could not even dream of, how much she was right.
sofija, all in her love ecstasy, could not even imagine that this night of passion is also a breaking night.
misterious paranormal string,which connected destinies of pera mitic, spiridon and inspector strahinjic, was threatening, to mix into twisted clew of crime that never can be untangled.

they had struggled for their traditions, for the right to be different.
they had believed in the possibilities of the brotherhood of man.
they hoped to live normal lives, to raise families, and to live in peace.
some had found refuge in the americas and in australia, but most looked elsewhere, to a small land with great meaning in their history- to palestine, the ancient homeland of their people.
then in the late 19th and early 20th century, this land saw the arrival of a new breed of jewish settler.
they were young and idealistic, from russia and the countries of eastern europe.
the turkish empire, an ally of germany, came under attack from allied forces.
it collapsed, and british and french troops moved into the middle east promising independence to its various regions.
palestine fell under british rule while its arab and jewish populations each waited to be given control of the land.
in 1917, britain had issued a document- the balfour declaration- promising support for a national home in palestine for the jewish people.
jewish immigration increased, in part because of the new opportunities in palestine, in part because of the worsening conditions for jews in eastern europe.
on a greater scale than ever before, the jewish community remade the land, clearing fields, draining swamps, building cities.
tel aviv was already a metropolis- and jewish immigration was fast increasing as tens of thousands arrived each year fleeing nazi power in europe.
in the middle east, france and britain had recently created new arab states-
in the thirties, there were riots and sporadic outbreaks of violence against both the jews and the british authorities.
but the conflict in palestine was about to be engulfed by a coming universal conflagration.
they continued to limit immigration severely, hoping to achieve good relations with the arab world and protect their influence in the middle east.
the jews, however, were determined to increase immigration in defiance of british authority.
there were 2,000 of us on a boat built for 400.
many of us were sick from the crowding, the conditions, and the storms.
now the hiding was useless, so we came on deck to breathe.
we knew the british would try to stop us reaching the shore, but we wanted them to know they could not break our spirit.
international pressure mounted for britain to change its policy, but to no avail.
in palestine, the jews now fought the british by all available means.
that afternoon in tel aviv, david ben-gurion, leader of the national jewish council, proclaimed the establishment of a jewish state in palestine to be called israel.
it was exactly 3 years, almost to the day, since the end of the war in europe and the overthrow of the greatest tyranny that had ever oppressed the jewish people.
for the jews, it was a miraculous transition from the deepest valley of despair to the fulfillment of their highest hopes.
but the arabs viewed the u. n. decision as a defeat.
arab irregulars from syria and lebanon, the armies of egypt and transjordan, and other arab forces crossed palestine's border in arms, rushing to occupy the vacuum created by the british withdrawal.
the jews now had to take up arms to defend their lives, along with the life of their new state.
with few weapons or supplies, but with determination and discipline, they created a civilian army.
war raged the length and breadth of the land... nowhere more fiercely than in besieged jerusalem.
for the first time in almost 2,000 years, there was a jewish state.
and in may 1949, israel took her place as a member of the united nations.
but now a great community had been created in the place which had dominated jewish history.
these jews were bound together not just in time, but also in space, in the space of this new state.
and they came-more than 500,000 in the first 3 years alone.
by 1951, the jewish population of israel had doubled to more than a million.
they came from 42 countries, many-like these yemenites- from the arab lands.
for the yemenites, it seemed a biblical promise fulfilled- to be returned to israel on the wings of an eagle- though the "eagle" turned out to be a battered dc-6.
but in israel, all these jews were to share a common destiny and a common purpose.
from morocco, jews brought the celebration of mimouna, a festival unique to that community marking the end of passover.
the variety of customs that had developed among the jews during their 2,000 years of dispersion was now brought together for the first time within the borders of a single land.
for most of those who came, israel meant more than a refuge.
israel's first prime minister, that his people would create a new and vital culture as they worked to transform the land.
he made a point of working on the land himself, demonstrating by his labor his belief in a society without privilege.
one could hardly find a revolution that goes deeper than what zionism wants to do to the life of the hebrew people.
it is to be a homeland for every jew who returns there, a homeland that provides equally for all her children.
the kibbutz, a new kind of collective settlement, was one engine of this progress.
a small number of jews left behind their professions and their experiences of urban life to join in the kibbutzim and other pioneering villages, to follow a new ideal-
when it came, israel's response to arab threats was swift and unexpectedly devastating.
in less than a week, israel was victorious- the sinai peninsula, the golan heights, the west bank of jordan under israeli control.
this was particularly true among the 2 million jews of the soviet union.
one who remembers that moment vividly is alla rossineck, who was a high-school student in moscow at the time.
for the jews of russia in 1967, the celebration of israel's victory was tentative, restrained by their own problems with the soviet authorities.
50 years under soviet rule had taken them on a journey between hope and despair.
the soviets also encouraged all the cultures of their multinational state, including a secular yiddish culture.
shloyme mikhoels was lionized as the director of the moscow yiddish theater in the thirties, where many classics of the yiddish stage were presented as authentic expressions of proletarian culture.
though the purges began almost immediately, it was not until after world war ii that stalin, fearful of disloyalty on all sides, selected the jews as a major target of his paranoia.
dozens of jewish leaders and intellectuals were murdered, including mikhoels, all on fabricated charges.
gradually the soviet union was crushing the identity of its jews.
by the 1960s, much of the physical witness of jewish life had been destroyed, as well.
it was becoming harder and harder to practice or feel as a jew, and everything to do with the past and tradition was vanishing.
i knew if i didn't record the scene now, it would soon be too late.
within the empire, jews were one of the few peoples whose culture the soviets sought to repress.
in the 1970s, as jewish awareness grew, unofficial quotas excluded jews from many posts in government, in the army, in medical and scientific institutes.
jewish education was effectively forbidden, as were more expressions of jewish culture.
those who fought this policy and caught the eyes of the world came to be called refuseniks.
some chose to reassert their jewish identity through study and worship in the land of their birth.
others chose to emigrate to any country that would welcome them.
in an astounding exodus that took less than a decade, more than half a million jews, including yuli edelstein, emigrated to israel.
if departure had been hard, the arrival was no less difficult.
there were new norms, new practices, a new language, and a new culture.
the arrival of so many immigrants in so small a country had an enormous impact.
the real cultural and social influence of this wave of immigration is still part of the future, meaning that the very question of how we manage to integrate the new immigrants, bring them to the common denominator of the israeli society,
will more or less define their influence in the coming years.
while many became at home in the streets and neighborhoods of this country, they continued to feel part of the extended jewish community.
but the ambition that moved them all was to become americans.
jews had lived in urban jewish neighborhoods like these on the lower east side, now many were leaving those places behind.
their experiences of urban life were receding into memory, into nostalgia even.
israel's conflicts with its neighbors have always aroused deep soul-searching within this community.
as one has said, "my nation is at war with my state.
israel took the west bank and gaza, with their large palestinian populations, beginning over 25 years of uneasy military occupation.
the 1987 uprising of youth in the west bank was an expression of rage and protest against that continuing occupation.
at the end of 5 decades, the dispute still continues, with the israeli response complicated by continuing territorial threats and a fear for its national security.
the memories of the wars with egypt, syria, and jordan still haunt the national consciousness...
for israel has paid the price other nations pay for security and independence.
it has its cemeteries of war dead, its day of remembrance.
in 1993, israelis and palestinians finally saw the possibility for a new beginning.
it was called the oslo agreement and hailed throughout the world.
the shock of rabin's death left deep scars on israeli society that have been slow to heal.
the peace process itself uncovered deep division among israelis and lent fuel to an intensifying debate about the very nature of israel.
politicians, religious leaders, and philosophers are wrestling with the issues and confronting what it means for israel to be a jewish state.
when you say a jewish and democratic state, what do you mean, first of all, by jewish?
do you mean that it's only a demographic conception, that nothing will not connect us to our collective memory, historical consciousness, tradition, culture?
now, you can divide, easily, society according to the amount of jewish identity that they would like to accept upon themselves.
for years, there was agreement respecting the other's way of life.
recently the number and political power of the ultra-orthodox have increased, and there have been militant demands for the state to impose a variety of rabbinic laws on its jewish citizens.
there's a crisis in terms of jewish meaning in this society.
now, in some way, this indicates something vital- that this country is looking for its soul.
here on this kibbutz in 1984, the community celebrated the harvest festival of shavuot, a celebration dating back to antiquity.
those who built the kibbutz saw it as the foundation for the new israel.
now their children are leaving, and the hopeful dream of kibbutz is fading.
the certainties of a previous generation are giving way as a different israel is born.
now at the end of the 20th century, the question is, how do you take a people that now has freedom and has affluence and give them meaning in that context?
* la la la la la la la * [children singing in hebrew]
as the jews in the united states have become more american, the meaning of jewish community has become more diffused.
children: * la la la la la la la la la la la la la *
they wanted to drink schnapps together and have herring after services and just rub shoulders with jews.
children: * la la la la la la la * [children singing in hebrew]
who you are has to be defined from the inside, not by building a wall and saying, "they're different from me,"
but by saying, "here's who i am, in the full dimensions, interacting with the world around me. "
for most, like the members of this chavurah group, experimenting and questioning in order to create a meaningful jewish path within modern culture.
in a dramatic break from tradition, women now often share with men the responsibilities of ritual.
after all, the fundamental document, the classical statement of judaism, which is the talmud, is a document in which debate and disagreement is the central organizing category.
and yet everyone's on the same page, people with diametrically opposed views, and it's 75% of the entire document.
jews everywhere have been seeking new and diverse expressions of their jewish identity.
in the great community of america, in the populous jewries of france where more than half a million jews live, in great britain with 400,000, in countries from australia to brazil,
we are, all of us, the children of history, and for the enrichment of our world, we must try, each of us, to understand our heritage, to judge it in the light of its highest values,
and to pass it on as a treasure for all mankind.
it's been hidden somewhere in the western united states by its test pilot, stringfellow hawke.
hawke has promised to return airwolf only if we can find his brother sin jin, an mia in vietnam.
we suspect archangel, deputy director of the agency that built airwolf is secretly helping hawke in return for hawke's flying airwolf on missions of national concern.
stringfellow hawke is 34, a brilliant combat pilot and a recluse since his brother's disappearance.
his only friend is dominic santini whose air service is the cover for their government work.
with hawke and santini flying as a team, at speeds rivaling the fastest jets, backed by unmatched firepower,
the simulation is controlled from the main terminal and several smaller terminals.
we installed this large screen so visitors could view the action more easily.
it's just a matter of putting performance and appearance together in a given scenario at computer speed.
the graphics computers we're making even 3 years ago were cave drawings compared to these.
what happens if you go for a hike one day and don't come back?
what happens 10 years from now, when your flying skills begin to erode?
with winchester's equipment, we can get a computer-perfect profile not only of airwolf, but of how stringfellow hawke, in his prime, flies airwolf.
some of the major-league baseball teams are using similar techniques to profile the perfect swing.
i'm not gonna take airwolf anyplace the firm can get its hands on her.
each night you can fly it away to any hiding place you choose.
yeah, but listen, you ain't on your backside yet, not by a long shot.
now, come on, give me a hand with the rest of these groceries.
the telemetry pod will record your position, speed, and so on, anywhere on the range.
i'm not going to be responsible if that thing tears off at mach 1.

i'll be outside when you're ready to fly us back to the cabin.
hawke, dr. winchester has a report he'd like you to fill out.
and we have a pretty clear idea of its capabilities, even the classified ones.
it's just a matter of putting performance and appearance together in a given scenario at computer speed.
what happens if you go for a hike one day and don't come back?

each night you can fly it away to any hiding place you choose.
and before, you used to talk about how stupid and artificial this thing is.
but when it gives you less than a perfect score, you... you act like you lost a war or somethin'.
i noticed when we were hooking up for the simulation that airwolf has a rather extensive memory.
when it goes into a combat mode, the memory clicks on.
it's a fact the word "florida" comes from okefenokee indians and means "place where the old people come to sweat".
sam, did you see the lady there in the green dress?
i think it's best. lt eliminates that awkward first meeting at the altar.
coach, that is the most romantic thing i have ever heard in this bar.
ernie wants to take me to dinner at his favourite restaurant.
you and i have had dinner together every night this week.
it's a fact the word "florida" comes from okefenokee indians and means "place where the old people come to sweat".
sam, did you see the lady there in the green dress?
i think it's best. lt eliminates that awkward first meeting at the altar.
coach, that is the most romantic thing i have ever heard in this bar.
only if you want me to know what you're talking about.
sorry, that was my cute way of inviting you to an evening of romance.
if you change your mind, there'll be a moonbeam with our name on it.
ernie wants to take me to dinner at his favourite restaurant.
well, ms. hammond, i think you'll find that we're trying to cooperate fully with you in this matter.
mr. horn, our client is suing the school because he graduated but he can't read or write.
we have at least 10% of our teachers absent again today, and we're having trouble finding subs.
scrape the bottom of the barrel if you have to, grace, please.
i'm in the middle of a fund-raising breakfast and i'm informed that your school psychologist has flipped out in the middle of your goddamn office.
and then i get here and i find out there has been a stabbing.
all right, i've asked alan lewis, our attorney, to be here to help us on this matter.
first of all, i wanna know who is on our team, and i wanna know who is going to rock the boat.
he reads at a sixth-grade level and he's majoring in detention.
now, don't you think that's just a little bit more important?
it's very important to mrs. pilikian that we first settle this custody problem.
now, she hasn't been able to function in full capacity since the divorce.
and a juvenile hall will just send him right back here.
nobody would want us to let that kid loose on society.
it's not like that kid was chewing bubble gum or something.
look, this is the first time i've gotten to this kid.
well, you haven't lived until you taste one of my tacos.
one taste and you're gonna agree, i should've taught home ec instead of mrs. badie.
i'm gonna ask the questions and you're gonna have to give me the answers.
i know what's going on in that school and i'm gonna change it with or without you.
what we're talking about here, literally, is the future of the school.
they're gonna try to prove that john calvin was knowingly promoted when in fact he should've failed.
now, i feel confident that we have effectively stalled their access to the school records.
however... it would be most beneficial if neither of you had any personal records.
wait a minute, mrs. pilikian, now, i'm not flunking your son.
the problem here is your getting eddie to take over the reading class that he's already taken.
mr. rubell said that he doesn't have to take the reading class again.
well, wait a minute, if he doesn't have to take the course again, why...
god damn it, alex, what the hell do you want me to do?
i am not wasting what little time and money i've got on one kid.
i'm trying to talk to them, but they won't take it seriously.
that's why it's very important that everyone be at that meeting.
so, we just check the profit and loss column to see what's right?
don't get involved, settle the case, collect our check because we're just a business?
do you think that this is proper conduct for a teacher?
well, it's a hell of a lot better conduct than the teacher that got her pregnant.
oh, hell no, that's the last thing that this would be about.
we're afraid of what old alex is gonna say at his deposition today.
some schoolteacher knocked up a 16-year-old girl, and i took her to get an abortion.
now, if i don't resign, they're gonna nail my ass to the wall.
you're the one who's afraid to drop your shields, because if you did you know you'd have to take the risk of staying and fighting.
you're the one who's afraid to walk naked down the hall.
there's a whole room full of kids in there, and they care!
and there's a hell of a lot more where they come from.
well, ms. hammond, i think you'll find that we're trying to cooperate fully with you in this matter.
mr. horn, our client is suing the school because he graduated but he can't read or write.
we have at least 10% of our teachers absent again today, and we're having trouble finding subs.
scrape the bottom of the barrel if you have to, grace, please.
oh, god, i'd have given anything to have been there to see that.
can you just imagine his face? i tell you, alex, it's never dull around here on mondays.
today we're gonna delve into the fascinating world of radiator repair.
oh, we're supposed to be learning about social studies, not radiators.
now, these are our three minutes and we will get it.
and if we were a private school then we wouldn't have to depend on a bond issue for our salary.
i mean, just what the hell are you guys running here, a goddamn zoo?
i'm in the middle of a fund-raising breakfast and i'm informed that your school psychologist has flipped out in the middle of your goddamn office.
and then i get here and i find out there has been a stabbing.
and if that's not enough, one of your kids tries to eat one of your goddamn teachers.
first of all, i wanna know who is on our team, and i wanna know who is going to rock the boat.
and most importantly, we all have to agree on what's to be said at these depositions.
he reads at a sixth-grade level and he's majoring in detention.
now, don't you think that's just a little bit more important?
it's very important to mrs. pilikian that we first settle this custody problem.
now, she hasn't been able to function in full capacity since the divorce.
but you just got kicked out of your social studies class.
so, i'll give you a choice, you can take my class or you can take study hall.
i mean, a boy goes all the way through a school system and gets passing grades and a diploma and still can't read or write.
this boy was one of your students and he can't even fill out a job application.
words of wisdom from a guy who hides out in bathrooms.
you know, lisa, there's nothing worse than a female lawyer with a cause.
the parents and the system, they've so fucked up this kid that i don't know.
i don't think i'm ever gonna be able to reach him.
so don't pull some of that mr. chips crap with me!
your job is to get them through this school and keep them out of trouble.
they all have ideas, but nobody wants to pay the price.
now, you're asking some teachers to stick their necks out and they know they're gonna get chopped.
i don't know if i even really care, but i'll tell you this.
i'm gonna ask the questions and you're gonna have to give me the answers.
row! what we're talking about here, literally, is the future of the school.
they're gonna try to prove that john calvin was knowingly promoted when in fact he should've failed.
now, i feel confident that we have effectively stalled their access to the school records.
however, it would be most beneficial if neither of you had any personal records.
wait a minute, mrs. pilikian, now, i'm not flunking your son.
the problem here is your getting eddie to take over the reading class that he's already taken.
mr. rubell said that he doesn't have to take the reading class again.
well, wait a minute, if he doesn't have to take the course again, why...
i am not wasting what little time and money i've got on one kid.
for every eddie pilikian, there are 50, 100 kids who learn here and learn well.
i'm trying to talk to them, but they won't take it seriously.
that's why it's very important that everyone be at that meeting.
yeah, i thought you might want to know that we've reached a settlement with jfk.
the school district has agreed to pay the calvins $150,000 with a non-admission of guilt.
like anybody else, we make a profit, hopefully more than most.
so, we just check the profit and loss column to see what's right?
don't get involved, settle the case, collect our check because we're just a business?
well, what do we tell all those children who have to attend that school and others like them that aren't gonna learn?
no, no, no, wait a minute, now, listen to me, really, really.
this kid has beaten up everybody in the neighborhood, and i wanted him bad.
you know, this isn't about a 16-year-old girl that got pregnant.
oh, hell no, that's the last thing that this would be about.
oh, for christ's sake, burke, what do you think, that's gonna stop me?
a disgruntled former employee, who was fired, connected with sexual misconduct.
and there's a hell of a lot more where they come from.
they need you, and you need them, but you just pretend it isn't real so you have an excuse to walk away.
i want to make sure l`m passing it into good hands.
dad i am making something of my life l`m doing something worthwhile.
you come walking in here looking like yesterday`s bad news with a goat in your arms.
you want me to believe you have a handle on life?
somehow when we were transplanting him out in the desert transplanting them?
there this herd of five hundred goats on an island off the coast.
his mother not living there`s nobody to look after the boy i can`t believe his father hasn`t hired somebody to look after him
according to roberto there`s been two dozen but they all quit two days later.
maybe he works so hard so he doesn`t have to think about her.
he has a lot of pain inside, he doesn`t want to deal with.
don't tell me i managed to fool the navy's best attorney!
i've come to visit you because today the admiralty will sign your assignment.
a few days ago you were in fits for that duel i told you we would never allow.
and now you see la nación had to take its words back.
next day a storm broke off and i lost sight of the rest of the ships.
captain, your words were "i was exposed to a severe storm and i lost contact with the rest of the fleet".
according to admiral de solier, commander of the fleet, there were over 100 men.
i was the last one to leave the ship, after all embarked.
although there was a critical moment when the first boat was destroyed after a shock of the ocean.
the men were distributed between the other boats and the raft and it all went back to normal.
well, just one, when a black sailor tried to get on the officer's boat but lieutenant victorica prevented it.
according to a testimony a black sailor attempted to board the officer's boat but was prevented by an officer.
you'll see we're not responsible for the wreckage but those sitting behind great desks full of medals.
the rosales, like it or not, sir, sunk because it wasn't repaired after the collision with the "spencer" ship.
i require attention and imagination to follow the course of events which led to the tragic loss of our navy's ship, the corvette rosales.
the interrogatory research carried out by this prosecution have come to the following conclusion, which chronologically are:
gentlemen, i have kept from the beginning three essential points in which i shall base my trial against the officers responsible for the sinking of the rosales.
yesterday i demonstrated that the incompetence of captain funes was the main cause for the wreckage.
as a consequence then of what i have just described and of the evidence of this acts i conclude that captain leopoido funes is guilty of having lost the ship through his incompetence,
abandoning his crew, choosing the fittest and strongest men to include them on his boat for the safeguard
i demand that he, captain leopoldo funes, be sentenced to the death penalty.
for being guilty of complicity in these crimes i demand that lieutenant jorge victorica be sentenced to a dishonorable discharge and to have 10 years in prison.
for being equally guilty of complicity i demand that the rest of the officers and subordinates who survived the wreckage be sentenced to separate them from their ranks with no exception.
there are no soldiers in navy who can bring dishonor to it!
gentleman, we can't make the officers responsible and victims of the irresponsibility of the institution
when it is the institution who should take care of its officers!
we must no allow wrath to carry us away, but we must never assign vessels for missions to which they haven't been constructed and that there never again should be an inexperienced crew who know nothing of the sea!
mr. president, i ask that all officers of the rosales be returned to freedom and to our fatherland.
considering the lack of formal evidence supporting the accusations stated by the prosecution this court, by its own right, definitely acquits each and every officer who survived the corvette rosales.
officers, as a consequence of this verdict, you can proclaim to the world that you're worth of walking the decks of our ships under the glorious shadow of our national flag.
i can see that you're gripped with passion, but shouldn't you... change into something more appropriate?
- i have a quick bone to pick with my manager.
i mean, did he try to harm you in any way?
no, but still, i want to try to find out who sent him.
i doubt if i'll be able to stay awake through the shrimp cocktail.
all you have to do is show your pearly whites... say a few words and look as if you're interested.
we've been working with the police on it since we first noticed a pattern.
we'd be more than happy to find a hotel for you to stay in for a couple of days.
i'm not at all convinced that analyzing gregory peck's harpooning technique... set quite the proper tone for the evening.
well, it was a hell of a lot better than john barrymore's, i must say.
for her own safety, we're going to keep this tragic young woman under 72-hour hold.
and, if we can help her cope with her inner torments, so much the better.
hey, i want that racket stopped, and i want it stopped now!
i don't have to put up with this, and i won't!
- you know, holt... you are ripe for a class action suit.
we could prove in a minute that you represent a clear and present danger.
mr. steele and i are professionals, and we're very good at our jobs.
as a matter of fact, you're safer around here because of me.
are you sure all you're concerned about is the safety of the neighbors?
fill this out completely, and be sure to sign the last page.
i've seen the bank the management company sends the rent checks to.
i've seen the real estate firm that employs the bank to process the checks.
are you telling me that you just sat here all afternoon... and got the same information that i scratched and clawed...
- and banged my head against every wall in the city for?
- first of all, this cecil cosgrove character... may have been convicted of embezzling... but the missing money hasn't seen the light of day yet.
now, on top of that, there are rumors that econocon oil... may be the guilty party, and not your mr. cosgrove.
they run a subsidiary into the ground, end up making a profit... and usually get away with it.
perhaps we should try something like that around here and opt for an early retirement?
oh, they tried so hard not to yawn in my face.
so, i moved down here, to the creative community... hoping to find friends.
we all owe you and mr. steele here... a great deal, laura, including a giant apology.
that go for mr. bartholomew, or did he plan to abstain from this little peace party?
besides, the media exposure will do the agency a lot of good.
i can see that you're gripped with passion, but shouldn't you... change into something more appropriate?
i just want to know why you let someone into my loft without first telling me.
i don't particularly enjoy coming home to find a strange man lurking in my bedroom.
frankly, this is the kind of thing we like to keep under wraps... but there's been a rash of burglaries in your neighborhood recently.
we've been working with the police on it since we first noticed a pattern.
i've waited more than two and a half years to find those papers.
i must say, all in all, i thought the evening went quite well.
did it ever occur to you that mr. steele and i... might be just as innocent as you are?
mr. steele and i are professionals, and we're very good at our jobs.
yes, well, we seem to have asked that question frequently in the last 24 hours.
listen, my solitary firefighter, what are you trying to prove coming in here?
leading a drive to get miss holt out of this building.
are you sure all you're concerned about is the safety of the neighbors?
i've seen the real estate firm that employs the bank to process the checks.
i've seen the holding company that hired the real estate firm to employ the bank.
miss hapley, would you pull the file on 80010th street and bring it in, please?
- i assume this has something to do with the fire.
well, he obviously hid the stolen money in his old warehouse... paid his dues behind bars and then, uh, came back to claim his unjust reward.
do you really think he'd hide a million dollars in the walls and then burn the building?
okay, i think i might have found something in the morgue.
okay, i think i might have found something in the morgue.
a corporation needs a huge tax loss... so they do a little decorating on the books.
they run a subsidiary into the ground, end up making a profit... and usually get away with it.
i got tired of seeing that glazed look in everybody's eye when i told them what i did.
oh, they tried so hard not to yawn in my face.
i would like to know how silly this okland looks now.
if you dare do something against this family from germany, it has certain consequences for you.
by the way, professor gunström is in good hands with us.
it is probably futile to ask whether you have something to do with his condition?
rest assured, mr. okland, i will always remember your intelligence service with great respect.
- it's just that, in your circumstances... we lack the financial resources.
on behalf of my government, mrs. pacard, i ask you, to leave us your old clothes.
after examining and cleaning... we'll send them back to you of course.
these crazy radio messages have already enticed too many of my colleagues to the hotel.
oh, by the way, your escape from the drilling platform was brilliantly planned.
by the way, professor gunström is in good hands with us.
it is probably futile to ask whether you have something to do with his condition?
rest assured, mr. okland, i will always remember your intelligence service with great respect.
- it's just that, in your circumstances... we lack the financial resources.
come on the 24th at 3 pm... to the four seasons hotel in munich, and make yourself available.
your mother will then be released immediately." mom is in munich!
because i'm afraid that you and your son have the notion to commit foolishness.
your foray into the opposition halfway pleases pleases me a lot and not at all.
oh, by the way, your escape from the drilling platform was brilliantly planned.
it took us a rather long time before we saw through your trick.
i hope it is stronger than your customary resolve in battle?
-don't question my strength or the strength of this frame, megatron.
you check out the mysterious energy readings in those ruins, and when you get back...
-we'll let you play "kick the can" with what's left of megatron, and his merry machines.
i can make their drinks too strong so they get sick.
or i can water them down so they pay for nothing.
or if i don't like their attitudes, i can spit in it.
you're not still upset about that argument we had the other day?
it's against my beliefs to help things go smoothly with the squawk box there, but since coach is involved, i'm gonna bend the rules.
i know he has a crush on a teller at his bank.
well, i've thought a lot about your situation, and i've decided to take your case.
and based on what you've told me, i think we can win.
tom, i'm standing in front of the superior court building at downtown los angeles, where an anxious crowd is awaiting the arrival of the brodsky family for the opening day of testimony in this unprecedented child emancipation case.
casey brodsky, a fourth grade student at mann elementary school in west los angeles, is attempting to divorce her parents,
divorcing one's parents is legally referred to as the emancipation of minors act.
now basically, this act says that any minor in the state of california can be divorced from his or her parents if that minor can prove that the emancipation is in their own best interest.
and that, of course, is what this trial is all about.
ms. brodsky, is it true you were served your daughter's divorce papers while appearing on the merv griffin show?
now the proceedings are about to begin here at the county courthouse.
however, we are awaiting the arrival of the plaintiffs father, film director albert brodsky.
- well, his name is dennis brinkerhoff, but everybody calls him bink.
he's great, but he has this thing about his car-- no food or hitchhikers allowed.
you'll find an esso station on the north side of the highway at approximately 2300 hours, if you're still on course.
booked you a room in my name at the ho jo's in culver.
but i was the only one bink trusted with his car.
i just didn't want you to think i was a nut or anything.
they never do what they really want, and give themselves diseases.
and you know something else that really bothers me, as long as we're having this discussion?
and then, when you go to rebecca's house, you haven't really seen rebecca yet, you know?
also, i don't know if i'd mention why rebecca's coming home.
we worked that afternoon and the next afternoon and the next... and the next.
finally, albert just came out and asked me to write with him.
the child emancipation case of brodsky versus brodsky and brodsky closed its second week of testimony today.
sources close to lucy van patten brodsky say that monday's testimony will include the name that everyone familiar with this case has been waiting for.
i was driving around, thinking, and i stopped to get a coke at this hot dog stand, and there was a girl there.
i took one look at her, and i knew she was gabrielle.
albert felt if blake moved in with us, we could work with her day and night and transform her into gabrielle.
frankly, i wanted to transform her into an apartment down the street.
but i thought maybe albert was right, and i owed it to him to give it a try.
you see, unconsciously, gabrielle knows that when henri paints her and his brush strokes the canvas, in his mind, he's actually stroking her flesh, which he knows he can't do, and that frustrates him and excites her.
you're going to tell me this is blake's fault again, right?
albert, you have to admit ever since she came into our lives--
my dad and blake got real rich and moved into a mansion in beverly hills.
my mom didn't want to have anything to do with my dad.
daddy, i've been awful mean to you, and i'm sorry, real honest sorry.
well, i've been mean to you, too, kitten, and i'm sorry.
brodsky collapsed in his bel air home and was rushed to wilshire memorial.
the 38 year-old film director achieved notoriety with his first film, an american romance, but was best known for his disastrous
from that moment on, things got worse and worse, especially for me.
my mom refused to have anything to do with my dad.
daddy, you know, for a long time, you didn't talk to me so much because you were always so busy.
and now it's like you want me to be your best friend or something.
i realized today i don't even know my own daughter anymore.
gee, maybe you should have thought about all of this when you were lighting sarah bernhardt's cigarette.
i should get one of those armed guards to live in.
i keep getting these weird letters from people all over the country.
no, you were too busy getting me drunk so you could screw me and ask for a job, weren't you?
how about dealing with the fact that your 9-year-old daughter would rather sleep at the maid's than in the same house with you?
this child isn't going to know she has a father after today.
take a good look, because she's out of your life forever.
and please, don't switch custody around or anything, because that won't help.
i want you to know i don't expect my mom to be a person who vacuums all day, bakes cookies for me when i get home from school.
and i don't expect my dad to be some kind of real understanding person, puts me on his knee, wants to take me fishing all the time.
but my mom and dad are just too mixed up for anybody to be around.
i'm just a kid, and i don't know what i'm doing sometimes.
but i think you should know better when you're all grown up.
i think you should know how to act, how to treat people.
i think if you once loved someone enough to marry them, you should at least be nice to them, even if you don't love them anymore.
you know, when you have a dog, sometimes you forget he's there.
then when you get lonely, suddenly you remember him, and you remember how cute he is and stuff, and you kiss him a lot.
well, i've thought a lot about your situation, and i've decided to take your case.
and based on what you've told me, i think we can win.

the one i will rememberthe most, happened when everything was at it's worst, and all seemed lost, during my darkest days, in 1941
despite the rumors, the british government maintains that they will still strive to support hong kong
the statement was made earliertoday in response to mounting fear over the ongoing war against germany and japan
the hms prince of wales and the hms repulse have been dispatched to the far east to further boost confidence in the region
while men in the military or government service are required to stay in hong kong their families have been forced to evacuate, overthe months that this has been going on, several female group have mounted protests, unhappy at having to leave their loved ones behind
the next evacuation party is due to leave for australia tomorrow at 10 am

come on it's only singing it's not like you're selling yourself i might as be in a place like that, it's disgraceful well what the hell am i going to tell the customers shhhh-keep it down, my nephew might hear us
must keep moving, gotta keep moving, must keep moving right on
come on, faster, you're here to work come on, move it
well maybe they're still trying to get to know each other i rememberwhen our parents introduced us, we didn't know what to say to each other
why don't they understand, we don't have anything in common at all
my father's name was chung shin, he owned a rice granary
on the day he wanted to match paul and me up, he had also arranged to hoard the supply of rice, violating the price control legislation, then he laid off the workers without pay
go on, get out of here not a chance, not without our money
what my father hadn't expect, was that his decision would ultimately draw kong,
if you'll accept my friendship, i'll give you all this rice
you're pretty brave mister, maybe we'll just take it from you
and that's australia we can go to both if you want
as it turned out we couldn't have pick a worse day to leave
it's alright everyone, i've got everything under control, this way, come on.
this way kong, kong, they've gone crazy, let's get back to the palace where-it's safe
rememberwhat we said, we'll stick together always no matter what happens through thick and thin
calm down anna, listen he's going to be alright i promise you kong's going to be alright
hey kid, don't do that, go to the church there's rice there
but daddy said that we should never beg from the japanese
i meant to tell you about it, but, i was thinking of how to earn a living
that's why i'm leaving for yuen long to sell these clothes
and you know the japs they only want the cream of the crop
well now, i can't give them our locals here, and since you're a stranger in our little town
and my very favorite song of all, was the barefooted monk song
it's been quiet a long time since i've sang that old song
well, i remember you old scum, you bird brain, you forgot to wear your sandals again, as again
don't need them, while i walk, all i need are just my stocks, just my stocks
sleeping like a baby i managed to get some more rice
should last a while these are to help kong get better
kong neverwas able to buy his old house back, but he lived a happy life in the years that followed
now just a memory, like the dawn, overwhelmed by the strong morning sun
"the british government reassures that they will not give up hong kong.
the locals express their gratitude for the welcoming news from england.
in other news, several expatriate women groups have mounted a protest against the hong kong government for its way of evacuating families of the british military personnel and government employees.
they believe that forcing women and children to leave hong kong and leaving their men behind are inhuman acts.
another group is scheduled to leave for australia tomorrow by ship..."
it's only singing, not as if you have to sell yourself!
so i have to rely on foreigners, someone strong like you...
i want you to see how we treat those who try to run away.
my sweet jesus, we pray once more for ed and jack biddle.
hear my plea for your lost lambs, father suffering injustice at the hands of evil, unrighteous men.
there's a vision that i have of them taking us out to hang.
and they take jack up first so i have to watch.
when the sun came up this morning i felt very good, like a man reborn.
you are a living flower filled with light and i'm a dying one.
i knew a man in ohio pen who sawed through the bars on his cell.
he held them in place with candle wax so no one knew until he flew the coop.
jack and me could do the same if we had saws.
if you agree to this hold your hand over your heart wherever you are, and pledge to do it.
"...and the governor lay down, you see, i have to carry out."
all i know is those boys are guilty and deserve to die.
well, money, and to be the man who got the biddles.
look i'm gonna knock you out but don't make any noise like you're hurt or nothing.
"...day or night, 'cause in the sky you can see the sun.
"and at night, you can see the moon and the stars.
the two men in their mid 20s, and the woman, 35...
now, wait a minute now, i think i did see them.
you know, ma'am, you once ruined an important program of mine.
i had a pass to see the biddles hanged last winter.
do you understand how hard your sister works to take care of you and me and your poor mama?
and when you do something that's disruptive and wrong you have to be punished, don't you?
they can always find something to blame on an honest fellow like me.
you'll be pleased to hear i went to church four times when i was out.
and asking the lord for guidance the judge gave them their sentence.
but, mama, the biddles committed 90 robberies in 90 days and never hurt one citizen.
you've got one big imagination that will get you into a lot of trouble.
yes, i'm afraid the devil is winning the battle for my soul.
"i join other christian men and women in this great city...
"...in urging you to grant the biddles' case an official review."
he held them in place with candle wax so no one knew until he flew the coop.
jack and me could do the same if we had saws.
you'll play with jeannie and i'll see you in a few days.
eddie i want you to let clarence sit next to you in the cab.
do you know the other day a woman stopped me in the street to tell me that i was as good as a murderer?
as if i were the judge, the jury and the executioner all in one.
it belonged to my oldest girl, charlotte when she was young.
now she's had five babies and she's big as a barn.
let me introduce the superintendent of prisons mr. coates and the district attorney, mr. robinson.
you know, ma'am, you once ruined an important program of mine.
i'm really not eager to talk to cops who have a chip on their shoulders... stereotype women from rape centers and then go to any length to avoid them.
i'm sure you don't care for those kinds of cops either.
so far, the victims have all been women linked to unusual or aberrant sexual activity.
we recommend, however, that all women exercise extreme caution... until this killer is apprehended.
beryl thibodeaux talked to the mayor about you, and he called me.
he said if i don't come up with something soon, he's gonna start shitting all over me.
luther said he found minute glass fragments on them just like the fragments on the doll.
he also found a barley residue he says resembles the smudge marks on the carpet.
well, start checking the blood type o's, and then we'll work our way from there.
isn't it possible she could have got them from someone else?
i'm really not eager to talk to cops who have a chip on their shoulders stereotype women from rape centers and then go to any length to avoid them.
i'm sure you don't care for those kinds of cops either.
check out all sexual arrests in the town for the last two weeks.
that goes for somebody who's been humping sheep to some guy who's swinging his dick.
yes, we believe that the murders were committed by the same killer.
so far, the victims have all been women linked to unusual or aberrant sexual activity.
well, the hot-tub guy says she came down here and you beat her up.
do i look like the kind of guy who'd do something like that?
i mean, i'm not sure yet you're ready to run this task force.
beryl thibodeaux talked to the mayor about you, and he called me.
the killer's a caucasian, blood type o about in his mid-40s.

yeah, and then they wholesale them out to car dealers and auto parts stores, right?
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.

you just back off, be a good little worker, and nobody gets hurt.

we either get our truck back, or we bury you underneath this store.
forgive me for not laughing... but i always find the baby's first step... to be a very serious thing.
all right, i don't know what your game is... but we want that truck back.

if the system is going to be closed like this, he will commit his seventh and last murder in halle... in ten to fifteen days.
does that mean we can stop now you've found what you wanted?
just minding' my own business when the new sheriff rides into town.
he walks into that saloon, pulls out his six-shooter, and he says, "i'm gonna clean up this mess."
and i believe he will, 'cause he's got the fastest draw i ever did see.
how did i get involved with a couple of assholes like you?
i can think of things i'd rather do than attend the autopsy on the little girl.
[ therapist ] but it's part of the routine, mr. fisher, isn't it?
after you left, he told me not to let anybody in,
- [ knocking ] - but just now i heard him arguing with somebody.
harry grey doesn't exist anymore, and the lotto murders are a closed book.
those murders were ritualistic, bizarre, the fruit of a sick brain, maniac.
[ fisher ] i found this girl cut up in innenstadt harbor.
innenstadt is on the square too, right here in the middle.
it's a surveillance report on an innocent little trip... that harry grey took years before the lotto murders.
[ fisher ] if you'd read "the element of crime, " you'd know.
it is, if you like, a psychological identification that enables a policeman, through his own mind, to work his way into the unknown activities of the criminal-- to work his way into the crime in question.
[ man on tv ] that's a dangerous way of reaching understanding.
[ osborne on tv ] we always run the risk of being corrupted.
the morality of the police is no different from that of society.

and by treating the nasal passages i can dispel psychical disturbances as thoroughly as physical ones - anxiety no less than migraines.
i'm saying suppose it's the invariable cause... the single origin of every trauma?
probably...how unfair it was... for a person's good fortune to be threatened...by their very happiness.
i mean dolphie having a second baby so soon after the first one.
if there was an overnight cure, they'd be sure to damn it out of hand.

i am as convinced as you are that we must frankly reveal the sexual origins of neurosis in a good many cases - most, if you will.
but we have only a rudimentary idea of the mechanism of repression in such instances.
fliess has no special title to acceptance other than his work.
his father was a merchant, none too successful - a provincial jew come to the city to make his fortune and failing, just like mine.

but one thing i'm sure of - there are two distinct responses to such an event.
a hysteria, which develops from a passive submission to a pre-pubertal incident, a sexual advance of some kind.

apropos your earlier question... it may well be possible to prevent repeated pregnancies without substituting a glass of water.
i've been working on a theory of dual periodicity in sexual and emotional life.
not only the 28-day cycle in the female but a 23-day cycle in the male.
it's at an early stage, but i'm convinced that intercourse can be perfectly safe at certain stages of the cycle, provided the dates are carefully observed.
you had to go and send him on a sea voyage.
no doubt you resent my having deprived you of a patient!
oh, you don't trust me, you don't trust fliess and worst of all, you don't trust yourself!
my dear sigmund, with regard to our unhappy meeting the other day,
and don't let martha monopolize the lady or we shall have invited her in vain.
sigmund... ..are you advising me to pursue an arrangement with a patient of yours who's still undergoing treatment?
and left directly for berlin, without waiting to observe the effects?
is it true that one of his patients had her nose entirely rotted away with a cocaine necrosis?
dear friend, if martha has a boy... we shall call him wilhelm.
if a girl, i've been thinking - of the women in my dream, i already have a martha and a mathilde, named after breuer's wife.

my name is jack harm my dad is the sheriff, i apologise for my friend.
l`ll have charlie call you as soon as he comes back.

l`ve spoken to him a few times, he always seems nice enough, why?
i don`t know, something he said to me today about charlie`s drinking.
well a town this size you think everybody would know what everybody did.
we are small town folk, we don`t poke into other people`s business.
let me ask you something did dad ever talk to you about his work at all?
no, not really he didn`t want me following in his footsteps.
let me go and get my stuff we`ve got to go and tell mum.
looks like a hurricane all of a sudden, l`ve never seen anything like it.
hey jonathan, we`ve got to go and talk to bubba and find out where he saw charlie.
i can`t believe that by scaring the wits out of us, you have known for a while.
don`t worry you said all the planes are in perfect shape.
well if that plane didn`t go down we`d all still be in clover.
i took little arnie`s share of the money and stuck it in his dresser drawer.
they`re going to wonder where a gas station attendant got a hold of $40,000 in cash.
you know what l`m talking about, l`m talking about killing a man for money.
the money you have buried under the floor of the shed behind the general store.
fishing for a vacation in the stream, there is a world out there and l`m going to see it
you let me go, i swear to god l`ll kill you.
i want to be, i want to stop people from doing stuff that kills other people.
i do not want other kids to feel the way i do.
we do not shed our skin until we have six years.

i just got a, very strange phone call from some n r c guy, he said it was urgent.
he said, tell bosch, he's got the reverend on the video, in the n r c control room.
so he will not want for a roof over his head.

mattis is and remains the strongest robber-chief in all mountains and forests.
now i've watched out for everything except falling in the 'hellmouth'.

-to think that things can turn out so wrong so unnecessarily.
otherwise i would have made you my second a long time ago.
and it gives me great grief that i will disfigure your face.
mattis is and remains the strongest robber-chief in all mountains and forests.
borka, you will still remain chief in name as well as in honour but from now on my word will be the law, you understand that.
fine by me, but it will be a relief not to have to see his curly head every day.

addicts need their daily fix and to give it to her, and it's just my supposition,
corrado must have had contact with those in the drug trade.
and perhaps unwittingly, he found himself mixed up in the squalid world of traffickers.

this is a humanitarian mission which has at heart the interests of miss pecci scialoia.
her family wants to cure her, protect her, return her to life.
yes, but tonight he'll have the honour of coming to my home.

each plays in their own way but it would be foolish to ruin a good game when one has played as a partner.
titti had said such a silly thing, you, lnspector, would have arrested me.
you would have dragged me in front of a judge and i would have been stuffed...

nancy and me, we come from a small town up in nebraska.
we always have to go someplace else for excitement and variety, you know?
it's a village called magdalena, if this thing will make it.
it was the doctor who wanted you called in on this.
you know, i was thinking, i'd like to have a mercedes and a little ranch in malibu.

it has become a subtle and sophisticated specialty to be carried out with medical and scientific precision.
physical and psychological pain is applied in unbearable yet controlled doses, to destroy the subject's will and spirit as the body clings to life.
now, the process can take weeks, even months during which the subject is kept trapped in a delicate, shall we say, nightmare existence of terror.
now, the hood, which serves to separate the interrogator and subject psychologically, is not always necessary.
astute for the most part, though you do have certain facts wrong.
you credit me with instructing the leaders of over 35 countries.
hector, you don't seem like the kind of man that would commission somebody's death.
i'm not but the doctor stands outside the moral laws of civilized people.
they said it would continue until i confessed crimes against the government.
but i invented things to save my family, and they said i was lying.
they made me watch when my friend was strip naked and made him stand against a wooden table
two men held him when the doctor drove nails through his testicles
he fainted many time from the pain and each time they trew water again to revive them
my husband was made to watch when i was raped and then the doctor killed him in front of me very slowly by cutting him open and pulling out his intestines
the doctor force me to eat ground glass that hurt my inside so bad that i cannot have solid food even now
my skin was burn with acid and needle was puch under my fingernails
every government represented condemns my brother publicly and then welcomes him privately.
they have called for another meeting and study of human rights violations.
my brother had a great deal to do with making this country secure, victor.

1974, but i've come close a lot of times since then.
buddy, you don't know anything, so why don't you shut up before you prove it?
i'm ashamed to know you if you don't stand up to that guy.
carla is provoking cliff into a physical confrontation with that lout.
i told you i don't want anything more violent in my bar than an occasional love nibble.

and it's gonna take a lot of very sophisticated legal expertise to structure and administer these affairs.
now, you do this for me, today, go out to her house, and i'll put you in charge of all that.
no more being looked down upon by people that think they're better than i am because they're rich.
from now on i'm gonna be respected by people who think they're better than i am.
i'm sorry but i don't think it's a good plan at all.

and i'm sorry if i made you being dead an unpleasant experience.
why do you think i've gone to so much trouble and expense to buy myself another chance?
cause you're under mistaken assumption that it's going to make a difference.
mrs. schuyler's sole source of support was mr. schuyler whose sole source of income was the law firm.

i'm sorry but i don't think it's a good plan at all.
my dauther's soul leaving' her body and going off to who knows where?
are you insinuating that i am not of perfectly sound mind?
no, i wouldn't do that, but i think practically everybody in the solar system would.
it's just that as a barber he didn't have that much opportunity!
grayson, bring the car and my hairdresser and the golden diamond jewelry, over.
i want something far more valuable than money, far more elusive for which
i'm giving up my physical being and become one with the universe.

tyrone, you really should not call another person a honky mook.
edwina claims that she's finally dying and needs to get her affairs in order.
no, uh, i have to discuss my future here right now.
long after edwina is gone from this earth, her estate is going to generate more income for this office than most small countries see in a year.
and it's going to take a lot of very sophisticated legal expertise to structure and administer those affairs.
now, you do this for me, today, go out to her house, and i'll put you in charge of all that.
now, if that's not real law, if that's not big law, i don't know what the hell is.
it means well, but it's always been something of a lemon.
i've had all the money in the world and not one good chance to enjoy it.
i'm sorry, but i don't think it's a good plan at all.

no, i wouldn't do that, but i think practically everybody in the solar system would.
mr. cobb, that's last thing i need around here is your ill-informed negativity.
and it's not that he didn't want to rape the environment and exploit the workers, i'm sure he did.
it's just that as a barber he didn't have that much opportunity.
i thought the bit with the bowl was overdoing it a little, but, it's certainly original.

i'd just as soon take it as have to kowtow to people like her
roger, i have a case that needs a lawyer just like you.
you win it, and i'll put you up for a partnership.
call the fulton morris orchestra tell them miss cutwater has requested her favorite saxophone player tyrone wattell for her party.
and she'd like him to receive a thousand dollars for the night.
if you want me out of you, then you must stop this ridiculous behavior.
lady, i don't know how you got in there, but i'm going to get you out of me right now!
but just because nobody ever did this with you doesn't mean the rest of us have to go without.
as a matter of fact, i am quite proud of my virginity!

with them went members of the students' popular culture center whose aim was to encourage local cultural centers in the states.
images of poverty in contrast with imperialism were a typical tendency of the art of those times.
i have paid my tribute to the nationalism of those times.
i filmed an oil field exploited by petrobras in alagoas state.
the day after our arrival a protest rally against the murder was held in sape, a town 30 miles from the capital.
elizabeth teixeira, joao pedro's widow, attended the rally with 6 of her 11 children.
the people assembled in front of the small farmers and farm workers association known as the peasant league.
at that time the sape league was the largest one with over 7,000 members.
the league had been registered 3 years before as a civil corporation in private law.
as rural syndicalism was a non-existent right the peasants found in the leagues the only legal way to channel their demands.
the emergency forced me to move the location and i found the ideal spot in pernambuco state at the galilea sugar-mill where a first league was founded in 1955.
when we arrived there some 50 kilometers from recife, the capital we again prepared for filming.
with the league's permission and the help of local people we chose the locations and actors.
on february 26, 1964 when we shot the first take we had a cast able to give time to the film.
just the idea to try and find the people who had worked on the film before.
i intended to get statements on the past including facts linked to the interruption of the film the true story of joao pedro's life
because here the dead were buried in a coffin lent by the mayor.
we took the body to the cemetery and then the coffin back.
the charitable society for the dead the pernambuco planter's agricultural society.
you couldn't call anything a union or else you'd be dead.
the owner of galilea evicted all the tenants when he realized that the league had also aims of mutual assistance.
so the people looked for a lawyer to defend their rights.
joao virginio is greeted by bia, 56 who left galilea in 1975 and never returned.
he was a mill watchman, and now is a quarry watchman.
joao mariano santana da silva, 59 who played joao pedro, had not been here since 1964.
he meets these people only at victoria's fair, where he lives.
on his 10 acre farm he grows vegetables which he sells in recife.
6 of his children live in sao paulo and 3 people help him.
i went to find abraham in patos, paraiba state where he is a journalist.
after making many demands, he agreed to take the film crew to his mother's house.
we went to the border and entered rio grande do norte state still not knowing where we were being taken.
after 4 hours of very bad roads we glimpsed a village near the piranhas river.
for having given the right for political prisoners outside brazil to come back to their families.
today, here i am with my son, meeting you, coutinho, again.
they are all rustic, violent, arbitrary dependending on your economic situation.
all factions forgot elizabeth teixeira simply because she had no power.
only in his free time on saturdays and sundays would he go out, or they'd come here to discuss things and he'd ask them how they were surviving.
others came to tell him they had been thrown off that the owner had evicted them out of hand.
a group of peasants led by joao pedro were discussing rent increases with the administrator.
the dialogue was created by the actors through an improvisation before filming.
he was going to make a deal with the lawyer about the land we lived on and about which we disagreed with the owner.
he'd been called by the lawyer and was going to pick up the eldest boy's books at the same time.
you're a real teacher to me, and you are a school.
this is, for me my strength, my reason for living being able to talk to mr coutinho fighting with him over 100,000 cruzeiros over 50,000, 10,000, 20,000, 100,000.
joao pedro teixeira was ambushed and killed... on april 2nd, 1962 by two soldiers of the military police.
another participant was a cowhand from landowner agnaldo veloso borges's ranch.
one deputy and 4 vices resigned to allow him into office.
in march, 1965 the 2 policemen who killed joao pedro were unanimously acquitted by the jury.
joao mariano was the only one who was not politically active.
when we asked him to do the film we told him who joao pedro was.
i was at the mill, because of the league and so on.
i left the mill to avoid getting mixed up in it all.
so i enjoyed it because i saw the fruits of my work.
elizabeth went to the south, 20 days after her husband was killed.
on may 5th, 1962, in brasilia she spoke to the parliamentary commission on agrarian affairs.
i had to go to rio to take part in the enquiry commission.
in answer to the peasant movement the government encouraged rural unionization.
2 weeks after this demonstration there was the conflict near sape which didn't allow filming in the area.
the big keg where we kept the flour had been thrown outside through the kitchen door.
a pan of manioc we were cooking for dinner... they threw out into the yard.
it was in galilea that the army apprehended material from the largest subversive communist group in pernambuco abandoned by left-wing leaders with the women and children.
in a typical peasant hovel highly subversive material was found, set up by international left-wing groups, protected by the last state government.
it showed how the peasants should react in cold blood with no sense of guilt or remorse when shooting was necessary or decapitation or other forms of elimination inflicted on "reactionary" prisoners in battle or taken to galilea.
meanwhile, a sociologist who wishes to remain anonymous drew up a plan to be used in the case of the mill to help in the moral and social recovery of the sub-race to which the communists tried to reduce these peasants.
we split into groups of 3 and got onto the recife road a few miles further on.
we all took separate buses and managed to get to recife.
if you can see any reason why i be arrested or beaten, or shot 2, 3 or 4 times, if i can stand it."
he said: "you're scared to be a prisoner." i said yes.
sergeant saraiva says: "tell me where the guns are, ze daniel."
well, says i, "there's that gun you took from home and others, shotguns to hunt fowl to eat and these are the guns in galilea."
i'd sit in the garden under an acacia tree and get down to work.
if any of the ss militia came near the garden, the peasant would warn me by a cough."
the army captain wanted this one because it was about the world war and russia or something.
but i said: "it was mine." he said: "it was the cuban's."
he thought you were them bearded cubans filming here back then in 1964.
so i said: "no sir, there's no cubans or communists here."
joao virginio was released in 1970 after serving 6 years of his sentence.
the recife penitentiary was turned into a cultural center in 1976.
she said she felt so sad... that it got to such a point.
in december, 1962, 8 months after joao pedro's death the eldest daughter, marluce, took arsenic and died.
actually, joao pedro is buried in sape cemetery in an unmarked grave.
joao pedro was born in the nearby town of guarabira and lost his father early on.
elizabeth's father, manoel da costa, a small landowner quarrelled with joao pedro and sold the farm.
threatened with eviction, joao pedro went to court for the right to live there or receive compensation.
on this road, further ahead on manoel's land, joao pedro was killed.
elizabeth used to come by here to head demonstrations to her husband's memorial.
the filming we did in st rafael in february, 1981 meant the end of elizabeth's reclusion.

i'm your agent here... so you'd better get along ok with me.
listen, look here, nobody will believe me... but i did nothing wrong, i was just looking at bracelets.
let me tell you how you should behave in here, will you?
here, we have a representative, we vote and choose one of us.
i've been told of facts... things that happen in some sectors.
if what i heard is true i'll be strict with the guilty ones.
and i don't need to get involved in stuff, like some others do.
so, i'll hear about what happened last night, soon enough... even though they lock their lips.
i'm afraid the vibrations from your gas engine can be felt all over the house.
the vibrations from a sneeze could be felt all over this building.

(kemp) you mean, there's an invisible cat at large in the world?
foolish as it seems now, i'd not reckoned with the weather.
when it began to rain, my euphoria vanished and i became inexpressibly wretched.
i had no refuge, no one in the whole world in whom i could confide.
the one thought that possessed me was to find shelter and food.
the russians have been working on this for the last seven years.
they take the cells out of the mammoth, they try to re-vivify them.

shepherd, someday paramedics are going to carry cryo tanks... someone's dying, you freeze him, you stop everything until you've got the blood, or the surgeons, or the spare parts you need.
this is worth much more than any one man, even him.
a forty thousand year old man who can teach us about ourselves, tell us how we evolved.
now that is much more important than trying to figure-out how to preserve people.

what... you said it, singe, we have study him and save him.

see, look, there's... there's no blood, these people are producing some chemical that protects their tissue, prevents charring, stops bleeding.

it was a thriller about a woman who has a dream about peeling tomatoes.
then, when she wakes up, ...she's sliced her husband to bits with a carving knife.
♪ living the life that a young man... ♪ '...according to the official south news agency...'
'...hardly a man one associated with epics...' '...was going to direct...'
it was a thriller about a woman who has a dream about peeling tomatoes.
then, when she wakes up, she's sliced her husband to bits with a carving knife.
no, but i know i don't want to do another chorus line.
well, kelly, now that you've left your life in the theater... maybe you'd reconsider my offer of four years at princeton.
at least she's not spending time with those street people anymore, darling.
look, i come home to relax with you guys, not argue.
we're gonna take you to the place where we all stayed
we're gonna take you to the place where we all go
the property values in that area are just going to take off.
and that building that the kids are in... that has got to go.
it would be more cost effective at this point to... tear the building down, and offer the property for sale.
and i don't think it would be bad if we took this area... and put in a shopping center here.
but the best that i'm able to do is get you a 30-day grace period... so that you can raise some money to renovate that building.
we appreciate your 30-day grace period... but do you really think that's long enough to raise that kind of money?
it's time for us to find out who's really the best with the freshest crew
no time for work, we're through with that all that's left is real combat
now we're all here, both of the crews someone will win, someone will lose
but we must battle to decide who keeps his honor and pride
now this is it, no time to choke this is a battle, not a joke
to win, you must be hard, not soft when you get on the floor, you got to go off
use every move you've learned in life dance is your weapon, not a knife
pull all the tricks out of your hat this is no game, this is combat!
now i seen battles in my time that move so fast they make you blind
and with the talent they possess, it made it hard to pick the best
so we will take them from this scene to find whichever was the cream
the only way this could be done was separate, go one on one
so when you battle, show no shame make other crews respect your name
be fresh and hard, give them no break and make them pay for their mistakes
give them no slack, always attack and never hit while stepping' back
be merciless, so when you're done there'll be no question of who won
now he's the beast from the east and the best from the west
so when they go up and down it tastes like this
i like the way you turn me on with just a single kiss
you stimulate in such a way that you can hardly miss
commissioner snyder, since no one has come forward... with funds in the amount required to save this building... our office feels it would be to the city's advantage... to tear it down and put the property up for sale.
this would not only upgrade the entire area, but make it commercially viable.
you're not going to tell me what to do or where to go.
i liked it a lot better here with you gone, and i want it to stay that way.
today, the little guys are going to take on the big guys.
right behind me here you see a bunch of spunky kids... who are getting ready to fight city hall in their own way.
well, you just heard mr. douglas change his mind on the whole affair.
and i'm sure that mr. douglas will make a nice, sizeable contribution... to help us pay our loan just fine.
we must save the miracles, the time is now all together, we can do it somehow
so reach to your pocket and give us a sign a quarter, a nickel or even a dime
today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.
ramon is afraid that this could be taken in the wrong direction
i want to die because for me, life in this way...is not worthy
i can understand if other tetraplegic could feel offended when i say life like this is not worthy
look, we will win heaven, because we have spent our whole lives in hell
i tape this image so the judges or politicians or whoever has to decide understand better...
besides, i don't think i�d be willing to take on two children, i have enough with my nephew
i saw you on tv the other day hmmm...see, now we are getting closer
no, i came because i want to be your friend ramon
if you want to be my friend, rosa, you should start by respecting my will
although i know he won't because...the last time we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms
but for what it's worth, i�d like to tell him i'm sorry
but then comes the next stroke and the next, and the next and no one can tell you when or how they are going to be
no one can tell what is going to be left of you if anything at all
when gen� told me that a lawyer wanted my case there was something that influenced my decision and it was the fact that the lawyer suffered a degenerative disease
i thought that only someone in that condition could really understand mine
with the hope that you will come soon and give me a hand
for now, my nephew javi is helping me by copying them on his computer
but the doctors have limited me the use of the computer and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs
they assure me that i�ll be able to walk again but they say that i shouldn't continue with your case
i reach the sea and keep flying until i can only see that endless line of water
and think, foolish me, that if you do the same from corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again
and we end up finding each other in some part of the planet
i identify with you when you mention the lack of freedom and privacy
i try to bear with it, mainly for my husband that takes care of me with much dedication
but at the same time, i refuse to fall into this inertia where i just can be grateful for what is given because i have no other choice but to accept it
i wish i�ll be able to see you in a couple of months
and i keep my promise of helping you with the book
and now it is me the one that has to tell him
the demand of the tetraplegic ramon sampedro requesting the euthanasia was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form
the sentence says that the judicial process should have been started in corunna where he resides, and not in barcelona
many voices have been raised due to this case among them is priest's francisco de galdar tetraplegic like ramon
couldn�t it be possible that what ramon is asking is for more love?
i would really like to talk to him and convince him that there are many reasons to keep on living
if i called you that then, now i call you strong and brave and kind and beautiful.
and i call an imbecile to those who can't see it
why does the church keep with such passion that posture of terror of death?
because it knows that it would lose a great amount of its customers if people lose their fear to the great beyond
now you tell him that moral issues are not resolved through polls
because most of the german people was also in favor of hitler
don't you think that what's really demagogic is to say "death with dignity"
why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and call things by its name, with all its rawness
ramon, do you feel alone because you are the only spanish to have requested euthanasia?
yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
when you need the help of someone else to die with dignity, then the state interferes with the freedom of the people and tells them that the life they are living is not theirs, that they can't make decisions about it
this, your honor, can only be done based on metaphysical beliefs, or religious
that you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do, if the judges decided against you
yes, rosa, but i already asked you to forgive me, right?
or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills like they used to do at the hospital?
- no one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
for me what counts is what people have in their heads, and you have nothing in yours
i will not be a slave of your ignorance anymore or of your prude conscience
you should know that the processes conducting to my death has been carefully divided in small actions that do not constitute a crime by themselves and have been executed by several friendly hands if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers
i would suggest that you cut their hands, because that is all that they contributed
i believe that living is a right not an obligation, as has been in my case forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years, 4 months and some days
after all this time i make a balance of the road traveled and i can't account for the happiness
only the time that passed against my will, during most of my life will be my ally from now on
only time and the evolution of consciences will decide one day if my request was reasonable or not.
and in the weightlessness of the bottom where dreams come true two wills come together to make a wish come true
your look and my look like an echo repeating, without words
today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.

only time and the evolution of consciences will decide one day if my request was reasonable or not.
and in the weightlessness of the bottom where dreams come true two wills come together to make a wish come true
your look and my look like an echo repeating, without words
i want to build it on the site that we talked about.
the property values in that area are just going to take off.
the key thing though is that our current engineering reports show... that that building is structurally unsound.
it would be more cost effective at this point to... tear the building down, and offer the property for sale.
it says our building is going to be condemned... unless somebody comes up with $200,000 to fix it.
and i don't think the city is gonna come up with that kind of bread.
you may think we're funny but we got to have the money
got to have the money if you want to get the honey
it's very noble, but don't let it interfere with your career.
i have had a lot of time on my hands lately.
but we must battle to decide who keeps his honor and pride
we've got the moves, you've got the beat we got the power that you need
to win, you must be hard, not soft when you get on the floor, you got to go off
use every move you've learned in life dance is your weapon, not a knife
and with the talent they possess, it made it hard to pick the best
so we will take them from this scene to find whichever was the cream
be fresh and hard, give them no break and make them pay for their mistakes
give them no slack, always attack and never hit while stepping' back
you stimulate in such a way that you can hardly miss
commissioner snyder, since no one has come forward... with funds in the amount required to save this building... our office feels it would be to the city's advantage... to tear it down and put the property up for sale.
the chair, at this time, does not recognize comments from the floor.
and the floor recognizes this panel's trying to push us out of our neighborhood.
those are certainly admirable goals, sir... and the city greatly appreciates your efforts.
but the fact is that the building that houses miracles... has been considered unsafe.
commissioner... it's clear that it's beyond these people's resources... to provide the necessary improvements for this building.
in light of the fact... that the city has already received a healthy bid from mr. douglas... the planning office recommends to the zoning board... that we approve the development plan for this proposed shopping center.
pride's more important to our kids than your money will ever be.
nobody is going to tell me when to lay down my pride.
i would like to get a little reaction and comment from mr. byron smith.
well, you just heard mr. douglas change his mind on the whole affair.
as you can see, there's a lot of excitement here today.
finally the little guys are coming out on top... and i think that victory deserves a lot of applause from all of us.
so reach to your pocket and give us a sign a quarter, a nickel or even a dime
everybody in the place sing along with me everybody in the place, g-l-v-e
we have an intra-disciplinary group studying relationships between science, art and literature.
we're interested in the magic square represented in albrecht dürer's painting "melancholy".
that you are at loss, but you insist on finding a single maniac.
you add up your facts like a child, you want someone to lock up.
only know there was lgnazio, maria, and me too, still living at home with our parents.
one year it snowed, another there was talk of a coup d'état
washington insiders consider tonight's gala the beginning of attempts on the part of the administration to arrange a strategic deal with the emir.
it would involve the establishment of a major american military presence in that middle eastern country.
no identification yet of the gun-wielding man who to the horror of terrified witnesses made his abortive attempt on the life of the emir.
we have not been told how serious the brave ms. davis' condition is...
she is behind me in one of the rooms of the george washington hospital and according to the latest bulletin, she's fine.
there's a rumor that someone from the white house perhaps the president will pay a visit to this young lady whose unusual display of bravery, of intestinal fortitude of old-fashioned american guts, have thrust her into the harsh yet warm and grateful light of media attention.
if you'll just let me fill you in on this material...
this map is part of the background material we're giving to the press.
well, i'd like to say thank you to everybody at the hospital for being so nice and taking such good care of me.
and i'd like to tell everybody in america that this is the best place to come if you're ever shot in the ass.
and relax and see what new things my dad's invented in his workshop.
and check on my dog and eat some of my mom's huckleberry pie which is the best in the world.
she's got the working women, the small-town folks the senior citizens, the gays, the law-and-order bunch!
and the baseball fans and the barflies and the animal lovers!
someone who's reasonably good-natured has a relatively high tvq and nothing important to do.
this is the first time anyone like the vice president has visited our city.
sunny davis graduated in the top 75% of her class at diamond junction high.
she was a pep girl, a member of the hair-dressing club and an expert ping-pong player.
lou, well he's my boss, and he's really a nice guy but business is slow.
and i was kind of hoping for an advancement, you know.
but lou's aunt works the cash register and his sister's the hostess.
so i'm gonna have to wait around until one of them quits or drops dead.
dad, these books the protocol department sent are filled with weird rules.
"never cross your legs in front of an african chief because the sole of the shoe is considered an insult."
as for mr. al kabeer and his friends here i've never met a nicer bunch of foreign people.
and that car is just about the prettiest thing i've ever seen.
"we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed."
i feel like i don't know, like they're testing me for something.
if you behave yourself, i'll give you a real massage someday.
i want you to think of this as your oasis away from your oasis.
your majesty and you fellas you'll find we pour some of the most generous drinks in town.
- sunny this is a chance for you to perform a vital service for your country.
does this have anything to do with that strategic military thing mr. hilley talked about yesterday?
i know you're going to be proud of the job i'm doing.
the people here are friendly and they greeted me like i'm a real princess.
i can honestly say i'm on a sort of intimate footing with some of them already although i can't understand what any of them are talking about.
i haven't been outside the palace yet but as soon as possible, i plan to contact the american ambassador for any special instructions.
i think there's a feast tonight and tomorrow we're supposed to go on a camel ride in the desert.
if there's a diplomatic pouch coming here i wouldn't mind if you included a tuna salad sandwich and some lip gloss.
here's a list i've made up of some places i'd like to visit.
one of them is a hospital, a daycare center maybe a farm, an irrigation project, something like that.
according to sources in the state department sunny davis had no knowledge of the wedding plans arranged by our government without her consent in exchange for a military base in his country.
we'll have more for you in just a few minutes from now.
her presence started a war that may affect the world's economy.
rescued from sure death and probable torture she learned she was traded for the balance of power in the middle east.
i was on my way up in the political racket if you know what i mean.
and then a few weeks ago i met this extraordinary person who reminded me that i had forgotten something real basic, real simple.
i have to say that i really feel badly about what happened.
i imagine it was the first time mrs. st. john got busted.
yes, but i figured they must know what they're doing because they're supposed to be the experts.
sunny, the purpose of this hearing is to find out who is responsible.
i mean, when you guys, when you spend another pile of money and give away or sell all those guns and tanks and planes...
every time you invite a foreign big shot to the white house and hug them, and give them gifts it has a direct effect on "we the people's" lives.
i mean, if i don't know what you're up to and if i don't holler when i think you're doing it wrong and if i just mind my own business and don't vote or care then i just get what i deserve.
so now that i'm sunny davis, private citizen again you're gonna have to watch out for me because i'm gonna be watching all of you like a hawk.
and of course, my very good friend and the best, best babysitter a working woman could wish for, my very good friend, al kabeer.
i have a phone call that some of you may want to hear.
among the celebrities we expect to see tonight are the president himself and his honored guest, the emir khala'ad bin abdul majid.
washington insiders consider tonight's gala the beginning of attempts on the part of the administration to arrange a strategic deal with the emir.
it would involve the establishment of a major american military presence in that middle eastern country.
although the emir struggled for years to reconcile dissident factions within his traditionally conservative nation he is considered powerful enough, if not popular enough to assure his own people that the long-term economic benefits from such an arrangement would help his suffering country.
at approximately 11:45, when the president's banquet in honor of the visit of the emir khala'ad bin abdul majid was ending and the would-be assassin appeared in the crowd...
the information we have developed so far reveals that the name of that real-life heroine is sunny ann davis.
you cannot help but discern its strategic importance to the west in terms of its proximity to the gulf.
and its value as a buffer, geographically speaking between these two rival nations.
well, i'm gonna go home to oregon and visit my folks.
and relax and see what new things my dad's invented in his workshop.
this is the first time anyone like the vice president has visited our city.
but the governor is here a lot to visit his sister clara who lives just outside of town.
i mean, well, i have a job at the safari club.
lou, well he's my boss, and he's really a nice guy but business is slow.
and i was kind of hoping for an advancement, you know.
but lou's aunt works the cash register and his sister's the hostess.
well, mr. nawaf, this is a real natural high for me.
it means, "blessed are the small ones who shall be made large."
i'd like to say that i think the emir is really a great guy.
as for mr. al kabeer and his friends here i've never met a nicer bunch of foreign people.
and that car is just about the prettiest thing i've ever seen.
it gives me a headache to tell you that as a government employee i will transfer ownership of it to the general services administration and include it in a list of gifts to an official in the report in accordance with federal registry order 327.
dear michael, i don't know when i'll be able to send this letter i wanted you to know how grateful i am for helping me out.
i know you're going to be proud of the job i'm doing.
the people here are friendly and they greeted me like i'm a real princess.
i can honestly say i'm on a sort of intimate footing with some of them already although i can't understand what any of them are talking about.
i haven't been outside the palace yet but as soon as possible, i plan to contact the american ambassador for any special instructions.
i think there's a feast tonight and tomorrow we're supposed to go on a camel ride in the desert.
i think sunny davis represents the kind of american woman we can all be proud of.
she's real, she's honest and she isn't taking crap from anybody.
one of them is a hospital, a daycare center maybe a farm, an irrigation project, something like that.
and also, i'd like to see that military base we're building.
she was queen for a day, and she claims she didn't know it.
her presence started a war that may affect the world's economy.
the important thing is that we pull together so when that committee starts the hearing...
you want to tell me what you think i should say, right?
i'm going to make one last appeal to you on behalf of the country.
there are at least four people in here who don't speak for my country.
mr. hilley told you to show the emir a good time?
well, actually, the exact words he used were "a very good time."
i took the emir and his friends to a party at lou fox's safari club where i used to work.
i have to say that i really feel badly about what happened.
didn't you think it was unusual for a person like yourself who had no expertise, to be sent on a mission of such importance?
yes, but i figured they must know what they're doing because they're supposed to be the experts.
every time you invite a foreign big shot to the white house and hug them, and give them gifts it has a direct effect on "we the people's" lives.
i mean, if i don't know what you're up to and if i don't holler when i think you're doing it wrong and if i just mind my own business and don't vote or care then i just get what i deserve.
the polls have been closed for 10 minutes in green hills a suburb of diamond junction and it's impossible to predict a winner in this.
some people call tonight's contest one of the closest in history.
first, this is not a victory speech, because we haven't won yet.
it's getting really late, so i want to take this chance...
and no matter what happens, we're still gonna go on together you, me and the best campaign manager in this country my husband, michael.
and of course, my very good friend and the best, best babysitter a working woman could wish for, my very good friend, al kabeer.
good evening, i'm howard k. smith, and this is the state of the war tonight.
visitor forces cut through the rio grande valley this week... leaving a path of death and destruction in their wake.
visitors have established processing centers... in dallas, el paso, and san antonio.
in san antonio, a migrant farm worker miguel ramirez... and a handful of his neighbors barricaded themselves in the alamo... and held out for two weeks against overwhelming alien forces.
in the end, ramirez and his valiant followers blew up the national shrine... rather than allow it to fall into visitor hands.
we are proud to award him... the freedom network medal of valor posthumously.
i expect the terrorists responsible to be found and dealt with accordingly.
the man found this morning was raoul... your chief food processor from san diego.
look, if you just take us to her, we'll get everything straightened out.
yeah, we probably could... except for the fact that sandi's dead.
this tune goes out to tracy and todd, gene and joan...
the goose and mr. d, who want all the peas in the pod to know... they're living in the valley of the jolly green giant... and the boys in the tower who asked me to remind all their guests... that check out time is 11:00 sharp.
you're about to witness... the state of the art in human processing technology.
a system so clean, fast and efficient... that the results are truly staggering.
the bottom line is i intend to maintain the peace in this city... no matter what the cost.
of course the cheapest way is to wipe out the resistance.
once they realize what's in store for those who oppose us...
i suspect we'll see an end to their feeble acts of resistance.
this is the proper position you must assume... in order to appreciate your father's concerns.
i would like to propose a toast... to our illustrious commander.
in san antonio, a migrant farm worker miguel ramirez... and a handful of his neighbors barricaded themselves in the alamo... and held out for two weeks against overwhelming alien forces.
in the end, ramirez and his valiant followers blew up the national shrine... rather than allow it to fall into visitor hands.
your chance to tell someone out there how much you really care.
this tune goes out to tracy and todd, gene and joan...
she's personally responsible for the roundup and processing... of 50,000 innocent people.
according to the wlf... her appetite is exceeded by that only of her mentor.
assuming it meets with everyone's approval... each of you could have one by the end of the year.
as you can see, the subject requires very little advance preparation... and no body partitioning.
after we take out the first sentry, we got only 60 seconds... before the second guards arrive.
dean, you'll put on the sentry's uniform and take over his post.
we mustn't overlook... the psychological impact of mass processing on the humans.
once they realize what's in store for those who oppose us...
now the person showed up on the radar because they returned to japan.{at this point they don't know if the person has a vagina or a dick}
this means we might have a foreign warrior joining us.{someone is getting horny...
my godfather, eunuch qiren... asked me to meet the boxers of different schools
if they're willing to work for the emperor, they will be forgiven and rewarded
but even the east sea thescarfclantogether ...can't harm us in any way
shangguan hou, we got a secret report you hid a wanted criminal in your place
if there's anything wrong with the kid, what should we do?
if you think he makes a mistake, then what is your opinion?
i just turned and... jumped from the cliff into the valley
my clothes got stuck on a branch and stopped my fall
how do you find yourself again once you've surrendered both body and soul to a lover?
i hesitated... i was facing a decision that would completely change my life.
such a fundamental change will have an impact on your mind.
and i think you should consult a psychotherapist to assist you day and night, for three months.
marc, marc, even changed like this, how could i ever forget you?
would i at last escape you, now that i had become emmanuelle?
what was i doing, so far away, in this strange house?
a young girl sleeping there seemed to have the face of an angel.
so i went from party to party, trying to forget marc.
but love, real love, when you've found it is it something you can leave behind, no matter how long the road?
let yourself be entered by this limp tepidity that so easily mixes with my own similar feelings.
little girl, do you know we have lips down there, and lips up here?
and i wanted even more that my friend had pleasure out of the humiliation he submitted her to.
he was very brutal, but i was ready to follow him at his wish.
i was afraid. i saw myself being caught in this evil place.
by these horny youths, coming out from the dark, like wolves.
in this office that i knew so well, i was suddenly aware of myself.
i was going to offer marc the new body he had had a glimpse of in rio.
it's true i want you, and that since i met you...
do you know the poem: "an unknown woman i love, and she loves me."
i hesitated... i was facing a decision that would completely change my life.
but when changing to another body, will all memory be changed as well?
i know. i'll call you when i wake up tomorrow. i'll keep you posted.
the paper will handle your change of address and take care of things.
and i think you should consult a psychotherapist to assist you day and night, for three months.
if i have to live with a man day and night for three months i will have physical problems.
i did not feel this new encounter would lead to a forbidden adventure.
i had been in love with a few men, but i never knew i could fall in love with a woman.
this shape that was my existence from now on in the eyes of others?
with this appearance, searching my innermost would i find the same emotions, the same fantasies?
would i at last escape you, now that i had become emmanuelle?
now emmanuelle's soul had to learn to live again in this body.
she seemed to have disappeared from the surface of the earth.
but something in me kept saying that i would find her again some day.
i will ask you a question, that no woman asks a man:
do you make love with the lights on, or in the dark?
i'd like to know you, i'd like to make love with you, for a long time.
i want to make hard love with you, i want to find the pleasure.
little girl, do you know we have lips down there, and lips up here?
they are the ones we adorn with the greatest care, and sometimes while thinking about the other ones...
sometimes, it seemed that no man i met would be able to satisfy me.
i wanted them all, and i had flings with all of them.
after the father, i had a longing for the embrace of the two sons:
alfonso, maria's fiancè, and miguel, his brother who maria also coveted.
i found the feeling i had, watching nadine being fucked in the ass.
i never liked maria much, but i really hated this man.
he was very brutal, but i was ready to follow him at his wish.
during this inner journey that seemed like an initiation i never stopped asking myself who i really was.
in front of this defenseless body, overwhelmed by sleep i let myself get carried away into fantasies.
an enormous river carried me away under a sky heavy with passion.
do you know the poem: "an unknown woman i love, and she loves me."
"and each time is neither quite the same nor quite another"?
i loved this woman so much, and one thing bothers me.
you see, i think of you as much as of her.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
we don't want your little tribe dirtying up our country air.
of course, if that bothers you, you can always kick us off your land.
so sykes just keeps on making policy decisions for the locals.
a policy that doesn't include us building our meeting house or settling down there.
i hope that you'll be able to perform the miracle... that eric here claims you can.
i get a feeling that you have some doubts that we will.
i've spent my life trying to live without hate and harm.
i think that your being here is a signal that we're ready to fight.
man, talk about living your life with a shell around you.
i'm telling you, murdock, for the last time, get to work.
you can use that in a little while to put a brace under that board... so no people come in here.
the way i see it, we can handle this one way or another.
i don't think he liked what you had to say, colonel.
some people would complain if you hang them with a brand new rope.
we can't ignore the generosity of the reverend who let them use the church.
besides, i won't let these people go without an escort, like it or not.
my mother wants me to do this 'cause i got in trouble.
i helped you get in trouble, so it'll be okay if i help you carry them in.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
we don't want your little tribe dirtying up our country air.
of course, if that bothers you, you can always kick us off your land.
so it must be built. i hope that you'll be able to perform the miracle... that eric here claims you can.
i get a feeling that you have some doubts that we will.
i've spent my life trying to live without hate and harm.
i think that your being here is a signal that we're ready to fight.
well, paris doesn't have to worry... about losing the tourist dollar to dear old kellysburg.
but sometimes there's a lot to be said for the quiet life.
i can bring them out of the shadows und into the light.
man, talk about living your life with a shell around you.
i'm telling you, murdock, for the last time, get to work.
it was a good thing that you were wearing your shell.
we'll drop you off at the hospital when we're finished... if it will make it any easier for you.
i don't think he liked what you had to say, colonel.
but it is a fantasy well-suited to the hearts of the people of the canal town beautiful and willowy.
a psc, new japan productions, and art theatre guild joint production
i spent the summer in that town to write my graduation thesis.
i hadn't intended to go to such a far-off place that i'd never visited.
any cheap and quiet inn where i could have studied would have been fine, but that wasn't so easy to find.
by chance, a relative told me of a place where a friend had a home.
even back then it was such a lonely and quiet countryside town.
i'd sent a letter beforehand, but as i passed through the imposing gate and saw the old-fashioned building, i couldn't help feeling a bit afraid.
they used to have the practical purpose of preventing flooding from the river, but...
at some point the townspeople starting digging them almost as a hobby.
i was adopted into the family, but she doesn't hold that over me.
and even though i like to go out and have a good time, she's not jealous either.
memories allow us to make sense of an incident after it occurs, giving it order and context.
the incident that occurred at the end of that summer was seared into my mind, and as a result i became prone to expecting tragedy at the beginning of things.
it happened near the end of august as the day i was to leave the town approached.
during that short month i spent my time on the second floor, working diligently on my graduation thesis, unaware of anything else.
the lives and works of poets across the sea had nothing to do with my life had nothing to do with the tragedy that was slowly developing so close by.
as i look back on myself then, so obsessed with that thesis,
she went to the temple at the beginning of the summer.
it was almost like she was telling the two of us to be happy together.
she's the type to become more and more resolved in the face of excuses.
he was the type that would quickly give up and think it's no use.
it started with a simple misunderstanding and got worse and worse.
and in the end naoyuki couldn't go on living with it all.
i pray that you get married and live a life full of happiness, yacchan.
hide said she wanted to be together, so she'll come along.
i too now realize that i was in love with yasuko-san at the time.
no, the truth is that i must have known it deep in my heart even then.
when yasuko-san clung to me in that room bathed in the afternoon light, she was so dear to me in that moment.
the two of us held each other in that second-floor room after naoyuki-san's death.
the train struggled through those late summer fields, already so far from town.
and then i heard the moment the town collapsed just as it passed, like the sound of the river flowing in my heart.
put your seats in upright position and put your boards into the starting position.
in a few minutes we shall be landing at budapest airport.
l'm fed up with everyone going about normally dressed and only i am wearing such impossible clothing.
i've got a brand new chanel dress, ijust received it from paris, it will suit you.
however the path is winding, and sometimes we have spring in winter.
still, there is no hope, believe me, we need a lot of wisdom and faith,
and that she'll leave this place because she'll simply die if she stays on.
and after that she did not hesitate to make me give a massage to her tiny feet and said in the meantime:
take care of me on the bus, and on the streetcar,
on the metro and on the train, in the summer and in the winter
i was walking in the zoo, and i remember when i caught sight of jénos, he was cleaning the cages there.
he took some time to notice me and indicated to me to go round.
the rock that accommodates lions also houses some small rooms and big halls like this.
it was there where janos hid me, because i had run away from the reformatory and it was certain that] was sought by the police.
he always brought food for me and got a television set from somewhere and so i could always watch the serial on a well-trained police dog's adventure.
later we ventured into town, climbed the fence there in the back, jumped on a freight train and went to lake balaton.
or to the other side opposite you where there is no view.
it's difficult for me to get up i still have the dream on me,
well, we could buy a house in the country and live there.
we'd have some goats and kids and poultry, hens, a rooster, geese.
and all we should do would be to keep them well and we'd be able to sit comfortably in the afternoons...
and of course, we'd also have some dogs and cats, too...
is that they're looking at a monster, because that's what i really am.
and i swear to myself that i'm never going to do it again.
now the reason you came to consult with me was something deeper.
tell me, does your husband know you've come to see me?
happened about 12:20, but there was no robbery intended or anything like that.
by that i mean his wallet was still intact and had a couple of hundred dollars in it.
that means, doctor, translating from the french, do they have the hots for you?
after all, you sit there and you listen to them, listen to all their troubles and you hold their hand and you wipe their eyes and one day a fag walks in here you see...
now, i don't wanna shock you with the terminology i'm gonna come out with, but this mr. boyd gets a hard-on for you and you being normal, of course, you reject him and now he threatens you with blackmail,
so it's your word against his and we have the beginning of a motive.
you're very lucky to go around with a colleague with such an overdeveloped sense of humor.
oh, yeah, he's a barrel of laughs on a murder case.
nor do i feel that i have to stand here and listen to your innuendo.
if a patient of mine has been murdered, then i shall answer any legitimate questions and do anything i can to help.
anyway, one of the two detectives turned out to be the ex-partner of the dead policeman.
i know it sounds crazy, but he treated me like i was a suspect.
i'm collecting a very fat check for our new pediatric wing.
one of our prominent citizens is coughing up the last $100,000 and you know me, i'll go anywhere for a buck.
i mean, that's under law but i have to warn you...
now let me tell you something, mcgreavy, i've just about had you two.
what is this, some private grudge you're trying to work off?
no, this is a perfectly legal investigation into a murder and a break-in.
yeah, we'd like to know where you've been since you left it.
i saw my brother-in-law at his hospital, and then i had some dinner.
they'll kill you for a book of matches, they'll beat up an old lady for a bottle of beer.
for a lousy heroin fix, they'll blow you off the earth and you ask me for what?
we got a little black lady who was pregnant, who is killed, right?
and we got a doctor who refuses to let us look into his files and you're talking to me about conjecture.
a bike that's driving a couple of wheelchairs, or a wheelchair that's driving a couple of bikes?
lieutenant mcgreavy, whether you believe me or not, an attempt was made on my life tonight.
all i can promise you is that i'll keep an open mind.
i may not appreciate my partner's tactics all the time but i'm out to nail whoever did it.
well, the only damn thing i could think of was to make that suicide call, but i never expected you to show up.
i just happened to be in emergency when the call came in and i recognized the address.
you can forget about caring about me, you see, because i can take care of myself.
i can take care of stevens and you know what you can do?
doctor, i know i shouldn't disturb you but this is important.
i've seen that friend of mine again, and she wants me to tell you that she wasn't wrong.
well, you can't catch it off a cracked cup, you know.
now the way i see it, is the first thing we have to do is to find out whether somebody's actually trying to knock you off or whether you're nuts yourself.
now, let's put this little baby safe in my car and then we'll go out and grab some breakfast.
i don't know about you, but sleepless nights always give me one hell of an appetite.
look, the fact that i picked morgens at random must weigh in his favor.
i mean, he couldn't possibly be connected with this at all, could he?
i can't help you if you go off on your own.
and whatever you do, please don't meet morgens alone again without me, okay?
at last i have the pleasure of meeting the famous dr. stevens.
forgive me for having you brought to me in this unconventional fashion.
it never entered his head he was treating the wife of a capo.
and that even the nothing she told you was too much!
i don't know whether it's important, but an operator just took an emergency call from a woman in the lake forest area.
she hung up before she got any details or a trace.
a heap of discarded ideals, lost hopes, old loves, all find their way here eventually to be carried along this conveyor, to the last mouth that will taste them.
i'm sure you will appreciate the poetic justice of such an arrangement, doctor, being a sensitive man like myself.
as a matter of fact, the only difference between you and me is that you still believe that human nature is basically good.
whereas, i have no doubt that human nature is basically corrupt.
but i can't rely on that, you have to appreciate my position.
how much do you earn a year, doctor, listening to all that garbage?
i still make my prison visits but i don't have private patients anymore.
does that now mean you're now allowed to socialize with ex-patients?
now, you know how you have been on me about my field reports being behind.
i was gonna use this time to bring them up to date.
look, what if i put off my vacation and do the mugshot file update?
you've been asking for a volunteer for that for months now, huh?
we've placed one of our people in the americans' own training facility.
it's one thing to get pavlovitch in, another to bring off the assassination.
your applications to the agency show your willingness to serve your country.
but the process of becoming an agent is a long and difficult one.
station 1 is only the first step in your training which will include physical exercises psychological testing and our dodge city maneuvers.
the truth is that most of you will not pass this initial phase.
in order to survive in this business, one must always expect the unexpected.
if this had been a real assault, mrs. king, you would be dead right now.
i conceived the idea of an elite squad whose sole purpose it is to terminate the top western agents.
let me tell you that our target will not be obvious.
but as confirmation pavlovitch is gonna look through the files in the instructor's office.
this well tell us, beyond a doubt, that it is amanda king.
uh, files on the class, full backgrounds on all the recruits.
with the perimeter security around this place, you know what this means.
everybody, first thing you're going to do is block your opponent's blow.
i want you to use all of his momentum against him.
ladies and gentlemen, this will be your last night at station 1.
in the morning, you'll be leaving for more training at dodge city.
dodge city is a pursuit-and-avoidance course specifically designed to test your ability to think and act under pressure.
in order to successfully complete this course you will have to run the entire dodge city gauntlet including what we affectionately term 'assassin's alley.'
further instructions will be given to each of you at your respective starting points tomorrow.
and remember only those of you who successfully finish will be going on for more training.
some are armed, some have hostages and some are just innocent bystanders.
now, you have a split second to decide whether to shoot or not.
there shouldn't have been any problem with the phosphorus bomb, but there was.
as backup, pavlovitch and i will be at dodge city waiting.
well, she's the only recruit we know for sure isn't the russian plant.
for appearances' sake, i'll wait till we're off the compound before i break the news.
she seems to be taking her frustrations out on that report you requested.
neither of you two seem any worse for wear with another station 1 under your belt.
masafumi did? it doesn't seem likely that the damage caused by this drug is going to decrease. someone is doing the same thing that was done back then... one rainy night...
those bastards forced her to take so much of the drug... it's not working on this worthless girl... boss.
rio made that story up to get her through that moment.
but i can't remember anything that happened... lt's not fair that you're the only one who can remember.
i am not going to talk about your work with this film company because i agreed it's none of my business.
but i do have the right to be, uh, concerned about your well-being.
field marshal kreschenko has made himself an outlaw in his own country by coming here.
he wouldn't do so unless he had some kind of a plan.
she has been observed in your company on a number of occasions.
i followed her through some dead ends until i found you.
i have a doctorate from the university of psychic studies in murmansk.
i understand, but hypnosis just won't work on me, you know.
our sympathetic friends who own this place have also been good enough to allow us to use their vehicle.
of course, they have no idea what we will be transporting.
uh, did you by any chance, uh, go out with this barky?
well, he asked me to, but, um, i didn't really want to.
the dinobots attempt to stop the huge tidal waves, and earthquakes, which threaten to rip the planet apart.
and spike journeys to cybertron to save his father, sparkplug, who has been turned into a mindless slave.
megatron's deadly plan to bring cybertron into earth's orbit, creates tremendous natural disasters around the worl.
the dinobots attempt to stop the huge tidal waves, and earthquakes, which threaten to rip the planet apart.
you've had quite a colorful career as a student, mr. mcgraw.
you've managed to be suspended, expelled, or physically thrown out of 16 colleges and universities throughout the country.
mr. mcgraw, as you are aware, this university, our university has the reputation as the single worst educational institution in the country.
that's because it is the worst educational institution in the country, sir.
in fact, the only certifiable recognition that any of our alumni have ever received is a parole.
mr. mcgraw, every year for the past 15 years the colleges and universities of this country have held an intercollegiate raft race.
i'm damned if i'll let my university be the laughing stock of this country any longer!
i want a victory with a capital "v" and i want it now!
you have the distinct honor of being the four worst students in the entire country.
you are not at the bottom of the list, you are the bottom of the list!
that's why you're going to win this race for me and lepetomane.
you're the only men who virtually have nothing left to lose!
i was hoping we could avoid this scene, but since you feel the need to test me...
i suppose you know nothing about the student loans you've taken out in 35 different names.
men, i have a lot of race preparation to do before tomorrow morning.
what do you say we just cut the bullshit and get down to business?
you get in my way again, and you're gonna be sorry you were born.
he knew then and there that the friendship they had had since youth had died a sudden and tragic death, destroyed by the love of a woman.
i don't think i need to remind you gentlemen about the importance of this race.
i don't think i have to bore you with the fact that the washington military institute has won this race for the past three years!
a real, wide open night filled with the stars of a thousand dreams.
it was the kind of night that could only be found in a place called the west.
well, i hope, for your sake, the institute is a lenient one.
under the circumstances, i have no choice but to impound your raft and disqualify you.
today you will race to this point, beaver flats, where the first five teams will pick up flags.
and only the first five teams to pick up flags will be in the second day.
and those of you who pick up flags will then portage to chicken falls where you will spend the night and turn in your flags.
then tomorrow morning at 10:00, you will continue the race downriver.
now, you all come here to represent your colleges and your universities.
you have come here to participate in an annual event that shows good, healthy american competition is still alive.
i don't think we need to explain to him that somebody tried to destroy our raft, knock us out of the race.
no, if he's gonna get his nose bent out of shape over a little lost time,
that's because it is the worst educational institution in the country, sir.
do you realize that not one single student, including you, and them, has ever won any award for anything?
i mean you could win this race for our school, it would mean an end to jokes like "lobotomy u."
it would mean that for the first time in our history...
i don't need this aggravation, and this really doesn't sound like a lot of fun.
i'm damned if i'll let my university be the laughing stock of this country any longer!
you are not at the bottom of the list, you are the bottom of the list!
that's why you're going to win this race for me and lepetomane.
skinny, uncoordinated, got a yellow streak down your back a mile wide, you're anemic, you dress like a creep, you've got the personality of a mayo and baloney on white.
you're the kind of guy most people wouldn't give the time of day to.
men, i have a lot of race preparation to do before tomorrow morning.
what do you say we just cut the bullshit and get down to business?
i don't think i need to remind you gentlemen about the importance of this race.
i don't think i have to bore you with the fact that the washington military institute has won this race for the past three years!
i didn't get all their names, but they all wore the same cologne.
you know, this is gonna be a piece of fucking cake.
and only the first five teams to pick up flags will be in the second day.
and those of you who pick up flags will then portage to chicken falls where you will spend the night and turn in your flags.
then tomorrow morning at 10:00, you will continue the race downriver.
now, you all come here to represent your colleges and your universities.
i don't think we need to explain to him that somebody tried to destroy our raft, knock us out of the race.
no, if he's gonna get his nose bent out of shape over a little lost time,
when it is returned to us you will keep the original,
and you can give the copy to herr flick of the gestapo,
in the desert, a body like this would wither and die.
after a few hours with such a body, what would it matter?
airwolf can exceed mach 1 from sea level to 65,000 feet.
the crew consists of an in-flight systems specialist in the electronic data command center to monitor turbine temperatures, fuel and lubricant pressure, rotor synchronization, all on board flight systems.
he also has a duplicate flight system control in case the aircraft commander becomes incapacitated.
and finally, the aircraft commander, who's responsible for positive flight control, target acquisition, and weapon system selection.
you can only keep the lid on testing and development for so long.
and if the firm puts airwolf in the field, it'll leak to congress in a week.
and they won't take kindly to the firm's developing secret tactical weapons.
that's why the firm would like to turn this prototype over to the department of defense and let them take credit for it.
to demonstrate airwolf's tactical capabilities it will penetrate a typical soviet defense zone, the type used around their icbm sites, their military command posts and communication installations.
simulation has a way of always making the test vehicle look good.
he'll use the mountain range to block our defense radar until he can exceed mach 1.
after that, he can penetrate the defense zone from any point on the compass.
moffett probably flew it south through central america then jumped from brazil across the atlantic to north africa.
same route we used to ferry planes in world war ii.
once you land in tripoli, our operative there will help you.
the carrier enterprise will be standing by in the gulf of sirte.
but i've been up there doing it for the cameras, and i'm gonna do it for mona!
either that or you can use your... your choppers to haul tourists around disneyland.
i don't understand what you westerners see in women with such skinny bodies.
in the desert, a body like this would wither and die in a matter of hours.
of course, brother khadafy was most pleased with your exploits this afternoon against the french on behalf of our beleaguered freedom fighters in chad.
your destruction of 2 french mirage fighters will be told about in the camps of our people until the desert sand turns to water.
we have reason to believe it's been used against the french in chad.
a mirage fighter was shot down yesterday over the desert there.
string, if you don't teach that mutt to keep out of my way, so help me, i'm gonna land on him!
you know, i wouldn't want to tell anyone where to land.
he remembered the time that he and your dad and i got drunk in towbridge after the schweinfurt raid, and we stole a pig from a nunnery.
we took him back to the field, fed him 8 boxes of prunes, and locked him in general baxter's office, overnight.
4 hours ago, one of our destroyers went down in the gulf of sirte.
the press is being told that a missile went off in the magazine.
we've got 48 hours to recover airwolf or they're sending in the marines.
the russians have a missile task force shadowing our carrier group in the med.
after a few hours with such a body, what would it matter?
we've got 48 hours to recover airwolf or they're sending in the marines.
his primary m.o.s., is to suppress, neutralize, or destroy any weapons threatening the integrity of airwolf.
he also has a duplicate flight system control in case the aircraft commander becomes incapacitated.
and finally, the aircraft commander, who's responsible for positive flight control, target acquisition, and weapon system selection.
the latter offers him 14 firepower options ranging from 30mm cannons to nuclear-tip shrike missiles.
now you've got topsy, what are you gonna do with her?
you can only keep the lid on testing and development for so long.
and if the firm puts airwolf in the field, it'll leak to congress in a week.
and they won't take kindly to the firm's developing secret tactical weapons.
simulation has a way of always making the test vehicle look good.
that defense zone is filled with soviet equipment and manned by personnel who know how to use it.
the computers have airwolf's point of penetration into the defense zone.
they can interpolate his most likely approach to the target area and deploy tu-36 helicopters to block the canyons.
same route we used to ferry planes in world war ii.
it took 2 weeks of concentrated satellite surveillance to confirm airwolf's location.
it's a french firm, but most of the technicians are americans.
once you land in tripoli, our operative there will help you.
the carrier enterprise will be standing by in the gulf of sirte.
you probably won't have to fly more than 200 miles to get there.
he... he said i was a natural, he said that i hardly had to touch the stick.
and besides, hawke has been letting me fly for 3 months.
the firm will do all it can to find your brother.
they're concerned you won't take the mission till they have something tangible.
in the desert, a body like this would wither and die in a matter of hours.
after a few hours with such a body, what would it matter?
oh, i got steaks, and chops, and burgers, and all of it.
well, tet and i end up eating most of them, but, we keep hopin'.
the russians have a missile task force shadowing our carrier group in the med.
if we invade libya, chances are it'll mean world war iii.
i've got 10 hours to get you to paris to catch a flight to libya.
i'll have someone stay here to watch the place, take care of your dog.
i figured airwolf might be behind it, so i flew out to the cabin and found tet makin' eyes at some cute little thing in white who said she was house sittin' for you.
didn't take a genius to figure out what happened, you know.
if your boys don't get that chopper in 4 hours, our boys go in and blow it away.
our "boys," captain, include women, 1 of whom has already given her life on this mission.
of course, there is still time for me to save you, gabrielle.
i mean, you may scar a little, but isn't that better than dying?
- you're a nice kid, howard, but don't you ever touch me like that again.
tonight, you be there, or you don't see a dime, you got that?
uh, well, i just flew in from new york a few days ago, and, uh, my aunt just flew in from maine... and maybe a few of howard's friends.
speaking of the groom, i do have choir practice in five minutes.
i wanna go to this place, you know, to find out.
but if i love him, how can i justify spying on him?
[scattered laughter] i wanted to look good for the show tonight, so i went to a barbershop right before the show.
lfigured i'd get a shave, a shoe shine and a manicure...
she said, "i'd like to, but i'm married." i said, " come anyway.
tell your husband you're going out with the girls." she said, "you tell him.
[freddy] "you're never gonna sell a car with 120,000 miles on it.
why don't you just lower that odometer, you know, go in and lower it?
i, too, have been up all night, and i have got jet lag on top of it.
i was supposed to go on a tv show this morning, but i canceled it... because i thought that this was more important.
the only fingerprints on the gun was his, and it was common knowledge he'd been arguing with drake about money.
and, oh, yeah, the gun was stolen from a pawnshop... about six months ago in new york city, which is where howard comes from, i believe.
vicky'd marry me no matter what i was into, including unemployment, welfare and starvation.
look, i don't know how to explain this, but i wanna be a performer, and i knew if i didn't give it a shot, a real shot, that i'd be miserable and so would my marriage.
that still doesn't explain why you were standing over him with a murder weapon in your hand.
well, see, i finished my act, and i went back to his office to quit and get my money...
don't you ever speak to me that way in front of the staff again!
i suppose we do have to keep up appearances, don't we, darling?
you know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, mr. york.
it's too bad it's wasted in a dump like this, huh?
you know, in vegas... you think they'd give a star a dressing room like this?
they got a llama in one of their shows up there.
i'm positive, but i did see her comin' in the stage door just before i went on.
howard, i think that you should take vicky to lunch yourself, and i'll take a rain check.
well, it seems to me all you proved is that i could've staged the falling lights.
that doesn't mean i had anything to do with what happened to al drake.
i mean, you both know i was onstage when drake got hit.
yeah, but the lady here thinks you shot him before you went on stage.
i think you used mr. drake's pillow to muffle the shot.
then you removed your fingerprints from the gun, got rid of the pillow... and went on stage.
but if i love him, how can i justify spying on him?
for your own peace of mind, i think you have to.
how could howard afford to bring her to a place like this?
[applause] and now, the one and only, our very own, in his third year...
i, too, have been up all night, and i have got jet lag on top of it.
i was supposed to go on a tv show this morning, but i canceled it... because i thought that this was more important.
the only fingerprints on the gun was his, and it was common knowledge he'd been arguing with drake about money.
and, oh, yeah, the gun was stolen from a pawnshop... about six months ago in new york city, which is where howard comes from, i believe.
he knew i was broke, so he held back on my wages.
that still doesn't explain why you were standing over him with a murder weapon in your hand.
but, you know, i wonder what miss stevenson was doing there.
well, everybody knew that mr. drake and barbara worked late... a lot together.
i thought we should get our stories straight for that mrs. fletcher.
she is determined to get howard off the hook by putting someone else on.
other than the fact that you despised the man... and that you were talking to a lawyer about divorce proceedings.
and naturally, you didn't care that he reneged on his promise to sell you the club?
well, it just goes to show you can't go by first impressions.
[chuckles] uh, mrs. fletcher, you're a nice lady, but, uh, i think you're making a big mistake.
but the murderer was afraid that someone would notice that drake's pillow was gone, so he put this one there to cover his tracks.
i don't know if you've noticed, but the settees in all the dressing rooms match.
that was very theatrical, diving off the stage when you didn't have to.
well, it seems to me all you proved is that i could've staged the falling lights.
yeah, but the lady here thinks you shot him before you went on stage.
i think you used mr. drake's pillow to muffle the shot.
half the people in this club wanted drake dead, and your niece's boyfriend's gotta get tagged for it.
i knew you were trouble as soon as i saw you.
i think mr. york was afraid the charges against howard would be dropped.
they weren't strong enough, so he thought perhaps another murder attempt, particularly against himself, would point to someone else.
i am sitting surrounded by the greatest proliferation of life anywhere on the surface of the earth.
i'm up in the canopy of the jungle, the tropical rainforest.
between them, those two factors have created the jungle, which stretches in a broken green band right round the earth.
this particular patch lies in south america, right across the equator, stretching for 600 miles both north and south of it in a vast blanket, almost unbroken except for the rivers.
here there is probably more unexplored territory than anywhere else in the world.
travel east from here along the course of that greatest of rivers, the amazon, and you reach the atlantic.
continue along the line of the equator, across the ocean, and you come to the west coast of africa, another gigantic river, the zaire - that used to be called the congo - and another vast tract ofjungle.
eastern africa doesn't get as much rain and the jungle dwindles into savannah, but across the indian ocean the great green rainforest reappears along the western edge of india and sri lanka.
it covers south-east asia, burma, thailand and malaysia, the huge islands of borneo and sulawesi and the smaller archipelagos of indonesia, and farther east still, new guinea.
beyond lies the vastness of the pacific, for the most part empty of land except for scatterings of tiny islands, until, having girdled the earth around the equator, you come back to the greatest expanse of all, the amazon jungle.
the kind of tree i've climbed doesn't grow in groups but as isolated individuals, and it's by far the tallest tree in this particularjungle.
it's a kapok, and it grows to over 200 feet high.
if the canopy of leaves formed by the rest of the jungle can be called a sea of leaves, then the crown of the kapok is an island which rises above that sea, and it has a climate all of its own.
there is more sunshine up here than below and there's also wind, which is virtually unknown in the depths of the forest.
the wind also brings a benefit - it distributes the kapok seeds, which are extremely fluffy.
they float gently across the top of the canopy for mile after mile.
in south america the harpy, in africa the crowned eagle, and here in malaysia the hawk eagle.
all patrol above the surface of the canopy, occasionally plunging down into the leaves at great speed to seize a squirrel, a bird or even a monkey.
all produce just one nestling which they must feed with meat for almost a year until it too is big enough to hunt.
these high outposts above the jungle are excellent vantage points from which to scan life in the canopy below.
few other creatures dare fly above that sea of leaves when there are eagles about.
coming down from the airy sunlit branches of the kapok, you leave the breeze and the dazzling sunshine and enter a different world.
here the warm still air is heavy with moisture, there's hardly a breath of breeze, the leaves above cut out much of the sunshine.
the canopy - millions of leaves stretching in a vast endless mosaic of green, each leaf exactly angled to collect the maximum amount of light.
many have a special joint at the base of their stalk that enables them to twist and follow the sun as it swings overhead.
it's an isolated world, many of whose inhabitants are born here and will die here, without ever leaving it.
workers, feet hooked on one leaf, lock theirjaws on the edge of another and haul the two together.
while they hold the leaves in position, other workers use the colony's grubs as tubes of glue, gently squeezing them so that they produce threads of sticky silk which they weave back and forth across the junction.
eventually they produce an enclosed globe within which they can rear their young.
the insubstantial green terraces of the canopy are the pastures of the jungle and a multitude of creatures graze on them.
these in south america are squirrel monkeys, but every jungle has its monkey troops that scamper with total confidence through the branches, fastidiously selecting the right kind of tree, the juiciest bud... or the particular shoot that most takes their fancy.
there are no seasonal changes here comparable to winter and summer in the north, so there is no one time for the shedding and the renewal of leaves.
but the rhythm is far from haphazard, for all the individuals of one species produce their flowers at about the same time, as they must if they are to cross-pollinate one another.
with so little breeze within the canopy, the trees can't rely on the wind to pollinate.
most depend on insects and other animals, bribing them with lavish feasts of pollen and nectar.
bigger creatures have to be persuaded to transport the heavier seeds.
there are a great number of different kinds of figs in the jungle, each with its own fruiting rhythm.
since the bats are such accomplished fliers, they can range far over the jungle and can always find figs of some kind, ripe somewhere.
marmosets live in families, each with its own territory in the branches, and each has at least one of these sap wells which the family keeps open and productive and vigorously defends.
still though the air is, it carries the microscopic spores of ferns and mosses which lodge in the crevices of the tree bark and sprout.
as they flourish and decay, their remains accumulate into a compost on which other plants can grow.
their dangling roots collect moisture from the humid air, and so the broad branches become balconies loaded with orchids and bromeliads.
bromeliads are relations of the pineapple and each one has its own population of animal lodgers.
the rosette of leaves forms a chalice that is always full of water, a useful drinking place for the canopy animals.
this little female arrow poison frog laid her eggs on a leaf.
as they hatched, she allowed a tadpole to wriggle up onto her moist back.
now she must find a pond for it to swim in.
she reverses into the water and allows the surface tension to pull her tadpole off.
several species of arrow poison frogs use bromeliads like this, and most regard their parental responsibilities as being over at this stage.
mosquitoes are likely to lay here, so with luck, there should be some wriggling larvae for the tadpole to feed on.
for such frogs, like so many creatures up here, the canopy is a complete world, suspended above the surface of the earth, that they never need leave.
when you descend from the canopy, you leave behind the most densely populated part of the jungle and enter a kind of aerial halfway house of spindly saplings, hanging lianas and bare branchless trunks.
here, i am about halfway down, about 70 feet above the floor, midway between the ceiling of leaves in the canopy and the carpet of leaves below.
up here, there are very few leaves - these huge tree trunks don't sprout many.
there's nothing much but empty space, so very few creatures come here to feed, and apart from birds and some flying insects, the only creatures i'm likely to see are those that use these huge tree trunks and the dangling lianas
as vertical highways between the world above and the world below.
snakes with no legs and claws with which to hold on might not seem to be well suited to climbing, but in fact some can ascend the vertical trunks with astonishing ease.
the paradise tree snake of borneo maintains its grip by pressing sideways with its coils and propels itself upwards by sending ripples down the line of angled backward-pointing scales on its underside.
when it's about its normal business, the skin looks a bit untidy, as though the animal were rather sloppily dressed, but when the squirrel leaps, then it becomes the very summit of gliding grace.
most other mammals in this midway zone travel from tree to tree along the lianas.
marmosets are capable jumpers and confidently leap a yard or so.
but they are not always convinced that they can make it.
these termites collected their food from rotting vegetation on the ground.
they are laboriously carrying it all up here because it's up here, within the trunks, that they have built their nest.
other termites hang their nests from branches and these are often commandeered by others.
a bird originally dug this hole, but the bat took it over and now uses the termites' work as a convenient roost from which to hawk for insects.
the pillar-like trunks of the huge trees provide homes for a few birds.
a big bird like a macaw needs a nice open approach to its nest, and the hole is relatively safe, for few non-flying robbers can reach it.
this hole started when a dead branch fell, but the macaws have enlarged it greatly.
they usually have just two chicks, but keeping them properly fed is a considerable labour, for they will stay in the nest hole for over three months.
like all parrots, macaws feed their young by regurgitating chewed-up fruit from their crop.
both parents labour away, bringing loads of fruit throughout the day, for it's bulky food and the youngsters need a great deal of it.
so, after one family has left, other creatures soon turn up to inspect the vacant property.
the golden lion marmoset, like all its family, is incurably inquisitive.
they may already have a hole of their own, but it's always worth inspecting alternative accommodation.
and their curiosity has paid off - the hole contains a meal, a few cockroaches.
as it approaches the ground, the huge creeper-swathed trunk of the kapok flares out into buttresses which the tree needs for its stability, for its roots are very shallow.
the fact is that the forest floor is not a very fertile place.
this is partly because it is so dark, much of the light having been cut off by the tiers of leaves up in the canopy, and partly because the torrential rains wash away much of the nutriment that is in the soil.
so the roots of the kapok tree, and indeed of any other plant that grows down here, have to find their sustenance not deep in the soil, but from up on the surface - from this, in fact, the litter of dead leaves that's continuously falling down from above.
and the processes which release that sustenance are in fact very swift.
for down here there's very little wind, so it's extremely humid; it's also very warm, and those two factors together suit the processes of decay very well.
within days of a leaf landing, they creep all over it, breaking down its tissues and returning its nutrients back to the soil, where the roots of the trees, close to the surface, quickly reclaim them.
and as the fungi themselves flourish, so they put up their spikes and umbrellas, from which they spread their spores through the jungle.
the most spectacular of all growths on the forest floor is not a fungus but a parasite
to find it, you must discover first its host, a particular species of vine that grows in sumatra.
if the plant is infected, a huge solid bud will periodically emerge from its roots.
when it's swollen to the size of a cabbage, it slowly, over a period of four days, opens.
the forest floor is littered with the debris of trees, huge fallen trunks, branches ripped off by a storm and leaves falling in a steady gentle rain.
it's here that the termites collect their food, removing it particle by particle and carrying it away for treatment in their nest.
their incessant labour, like the work of the fungi, is a crucial link in the life of the forest, for the termites are bringing the nutrients in the wood back into circulation.
few other creatures can eat dead wood and leaves, but lots can eat termites.
the tip of its long antennae tell it where there's prey.
yet another varied population of creatures lives within the leaf litter.
down here it's always moist, so soft-bodied, wet-skinned creatures can survive very well.
a planarian worm smoothes its way by laying down a carpet of slime.
one of the few creatures apart from termites that eat rotting wood.
such inhabitants of the litter are, in turn, food for hunters from beneath the soil.
this phasmid, a large flightless prickly stick insect, has a powerful kick.
it gives warning of its strength by rattling its useless wing covers.
the smaller, less savage litter feeders are collected by little mammals that trot through the leaves, deftly snapping up a termite here, a beetle there.
in the madagascar rainforest, a tenrec, a more distant cousin of the european hedgehog than its coat of prickles would suggest.
in african forests, the elephant shrew, highly strung, skittish, prone to career off at suicidal speed if it's startled.
its long sensitive trunk enables it to investigate the depths of the leaf litter with the minimum of noise and disturbance.
but there is one inhabitant of the forest floor who makes more varied use of more parts of the jungle than any other.
human beings have lived here for tens of thousands of years, perfecting the techniques and accumulating the knowledge that enables them to meet all their needs from the jungle.
the waorani in ecuador, or auca as they used to be called, are among the few people left who have not abandoned any of their ancient skills.
their favourite fruit is chonta, a kind of palm, but its trunk is armoured with the most ferocious spines and impossible to climb.
the waorani know how to deal with that - lash a small stick to the end of a pole with a strip of bark, put a ring of lianas around your ankles and then climb a smooth-barked cecropia tree growing alongside the unscalable chonta.
the cecropia doesn't grow next door to the chonta by accident.
the waorani plant one beside every chonta tree they find, clearing a space for it so that it can get sufficient sunshine to grow.
within only a few years, it's stout enough to be climbed.
the waorani know their individual chonta trees as well as if not better than a fruit farmer knows his orchard, and they visit them regularly.
they grow all over the jungle, and often the people have to make long journeys to collect their fruit and walk for hours carrying the heavy stems back to their huts.
the waorani now have a few metal cooking pots but they still make some from clay, coiled and then baked in an open fire.
hammocks are woven from palm fibre, cups and basins made from gourds, and the hut itself from branches thatched with leaves.
the parrot chicks also take their chonta pre-chewed from their foster parents' mouths, just as they would from the beaks of their real parents.
the people traditionally are entirely naked, except for a string around their waist.
the seeds of the achiote plant, when squashed, produce a vivid red paint.
black comes from charcoal mixed with the juice of the genipa plant.
face and body painting lasts a long time, for like many forest people, the waorani sweat very little.
in the humid air, sweat doesn't so readily evaporate and cool the body as it does for people elsewhere, and the waoranis' skin doesn't produce it in great quantity.
a vine is the source of that famous poison, curare, with which the waorani tip their blowpipe darts.
scrapings from it are wrapped in leaves and water poured through the mash to dissolve out the poison.
carefully, each dart is tipped with it and then put in front of the fire to dry.
fibres from the seeds of the kapok tree, deftly twirled round the back end of the dart, will give it an airtight fit in the barrel of the blowpipe.
such thumps are audible for miles, and in the forest, where you can't see for more than a few yards around you, sound is much the best form of communication.
the jungle animals certainly exploit it to proclai their territorial rights and to summon their mates
in each jungle, there's one mammal up in the canopy which has become the champion singer:
in madagascar the indiri lemur, in south america the howler monkey and in south-east asia the gibbon.
sound is not so effective beside the thundering waterfall, so one frog that lives in such a place in borneo uses sign language.
tree lizards, up in the branches where they can easily see all over their small territory use a flag on their throat.
the cock has summoned a hen with his calls and now he leads her to his display ground.
the immense fans, lined with eyespots, are the greatly elongated feathers of his wing coverts
as many as forty male birds assemble in one patch of the forest, but each has his own cleared arena on the ground beneath him.
the performers squabble among themselves while they wait for their audience.
the female may or may not be impressed by the relative merits of the costumes or the dance steps, but in some way she makes a selection.
a tap on the back of the winner and he claims his prize.
it's as though this great age has enabled the forces of nature to produce specialised creatures to live in every tiny niche in this ancient and stable environment.
just consider, for example, how many creatures have developed notjust a generalised camouflage but a close and precise impersonation.
a big storm is preceded by a violent gale which for a few minutes lashes the tall trees and rocks the canopy.
the huge heavy drops begin to fall, first slowly and then in drenching torrents.
in places, the floor of the forest becomes a flood, sweeping in sheets through the trees down to the rivers.
when the storm has passed, then the blessings of the water it has brought can be enjoyed.
the jaguar is an excellent swimmer and seems positively to enjoy doing so, for it's seldom found far from water.
it actually hunts as it wades, catching crocodiles and frogs and even fish.
one of the small creatures which doesn't enjoy a soaking manages to pass the storm in perfect dryness and is still snug in its remarkable shelter.
the leaf of this heliconia is hanging in an unnaturally protective way.
maybe it had lost one of its huge branches from decay and was already badly out of balance before the storm.
the great weight of water hanging on its foliage was finally more than it could carry.
the death of this old tree was the starting gun for a feverish race.
the competitors are the spindly seedlings mostly buried under this wreckage of branches.
the huge rent in the canopy above is both the prize and the finishing post of the race.
those seedlings that can grow fast and get up there quickest will get their place in the sun, spread their branches, flower and set seed, but the rest will have no chance.
only one or two complete the course to sunlight, where they will spread their branches.
so the jungle floor once more becomes darkened by shadow and the green canopy is again complete.
i am sitting surrounded by the greatest proliferation of life anywhere on the surface of the earth.
i'm up in the canopy of the jungle, the tropical rainforest.
between them, those two factors have created the jungle, which stretches in a broken green band right round the earth.
this particular patch lies in south america, right across the equator, stretching for 600 miles both north and south of it in a vast blanket, almost unbroken except for the rivers.
here there is probably more unexplored territory than anywhere else in the world.
travel east from here along the course of that greatest of rivers, the amazon, and you reach the atlantic.
continue along the line of the equator, across the ocean, and you come to the west coast of africa, another gigantic river, the zaire - that used to be called the congo - and another vast tract ofjungle.
eastern africa doesn't get as much rain and the jungle dwindles into savannah, but across the indian ocean the great green rainforest reappears along the western edge of india and sri lanka.
it covers south-east asia, burma, thailand and malaysia, the huge islands of borneo and sulawesi and the smaller archipelagos of indonesia, and farther east still, new guinea.
beyond lies the vastness of the pacific, for the most part empty of land except for scatterings of tiny islands, until, having girdled the earth around the equator, you come back to the greatest expanse of all, the amazon jungle.
the kind of tree i've climbed doesn't grow in groups but as isolated individuals, and it's by far the tallest tree in this particularjungle.
it's a kapok, and it grows to over 200 feet high.
if the canopy of leaves formed by the rest of the jungle can be called a sea of leaves, then the crown of the kapok is an island which rises above that sea, and it has a climate all of its own.
there is more sunshine up here than below and there's also wind, which is virtually unknown in the depths of the forest.
the wind also brings a benefit - it distributes the kapok seeds, which are extremely fluffy.
they float gently across the top of the canopy for mile after mile.
in south america the harpy, in africa the crowned eagle, and here in malaysia the hawk eagle.
all patrol above the surface of the canopy, occasionally plunging down into the leaves at great speed to seize a squirrel, a bird or even a monkey.
all produce just one nestling which they must feed with meat for almost a year until it too is big enough to hunt.
these high outposts above the jungle are excellent vantage points from which to scan life in the canopy below.
few other creatures dare fly above that sea of leaves when there are eagles about.
coming down from the airy sunlit branches of the kapok, you leave the breeze and the dazzling sunshine and enter a different world.
here the warm still air is heavy with moisture, there's hardly a breath of breeze, the leaves above cut out much of the sunshine.
the canopy - millions of leaves stretching in a vast endless mosaic of green, each leaf exactly angled to collect the maximum amount of light.
many have a special joint at the base of their stalk that enables them to twist and follow the sun as it swings overhead.
it's an isolated world, many of whose inhabitants are born here and will die here, without ever leaving it.
workers, feet hooked on one leaf, lock theirjaws on the edge of another and haul the two together.
while they hold the leaves in position, other workers use the colony's grubs as tubes of glue, gently squeezing them so that they produce threads of sticky silk which they weave back and forth across the junction.
eventually they produce an enclosed globe within which they can rear their young.
the insubstantial green terraces of the canopy are the pastures of the jungle and a multitude of creatures graze on them.
these in south america are squirrel monkeys, but every jungle has its monkey troops that scamper with total confidence through the branches, fastidiously selecting the right kind of tree, the juiciest bud... or the particular shoot that most takes their fancy.
there are no seasonal changes here comparable to winter and summer in the north, so there is no one time for the shedding and the renewal of leaves.
but the rhythm is far from haphazard, for all the individuals of one species produce their flowers at about the same time, as they must if they are to cross-pollinate one another.
with so little breeze within the canopy, the trees can't rely on the wind to pollinate.
most depend on insects and other animals, bribing them with lavish feasts of pollen and nectar.
bigger creatures have to be persuaded to transport the heavier seeds.
there are a great number of different kinds of figs in the jungle, each with its own fruiting rhythm.
since the bats are such accomplished fliers, they can range far over the jungle and can always find figs of some kind, ripe somewhere.
marmosets live in families, each with its own territory in the branches, and each has at least one of these sap wells which the family keeps open and productive and vigorously defends.
still though the air is, it carries the microscopic spores of ferns and mosses which lodge in the crevices of the tree bark and sprout.
as they flourish and decay, their remains accumulate into a compost on which other plants can grow.
their dangling roots collect moisture from the humid air, and so the broad branches become balconies loaded with orchids and bromeliads.
bromeliads are relations of the pineapple and each one has its own population of animal lodgers.
the rosette of leaves forms a chalice that is always full of water, a useful drinking place for the canopy animals.
this little female arrow poison frog laid her eggs on a leaf.
as they hatched, she allowed a tadpole to wriggle up onto her moist back.
now she must find a pond for it to swim in.
she reverses into the water and allows the surface tension to pull her tadpole off.
several species of arrow poison frogs use bromeliads like this, and most regard their parental responsibilities as being over at this stage.
mosquitoes are likely to lay here, so with luck, there should be some wriggling larvae for the tadpole to feed on.
for such frogs, like so many creatures up here, the canopy is a complete world, suspended above the surface of the earth, that they never need leave.
when you descend from the canopy, you leave behind the most densely populated part of the jungle and enter a kind of aerial halfway house of spindly saplings, hanging lianas and bare branchless trunks.
here, i am about halfway down, about 70 feet above the floor, midway between the ceiling of leaves in the canopy and the carpet of leaves below.
up here, there are very few leaves - these huge tree trunks don't sprout many.
there's nothing much but empty space, so very few creatures come here to feed, and apart from birds and some flying insects, the only creatures i'm likely to see are those that use these huge tree trunks and the dangling lianas
as vertical highways between the world above and the world below.
snakes with no legs and claws with which to hold on might not seem to be well suited to climbing, but in fact some can ascend the vertical trunks with astonishing ease.
the paradise tree snake of borneo maintains its grip by pressing sideways with its coils and propels itself upwards by sending ripples down the line of angled backward-pointing scales on its underside.
when it's about its normal business, the skin looks a bit untidy, as though the animal were rather sloppily dressed, but when the squirrel leaps, then it becomes the very summit of gliding grace.
most other mammals in this midway zone travel from tree to tree along the lianas.
marmosets are capable jumpers and confidently leap a yard or so.
but they are not always convinced that they can make it.
these termites collected their food from rotting vegetation on the ground.
they are laboriously carrying it all up here because it's up here, within the trunks, that they have built their nest.
other termites hang their nests from branches and these are often commandeered by others.
a bird originally dug this hole, but the bat took it over and now uses the termites' work as a convenient roost from which to hawk for insects.
the pillar-like trunks of the huge trees provide homes for a few birds.
a big bird like a macaw needs a nice open approach to its nest, and the hole is relatively safe, for few non-flying robbers can reach it.
this hole started when a dead branch fell, but the macaws have enlarged it greatly.
they usually have just two chicks, but keeping them properly fed is a considerable labour, for they will stay in the nest hole for over three months.
like all parrots, macaws feed their young by regurgitating chewed-up fruit from their crop.
both parents labour away, bringing loads of fruit throughout the day, for it's bulky food and the youngsters need a great deal of it.
so, after one family has left, other creatures soon turn up to inspect the vacant property.
the golden lion marmoset, like all its family, is incurably inquisitive.
they may already have a hole of their own, but it's always worth inspecting alternative accommodation.
and their curiosity has paid off - the hole contains a meal, a few cockroaches.
as it approaches the ground, the huge creeper-swathed trunk of the kapok flares out into buttresses which the tree needs for its stability, for its roots are very shallow.
the fact is that the forest floor is not a very fertile place.
this is partly because it is so dark, much of the light having been cut off by the tiers of leaves up in the canopy, and partly because the torrential rains wash away much of the nutriment that is in the soil.
so the roots of the kapok tree, and indeed of any other plant that grows down here, have to find their sustenance not deep in the soil, but from up on the surface - from this, in fact, the litter of dead leaves that's continuously falling down from above.
and the processes which release that sustenance are in fact very swift.
for down here there's very little wind, so it's extremely humid; it's also very warm, and those two factors together suit the processes of decay very well.
within days of a leaf landing, they creep all over it, breaking down its tissues and returning its nutrients back to the soil, where the roots of the trees, close to the surface, quickly reclaim them.
and as the fungi themselves flourish, so they put up their spikes and umbrellas, from which they spread their spores through the jungle.
the most spectacular of all growths on the forest floor is not a fungus but a parasite
to find it, you must discover first its host, a particular species of vine that grows in sumatra.
if the plant is infected, a huge solid bud will periodically emerge from its roots.
when it's swollen to the size of a cabbage, it slowly, over a period of four days, opens.
the forest floor is littered with the debris of trees, huge fallen trunks, branches ripped off by a storm and leaves falling in a steady gentle rain.
it's here that the termites collect their food, removing it particle by particle and carrying it away for treatment in their nest.

so the roots of the kapok tree, and indeed of any other plant that grows down here, have to find their sustenance not deep in the soil, but from up on the surface - from this, in fact, the litter of dead leaves that's continuously falling down from above.
and the processes which release that sustenance are in fact very swift.
for down here there's very little wind, so it's extremely humid; it's also very warm, and those two factors together suit the processes of decay very well.
within days of a leaf landing, they creep all over it, breaking down its tissues and returning its nutrients back to the soil, where the roots of the trees, close to the surface, quickly reclaim them.
and as the fungi themselves flourish, so they put up their spikes and umbrellas, from which they spread their spores through the jungle.
the most spectacular of all growths on the forest floor is not a fungus but a parasite.
to find it, you must discover first its host, a particular species of vine that grows in sumatra.
if the plant is infected, a huge solid bud will periodically emerge from its roots.
when it's swollen to the size of a cabbage, it slowly, over a period of four days, opens.
the forest floor is littered with the debris of trees, huge fallen trunks, branches ripped off by a storm and leaves falling in a steady gentle rain.
it's here that the termites collect their food, removing it particle by particle and carrying it away for treatment in their nest.
their incessant labour, like the work of the fungi, is a crucial link in the life of the forest, for the termites are bringing the nutrients in the wood back into circulation.
few other creatures can eat dead wood and leaves, but lots can eat termites.
the tip of its long antennae tell it where there's prey.
yet another varied population of creatures lives within the leaf litter.
down here it's always moist, so soft-bodied, wet-skinned creatures can survive very well.
a planarian worm smoothes its way by laying down a carpet of slime.
one of the few creatures apart from termites that eat rotting wood.
such inhabitants of the litter are, in turn, food for hunters from beneath the soil.
this phasmid, a large flightless prickly stick insect, has a powerful kick.
it gives warning of its strength by rattling its useless wing covers.
the smaller, less savage litter feeders are collected by little mammals that trot through the leaves, deftly snapping up a termite here, a beetle there.
in the madagascar rainforest, a tenrec, a more distant cousin of the european hedgehog than its coat of prickles would suggest.
in african forests, the elephant shrew, highly strung, skittish, prone to career off at suicidal speed if it's startled.
its long sensitive trunk enables it to investigate the depths of the leaf litter with the minimum of noise and disturbance.
but there is one inhabitant of the forest floor who makes more varied use of more parts of the jungle than any other.
human beings have lived here for tens of thousands of years, perfecting the techniques and accumulating the knowledge that enables them to meet all their needs from the jungle.
the waorani in ecuador, or auca as they used to be called, are among the few people left who have not abandoned any of their ancient skills.
their favourite fruit is chonta, a kind of palm, but its trunk is armoured with the most ferocious spines and impossible to climb.
the waorani know how to deal with that - lash a small stick to the end of a pole with a strip of bark, put a ring of lianas around your ankles and then climb a smooth-barked cecropia tree growing alongside the unscalable chonta.
the cecropia doesn't grow next door to the chonta by accident.
the waorani plant one beside every chonta tree they find, clearing a space for it so that it can get sufficient sunshine to grow.
within only a few years, it's stout enough to be climbed.
the waorani know their individual chonta trees as well as if not better than a fruit farmer knows his orchard, and they visit them regularly.
they grow all over the jungle, and often the people have to make long journeys to collect their fruit and walk for hours carrying the heavy stems back to their huts.
the waorani now have a few metal cooking pots but they still make some from clay, coiled and then baked in an open fire.
hammocks are woven from palm fibre, cups and basins made from gourds, and the hut itself from branches thatched with leaves.
the parrot chicks also take their chonta pre-chewed from their foster parents' mouths, just as they would from the beaks of their real parents.
the people traditionally are entirely naked, except for a string around their waist.
the seeds of the achiote plant, when squashed, produce a vivid red paint.
black comes from charcoal mixed with the juice of the genipa plant.
face and body painting lasts a long time, for like many forest people, the waorani sweat very little.
in the humid air, sweat doesn't so readily evaporate and cool the body as it does for people elsewhere, and the waoranis' skin doesn't produce it in great quantity.
a vine is the source of that famous poison, curare, with which the waorani tip their blowpipe darts.
scrapings from it are wrapped in leaves and water poured through the mash to dissolve out the poison.
carefully, each dart is tipped with it and then put in front of the fire to dry.
fibres from the seeds of the kapok tree, deftly twirled round the back end of the dart, will give it an airtight fit in the barrel of the blowpipe.
in each jungle, there's one mammal up in the canopy which has become the champion singer:
in madagascar the indiri lemur, in south america the howler monkey and in south-east asia the gibbon.
the cock has summoned a hen with his calls and now he leads her to his display ground.
the immense fans, lined with eyespots, are the greatly elongated feathers of his wing coverts.
as many as forty male birds assemble in one patch of the forest, but each has his own cleared arena on the ground beneath him.
the performers squabble among themselves while they wait for their audience.
the female may or may not be impressed by the relative merits of the costumes or the dance steps, but in some way she makes a selection.
a tap on the back of the winner and he claims his prize.
it's as though this great age has enabled the forces of nature to produce specialised creatures to live in every tiny niche in this ancient and stable environment.
just consider, for example, how many creatures have developed not just a generalised camouflage but a close and precise impersonation.
a big storm is preceded by a violent gale which for a few minutes lashes the tall trees and rocks the canopy.
the huge heavy drops begin to fall, first slowly and then in drenching torrents.
in places, the floor of the forest becomes a flood, sweeping in sheets through the trees down to the rivers.
when the storm has passed, then the blessings of the water it has brought can be enjoyed.
the jaguar is an excellent swimmer and seems positively to enjoy doing so, for it's seldom found far from water.
it actually hunts as it wades, catching crocodiles and frogs and even fish.
one of the small creatures which doesn't enjoy a soaking manages to pass the storm in perfect dryness and is still snug in its remarkable shelter.
the leaf of this heliconia is hanging in an unnaturally protective way.
the great weight of water hanging on its foliage was finally more than it could carry.
the death of this old tree was the starting gun for a feverish race.
the competitors are the spindly seedlings mostly buried under this wreckage of branches.
had this tree not fallen, they would have been doomed to an early death, because once they had consumed the food in the big seeds from which they sprouted, there would have not been enough light down here for them to grow any further.
to begin with, shrubs appear which specialise in open sites like these.
they flower quickly and disperse their seeds to other temporary clearings, but in a year or so the sapling trees have over-topped them.
my wife and i just went out to look after our little summer house.
i told the mayor we were on our way with your lingonberries.
are you saying you are indifferent to the political regime you live under?
no, the war has been going on for so long... it is so hard...
what is going to happen when the dreamer wakes up, ashamed.
we have reason to believe you have been collaborating with the other side.
filip says i can buy myself out of this, since the organistion is in need of cash.
therefore, dear eva, please borrow me the money i gave you.
you're making it sound as if i've done something positively nefarious.
and all i've done is pay you $10,000 in advance... to come and play in one of the loveliest corners of the world.
you may have the formal training, but i have the hard-earned experience.
after two years of bailing you out in case after case...
i'll give you a chance to put your money where your mouth is.
i'll bet you that i can find carlton shepherd before you.
the clerk there told me carlton wanted to buy a boat.
so he sent him to a friend of his at the docks.
well, for giving us a shot at $30,000... he can do handstands on the deck naked as far as i'm concerned.
besides, i'm beginning to savor the challenge of finding this fellow.
i'm glad to see there are no hard feelings about what happened to your raft.
on the contrary, i'm delighted to see that you've entered into the spirit of things.
oh, experience, and the fact that while miss holt was changing clothes on the yacht...
i called the local constabulary and arranged a generous donation to the pension fund.
he was a mercenary soldier in one of those african wars about 10 years ago.
thought he'd get rich quick, so he kills two payroll guards his own side... and lit out of the swamp with a payroll of £400,000 and vanished.
the least you can do is tell us what this is all about.
well, like all enemies, wainright and i began as the best of friends.
but wainright shot two guards, and suddenly we had a battalion on our tail.
and, to make matters worse, he-he brought a south african girl with him.
now, i know you don't believe that i didn't take all of it.
but, we went through a lot together... and i figured that if either of us got out alive, we deserved a fair stake.
uh, pardon me... but, uh, for those of us who are not fluent in, uh, chess.
- a gambit is a ploy used to set up a surprise attack.
fortune was allowing me to do to moreland what he had done to me.
he blames moreland for the death of the woman he loved.

fortune was allowing me to do to moreland what he had done to me.
he blames moreland for the death of the woman he loved.
i returned for my three books, gentlemen, but i also need clothes.
though the days are warm enough for a man to run around stark naked, the nights are not.
for example, she wishes i looked a little more like charles bronson.
and i wish she looked a little less like charles bronson.
you still can't stand the sight of me with another woman, huh?
my heart goes out to any living creature in your company.
once the baby's born we'll fight over boy names or girl names.
you don't have to wait till the baby's born if you use sonar.
not triple a, but the food was good and she's got pretty good table manners.
high praise from a man who thinks mashed potatoes are finger food.
so you didn't make any plans to see each other again?
i like it when a woman is hot for me, but this is ridiculous.
i like you and i respect you too much not to be honest.
now i'm sorry if i misled you, but i just don't want to pursue this relationship.
sam, i will think of you every time i see something scurry under the sink.
i don't mean to seem ungrateful, but what exactly did you say about me in group therapy?
i sent away for the cashmere months before just to get that particular grade.
i consulted a colourist to determine the best colours for you and i hand-dyed the fabric myself.
i did the best i could when i was with you.
you're right, i have blind spots and i'm not a very good boyfriend, but i never tried harder with any woman in my life.
for example, she wishes i looked a little more like charles bronson.
and i wish she looked a little less like charles bronson.

why don't you just name him precious or pumpkin pie and be done with it?
my ex may not be a class act, but he's got a first-rate male name, nick.
i know it was stupid and cruel and i could have handled it better.
i guess i could have pretended to be sick for a few days first.
it's something that will change the way you feel about sam.
nothing you could ever say will change the way i feel about him.
no matter what you ever do, no matter where you ever go, i'll never get over you.
amanda, do you remember the man i used to talk about in group therapy?
sam, i will think of you every time i see something scurry under the sink.
i don't mean to seem ungrateful, but what exactly did you say about me in group therapy?
i consulted a colourist to determine the best colours for you and i hand-dyed the fabric myself.
i would have made the steak knives except i hocked my forge to buy the bar.
you're right, i have blind spots and i'm not a very good boyfriend, but i never tried harder with any woman in my life.
we had some bad times, but the good times with you were some of the best of my life.
it's fine if you take hold of this good opportunity and then come back tomorrow.
dayū here has gone to the trouble of showing her concern for you as well.
it has only these four strings and a board for its trunk....
and yet a rich variety of sounds can come out of it...
it is this crosspiece that acts as both the bones supporting the body of the biwa as well as its heart.
however, if this crosspiece was merely straight and stiff and everything was tight and tense you wouldn't get much sound from it.
you could say that where the biwa's tonal richness is born from is in the power of both ends of this crosspiece and its ability to move around with a moderate amount of slack.
in other words, i believe the mental readiness with which we humans should live should be similar to that of this biwa.
making an uproar in front of the main gate to the red-light district is uncouth.
if a government official like itakura were to come here and get involved you can expect he won't treat this as a mere quarrel case.
if that happens, each and every one of you would become a disgrace to all those who call themselves samurai.
and as for the justification the yashioka's teachers and students are using here wouldn't that rather make you the laughingstock of the world?
the nominal head of the yoshiokas will be the sole child of kasei genzaemon, seijūrō and denshichirō's uncle whose name is genjirō.
while genjirō is the heir to the yoshioka clan as he is a novice, he will be present and attended by many assistants.
furthermore, approximately 10 of our senior people will stay with them.
the rest of you divide yourselves up among the three roads and hide somewhere along the way.
as soon as he entrusted you with us, he left for edo right away.
in his message he said he would fullfil his promise upon the occasion of you two re-encountering one another.
you cut down yoshioka seijūrō and denshichirō and furthermore, you also cut down mibu genjirō.
so with that, your duel with the yoshiokas should have been finished.
however much you may say it was the way of the samurai, that was a cold-blooded act!
if i hadn't cut them down, i'd be the one who was dead.
it means there is no lord anywhere who would be able to employ you.
not for as long as the world of the tokugawa continues!
takezō, you cut down yoshioka seijūrō and denshichirō and furthermore, you also cut down mibu genjirō.
so with that, your duel with the yoshiokas should have been finished.
when the chance comes, kill the new shōgun, hidetada, with a pistol.
moreover, for the pistol you'll use i will bury that with my own hands beneath the camellia tree inside the castle.
if you dig it up under cover of darkness, you'll be okay.
but, because the workers are sent home once it grows dark you'll have to come up with some scheme to get it yourself.
with the move of the shogunate to edo, that city became the center of japan...
edo ...and the entire city was full of life under what was called a "rush of construction."
from the buzen kokura fief, hosokawa tadatoshi of the hosokawa family...
hosokawa tadatoshi ...was living in the daimyo's residence his family maintained in edo.
but whenever i have a match with someone anymore, i don't enjoy it.
the sword i loved so much ever since i was a child;
don't go making this nothin' but a boring puddle of yer own crap!
over in da thickets along the riverbed, ya kin eat all the buds ya want and ya kin live out here in da sun, while yer bellies play toots with yer farts!
musashi-dono, for what reason do you walk along the path of the sword?
well then, i hope you can find a true meaning for it someday.
what you are doing now to the soil to try and make it disappear right away...
that's just the sort of thinking that led you into such a rough life...
is it to make a name for yourself even without a successful career?
or is it to leave your name to posterity as the man who defeated sasaki kojirō?
it was with such a selfish desire that i annihilated the yoshioka school.
i snatched away the lives of more than 70 good people by murdering them.
still, a fight between two geniuses like musashi and kojirō has a different meaning than any normal fight.
for those people who follow the way of the sword all the way...
rather than just in terms of potential, let's say this is their store for the future.
when someone exceeds their own limits then the store of that potential grows larger.
when musashi and kojirō fight they expand those limits many, many times over.
and with that the potential for humanity as a whole becomes this much greater.
now, you're not get anywhere on your own, you're just much too upset.
just get in the squad car and we'll find her, okay?
that quick, happy wave of hers and then she disappeared inside.
she was excited, looking forward to a new experience, and totally without fear.
now, her defence will prove that mrs. colby is innocent, and mrs. colby has every intention of remaining in denver to face the charge and to see her name cleared.
i've reviewed the basics of this case, sketchy as they are for the moment.
then why didn't you go out and look for her and try to find her?
what do you think i've been doing for the past five hours?
i do know that she told steven that she was having excruciating headaches.
we really should have paid more attention to her, blake, as her parents.
the son who not only has my blood, but my brains.
you trust me enough to put your fate in my hands?
except that even with a genius like ballard, it isn't gonna be easy getting information out of her.
each time that i feel i'm about to make some progress, either she gets upset or her friend steps in with his alternatives and his advisements.
tell the lawyers that i'll be back to them in a day or two with a plan of action.
tell claudia to go ahead at la mirage any way she thinks is best.
meaning that i spent the day and night going through colbyco's sacred books and i found a not-so-sacred bookkeeping error.
and the more i investigated, the more i realised it was no error.
they confirmed that you withdrew $5 million on the day you left for hong kong.
did you use it to buy those few bolts of silk there, mother?
as for rashid ahmed and that money, do i have to remind you, of all people, that it was colbyco who started the search for oil in that area?
and your father, knowing this, ruthlessly squeezed me out of our part of the negotiations.
and if i say it's safe for him to play with this toy, then it is.
and i want this nervous nellie of a nanny to give him the truck back now.
my mama used to say i had a way with words when i was a little boy.
and her dream was for me to grow up and write poems for a greeting card company.
was she disappointed when you turned out to be a mere music tycoon?
well, when i didn't win a prize for an oatmeal-jingle contest,
i guess she kind of resigned herself to my doing just about anything.
about the entertainment, i'll let you know as soon as possible.
i don't mean to bring up sad memories, but you were a father.
even for only a few minutes of that poor baby's life.
i know how upset you are about losing denver-carrington and about fallon.
and i respect your right to grieve, but not to just let your whole life slip away without a fight.
the rules of hunting day in this year are same as before, i'm the leader on the left, ba is the leader on the right, walk up 3 steps if you agree, stay around if you don't agree.
ok, now this, my horsewhip fell on whose horse, who is the leader of right side, how?

today many cases of incest want to tell us what you think before proceed to the first call?
so ... first let me say that my research in this area is the most comprehensive and has prove that i'm right again and again.
do not forget the crazy brother may be the crazy wife ...
hello ... may be insane as a fuck ... should be more careful ...
and my husband likes to see me but have sex with another man.
and should be with the married forever ... and beginning to like it considers this an anomaly?
the truth is that there are more major causes for this issue
i believe that to explain and current families are the root causes problems of society
i'm certainly convinced ... that they grow up both leaf plot to protect themselves from external factors.
for example in my family i have two daughters ... which have a nurturing ... and attending a private girls' school until they graduate
joan is the top ... and i thought how nice it was my son ...
not what they did ... but how it reminded me me with my husband.
every night his father junior left the city for work ...

(megatron) if optimus prime's laser core was in fact extinguished, we shall destroy the accursed autobots and none shall stand between us and our conquest of the universe.
the autobots are without their mighty leader, and four of their number have been vanquished on cybertron.
-then i humbly suggest we attack their base now while we have the advantage!
well, i talked to rick and t.c... but they said they didn't want to hang out with a bunch of opera guys.
the sandwich islands savoyards and sir cedric brooke... are hardly a bunch of opera guys.
the last time i talked to him, he was so belligerent, i did some checking.
i found out that his two friends tried to leave the group... and a week later were found dead.
well, he told me that they give all of their material belongings... to their spiritual leader.
and that they do honest labor for their soul's salvation... and give the money to the poor.
tell me that mr. masters' camera is not-- the camera is fine!
the only reason that i'm a little bit wet... is i was conducting a surveillance.
i need you to run down an address for me, from a license plate.
thomas, i just happen to be a little busy right now.
i'm trying to find a place for my poker game by tomorrow afternoon.
how long could it take you to run down an address?
no matter where we were, there were always two things that i could count on.
one, that my brother, eric, was my best friend... number two, that my mother would make tuna casserole for dinner.
but the dragon symbol of this order told me... these were not the types who ask for money at airports.
i didn't want to overreact by charging in there, gun in hand... but, like my uncle george always said...
that does not alter the fact... that he called and personally asked me to put together this production of the mikado.
if he arrives and finds either the production... or my security measures lacking, i shall be personally humiliated.
and my reaction is that it always pays to be smarter than the other guy.
especially when the other guy may be waiting to do you in.
i am simply appalled that you could behave... in such an unprofessional, irresponsible manner.
your duty is to remain close to the stage at all times in case i need you.
(higgins) lf it's a matter of billing... i am afraid the programs have already been printed.
oh, jonathan, it's not the billing, or the money... or a larger role.
i'm sorry to say that ever since sir cedric and i were in short pants... long before he was sir cedric... we have inspired in each other this unflattering competitive streak.
as a matter of fact, i had even secretly begun to wish that he wouldn't show up... so that i might take his place.
i've always fancied i would make a far better lord high executioner than he.
dare i hope that you will find it in your heart... to forgive my churlish behavior... and return with me to the estate for this afternoon's performance?
the only difference between then and now... was that eric swung a lot harder than a 10-year-old.
i was dizzy, disoriented, and my legs felt as heavy as concrete pillars.
but the worst feeling, was knowing i had to face sally... and tell her her brother was dead.
that i'd been forced to kill him, was going to make even less sense to her.
and as for you, rick, i'm sure the board of directors of the club... would want to seriously reconsider the employment of a known gambler.
now, of course, if both of you were to volunteer to be in the show... i might possibly be able to use my influence with both the ladies... and the board of directors.
and even though eric had failed, i realized he was only plan a.
if i didn't find a way to get home soon... the lord high executioner was gonna be executed himself.
i made a deal with higgins to cover security for magnum.
and that will take care of my part of the debt.
if you had been attending to security, as i asked you to do... you would have uncovered the plot... before it got to some ridiculous cliffside confrontation.
if you had told me why sir cedric was here, i could have handled security.
with all i have to do... and you still haven't made arrangements for security for the performance?
well, i talked to rick and t.c... but they said they didn't want to hang out with a bunch of opera guys.
how was i going to get the money to come to hawaii?
then he and his two buddies joined this eastern chanting group.
this group that he hooked up with... did he say anything about their activities?
well, he told me that they give all of their material belongings... to their spiritual leader.
since 1885, when gilbert and sullivan's immortal mikado was first presented... the three little maids have performed this song exactly as i have taught it to you.
in your hands, ladies... is a tradition stretching back to the glorious days of the empire.
our guest star, sir cedric brooke, will have no rehearsal time with us.
he will arrive prepared to step into the classic blocking and staging.
i'll ignore that, and i told her there would be absolutely no problem... none whatsoever, with her staying here on the estate... in one of the many, many empty rooms which are always ready... completely prepared in the spirit of hospitality robin masters is famous for.
miss de forest, i regret that what magnum proposed is out of the question.
i mean, you can't be expected to do everything... constantly being tugged in one direction or another.
well, it would give me an opportunity to step back... and look at the production objectively.
thomas, i just happen to be a little busy right now.
i'm trying to find a place for my poker game by tomorrow afternoon.
no matter where we were, there were always two things that i could count on.
one, that my brother, eric, was my best friend... number two, that my mother would make tuna casserole for dinner.
but the dragon symbol of this order told me... these were not the types who ask for money at airports.
i didn't want to overreact by charging in there, gun in hand... but, like my uncle george always said...
i am simply appalled that you could behave... in such an unprofessional, irresponsible manner.
your duty is to remain close to the stage at all times in case i need you.
as a matter of fact, i had even secretly begun to wish that he wouldn't show up... so that i might take his place.
i've always fancied i would make a far better lord high executioner than he.
i was dizzy, disoriented, and my legs felt as heavy as concrete pillars.
but the worst feeling, was knowing i had to face sally... and tell her her brother was dead.
that i'd been forced to kill him, was going to make even less sense to her.
but then, things weren't making a lot of sense to me, either.
all my personal prestige on the line, along with my reputation as an artist.
the entire british colony here today... not to mention, a guest star of international renown.
however, it does occur to me that your half of that sordid gambling debt... must be equal to the monthly payment for your helicopter.
and as for you, rick, i'm sure the board of directors of the club... would want to seriously reconsider the employment of a known gambler.
now, of course, if both of you were to volunteer to be in the show...
i might possibly be able to use my influence with both the ladies... and the board of directors.
and even though eric had failed, i realized he was only plan a.
if i didn't find a way to get home soon... the lord high executioner was gonna be executed himself.
i made a deal with higgins to cover security for magnum.
and that will take care of my part of the debt.
if you had been attending to security, as i asked you to do... you would have uncovered the plot... before it got to some ridiculous cliffside confrontation.
if you had told me why sir cedric was here, i could have handled security.

sneaking up on the little creatures and blowing their heads off.
think of our intruder as a mallard whose time has come.
i mean, after all, if i'm the head of this company and she's merely an employee...
i mean, one can't expect an employee to remember every little intimate detail... about the boss, can you, hmm?
you know, we haven't- uh, you and i, you know... kind of-
perhaps, if you would allow me to, uh, jog my memory.
but if i'm not me, then who the devil am i?
well, you've always been very evasive and mysterious about your background.
yes, but i must have given you a clue, i mean, some kind of hint to my identity.
well, among other things, you prospected for gold in the yucatán... you boxed your way across south america...
you-you stole a famous painting called the five nudes of cairo.
and when i met you, you carried five passports... each with a name of a character humphrey bogart played in a movie.
well, there's no cops bangin'on the door, so what did steele know?
oh, i wish mr. armdale were here to guide me through these treacherous waters.
well, tomorrow it'll be over... and we'll all have enough green to live out our days in quiet splendor.
just the same, have clancy and foster... keep following steele and the girl.
sure, wasn't it just saturday last that you stood in this selfsame room?
surely, you can't have forgotten the dancing, the singing, the jollity?
and a finer man now never bent his elbow to a glass of ale.
oh, we gave him the very devil of a send-off, such a wake.
i don't seem to be following you this morning, mrs. armdale.
oh, i know what you're going through, absolutely know what you're going through.
i think just one face is all he should be subjected to.
my cable must have seemed very melodramatic... but you see, your name and address were about all that we found on him.
- but i think you did lie to me, didn't you?
i don't have to recall who i am to know, uh... what i am, hmm?
looking at you now, i can't believe that for nearly three years, i haven't, uh-
you know, we haven't- uh, you and i, you know... kind of-
well, you've always been very evasive and mysterious about your background.
yes, but i must have given you a clue, i mean, some kind of hint to my identity.

do you know, i reckon it was the best party now that he ever attended.
i have a feeling that i never, uh, knew who my real father was actually.
in fact, i don't think i even saw my birth certificate.
if anything like that were to happen to me, i hope i'd be half the man you were.
i don't seem to be following you this morning, mrs. armdale.
to remember that, uh, you and i are still just, uh... good friends.
if my husband were alive, he'd give you a good thrashing!
in your infinite power, show me the meaning of my life.

behold, there you are lying in front of me good father.
now i swear to you that you can count on me.
this grave wont bury you, i will guard your soul, while i live i will continue your legacy!
help me now, god, help my nation, help me protect this country!
there is no other way than god's way, whatever it may bring.
and one hundred thousand good soldiers will answer him if need be!
well accept it, and you will keep your rank and title.
istvan will be the king, by fire and iron if need be.
take this villainous traitor and pull him up onto the first tree!
lots of water has run and more will still run, dear, in the old danube(river).
there isnt any peace yet, and you dont know where you'll be after the war.
you need to win on the lands and you need to win at the castles.
you have use for everyone thats waiting for you to get on the throne, whether they stand by you out of interest or loyalty.
oh good mother, the nation wants peace and so does god.
why do we need war, our blood just runs and our nation shrinks.
man is a pitiful creature that cant see past its own fate, hes easily mislead by some well thought out lies.
people bent on being enemies, this here is not a nation, its in all our best interests that you be king of this country!
our sun has risen, istvan is our lord, let the light of his grace shine upon us.
our hearts are grateful, our happiness sounds aloud, beautiful magyarorszag, our dear home!
all who carry a sword are in danger of a sword, but on a crossroads between two fires, only fools hope for peace.
tell me, how much is a man worth if hes innocent but weak!
tell me, how much is he worth if hes preparing for a bloody victory.
oh good lord, i dont know anymore who i should be loyal to.
my sword grows heavy from your law, if i have to kill to defend you.
tell me, how much is a man worth if hes innocent but weak.
i didnt ask how long they would walk among us, those eye-rolling false priests.
the only thing i ask, awaiting your answer, should we be prisoners or free?
theres nobody worth more than you, that burns with a hotter fire, more understanding to a woman, nobody else.
speak to us with nice words, embrace us with your arms, cover us with your kisses, dear lord.
eye to eye, this is how our honor demands it, honor is worth more than anything.
our proud nation wont stand for foreign rule, our truth will prevail don't you fear!
i saw you atop the four largest castles, the sky became overcast and many girls were left as orphans.
all who carry a sword are in danger of a sword.
they call me a pagan despite the fact that i took the byzantine symbol upon myself, the only goal in that was to preserve our freedom.
they consider me a pagan because i wont endure the priests power,
they cry sinner, when this country is just fighting for its freedom.
they consider me pagan, because i fly in the face of conquerors, everyone here is pagan if they're with me and not istvan.
its too late to rethink all this, the time for peace has passed.
its too late to reinterpret the past, the world is forced on a path.
don't think that i don't like you, the throne is yours, if you accept what you have to do.
in our hands is a nation and the country's fate, all roads lead to rome, or into destruction.
i've brought a bloody sword, our ancestors bloody sword, the nation is preparing for a fate turning war.
we will defend our freedom, we will stand against istván, we dont need this pale godliness.
árpád's free country, honfoglalok's (home occupiers) blood, wont endure foreign bull-headedness!
our dreams will come true, or we'll perish to the last man, but better death than servitude!
koppány, if you defeat istván, our hero's wont die, the nation will be vast.
from rome to greek byzantine, from the rhine to levedia, they'll fear your successors names.
at mohács we will win, györgy dózsa will be our king, our large power will last for centuries.
rákóczi's will win the world over, with kossuth it will be realized, the republic of the danube.
my stars dressed in mourning, hope has left me, my god, even a brother is an enemy.

rome's blessing will be upon you, and you will win your salvation on this earth.
the pope sends his flag spear, and a crown for you.
appreciate who fights for you and they will be loyal to you, distribute koppány's spoils amongst them,
yours is this vast beautiful country and they're faithful to you, so distribute it amongst them so they'll guard your borders.
long live istván, the wise and truthful, long live istván our monarch.
long live istván, who defeated the evil, hail to you monarch!
let me bury him in the ground, and give rest to his peaceless soul.
be our true and understanding lord, if on this world we're your servants now.
oh good lord, here on this earth i'm your chosen one, you trusted me with this great burden and i fear i will collapse.
tell me, how much is a man worth if his honor is weak.
ive accepted your laws, but i wont be a slave to anyone.
tell me, whats the worth of who would follow you with their heart.

tell me, whats the worth of who would accidentally face against you.
our sun has risen, istván is our lord, let the light of his grace shine upon us.
our hearts are grateful, our happiness sounds aloud, beautiful magyarorszag, our dear home!
one hundred years after the conquest of their new homeland, the leaders of the hungarian tribal alliance realized that they have to create a western european-style state for their nomadic people, otherwise the nation would be destroyed.
the creation of this new state meant the creation of the feudal economical and political system in the country, the accepting of the roman rite of the catholic church and the creation of a centralized monarchy.
geza, the grand prince of the hungarians prepared these great reforms and his son, stephen (970-1038) implemented them with merciless consequence.
thanks to him the hungarian speaking hungarian people are still have their own national home in europe.
when stephen inherited the throne in 997, he had to defeat his uncle, chief koppany, who was against his new order and the christian faith.
in their war, koppany fought for the old, familiar order, while stephen fought for something new and unfamiliar.
when koppany besieged veszprem, the castle of the wife of the late prince geza, the mother of stephen, in order to force the widow to marry him according to the ancient custom, the young stephen defeated him in battle and had his body quartered.
after his victory stephen asked for and received a royal crown from the pope.
he was crowned 25 december 1000 as the first king of hungary.
50 years after his death, stephen was canonized as a saint by the church and became a christian hero and idol.
give me strength to fight to make my life worthy of you, good and beautiful.
help us to make this place according to your will, to your land, and i offer my life to you.
every man is weak and searching for a place where he can sell himself for a better price.
always had and always will have, that's only business, everyone has opportunities.
every man is weak and agrees with the side which pays more.
every man is weak and stands on the side which promises more.
always had and always will have, that's only business, everyone has opportunities.
always had and always will have, either high up and low down,
every man is weak and conceived in sin and still live in sin.
oh, my god, please help us, comfort us in our troubles.
his soul is up in the sky now, walking among the stars.
this land is devastated, he was a wise leader of our people, and i don't know yet what he knew.
there is no other way just the way of god, no matter what you will find there,
there is no greater force in this world than his will.
you will be rich and you will have a pompous court.
so listen to my words, accept the offer and the ancient law will prevail.
he nuzzles the mud all day and wallows on the dunghill.
if he has a sinful urge he chases a goat around, bah-bah-bah!
plenty of blood ran and more will run down in the water of the old danube.
there is no peace yet and you can't know where you will be after the war.
but on the crossroad between the rock and the hard place, only a fool believes in peace.
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who is guiltless but weak?
tell me, what is the worth of a man if he prepares for a bloody victory.
oh, my good lord, i don't know anymore who i should be loyal to.
my sword would strike down upon your law, if i need to kill to defend you.
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who is guiltless but weak?
tell me, what is the worth of a man if he prepares for a bloody victory.
you are so far away from me and still so close.
you're listening to me and i feel my heart answers to you.
oh my good lord, i got my soul and my position from you.
fly far, fly high, fly on the light wings of the wind,
carry the news of a new spring, fly high free bird.
i feel, that my body and soul want you, just you.
my flattering, seductive wives, your love draws me into a luscious marshland.
my flattering, seductive wives, your love draws me into a luscious marshland.
my wives, who tiring me with your devotion, you will get everything.
annoying, cocky fellow, down with stephen, we don't need him anymore.
he thinks it's enough for him to command and everyone scurries there.
or let's say a little dagger, long enough to reach his heart.
the dreams of priests and upstart landlords would be over in a tick.
annoying, cocky fellow, down with stephen, we don't need him anymore.
he thinks it's enough for him to command and everyone scurries there.
they consider me a pagan, because i don't accept the rule of the priests.
they call it a sin, when the country defends its freedom.
they consider me a pagan, because i stand up against the invaders.
they consider everyone a pagan, who supports me and not stephen.
it's too late to reconsider this all, it's too late for us to desire peace.
it's too late to take it another way, the world moves towards its destiny.
the throne is yours, if you do what has to be done.
the fate of a nation and a country is in our hands.
the free people of arpad, the blood of the conquerors... can't accept foreign yoke.
our dream will come true... or we will all die, but it's better to die free than live as a slave.
but alas, the days just keep getting sadder in this world.
my bright sun turned dark, and it looks down on a bloodstained ground.
if you support the holy church, the blessing of rome will be on you.
and this way you can obtain your salvation here in this world.
light and glory on your name, but please don't despise the defeated.
hear my plea, my lord, give my dead father's body to me.
let me bury him into the ground, let his restless soul find peace.
be our true, gracious lord, as we are your servants in this world.
oh, my good lord, i am your chosen one in this world.
you entrusted this burden on me and i am afraid i will collapse under it.
tell me, what is the worth of a man, if his integrity is weak?
tell me, what is the worth of a man, if he is doomed to triumph?
oh, my good lord, give me strength to bear your burden.
i accepted your rules, but i won't be other people's servant.
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who wants to follow you?
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who could defend you even against you?
you are so far away from me and still so close.
you're listening to me and i feel my heart answers to you.
fill my soul, my heavy heart with loyalty, with kindness, with love.
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who wants to follow you?
tell me, what is the worth of a man, who could defend you even against you?
you are so far away from me and still so close.

unfortunately, the tests show that this kind of robot, which was built by us, cannot be useful to society.
consequently, we've decided to rebuild it, based on a... more conventional model.
don't you think opening the robot up will mean a step backwards?
that this fear about galax gaining human abilities, could be considered a victory of mysticism over science?
my proposal was to repair all the damage then open the robot up.
if we want good results again, my view is, we must all work together.
that's why we're here, we've the same obligations, student and professor.
if you think you've nothing to learn; give your place to the many teens wanting to learn.

i mean, i wanted to sacrifice the precentral vein in order to get some exposure.
but because of this guy's normal variation, i got excited and all the sudden i didn't know whether i was looking at the precentral vein or one of the internal cerebro veins or the vein of galen or the basilar vein of rosenthal, so one my own me at this point i was ready to say "that's it, let's get out".

sources close to the national security consortium have refused to comment.
let's get on back to three great modern country hits in a row.
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way.
we have created a device called an oscillation overthruster, which systematically reorders matter by annihilating electrons, positrons...
oh, no. lt's not obvious at all. lf it was obvious, everybody would be doing it every day.
see, by all accounts, it appears as though i literally went right through a mountain.
but you could take that mountain and pulverise it... and sift through it like breadcrumbs for the rest of your natural life... and you would never ever find... this.
and yet this living organism came out of that mountain in texas with me.
- lt was purple. lt'll be dark before we even find it.
we get professor hikita to cough up the crucial missing circuit and then we finally get our butts off this rock!
will everybody shut up so i can hear the rest of this thing?
and now you, buckaroo banzai, have unintentionally helped john whorfin with the success of your oscillation overthruster.
for our intelligence warns us that he intends to steal your overthruster.
if he should attempt this, we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle-beam weapon from your airspace to smolensk in the union of soviet socialist republics.
secretary of defense mckinley and my national security advisor smirnoff, are visiting me, but i have no secrets from them.
well, something has reared its ugly head in outer space, mr president, and it looks like the earth is caught in a crossfire.
may i pass along my congratulations for your great interdimensional breakthrough.
i'm sure in the miserable annals of the earth, you will be duly enshrined.

let's get on back to three great modern country hits in a row.
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way.
we have created a device called an oscillation overthruster, which systematically reorders matter by annihilating electrons, positrons...
if it was obvious, everybody would be doing it every day.
see, by all accounts, it appears as though i literally went right through a mountain.
ai, you set up the grid and get the last known coordinates.
tommy, hop on the marconi and see if we got blue blazes in a ten-minute radius.
will everybody shut up so i can hear the rest of this thing?
and now you, buckaroo banzai, have unintentionally helped john whorfin with the success of your oscillation overthruster.
for our intelligence warns us that he intends to steal your overthruster.
if he should attempt this, we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic communications and fire a particle-beam weapon from your airspace to smolensk in the union of soviet socialist republics.
now, all i'm saying is that this jet car belongs in the hands of defense.
i mean, if the banzai institute doesn't want to sell it to us, then we're gonna have to take it from them!
well, something has reared its ugly head in outer space, mr president, and it looks like the earth is caught in a crossfire.
we have reason to believe that there are vicious red aliens walking freely among us, posing as the owners and operators of yoyodyne propulsion systems.
may i pass along my congratulations for your great interdimensional breakthrough.
i'm sure in the miserable annals of the earth, you will be duly enshrined.

30 years ago, almost to this day, my mother and father, doctors sandra and masado banzai.
gave their lives for what was then considered to be a very insane notion... the possibility of contacting alien life..

despite the king's repeated appeals... the political leaders with their quarrels... had led the country to a dead end.
the task of our committee is to confirm whether the death of our dear bogosav was caused by an imperialistic diversion or a result of some other circumstances.
bogosav was the president of the mnc gornji jaukovac, therefor the leading man in the village.

i heard district leader nadisch... and the farmers' leader onh in simmern.
they spoke about debt conversion... and the farmers... and the laws about entailed estates... but, frankly, i don't understand all that.
that's why people like us from the pany... are here to explain to you.

so let one prayer arise from here... make our armband's meaning very clear.
o father in heaven, protect us still... as you've always done and always will.
help us to conquer enslavement and pain... so that finally we're free people again.
our faith, so sacred, so immense, will not waver, to the last defence.
for we must, we want to free our land... so that as pure german stock we stand.
when i think of our turnover in the last three weeks, my god!
eduard, after closing time today i sold another three gold watches.
maybe, or especially, because you're part of the team driven by the best pilot of the dacia automobile plant from piteºti.
so, you are due to reveal to the motorsport fans something about your passion for engines.
if the man wanted to be nice, could i say no?
come on, forget that upset, you're a young and beautiful girl.
at the junction with strada libertãþii, she passed on the red light.
she didn't stop at the signal, and didn't show her documents.
but you have to prove that, you're a good worker for every job that you're given.
or else you won't be able to notice the weaknesses of a car.
but he kept working so hard he ended up getting sick.
shigeru took his place and tried his hardest to make them grow.{ i guess it's better than sucking salaryman-cock}
percy phelps, brilliant boy, carried off every prize the school had to offer, went on to fresh triumphs at cambridge.
i must confess, he'd passed completely out of my mind until this.
well, i mean, if your cases are more interesting than mine.
i was gonna say, my practice would do very well for a day or two.
most regrettable, and it is of the utmost importance that nothing further should leak out.
the french and russian embassies would pay an immense sum to learn its contents.
well, in outline it defined the position of great britain towards the triple alliance in the event of the french fleet gaining complete ascendancy over italy in the mediterranean.
i returned straight to my office where i found a colleague of mine,
you made sure that he was gone before you started work?
quite sure, and i copied as fast as i could, for i knew that joseph, my fiancé's brother--
i thought a cup of coffee might clear my brain, so i rang the commissioner who stays on duty all night in a small lodge at the bottom of the stairs.
to my surprise, it was a woman who answered the summons.
it's the bell in the room in which you're working, sir.
you ran back upstairs and the document was gone from your desk.
and the room and the corridor all seemed exactly as i'd left it!
percy has drawn a rough chart of the building, mr. holmes, which he thought might be of use.
on your discovery of the theft, what did you do then?
well, i recognized in an instant the thief must have come up through the side door.
well, you'd have met him if he'd come the other way.
and you are satisfied that they could not have been concealed in the room or in the corridor?
on the corner we found a policeman, but he'd seen no one leave the building in the last quarter of an hour except for the commissioner's wife, so we ran through to whitehall.
it was full of traffic, people coming and going, all only too eager to find a place of shelter on so wet a night.
my father is an iron-master, and a staunch supporter of the conservative party.
she came down here to meet percy's people, and you came as escort?
inspector forbes of the yard arrived to take up the case with considerable energy.
we hired a hansom, and within half an hour we were at the tangeys' home in brixton.
after about ten minutes, we heard the front door, and here we made one serious mistake for which i blame myself.
mum, there's two men in the parlor wants to talk to ya'.
we've reason to believe that you've taken a paper of importance from the foreign office, and you ran in here to dispose of it.
now, you better come back with us to scotland yard to be searched.
a four-wheeler was brought and we all three drove back in it to scotland yard.
i waited in an agony of suspense until the female searcher came back with her report.
i believe a police officer drove me to waterloo where by the merest good fortune,
i met dr. ferrier, who lives near us and was traveling down by the next train.
i was surprised, but not unduly worried that he was alone.
percy often worked late, and i knew there was another train.
it was evident that poor percy was in for a long illness.
so, joseph was bundled up to my room, and this was turned into a sick room for me.
she nursed me by day, a hired nurse looked after me at night, for in the mad fits i was capable of anything.
it's only in the last few days that my reason has slowly cleared.
i've wired inspector forbes, but he's told me no clue has been discovered.
so i turn to you, mr. holmes, as my last hope.
it can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner.
our highest assurance of the goodness of providence seems to me to rest in the flowers.
it is only goodness which gives extras, and so i say again, we have much to hope for from the flowers.
do you see any prospect of solving this mystery, mr. holmes?
surely, you don't believe that she had anything to do with it?
the most difficult crime to track down, watson, is the one which is purposeless.
now, this is not purposeless, but who is it that profits by it?
well, there's the french ambassador, the russian, and whoever might sell it to either of those.
on the contrary, in my last 53 cases, my name has appeared in only 4 and the police have the credit in 49.
i don't blame you for not knowing this, you are young and inexperienced.
then since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, it is not unfair to suppose then that the treaty for some reason has not reached them.
but holmes, we can hardly suppose that the thief took the treaty in order to... frame it and hang it on his wall.
if we keep our courage and patience, the truth must come out.
miss harrison, you must remain in this room for the rest of the day.
i have a slight headache and this room is deliciously cool and soothing, thank you, joseph.
mr. phelps, while we're investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry.
there are one or two points i wish to clear up, and your absence, mr. phelps, will rather assist me.
watson, when you reach london drive our friend straight to baker street and remain with him until i see you again.
i remained there until dusk, and then i returned to your house.
i clambered over the wall and made my way through the undergrowth until i reached the stables, just opposite your bedroom window.
the blind in your window had not yet been drawn, and i could see miss harrison reading a book by the light from a lamp.
it was about a quarter-past ten when she closed the book, moved across the room, carrying the lamp with her.
without her cooperation, you would not have that paper in your hand now.
it was a weary vigil, but it had the sort of excitement a sportsman feels when he lies before the watercourse and waits for the big game.
if he's quick enough to catch his bird, well and good.
but if, as i shrewdly suspect, he finds the nest empty, why, all the better for the government.
i fancy lord holdhurst, for one, and mr. percy phelps for another, would much rather the affair never got to a police court.
my god, do you tell me that during my 10 long weeks of agony the stolen papers were in the very room with me all the time?
yes, but his own sister's happiness, and your reputation, your health!
he knew that you often worked late, and he was in town having dinner with his stockbroker, as he told me.
finding no one in there but the light on and work evidently in progress, he rang the bell.
the instant he did so, his eye caught the paper on the table.
he knew at once that chance had put in his way a state document of immense value,
returned alone to woking and concealed it in what he thought was a very safe place, intending to remove it in a day or two, and take it to the french embassy or wherever he thought a long price was to be had.
without a moment's warning he was bundled out of his room and from that moment on, there were always at least two of you in there, preventing him from regaining his treasure, maddening for him.
my suspicions became certainties when the attempt to break in was made on the first night that the hired nurse was absent, which showed that the intruder was well accustomed with the ways of the house.
but he had another chance when you came up to london.
i kept miss harrison in the room all day so as to anticipate him.
but if you already knew the papers were in the room?
i thought they probably were, but i had no desire to rip up all the skirting in search of them.
yes, but why did he try the window when he might have come in through the door?
to appear to be a burglar, and if necessary, make good his escape across the courtyard.
i have no doubt you remember tadpole phelps, who was in the third form when you were in the fifth.
it's possible you may have heard that through my uncle's influence
it seemed to us a piquant thing to chevy him about the playground, hit him over the shins with a wicket.
"do you think you could bring your friend mr. holmes down to see me?"
now, remain behind when the others go, so that you can work at your leisure and without fear of being overlooked.
and when you have finished, relock both the original and the draft in your own desk, and hand them over to me personally tomorrow morning.
this treaty, can you be more precise as to its nature?
well, in outline it defined the position of great britain towards the triple alliance in the event of the french fleet gaining complete ascendancy over italy in the mediterranean.
by 9:00 o'clock, i was feeling drowsy and scarcely a third of the way through.
i thought a cup of coffee might clear my brain, so i rang the commissioner who stays on duty all night in a small lodge at the bottom of the stairs.
i thought of my uncle, his cabinet colleagues, the shame i'd brought upon them, myself, everyone connected with me.
although i was the victim of an accident, there are no allowance for accidents in diplomatic circles.
indeed, mr. holmes, especially when they learned of percy's connection with lord holdhurst.
my father is an iron-master, and a staunch supporter of the conservative party.
the, um, the wedding is planned for september, if the poor chap recovers.
i suppose you only intended a short visit, and then came the smash?
and you get back in here, now go on, and shut the door.
after about ten minutes, we heard the front door, and here we made one serious mistake for which i blame myself.
my family were taking advantage of their trip to america to have several of the upstairs bedrooms redecorated.
it was evident that poor percy was in for a long illness.
it's only in the last few days that my reason has slowly cleared.
i've wired inspector forbes, but he's told me no clue has been discovered.
there is nothing in which deduction is so necessary as in religion.
it can be built up as an exact science by the reasoner.
our highest assurance of the goodness of providence seems to me to rest in the flowers.
it is only goodness which gives extras, and so i say again, we have much to hope for from the flowers.
the most difficult crime to track down, watson, is the one which is purposeless.
now, this is not purposeless, but who is it that profits by it?
but i'm as english in sympathy as you are, mr. holmes.
am i under some sort of cloud because of my name?
on the contrary, in my last 53 cases, my name has appeared in only 4 and the police have the credit in 49.
i don't blame you for not knowing this, you are young and inexperienced.
then since nearly ten weeks have elapsed, it is not unfair to suppose then that the treaty for some reason has not reached them.

i fancy lord holdhurst, for one, and mr. percy phelps for another, would much rather the affair never got to a police court.
from what i gather, he had lost heavily dabbling in stocks, and concealed the fact from his father, a man of strictly conservative habits.
yes, but his own sister's happiness, and your reputation, your health!
he knew that you often worked late, and he was in town having dinner with his stockbroker, as he told me.
but he was free by half past 9:00, and called by your office, entering through the side door.
the instant he did so, his eye caught the paper on the table.
he knew at once that chance had put in his way a state document of immense value,
i kept miss harrison in the room all day so as to anticipate him.
but if you already knew the papers were in the room?
i left her a note to come to london the moment she woke.
but mr. phelps, she knows nothing as yet of her brother's criminality.
i have no doubt you remember tadpole phelps, who was in the third form when you were in the fifth.

i don't blame you for not knowing this, you are young and inexperienced.
but if you wish to get on in your duties you will work with me and not against me!
oh, watson, i won't detain you any longer from your legitimate work.
but i should be extremely obliged if you would come down to woking with me tomorrow, the same train that we took today.
mr. holmes has imbued me with fresh hope, and i feel i'm on the mend.
we have an appointment in church in september, my love, and i mean to keep it.
could it be that i am the center of some monstrous conspiracy, and that my life is aimed at, as well as my honor?
i haven't as far as i know, an enemy in the world!
now, why did the intruder choose the window onto the courtyard?
i should have thought this side of the house would have been easier.
mr. phelps, while we're investigating this minor affair we must not lose sight of our main inquiry.
it would help me very much if you would come up to london with us.
her cuisine is a little limited, but she has as good an idea of breakfast as any scotswoman.
now, what will you take, mr. phelps, curried fowl, eggs, or will you help yourself?
i settled myself into the english countryside and spent a charming afternoon.

yes, well, quite frankly, miss sullivan, i prefer my hogs in the form of bacon.
no,you see, in this one... a respected banker has embezzled $7 50,000.
and two days before the bank examiners are due [ chuckles ] he kills himself!
need i remind you that no one has hired us to investigate any of this?
well, aren't you at all intrigued by grown gentlemen playing at detective?
it cost me a sawbuck, but this cabbie with a busted beak put me onto vince pappas.
last he heard, pappas was chauffeuring for a general ingram... somewhere in santa monica.
of course, i don't have to tell you about cameras, now do i?
- i've had the most difficult time tracing you, mr. geiger.
i was thinking now is as good a time as any... for me to try my luck somewheres else... only, uh, i could use a little stake.
well, i was thinking, uh, five grand... or maybe 1 0 if you're feeling generous.
it ain't fair that you make out so well and i lose my shirt on that lousy portrait studio!
how do you think you'd feel if people suddenly found out who you really are?
don't think i don't know why you're so anxious to pursue this nonexistent case.
you just want to keep me occupied so i won't discover... who's sending me those beautiful flowers.
[ exhales ] laura, this, uh- this poet of the obscene might be a blessing in disguise.
he's made me understand how very much you mean to me.
i think it's time you told us the truth about eddie lucas.
you have a disturbing habit of doing that every time his name is mentioned.
uh, we realized, unfortunately too late for winston... that we're in over our heads.
we've come to ask you not to pursue this any further.
i came across this letter that the general had written for pappas two years ago.
it seems that pappas wanted to open up his own limousine service... but on account of his police record, he was having trouble being bonded.
the killer obviously sat directly behind him... and calmly shot him in the back of the head.
it appears lucas is eliminating everyone who could link him to the embezzlement.
that's why the killer was waiting for geiger in the park.
i mean, winston was dutifully calling in the times and places of the meetings.
ask mildred if you could use the phone in private... then ask the limo service to deliver him?
he didn't suspect a thing when a sweet young lady sat behind him.
my father was a very proud man, miss holt... proud of his position in the community... proud of all that he had accomplished.
the thought of being held up to that kind of public debasement was just too much for him.
what better way to have your cake and eat it too?
aren't you the least bit flattered that i care so much to create such an elaborate ruse?
the wind in your face, 500 c.c.'s throbbing between your legs.
yes, well, quite frankly, miss sullivan, i prefer my hogs in the form of bacon.
no,you see, in this one... a respected banker has embezzled $7 50,000.

don't think i don't know why you're so anxious to pursue this nonexistent case.
you just want to keep me occupied so i won't discover... who's sending me those beautiful flowers.
[ exhales ] laura, this, uh- this poet of the obscene might be a blessing in disguise.
he's made me understand how very much you mean to me.
i think it's time you told us the truth about eddie lucas.
you have a disturbing habit of doing that every time his name is mentioned.
uh, we realized, unfortunately too late for winston... that we're in over our heads.
we've come to ask you not to pursue this any further.
i came across this letter that the general had written for pappas two years ago.
it seems that pappas wanted to open up his own limousine service... but on account of his police record, he was having trouble being bonded.
the killer obviously sat directly behind him... and calmly shot him in the back of the head.
it appears lucas is eliminating everyone who could link him to the embezzlement.
that's why the killer was waiting for geiger in the park.
i mean, winston was dutifully calling in the times and places of the meetings.
ask mildred if you could use the phone in private... then ask the limo service to deliver him?
he didn't suspect a thing when a sweet young lady sat behind him.
my father was a very proud man, miss holt... proud of his position in the community... proud of all that he had accomplished.
the thought of being held up to that kind of public debasement was just too much for him.
what better way to have your cake and eat it too?
aren't you the least bit flattered that i care so much to create such an elaborate ruse?
a new shipment is about to arrive and i can't pay for it.
as i told you last month don't count on working here much longer.
well, i'm sorry, but what you see is what you get.
and what you saw is only part of what you're up against.
a bunch of bad apples she picked up off the streets of new york city.
and now she wants to bring them out here... so's they can terrorize our decent, law-abiding citizens.
well, i think it's time we sashayed down to the old homestead, partner.
(kitt) i think i liked you better when you spoke rock 'n' roll.
she's been blind since birth, kicked around more times than an italian soccer ball.
if you haven't guessed already, michael, my real occupation isn't ranching.
by the way you tried to milk that cow which turned out to be a bull.
seriously, rebecca, i do admire the way you handle the kids.
(kitt) two parts c21, h22, n2o 2... and one part s2o4.
doesn't sound like the recipe to mom's apple pie, does it?
why is this rat so anxious to move rebecca hammond off her ranch?
i'm not sure, but i think it has something to do with those kids.
(michael) kltt, can you give me an overlay of rebecca's ranch?
whatever that "x" represents... i'm positive it's somewhere on rebecca's ranch.
(male narrator) knight rider, a shadowy flight... into the dangerous world of a man... who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner... on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent... the helpless, the powerless... in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
i don't want any nose-to-nose encounters with that machine... until bonnie's had a chance to beef up kitt's weaponry.
karr was kitt's prototype, designed and built by wilton knight... with all of kitt's capabilities.
i can have kltt back from the foundation by this time tomorrow.
twenty-four hours we don't have to install a laser that won't work.
but i had kltt trace the salt water damage to karr's alpha circuits.
if he gets those parts and he repairs them, it's only going to be a matter of hours... before his other systems are up to full strength.
look, if ever we needed to act as a team, it's right now.
you go back in the foundation, you finish the laser, and you bring it back.
(karr) move to the cash computer, and i'll do the rest.
when it comes right down to it, i don't like this.
big ed, i say we fire up this baby right now... and grind those apples into sauce.
look, if you wanna find out about big ed... why don't you just take a little peek inside of his safe?
i thought he'd send an army or at least a bunch of reformed muggers.
well, i'm sorry, but what you see is what you get.
well, i think it's time we sashayed down to the old homestead, partner.
i think i liked you better when you spoke rock 'n' roll.

michael, if you think about it, none of this makes any sense anyway.
why would anyone want to buy rebecca's ranch... enough to go to these lengths?

it was the army-navy game... and i went 21 for 30 with two touchdowns in the air... and a scramble for another.

i'm ready to leave i push the fact in front of me facts lost, facts are never what they seem to be nothing there, no information left of any kind i'm lifting my head, looking for danger signs
the island of doubt it's like the taste of medicine working by hindsight got the message from the oxygen ooh i'm making a list find the cost of opportunity doing it right, right facts are useful in emergencies
the feeling returns whenever we close out eyes lifting my head looking around inside.
facts are simple and facts are straight facts are lazy and facts are late facts all come with points of view facts don't do what i want them to
facts just twist the truth around facts are living turned inside out facts are getting the best of them

that's a real comfort to me, suffering as i do from a herniated lower lumbar.

word down on the beach is you've moved in with a bunch of sex geezers.
they might be old, ugly and horny, but actually they're very nice guys.

suppose l was your guest, you'd ask me if i'd like coffee or tea
after the guest has made their choice, then you ask how they want it
he might have to spend the rest of his life there
mom, dad has never visited him i hope he's dropped dead!
although this statue's making was recorded, it had never been found
there are seldom antiques of this kind, it's a rare piece, so it's very precious
ms. li graduated in design in england, we've invited her to join our design department
we need talent like ms. li's, we could do with some new ideas
alright, i didn't intend to do that anyway i should go
ting ting... do i look pale? i had a bad night
and i started to hear a baby's cry after that incident
the master was frightened, and he bought a statue and performed an exorcism by putting the child's ashes inside of it
and though i've tried to discourage her... she seems determined to talk to you about her case.
i would think you could find a moment or two to discuss it with her.
i mean, whatever he's cooking up, it's gonna happen this weekend.
well, whatever it is, we're going to miss it... because you locked us in the vault!
after all, somebody is bound to notice that we haven't come back.
i mean, do you think that we're the last two people... who are gonna use this vault this afternoon?
what have you ever done in a situation like this before?
i hate to disillusion you, susan... but no one's ever locked me into a bank vault before.
so, now you can understand why i might be a little bit upset.
well, i mean, i kind of knew it had to be more than... being locked up in a small room without any food or water.
it's probably just a matter of minutes... before we both start hallucinating.
we'll probably go through this incredible... cosmic experience together just before we kick off.
magnum, miss johnson is the assistant manager... of the first anglo-hawaiian bank... which handles all of mr. masters' transactions on the island.
and though i've tried to discourage her... she seems determined to talk to you about her case.
i thought maybe that... you could follow him around... and then if you saw him starting to commit a crime then you could stop him.
i don't think i could just follow someone around... waiting to see if he was going to commit a crime.
perhaps we should try something different this year... and share our own inspirational thoughts... instead of listening to someone else's.
who knows what might come out of an atmosphere of intimacy.
susan, a big surprise could be a trip to sea life park.
a big surprise could be two tickets to the don ho show.
after all, somebody is bound to notice that we haven't come back.
i mean, do you think that we're the last two people... who are gonna use this vault this afternoon?
i have an entire weekend of quiet meditation and fasting planned... and just as we begin our moonlight chanting... the cacophonous sounds of that hi-fi come blasting across the grounds.
i come over here to find that not only has magnum not returned with my book... but the two of you have turned mr. masters' guest quarters... into some kind of musical rumpus room.
it's nice because, i mean, look... i've only known you, what is it... 13 hours.
i don't know, it seems like i've known you at least... 1 4 hours.
when the wires shorted out... the code could have gotten scrambled.
maybe it was just a matter of trying combinations of numbers... to get the door open.

like in whether you take a case because of the money, because of friendship and loyalty, or simply because you have to.
well, after three weeks on a tough case on the north shore, all that was irrelevant.
a very close friend of mine owns a majority interest in kaimuki savings and loan.
apparently, someone in the real estate loan department has been doing some long-term embezzling of the firm's funds.
consequently, it's been arranged for you to begin work there tomorrow, under the guise of a loan officer, to attempt to ferret out the culprit.
no one in the office will be aware of your true identity, since all employees are suspect.
nevertheless, under no circumstances should elizabeth andrews be made aware of the situation.
she is a member of the house of commons, and her career would be in ruins if there were the slightest inkling that she had had an illegitimate son.
the assignation in question took place in mrs. andrews' youth, when she was a young woman growing up in kenya.
it must have been awfully lonely out there on the veldt.
therefore, i didn't have any qualms about luther continuing with whatever higgins' little problem was.
especially since i was going to be really tied up with this important embezzlement case for robin.
i have to pretend you need a loan for your medical bills.
listen, big guy, you're getting half the retainer on this one and we're taking all the lumps.
it just appears that this case is neither fish nor fowl.
i refuse to sit here any longer and subject myself to this childishly inane behavior.
you're thinking that magnum's not gonna do anything but play with his computer all night.
and that ain't doing your common lady friend a damn bit of good.
you can start by explaining why you didn't tell us that this kid we're trying to save is yours.
do you remember where you were in the spring of '54, mr. gillis?
you might be able to understand the story i'm about to tell you.
i spent my spring of '54 in kenya, which is far, far removed from st. pete.
you could've found out if the little sucker was yours or not.
you could have found out if there even was a little sucker.
the alien concept of honor, all that stuff i'm supposed to know nothing about.
well, maybe it ain't honor that kept you from making that phone call.
there happens to be a guy behind you with a gun.
last time i heard that, it was bugs bunny to yosemite sam and he didn't fall for it either.
the truth of the matter is i can't stand the damn weather out here.
it never snows, and you ain't got a major league ball club.
therefore, although the united states has not yet entered the war in europe we of the american ambulance service have continued to donate men, women and equipment to aid our unfortunate wounded french and british friends.
i want to thank this year's graduating class of lake forest college for this badly needed vehicle.
this is the singly most disgusting concoction in the culinary annals.
well, that didn't stop you eating a dozen of them every fourth of july when you were a boy, elliot.
he says his arm is shattered, and it's pinned under the body of another guy who won't move, because he's already dead.
he's sure he's dying and if you had the decency of half a human being, you'd do something!
you know, if i may say so, louisa it makes perfect sense to me.
all americans should avail themselves of at least one season in paris just prior to marriage.
but your mother preferred to remain in the cow pastures of illinois.
no worry, i realise why you finally deigned to visit your old uncle.
i invited him to parties, he claimed he didn't have a dinner jacket.
i asked him to lunch, he said he didn't eat lunch.
he'll come back, but he'll be a little late, won't he?
i wonder if she'll still let gray give him that job.
well, gee, i know what this one here is but shouldn't this one be walking by now?
i mean, did you ever think of giving it a cold shower or an aspirin?
i don't give a damn if they catch who killed her.
what i wanna know is how you got her to take the first drink.
you know i spent my whole life among the great names of europe.
now i'm dying and who comes to see me but a...
i found out there's another debt to pay for the privilege of being alive.
i thought sophie was my reward for trying to live a good life.
no one in need who has ever approached you... the generous citizens of lake forest, illinois... has ever been refused.

this quaint little village may have been the place of my birth... but after 15 years in paris...
i've come to regard that as a most unfortunate accident of genetics.
he says his arm is shattered and it's pinned under the body... of another guy who won't move 'cause he's already dead.
he's sure he's dying... and if you had the decency of half a human being, you'd do something!
did it ever occur to you that i might be in training?
did it ever occur to you that you might be avoiding me?
you know, if i may say so, louisa... it makes perfect sense to me.
all americans should avail themselves of at least one season in paris... just prior to marriage.
i told him that pop always kept a gun in his office... and he kept large amounts of cash.
and while he was cleaning the gun, it... accidentally went off.
now, joseph, you see... this is not fit for a gerbil.
that, on the other hand, minus an outer leaf or two... is positively rousseauian in its beauty and at half the price.
i wouldn't have to pay for the linen at my place.
are you sure you both don't want to come to our house?

and we all know that you've had some kind of a well, shock over there, and that...
well, that you just needed time to kind of "loaf around" as you put it.
all americans should avail themselves of at least one season in paris just prior to marriage.
it curbs the itches which tend to rise a year or two down the connubial pike.
is that what you're gonna tell mr. maturin when you see him?
that you kept him waiting six months because you like to pack fish?
this is a sad time, mrs. macdonald but it is also a day for rejoicing.
our lord has promised to call us all home to him in heaven.
i told him that pop always kept a gun in his office and he kept large amounts of cash.

i'd like to take you to molyneux's after lunch and pick out your dress.
gray and i would love to give it to you as a wedding present, wouldn't we?
what i wanna know is how you got her to take the first drink.
what'd you do, get her going on bob and the baby?
when piedmont died i had to pay him back for my life.
i found out there's another debt to pay for the privilege of being alive.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
there was some arms trafficking on the us army base... that you and your brother were stationed at.
and that before his death... your brother was scheduled to drive the stolen hardware off the base.
he even told you he was coming to the base to get the goods on harnett.
that means i've held up my end of the deal that you came to me with, colonel.
you know, if i get tired of ozzie and murdock... or i love murdock or...
i flip through the dial and it's time for bachelor murdock... or have murdock
we went to an army base... and decided to follow a soldier home when he picked up a pretty girl.
right now he has no idea... that we're playing a harmless little joke.
and then maybe you can come on down and get your money.
i guess the laugh's on him, because what mr. harnett doesn't realise... is that the candid murdock has been recording the whole thing.
nothing to fret about here, just a little civil defence matter.
he has volunteered to be "citizen victim for a day"... and he's pretending he has contracted... a highly contagious, toxic, intergalactic virus.
we'll have to take these on the first run and come back for the rest.
you stay here and make sure harnett doesn't show up and make trouble.
in 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the a-team.
as long as you can get us enough weapons to make the 6:00 news start at 5:00.
i have what you need, what you do with them is your business.
there was some arms trafficking on the us army base... that you and your brother were stationed at.
and that before his death... your brother was scheduled to drive the stolen hardware off the base.
listen, hannibal, there's about 100 reasons why i hate this plan of yours.
but my biggest objection... even bigger than my objection of letting someone else drive my vette... my biggest objection is sending the golden age of television here... to back up tawnia while she tries to scam a piece of scuzzy luggage like harnett.
now, remember... this whole bag of bulbs is like that episode on have murdock
- will travel... i was telling you about where the bad guy is galloping along on his horse.
we went to an army base... and decided to follow a soldier home when he picked up a pretty girl.
right now he has no idea... that we're playing a harmless little joke.
i guess the laugh's on him, because what mr. harnett doesn't realise... is that the candid murdock has been recording the whole thing.
boy, i sure as heck wouldn't want to be in his army boots.
nobody can blame you for trying to find your brother's murderer.
i for one am not gonna be chintzy with the applause.
the british were in a continual state of war with the fiercely independent tribes along their northwest frontier.
an extraordinary regiment was raised to deal with them. and it's headquarters were here at mardan. they wrote some of the most glorious chapters in the annals of military history. which was when this story really began.
[koda dad becomes a father to ashok] [while teaching him horse training]
[anjuli gives ashok a mother-of-pearl fish emblem] saying...] [that someday they will meet again and put it back together]
mary was telling me a bit about it on the train from bombay.
and not only that... he was rescued from the mutiny by his hindu foster-mother.
in fact i'd have given the game away if edith viccary hadn't dug me in the ribs.
perhaps she thought it was none of your damn business. you're back in india.

i suppose that's why i told her all those stories about my rich relations.
i never thought she'd take it that way if she found out.
how much longer do they mean to keep you tied to a desk?
soon it will be three years since you were at the corps.
a circumstance which allows for the fresh eye and the open mind.
if you think it's just a case of us cold-shouldering them.
imagine your england being a conquered territory. and council proclaiming and and silencing any protest with brute force.
the last of those protests was less than 20 years ago.
none but the sahib would dare to lay hands on their highnesses as you did.
who knows what vengeance the brother the maharajah nandu would have taken on us.
besides i could think of worse places to pass a couple of days.
i noticed black buck as well as jinkara out in the plain.
so that i could be sure that you were really who you said you were.
let me turn the lamp out so that i can look at you.
and rightly. and brought black disgrace on both karibcotte and the british raj.
are you even sure that the princess anjuli would join you in such a venture?
do you think you only have to pass a law for a tradition to die?
suttee won't cease until our women refuse to submit to it.
i faced that when i realized she wouldn't go to bhithor without me.
how could your own brother marry you both off to someone much older?
i suppose you've also thought if you conceive? that i swear to you.
i will see to it that he grows to be a prince we can be proud of.
and it may be father of other children without knowing or caring.
will know and care. and at the end risk death and endure pain to give it life.
and tomorrow his remains shall be carefully collected and taken to be thrown into the sacred waters of mother gunga. his friends must take it upon themselves to perform this pious duty.
mohan and sen gupta to go together with their servants and those of biju ram.
i may have to accept whatever terms he cares to dictate.
dare not insult him. and send them home without their dowries.
and foolish. and i am much to blame for your pain. for both of you.
the best thing that we can do now and not as one of her sister's waiting women.
within 24 hours you come to terms over i hereby inform you that i shall submit a report of the whole incident to my superiors together with the strongest possible recommendation that the only appropriate response to such an act of unprovoked aggression
is for you state to be taken over by the government of india and sent away to live the remainder of you life in exile.
there's not another man alive that knows the afghan mind better.
i'm in no position to accept a british mission in kabul.
very few of my troops have actually experienced defeat at the hands of the british.
they will see no reason why i should permit you to establish a permanent british mission in kabul.
so why should they let us set up a permanent mission in kabul?
wigram used to say he wouldn't be in your shoes for anything in the world.
it is not right that shushila rani should be so indulged. and dreaded so greatly.
all the less reason for her to cause you to be treated in this way.
they're like a bunch of children on a school treat crowding up for a slice of the cake.
since we're outnumbered even by the ruffians lining the route there's not assembly the great big comfort to me.
....what did you expect? and they wore rich furs and great boots of leather.
but this... this was a poor show. how is it possible that a government which could not afford to send a proper embassy will be able to pay the amir soldiers all they are owed.
i must advise you to ask the amir to provide us with alternate accommodation. it would be grossly discourteous to the amir.
that there's precious little anyone can do to make it safe against attack.
it's the duty of all of us to defend this residency to the last.
you must choose the men to go with you. and we'll have a go at spiking the guns.
my master says you will know what the law means in bhithor.
wives and concubines followed him into the flames. but only catamites.
the rana of bhithor is quite enough of a handful as it is.
and you want me to get the political officer to shake a stick at them on the strength of some tittle tattle in the women's quarters?
a great damasha. but you were reared as one of us long enough to know one that bestows merit on everyone who is present.
the people of bhithor will be enraged if anyone attempts to prevent it.
there well be more guards and wakeful people in the palace then ever before.
i will let you know when i have worked out a plan that will succeed.
the only chance we have is to hold them off until nightfall.
there is a ruined temple across the plain take her highness there.
the corps of guides, and it's headquarters were here at mardan.
composed entirely of native volunteers, hindus, sikhs and muslims, and led by a handful of specially selected british officers, they wrote some of the most glorious chapters in the annals of military history.
this brat from the bazaar is the son of hilary and isobel pelham-martin.
how the hell he managed to survive the mutiny, i don't know.
[instead of executing ashok, buji ram brands his chest] [with a red-hot pistol barrel]
[with the help of koda dad ashok and sita escape the palace]
well, young fellow, like it or lump it you're going to be shipped back to london, and licked into shape.
[after seven years in england, learning english, attending school] [becoming acclimatized to english society]
well, that can be no bad thing out here, providing it's kept in check.
i'd say your biggest problem will be to resist getting over-familiar with your men.
[ash laughs and converses [ with his men in native tongue. ]
accused admits that while on sentry duty he mistook the missionary for a horse thief and fired at him.
[thou needest no praise, yet i offer thee these prayers and salutations]
[lord, forgive three sins that that are due to my human limitations]
that's almost all that i can remember my father saying to me.
mind you, he was pretty much out of his depth, poor man.
i rather suspect he was thankful that she and the other servants more or less adopted me.
it absolved him from having to do anything except harangue me occasionally.
i can still hear the sound of hyenas and jackals quarrelling and snarling over the dead.
and the croaking and flapping of gorged vultures in the trees.
a gentleman would have forgotten that, not tried to use it to his advantage.
are you trying to pretend to be in love with a man who's old enough to be your father?
don't think i'm not going to wait until someone else finds out to make us a laughing stock.
i shall tell everyone i suspected it all along and trapped him into admitting it.
that you remove every article of equipment and uniform that is the property of the corps, and that you should return it to the quartermaster,
and that you should not let us see your faces again until you have returned with the stolen rifles.
well, i say, you can't talk like that in the mess, ashton
if you must spout filth, go and do it somewhere else, will you?
the corps of guides, and it's headquarters were here at mardan.
composed entirely of native volunteers, hindus, sikhs and muslims, and led by a handful of specially selected british officers, they wrote some of the most glorious chapters in the annals of military history.
in 1865 i had the honor to be commandant, which was when this story really began.
...yes, yes, ash-baba, we are playing a game, that your name is ashok, and that you are my true son.
we were formed to gather trustworthy intelligence, beyond, as well as within, our borders.
exactly sir, if one of our officers can spend a fair amount of time on the other side of the border without being spotted as an englishman- or shot as a spy-
personally, i'd like to see him transferred to another unit, for a couple of years, preferably a british one where he can cool his heels for a bit, and mix with his own people for a change.
he needs to get right away from the frontier, and his pathan friends, until he's needed.
'a fellow with more dash than cash, 'thought his courting was proving a smash.
'the beastly belinda, 'burnt his hopes to a cinder, 'but couldn't demoralize ash. '
i don't believe they really ever forgot that i was a sahib.
trouble is, i can't really see myself as being a sahib.
now, how much longer do they mean to keep you tied to a desk?
soon it will be three years since you were at the corps.
a colony in which indians hold every post of any real authority, with an indian governor-general, and council proclaiming and enforcing laws which are completely alien to you way of life and thought,
indians running the public services, garrisoning your country, and silencing any protest with brute force.
and don't forget, sir, the last of those protests was less than 20 years ago.
in the circumstances, sir, would you be keen to get on close and friendly terms with your indian rulers?
the princes shushila is complaining that the swaying of the howdahs is making her unwell.
i've tried to reason with her, but she insists the raj-kumaris (princesses) be immediately transferred to a carriage.
i suppose i was too annoyed by this posting to take the trouble to find out.
tell me, father, are there any others in this party who might remember the boy ashok?
in fact she has just sent word, that she is suffering from shock sickness.
she flatly refuses to move anywhere for at least two more days.
princess or not, she throws her weight about a bit, doesn't she?
they say, it's not such a tiresome decision as it might have been.
i noticed black buck as well as jinkara out in the plain.
it will be pleasant to spend a day or two shooting whilst your highnesses recover.
yes, i am afraid, and if you are not, you should be.
this touches on your honor, and i have no desire to get a knife between my ribs.
there is a man called biju ram, but he is out of favor with nandu.
besides, he would have forgotten my friend, as has everyone else.
the corps of guides, and it's headquarters were here at mardan.

in 1865 i had the honor to be commandant, which was when this story really began.
...yes, yes, ash-baba, we are playing a game, that your name is ashok, and that you are my true son.
now by the signs i would have said that you had left your heart enrobed, indeed.
for it is thus that young men look and speak and sigh when they think of their beloved.
and while i hesitated, her father gave her in marriage to someone who did not care so much about such matters as i.
and afterwards.....afterwards i could not find another woman to take her place.
had any harm come to prince jhoti, my fate would have been sealed.
i suppose biju ram being out of favor with the maharajah is genuine.
biju ram, as you of all people should know, is not called the scorpion for nothing.
i feel a perfect fool being taken to see their highnesses like this!
i shall always be two people in one skin, which is not a very comfortable thing to be.
i understand that, but you will find it easier to separate the two, and do not try to be both at the same time.
no, but the one thing she respects is strength, and he showed that in plenty.
in fact they got along well enough until he arranged this marriage.
i faced that when i realized she wouldn't go to bhithor without me.
how could your own brother marry you both off to someone much older?
do you care so much more for her than you do for me?
i love you more than life, beyond anything, anyone else, but shushu is not as strong as you and i are, and if i'm not there to give her courage and to comfort her, she will die from fear and loneliness.
no, i did not think that i was the first, for i know that men are careless of their seed, and you will lie with other women.
and it may be father of other children without knowing or caring.
[ashton] i shall always be two people in one skin, which is not a very comfortable thing to be.
[anjuli] i was visiting my honorary brother, my poor sick honorary brother.
the corps of guides, and it's headquarters were here at mardan.

in 1865 i had the honor to be commandant, which was when this story really began.
...yes, yes, ash-baba, we are playing a game, that your name is ashok, and that you are my true son.
the fellow had served me well in his way, so i undertook to return the rifle to you.
but before doing so, i thought it best to test it.
as there are none of his relatives here, his friends must take it upon themselves to perform this pious duty.
therefore i command pran, mohan and sen gupta to go together with their servants and those of biju ram.
he might refuse to marry the two princesses, and send them home without their dowries.
if that were to happen, i could not answer for what
we welcome, your highness, and, of course you, pelham sahib, as a representative of the british raj, not only on our own account, but on behalf...of all the people of bhithor.
we thank you for your gifts, and we hope that ours, like them, will mark the outset of a joyous and fruitful union between your noble self and the sisters of his highness, the maharaja.
you know i love you more than anyone, much more than life itself,
but i love her, too, and you are wrong to say that she does not need me.
but, anjuli, has made a wise decision, for both of you.
the best thing that we can do now is to make sure she stays here as a wife, and not as one of her sister's waiting women.
unless, within 24 hours you come to terms over the arrangements for the of both the princesses, our terms, that is,
i hereby inform you that i shall submit a report of the whole incident to my superiors together with the strongest possible recommendation that the only appropriate response to such an act of unprovoked aggression is for you state to be taken over by the government of india
let us see, if this unfortunate misunderstanding cannot be resolved by older heads.
let it never be said that we left any avenue unexplored.
[rao] no question, but the rana is a very cunning fellow.
we could not have refused such an invitation, then, so we must put a good face upon it.
i would, if she were my wife, and all she could do was cry.

there's not another man alive that knows the afghan mind better.
major cavagnari, i'm in no position to accept a british mission in kabul.
very few of my troops have actually experienced defeat at the hands of the british.
they will see no reason why i should permit you to establish a permanent british mission in kabul.
and this time we won't stop until we've annexed afghanistan for good.
and at that point, you put our own puppet on the throne.
well, then you ought to know that we're exactly the same position we that were in at the end of the first afghan war.
after an enormous waste of blood, we've left every part of afghanistan bristling with our enemies.
so why should they let us set up a permanent mission in kabul?
wigram used to say he wouldn't be in your shoes for anything in the world.
it is not right that shushila rani should be so indulged.
thank the gods for permitting her to find happiness in a marriage, which she sought to avoid, and dreaded so greatly.
they're like a bunch of children on a school treat crowding up for a slice of the cake.
since we're outnumbered even by the ruffians lining the route there's not assembly the great big comfort to me.
it was, indeed, a great timasha, but this... this was a poor show.
for many of those who watched were saying, how is it possible that a government which could not afford to send a proper embassy will be able to pay the amir soldiers all they are owed.
and at once began to doubt if it was true, that he had come laden with riches.
well, now that we are here, i hope your people won't find us quite so trepacious ogres as they feared.
as to the question, it would be grossly discourteous to the amir.
i'm bound to say, sir, that there's precious little anyone can do to make it safe against attack.
i suppose being natives, the 77 men comprising your escort don't count.
you mustn't let me detain you from your duty, to inform mr. hamilton of any intelligence that you have managed to gleam.
see if you can find me a clean shirt, will you jenkins?
see if you can fold these wounds up for me, will you?
there is neither hem, nor fringe, nor border to the mercy of allah.
throughout that time in india, the british were in a continual state of war with the fiercely independent tribes along their northwest frontier.

in 1865 i had the honor to be commandant, which was when this story really began.
yet we hear traveler's tales, that daigita, who served anjuli rani since birth, is dead.
but surely, her highness would have mentioned that, had she been free to write, as she would.
i have instructed him to devise some means of passing on any news to you.
i would not trouble you with this, had i not known that you, too, would wish to satisfy yourself that all is well.
the rao sahib did me the honor of reading it to me before he sealed it.
well, i can tell by your face that this is not all.
when the previous rana died, 14 women, wives and concubines followed him into the flames.
the wits say at this time, only two women were burned, there being no concubines, but only catamites.
we will find a way of hiding it in your saddle bags.
well, of course i can't send a squadron into bhithor to serve the flag.
but, even then, it's such a hot potato, i'd have to wait for confirmation from camp cutter.
i mean, it's not even if you were still in the regiments.
mark it well, for it is not easy to find again from this side.
i will remain here until you return, for you may need to leave in haste by the same route.
the diwan will know very well, that you are not an accredited spokesman for the raj.
had you been, you would not have entered bhithor secretly, like a thief and in disguise.
tonight, there well be more guards and wakeful people in the palace then ever before.
i will let you know when i have worked out a plan that will succeed.
after she died, he was never more than the shell of a man.
but he could not more prevent my mother's death than you can prevent the ranis.
she only spared me because she had ordered that the last thing that i should ever see would be the flames uniting her body with the rana's.
afterwards, my eyes were to be put out with hot irons.
the only chance we have is to hold them off until nightfall.
there is a ruined temple across the plain take her highness there.
lmagine that we fought all the time and you had to live with it.
but do we, i mean, do your mother and i fight?
of course, it won't kill everyone, just the people in the front seats, the orchestra.
but the big bomb has to be set off by a little bomb... in the car.

acting and writing are two different professions, and there's no way to compare them.
franny, is it true that you're involved with a black law student?
you're a great writer and you're not gonna let those people affect you.
you're right back to work and i'm gonna take care of you.
this job's gonna be harder than... trying to rape a rhinoceros.
this is miss rhonda ray, who's going to be head maid and waitress.
i'd like to get my hands on that chipper dove just once.
you oughta have a hundred pounds on here, but i'm gonna start with 80.
and one fine morning, so we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.'
well, i don't know... only somehow... it's against my politics, but it makes me want to go to the us.
human beings are remarkable at what we can learn to live with.
if we can't get strong from what we lose, what we miss, what we want and can't have... then we could never get strong enough, could we?
if one of us has to drive, i'm much better driver.
i swear to god if you make my father to drive, i'll kill you, ernst.
one day it's gonna blow you away, unless you do something about it.
one day we're going to have to do something about the bear in you.
you see, when you touched the her in her, you broke her heart.
and that's why it was so important that you came, because if we could touch the you in you, then maybe the shock might bring her back.
go on, chipper, put your pants back and get outta here!
the next time you take youir pants off for anybody, think of franny.
'the good hotel... ', father used to '... provide you with the space and the atmosphere you need. '
i was still the only one in our family who didn't know what i needed.
when somebody touches you and you really don't want to be touched, well, that's not really being touched.
you still got you inside of you, and nobody's touched you... not really.
while we were stuck in our hopeless loves, lilly had a mission.
if she couldn't grow in life, she'd grow in her imagination.
the american publishers paid a lot of money for lilly's book.
maybe they wouldn't have if we hadn't become famous for saving the opera and murdering the terrorists in our good-old american family kind of way.

we're going to have to do something about the bear in you.
john just finished a long run, and i wrote a whole novel.
it was truly terrible, but i had to write it, so i threw it away.

you're about to see a classic, at least to those brought up in sweden in the 1980:s.
the jönssonligan movies are centerpieces of good swedish movie production of those days.

-i hope we'll meet in sandhamn [island in stockholm's outer archipellago] this weekend.
hence eve tasted the fruit and when her shoulders touched the tree she saw death draw nigh.
now i must die and the lord will give adam a new wife
but if we are not to die, we will live together.
if you were carried away by death the lord could never console me with another woman.
thorns and thistles shall it bring forth, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground.
let us pray to the gods that heaven protect our people's right and bring your valiant father safely back.
why did my father go so far away to protect this ragged, cowardly people leaving his lovely wife to grieve at home?
who would lose all he has in rash defiance of the raging tide?
who would risk all he has in rash defiance of the raging tide - and what sort of tide?
my son, i have not now the time for such small things.
i must pass judgment on heretics that grow like noxious weeds, though with fire and sword... ..we root them out yet ever do they come in ever greater numbers, sent by hell.
the sin must be abhorrent, to kindle such fierce anger in the church of love.
my son, love is not that which flattereth the flesh by that which leadeth back to the soul by the edge of the sword or by flame if need be to him who said.
for both of us it would be best if you go.

but we are bound by law and custom and the church.
i had not heard that my souvereign had annulled the titles of nobility.
if we are guilty and you spare us, you betray your country.
let's get over the first sin, as it was written in the bible.
perhaps you will buy me as a fairing the beatifications that offer themselves.
shall my kind progress, or like cattle in the treadmill stay within the circle?
shall my kind progress... or like cattle in the treadmill stay within the circle?
why did i strive to achieve greatness in man who is moulded of sunlight and dust in knowledge a pigmy, in blindness a giant?
freely to chose between good and evil, how great the thought revealed.
as soon as the little prince saw olga he got weak in the knees.
for two weeks he kept his hand on his dagger so no one'd come near her.
i recently read "the new plutarch, or the lives of great women".
larissa dmitrievna, can you explain to me why women usually prefer evil men instead of those who are decent?
as a friend of hers, i ask you to explain to her that i had to leave in a big hurry.
i'm going to write to her as soon as i can.
why, he went so far as to invite me for dinner, for example.
but what's so stupid is... that it never entered his mind how he's going to live with such a wife.
ah, i got carried away, but that isn't the reason i came here.
you should have a nice trousseau for larissa dmitrievna to wear.
i trust that larissa dmitrievna won't give any cause for it.
those who are jealous often don't have any reason to be jealous.
so you didn't forget the argument you had a while ago?
all right. lf you want, i'll put an end to all this.
if she could go with us... i'd be willing to pay dearly to have her company.
i'd be willing to pay one ruble to every crew member if she were to come on board my "swallow".
give me a straight answer, am i your wife now or not?
think about the rumors you'll be the source of if you don't go.
i would see to it that your income would be so that the most spiteful gossips and moralizers would be forced to shut up.
i would never hesitate to offer you my hand, but i'm already married.
they insulted you and they are going to pay the price!
the biggest insult for me is your playing the role of my protector.
only if you do get caught, then you'll be accused of sinning.
yes, if you go to court dressed, you come out naked.
i wouldn't be running away from it by marrying you if it weren't so.
it's not because of any of your qualities that i chose you.
and as if it wasn't enough, they played a dramatic scene.
they took off all of their clothes... they tore a pillow apart... and rolled in the feathers...
but what's so stupid is... that it never entered his mind how he's going to live with such a wife.
well, i hope she'll leave him soon and come back to live here.

so we, her friends, are not only allowed, we feel forced to take part in her destiny.
d'you mean that's the right occasion to take her to paris, for example?
i can assure you there're boundaries that reprobation does not cross.

i mean a wedding dress and all that goes with it.

no, you're going to shine as never before and everyone will see it.
the dealer said we could have the wine at ten kopecks a bottle and he'd stick any label we want.
he gave us good wine too. lt smells of cloves and something else...

no, the young lady is not, as you might think, already hypnotized.
but do you not see in her physical bearing that waxen flexibility in her face, that dullness, la belle difference, which links the hypnoid and neurotic states?
she found that while she could rise from her bed at home without difficulty, a strange impediment had descended on her during the night.
our tests show undiminished muscular strength, and when examined in bed she is capable of normal movement with normal vigor, and, strange to say, she can perform a quite complicated leg movements.
i never knew what it was to feel so provincial until now.
even charcot's lectures appear to belong to the beau monde, in all their finery, as much to the students of medical science.
and charcot holds them all spellbound, at once doctor, sage and ringmaster.
the great man himself has welcomed me most cordially and arranged a cubicle in the laboratory, with all the pickled brain tissue a devout neurologist could wish for.
so i flee into streets, to the cites, to notre dame, to the louvre, where i feel a cultural being once more.
yesterday i walked in a daze down the alley of versailles, with its stone guardians overlooking a nature trimmed and tamed.
you may recall the tragic railway collision at clermont-ferrand earlier this year, resulting in several fatalities, this gentlemen was among the fortunate.
he appeared to have escaped the crash without injury, having thrown out his right hand to save himself from being flung across the carriage.
to the sudden onset of cerebral tumors, as our esteemed colleagues in vienna maintain?
herr professor meynert believes himself able, i understand, to trace even mania and melancholia to the cortical circulation of the blood.
indeed, where else are we to find the source of this many-watered nile?
in what name are we to save these patients from the surgeon's knife?
why of the many victims at clermont-ferrand was it this man's fate to bear a timeless witness?
and this girl, of all the rejected lovers in the world?
we can only assume that a single traumatic event stirred from sleep some hereditary disposition in her psyche, which, during the ensuing days, that fateful interval, mulled over the material like a busy dramatist, to make of it a passion play.
and here at the salpetriere, what can we do for these poor actors tyrannized by their predestined role?
charcot's fallen out with his german translator, and as soon as the opportunity...
tell me, do you think it's true that under hypnosis the subject will do anything you command?
but isn't that exactly what attracts the tout paris to charcot's demonstrations, hm?
i attended one where he persuaded a girl to stab and kill a number of imaginary assailants.
my esteemed colleague josef breuer has already used the technique on a young patient with remarkable success.
the girl was afflicted with multiple paralysis and a variety of delusions.
i know your mother was engaged for nine, but i can't go on waiting.
i've come to ask you to forgo the ceremony, rings, presents.
no, this way you're free to approve or condone my lecture as you please.
gentlemen, during my six months' visit to the salpetriere in paris,
i was privileged to witness some remarkable developments in the treatment of hysteria, through which maitre charcot has, i believe, transformed our understanding...
he went to paris a neurologist and he has returned a crank.
what i said to you the other day about charcot, only a worthless person would say such things.
believe me, it's not incompatible with an unblemished character or a well-governed mode of life.
and you said it was like a slap you had deserved but not received.
tell me, is it possible that you once received one that was not deserved?
but i understand you procured papa a free pass to travel anywhere in europe.
you don't suppose he suddenly decided to take advantage of it today?
and now i realize you were making me work all the harder to satisfy you with my memories.
but you know, too, that in my mind you are still my lover?
and how the body mimics them, drawing attention to some... hidden incident.
but in disguise, as if the mind itself were the enemy of truth.
wasn't the temple of sirius supposed to have been built by ancient astronauts?
that's right, daphne, and the temple is supposed to be haunted by the astronaut's ghosts.

all you want to hear is how great it is out here.
well, maybe it's great for you, but it sucks for me!
i was telling my buddies about it, but i kind of messed it up.
so i was wondering if you could give us a quick review on it now.
i'll explain it to you, and you can pass the information on to your friends.
now the plains indians were a very primitive tribe all over north america...

i've had fine times on winter nights when the wolves were after the stock.
but i hoped you'd come, because other wolves are running, and they're running after me, and they're running me very close.
excuse me, but doesn't the box protect you from the wolves?
they run me close with their new magic, which i can't guard myself against - not any more - because i'm old now and only know the old magic.
if you push this to the right, you can go small.
if you press it to the left, you can go swift.
it wouldn't do for you to take them without your guardian's permission.
far be it from me, as a man of the law, to encourage...
we in the law are always grateful for evidence from one who knows what's what.
so, i'll keep my eyes and ears open, and i'll ask what aeroplanes were around that way this morning.
did you get close enough to recognise any of the parties?
well, as i told you, we think - we're sure - the old man kidnapped was old mr hawlings who gave his punch and judy show at my house yesterday evening.
now... that is what we call in the law, a coin-ci-dence.
our officer in tatchester's enquiring about your punch and judy man - was it mr hawlings?
there is a possibility that my part in this was suspected only by the president.
that's why he sent the doctor, but the president is dead.
if he shared his suspicions with anyone, i shall know within a few hours.
in which case, i shall not be able to return to androzani major.
i have a considerable fortune invested in other planets in the sirius system.
but before i go, i want to take jek's private hoard of spectrox.
i am now chairman and chief director of the sirius conglomerate.
oh, and incidentally, the government have also sequestered all your private assets, including those secret funds you had salted away on the outer planets.
you're not more intrigued than if he was your little cousin on holidays.
to be frank i had almost forgotten he was still here.
the worst is that one of ours striked a compromise with the enemy.
he has already denunced to your secret police several of our fellow countrymen.
let's not exaggerate, but you know her, she's an impulsive woman.
she was probably seduced by the fashionable ideals of this little student cousin.
it's jacques who told me the other day when he show me the seeds cabinet.
i don't want to hear about this furniture made on order by a maniac.
when you were a child your mother entrusted me with you.
i was asking you "what game you want to play?" and you were answering "just playing".
as painful as it is for me to learn about sir erik's passing on it seems equally important for me to state my business.
i represent an organization that conducts private investigations into individuals and businesses.
we can produce testimony from one of the women to the effect that director lonnqvist raped her.
it is up to you to decide what we are to do.
"i am 62 years old and consider i have done my share for the company."
"i'd be grateful if you as chairman of the board could achieve" "a smooth transition from the old guard..."
maybe you and your wife don't have anything to talk about.
but i want to share everything with the person i live with.
they don't grasp that a business means continuity, growing seasons, spring and autumn.
they see everything in black and white, either lonnqvist or you now that the shadow of sir erik is no longer there.
one time he wanted to take me to the country to meet his grown-up kids.
it's like you and i going to paris to meet your wife.
as you're always urging me to take it easy, i think i'll do just that.
just a cup of coffee and i'll be off for home.
(male narrator) in 1972, a crack commando unit... was sent to prison by a military court... for a crime they didn't commit.
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government... they survive as soldiers of fortune.
if you have a problem, if no one else can help... and if you can find them... maybe you can hire the a-team.
but let me assure you, we do not work for the military... and we are sincere... in our plea for help from the a-team.
as i told mr. lee... our oil company is engaged... in a joint venture with the government of san marcos... to build a hydraulic power plant.
we have erected a temporary city on the site... to house those workers.
it's locally known as rivertown... due to its close proximity to the rio blanco.
the problem is in the past year... over 20 men have been lost to industrial accidents and explosions... and their bodies have never been recovered.
now part of our contract with the government of san marcos... is to provide the security for rivertown.
you figured i would take your burger... get wise to it, then take face's burger.
and face's burger is the one that got the sleeping powder in it.
yeah, well, i sure hope these bars are strong 'cause he's gonna be mad.
not to mention the fact that he ain't never gonna eat lunch with us again.
i, b.a. baracus, will duly uphold... all the laws of rivertown.
i will conduct myself as an honorable peace officer... and obey, at all times, all the rules of deputyship.
the workers listen to me and... well, they're happy and everything runs real smooth.
now, as for the sheriffs around here, well... i take care of them, and they look the other way.
now, i'm gonna put your boys away... for simple assault, overnight.
next time, it'll be six months... for assault on a police officer.
the city was at peace with itself... but it wasn't going to be that way for long.
and when the peace is broken, that's when i go to work.
that's a nice way to talk about somebody whose house you were found breaking into.
hey, man, how do we know she's who she says she is?
and about three times a week, around 10:00... he leaves and doesn't come back until morning.
so i decided to snoop around his place... and see if i could find out anything more... that would tell me why craig was in that tunnel.
one of boyle's men was going through your brother's possessions... in the locker.
now, we've been through it... but maybe you could go through his stuff... and find something we missed.
there's a new sheriff and his men i have to deal with.
you told me you could take care of anyone the american pigs sent down.
he knows more about explosives and guidance missile designs than any man i have.
he has been doing a good job... but he gets weaker every day. i do not know how long he will hang on.
i'm just trying to figure out a reason to go and take his particular medication.
i mean, if they had a legitimate need... they'd go to the infirmary and get it right away.
(hannibal) we'd learn a lot if we can just find out... where boyle disappears to?
b.a., could you cook up something we could follow this scuzzbucket with?
once we plant it on him, we got to be sure it stays on him.
now, what would he have that he would keep on him all the time?
let me tell you something, sport... if our sheriff ever decided to push you as far as he can... you'd drop off the edge and no one would hear you scream.
you know... you really should find... better specimens to kill your time with.
you know, your moves aren't any better than my lady friend over here.
and he sent that homing device... back to rivertown with one of my men, it made you think i left.
the girl has expensive taste, but i wonder if she can sing.
as fine as she is, she doesn't have to know how to sing.
this is a business, you ain't too far gone to see that yet.

the last three bands that came here went on to be big stars.

20 years ago, master li found 2 manuals on jiu xuan force
i would have shot him and he'd be like you right now!
i was there to save you or else i wouldn't be like this!
hold me steady as i swing her up, then i can get her to my back where she rides a-triumph.
only i do date from pagan times, and age makes joints to creak.
i am, so to speak, a showman, but the secrets of my show, they aren't to be had by everyone, are they?
- i was to ask whether you'd like a lift into town.
i'm giving a christmas party tomorrow evening at five o'clock, and you're all invited, especially you, mr cole hawlings, with your punch and judy show.
right gladly will i come, your grace, for i've played a christmas play upon that night ever since pagan times.
as a matter of fact, i had a bad dream last night myself.
i had a hard-on this morning when i woke up, tina.
of course, hamlet's response to this... and to his mother's lies was to continually probe and dig.
just like the gravediggers... always trying to get beneath the surface.
'the grave stood tenantless... 'and the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber... 'in the roman streets.
'as stars with trains of fire and dues of blood... 'disaster's in the sun and the moist air... 'upon whose influence neptune's empire stands...'
you know, i probably could have saved her... if i'd have moved sooner.
but i thought it was just another nightmare... like the one i had the night before.
or maybe i should grab that bottle and veg out with you.
avoid everything happening to me by just getting good and loaded.

we found him in an old abandoned boiler room... where he used to take his kids.

i don't know who he is... but he's burned, and he wears a weird hat... and a red and green sweater, really dirty... and he uses these knives, like giant fingernails.
you better keep her home for a few days... until she really gets over the shock of this.

liquid nutrients are then carried... through an elaborate system of filtering... aided by the pancreas, liver, and gall bladder... or collected in the bladder to be expelled at a later time.
carbon dioxide is exhaled... and oxygenated blood continues passing through the veins... into the left auricle... through the left ventricle, passing out again.

how she went crazy... when she saw her boyfriend get murdered across the street.

how much longer will you go on blaming your dreams... for your own weaknesses?
how much longer will you keep blowing smoke up our ass?
all of you have this inner strength... some special power that you've had... in your most wonderful dreams.
together, we can learn to use that power if we try.
i was willing to go through with this... for the kids' peace of mind, but you'll have to face reality.
joey, i just wanted to get you alone for a second.
why, all of a sudden, is this freddy guy after you?
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy.
dearly bereaved, we gather here in remorse for rickjohnson... a young man whose death confounds and mystifies us... for rick was in his prime, beloved by all... exemplary of young men's ideals... and of strong moral fibre.
we grieve our loss but take comfort in knowing such a man... rests in the kingdom of god.
it's that i just felt like i wasn't in control... for the first time since all that.
look, if you don't dream him up, he can't hurt you or us.
amanda krueger was part of a religious order... that ran that asylum in the 1940s.
she was raped by the lunatics and had the baby there.
that baby grew up to be freddy krueger... who murdered twenty or thirty kids... right here on elm street.
he got caught... but the courts cut him loose on a technicality.
you're the one who's always slapping my hand... about my weight, mother.
that's why we diet, dear... so we can eat at social events and not upset the other guests.
as long as we do it before dawn, we're home free.
we're gonna be livin' large in cali before the week is out.
i just have a little reoccurring dream... and i'm handling it fine.
and you are not being paid to be a dream doctor.
there's some connection between your dreams and his dreams... and his dreams mean bad news.
i know you think i'm crazy, but i can feel it.
first i want you to find a phone, call kelly... and tell him you're all right.
then i want you to get in that van... and drive straight back to the shelter.
they took you away from me... but i made 'em pay!
i took all their children away from them... and now... that's over.
god is our hope and strength... a very present help in trouble.
therefore, we will not fear... though the earth be moved... and though the hills be carried... into the midst of the sea... though the waters thereof rage and swell... and though the mountains shake... at the tempest of the same.
i know his behaviour is bizarre... but he's usually so normal and well adjusted, john...
i can't believe it's him... and not something outside influencing him.
you're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope?
everything about dylan's behaviour is understandable... for a kid who just lost his father.
six weeks, and you're surprised you got freddy in your dreams?
hell, sonny bono, after a while... began seeing his stalker everywhere, even at mass.
you know the guy that was calling me all the time?
he started again... and he's putting stuff in my mail again.
seismologists at cal tech... have counted over 300 temblors so far.
though most were too faint for us to feel... seven have shaken our community in the last few weeks... and now scientists are speculating... there might be an unknown fault running beneath los angeles... a fault that could...
i dream a scene at night, i write it down in the morning.
beyond that, your guess is as good as mine where it's going.
so in order to get out, he's got to come through you.
he's gonna try to do that at your most vulnerable points.
terrance feinstein and charles wilson... two special-effects artists... reputedly working on a top-secret project... for the makers of the freddy krueger films... were found brutally slashed to death early this morning.
freddy's glove was missing... and police are speculating the murders were the result... of a botched theft... which apparently took place two days ago.
well, rex is at home, and that's where you should be.
but you got to get better before they'll let you come home.
you can leave a message if you wish, but... we'll be gone for some time.
i wish i could tell you where the script was going.
i sort of think of it as a nightmare in progress.
in this nightmare in progress... does this thing have any weaknesses?
it can get too familiar... or somebody waters it down to make it an easier sell... or maybe it's so upsetting that it's banned outright.
however it happens, when the story dies... the evil is set free.
actually there is a person in the dream... sort of a gatekeeper, so to speak.
somebody freddy has to get by... before he can come into our world.
the world of horror films suffered its own terror today... as two of hollywood's best known special-effects technicians... were found dead in a vacant field.
terrance feinstein and charles wilson... two special-effects artists... reputedly working on a top-secret project... for the makers of the freddy krueger films... were found brutally slashed to death early this morning.
they went separate ways, sam went back to his old ones.
i don't know which wagon sam fell off, but back to the bottle he went.
diane went what we euphemistically call... and spent time in a country hospital.
after she got out, coach got her into cheers to try and talk sense into sam.
frasier happened by in the midst of this spirited contest and he stopped to correct a flaw in my swing.
my opponent on that day was as crafty a strategist as i.
great, now i have to work another saturday night by myself.
you promised you wouldn't boink any more waitresses... unless it was me.
as frasier crane, md, i don't think that's a good idea for the two of you.
and as frasier crane, man, i don't think it's a good idea for the three of us.
i could live in the same house and never be tempted.
i could sleep in the same bed and get nothing but a good night's rest.
they went separate ways, sam went back to his old ones.
i don't know which wagon sam fell off, but back to the bottle he went.
diane went what we euphemistically call... and spent time in a country hospital.
after she got out, coach got her into cheers to try and talk sense into sam.
sam, there's something i've been keeping from you and i've got to tell you now.
there's something i need to say to you and i think i ought to go first.
frasier happened by in the midst of this spirited contest and he stopped to correct a flaw in my swing.
my opponent on that day was as crafty a strategist as i.
you promised you wouldn't boink any more waitresses... unless it was me.
i'm going to have to find somebody, who i can keep my hands off of.
the fact of the matter is i don't want to work here because
i think i have a better lot in store than a life of serving beer to squamulous laggards.
i could live in the same house and never be tempted.
i could sleep in the same bed and get nothing but a good night's rest.
from the look on your face, i'd say we should cancel our subscription.
well, the man on the cover's vey handsome, but i'm afraid it's an ugly article inside.
well, i don't know what it is, mark, but it's happening.
there was a time when i thought we were destined to be together.
my god, you've got a small naval force anchored above your leases.
i have borrowed a lot more than $1 oo million in my time and i've paid back evey dime of it, with interest.
now, who are you going to trust, some damn magazine or me?
yes, well, that is the question that i've got to put to the other bankers, isn't it?
well, first of all, steven, alexis and i are partners, not you.
and secondly, nobody tells me how to conduct my business, least of all, mama's boy.
if you need to prove your masculinity, do it on somebody else's time.
alexis colby decides who she deals with and who she doesn't, so if you have any complaints, take them to her.
second, little danny is gonna visit me here in this hotel.
we're gonna spend the entire weekend together, just the two of us.
legally, she has evey right to bring him back here with her.
it was made vey clear in the settlement, i would have custody of danny.
and it would be better for him and for you to be together in a place that he's familiar with.
supervised by you, blake, steven, precious claudia and the entire carrington staff.
tell me, with someone like alexis, how do you ever get even?
i wonder what alexis would say if she could see us now.
since we don't want to be labelled the most dangerous arrondissement in paris we are friendly requested to postpone arrests for petty crime until next year.
so, not only did you risk getting a knife in your belly but you were also pushing us up in the crime charts.
the team who made this film wishes to thank the city of madrid... and its mayor for their support and help.
we are also thankful to the owners of the house where our protagonists lived, as well as to the locals for their patience and assistance while making this movie.
in february, 1936, the young spanish republic was celebrating the popular front's victory in the polls.
five months later, on july 18, 1936, the military coup that was expected since the elections finally materialized with the uprising of right-wing military.
for a period of 3 years, since the civil war started in 1936 until the cease of hostilities was declared on april 1, 1939,
madrid endured the attacks of the nationalist forces under the slogan:
it's not up to him, he must talk with the owner of the winery.
but i think he might find some work in the office.
the academy's principal, don alejandro, is very happy with her work.
as long as they don't kill don alejandro one of these days...
i want to be in front of your eyes, i want to be always by your side.
i want to be in front of your lips, i want to be in front of your teeth.
it's a romance, so it must contain 8 syllables and assonant rhyme.
so i have to keep using the same letter the first word ends on.
charity, could we see each other again before you leave on vacation?
we could go to the movies or to the science museum.
you know i am not allowed to go out with boys by myself.
but on sunday the whole group of friends will go bicycling to casey de campos.
it's because of them that dona maria luisa didn't want to join us.
she lent us the terrace to celebrate your employment, but she didn't want to join us.
i don't know who the kids in your group are, but i don't think the parents i know have much money left to buy bicycles.
you told me it was because i failed physics not because you didn't have money
(radio) "the government didn't want to address the nation until finding out what exactly had happened and taking immediate and relentless countermeasures to quash it.
a portion of the army representing spain in morocco did raise up in arms against the republic rebelling against the fatherland..."
i can use with other kids the next few days, then i can take it to la almanac.
sure, and your cousin anselmo will use it more than you.
on the other hand, they like my countryman basilica and since the other clerk did join the militia and left for the mountains...
he is one of the ones who burned the convents when all that started.
mom, i didn't know there were so many novels up here.
and since you don't let me go out, i have to keep busy somehow.
i think he also wrote a children's play, and some friends played it somewhere.
when we got married, he started writing a play about las sardinia but he never finished it
but minestrone, that friend of your father's he was a very normal person, and he was a comedian.
besides, have you forgotten that i wanted to be a playwright?
the loving night drops from its skies a wedding canopy over the lovers.
the night has hanged its clear diamonds on the velvet-like summer sky.
the garden, in shadows, doesn't have any colours, and in the mystery of its darkness, rustling the leaves, scent of flowers and love a sweet desire to mourn.
the holy night looks impious, like blasphemy in the middle of a prayer
i don't care, for i am dancing with my juan jose.
well, then let the house collapse with all of us inside, and long live madrid!
i think it would be something feudalistic making her pay for this.
i think it would be more feudalistic if she stayed home so that our boy does with her what he wants.
when returning from paris, at home he found two babies, that here, in madrid, his wife had ordered.
and when pulling out of the trunk another baby that he had bought
it is customary that in those enjoyable activities between men and women there is either some money... or some love involved and, of course, that's not the case in your situation.
you are doing what you are doing because you are living under the same roof, what the heck.
there, you will find a young lad, older than inquisitor, with whom you may fall in love with.
inquisitor should stay here, studying physics and solving his developmental problems the way god shows him, that's why he was a member of catholic youth.
ln there is marriage, the married woman has to fuck and if there are whores, you pay them.
but if there is neither marriage nor whores... all the girls will be for clark gable.
and if you have a chance, ask about that to your cousin.
(song) i climbed to a green pine tree to see if franco was arriving.
but bringing her home... of course, the poor girl has lost her family and she has nothing.
and she is a very good girl, she helps me a lot.
he has always been in favour of freedom and progress, of free-thinking.
i think he even saw one day pablo ecclesiastes from the distance.
and now this baby... at time when there is no food and you will need nourishment.
mom, i don't think i am the only woman who is expecting a baby since the war started
do you think that i would let my son starve if i had any food?
the only thing is that, as you very well know, i work on a winery.
we now "exploit" the winery rather than letting the former owners exploit us
well, those are not the matters i wanted to discuss with you
and sometimes i trade it for 1 kg of salted cod so that my son and my grandson don't die from starvation.
but, dona maria luisa, be assured that i don't have any food stocked at my place.
and you eat everyday with the coupons you get at the theater.
and if she also comes to stick the spoon in the serving dish ...!
mom, i during a couple of days, when passing by the kitchen, i was so hungry
i eat a spoonful from what you have for dinner but a very small spoonful.
i, as i am the smartest being in this house because of my gender and age, have long understood that one spoonful between 6 plates could not harm anyone.
so, since about one month ago, and regardless of what's in the pan, lentils, chickpeas, rice and clams, or water with something suspected to be cod, and while pretending to go to relieve myself, i sneak into the kitchen
who cares if we ate the lentils in the kitchen or in the dining room?
we are the same people and we eat the same number of spoonfuls!
had the democratic powers assisted us two years ago, this would have been over by now.
if the revolutionaries weren't as brutal as the beginning as they were ...!
the trumpets suddenly start their sounds, their singing sounds, their warm chorus surrounds in a golden thunder the pride of the flags.
he says the fight, the wounded revenge, the rough mane, the rough plumes, the spear, the lance, the blood that waters the heroic land.
which falls in with the ensign of the nation and it's the weapon with which they have to defend it.
our desire is your greatness, that you be noble and strong
well, you get married again, this time properly, and problem solved.
well, he says that his position is very important and that he has a great future and it would be unwise to spoil it with a fast wedding.
for a couple more of these, man, i get you all the info you need.
i'm gonna duke ya to a warehouse full of speed, pal.
what happened out there this morning doesn't count for nothing, does it?
i mean, your client could've shot me and my partner and that'd be okay too.
then i have no alternative but to hold you in contempt of court... and instruct the bailiff to take you into custody for 30 days... or until this court is satisfied.
you know as well i do that it's my job to deal with informants.
oh, i see we're having a problem with someone not being able to pay their bill.
now let that be a lesson to you, ladies and gentlemen.
for a couple more of these, man, i get you all the info you need.

how did you know that undercover agent zucotti was shot in the back of the head?
to the best of my recollection, that information was not passed out by the media.
that he was just blowing smoke, trying to cop a plea... on an important dope supplier.
and when bramlette told you that he'd seen ruiz kill a cop in the everglades, did you still think he was just "blowing smoke"?
first we're sitting in a bar having a nice, friendly beer, and then a couple of yahoos drag us out into the swamp and then get us lost.
and then three maniacs show up with shotguns, march us through the woods, don't say a word.
since i played lucky last night and didn't get blown to hell,
i'll go around that end of the house, 'cause i know where the trip wires of the claymores are.
and the guns we're using will rip through this old house from stem to stern.
so you've got to cover this front and don't let anybody get inside.
i've been trying to get you to have a party for ten years - nothing.
one girl comes in, bats her lashes at you, and you melt like warm nutella.
why don't you just tell this woman you can't make it this weekend because you're rolling with the boys?
if i do that, saboo, she will pummel me into the dirt.
don't eat 15 in one go cos you will see the devil, and he'll try and rip your heart out through your kneecaps.
pop 'em in the oven - about 20 minutes, gas mark 4.
don't go into the shop - there are objects that could get broken and are valuable - and my room's out of bounds.
unless you're a young attractive girl who likes jazz - and then it's just down there, on the right.
seems like only yesterday i was a young guy in leeds with a head full of dreams and a passion for jazz-rock fusion.
but i followed those dreams and that passion, and they took me to doncaster... (electro music)
you have been brought here for one purpose, and one purpose alone:
to bask in the glory of my outfit and party like you've never partied before!
by this time, his face was really close to mine - it was frightening in the dark!
we're gonna play a little game now, a little game called spin the bottle.
or a single hand grenade thrown on the bullet proof car of the dictator.
which of the above two crimes is more heinous against humanity.
no, give my message to avinash as soon as he comes.
i'm going to mrs. rane in the evening ask him to contact me there.
'i refuse to play the joker. ' 'ln the crevices of the teeth of those people'
'fresh human flesh is filled like the fiber of sugar cane'.
i feel with fame, i'll be in the cocoon of safety.
if people mention my name, i'll have the confidence that i exist.
to define it, a girl looking into mirror is distressed for hours.
i might not be able to come, swimming in the canal of dirt.
i'm ruling the roost for 20 years, just because of my cleverness.
by the way what great invaluable experiences do i present in my works?
we've to take a decision whatever to live as a human or artiste.
if you ever face such a question what will you do?
but the north pole star remains fixed at its own place.
in this vast sea of humanity i know of one person.
'fresh human flesh is filled like the fiber of sugar cane'.
if i can write 4 such lines my life will be successful.
when this project starts, value of that land will increase 50 times.
an acre of land will be sold for rs.25,000 instead of rs.500.
is prime duty of all artistes to protest against injustice oppression.
first time in all these years, i've seen you talking so much.
but, as an art form, if it fails to reach the state of an epic.
if it fails to show a new path, whas the use of it?
just a few days ago, viewers, we noted with satisfaction how our city seemed to have escaped the bloodbath that's engulfing sicily.
but this morning, mr marineo, chief inspector, was found killed inside his car.
however, i've found new friends and that injustice will be redressed.
and if i get a certain job, my authority will count in many circles.
i was in a corner watching you as i sipped on my orange juice.
and i thought that when someone becomes famous, they also end up with lots of hassles.
well... for better or worse, we've been together 1 3 years.
i was best man at your wedding and i feel a bit responsible for both your happiness.
- paola, if we accept gifts, people might think we can be bought, understand?
i like this puppet, but if people were to think badly of us
finding an identical fabric is very difficult after so many years.
but you could say it's eleonora pecci scialoia's blood, but it isn't.
if you need anything, ask for me or mr lo spanno here.
yes, i'd like to be able to cash cheques from my milan branch.
listen, we must absolutely find out which name marineo used to sign cheques.
then we'll know how much money he moved and for whom.
corrado investigates the murder and meets titti, the dead noblewoman's junkie daughter.
he soon finds a link between his predecessor's murder and the marchioness' death.
people who greet each other with a smile as they see themselves in others.
for some time now, it's as if an evil force was among us.
between the wretch who kills for money and the powerful who give the orders.
that is why hope, in this day of bloodshed and sorrow, is represented by so many young people here today.
young people like leo de maria and women, who also want an end to visible massacres
like the one we mourn today and the invisible ones, because we no longer want to shed these tears.
marineo's death seemed a mafia vendetta, but leo de maria's killing puts a new slant on things.
there are people here who are running scared and will go to any lengths.
you make up all these things... to frighten me, i guess.
i found a box of matches stained with marineo's blood close by.
i was told that servants shouldn't witness family rows... so i sent him back to his room.
when i met titti, she was already tripped out, as they say.
why don't you accept, my dear olga, what's in front of you, which isn't too bad?
the wheel turns and we might get the wind in our sails.
i know, it's rather trite, but we mustn't see our actions as a catastrophe or a point of no return.
it might just be a response to an impulse of the moment.
the person responsible is called sante cirinna, a local petty crim.
we've arrested him and something will happen because cirinna is like an uprooted tree with roots that are so long that they may lead to the marineo case.
and you didn't want it known he had a torrid affair with a woman.
i didn't want him remembered as someone killed by a lunatic.
i then met a priest who told me about a new kind of rosary...
i'd be scared to go on tv, but he's clever and brave, isn't he?
because it criminally links so many different levels of our society.
and finally, when i arrived in this town, a high official told me to look for a gun.
perhaps it's imperfect and incomplete, but i believe it crosses our entire town with its venom.
and it's behind the link that ties people and businesses, both legal and illegal, from murderers to officials... money.
you're afraid of despising yourself if you do what she did.
no, i don't want to abuse my position towards you... your weakness and loneliness.
among his many titles were lord of the cugno and baron of quattronze, by the sea.
he gave half his estate to my mother and i and spent the rest on women and gambling.
investigating his predecessor's death, corrado meets titti, the junkie daughter of the suicide noblewoman and gradually falls for her.
his marriage to else has been on the rocks for a while.
titti tells corrado that cirinna, a heroin trafficker, killed her mother and lnspector marineo.
titti, fearful of cirinna and dependent on the drugs he gives her, didn't dare report him to the police.
i want a direct investigation into the banking status of people and companies under suspicion.
i want to check all entries for the past 3 years including drafts and personal cheques.
i'm not saying this town is clean, but we run the risk of tarnishing everyone.
if i granted your request, i'm sure you'd find something, but what about the innocent people?
to me, the most important issue is the balance between two loyalties.
loyalty towards the rights of the individual and the right of society to be defended.
the lugano bahamas banking route is the best, given the situation.
as for the other military supplies we have, where's the best market?
it'll take more than that and i'm not speaking just from a personal point of view.
you'll be responsible for the social unrest that might arise from hasty actions so you must stop him in time.
but out of a love of nature, we'll call it "jasmine".
so, a sum leaves this account, which goes to finance a mysterious, illegal deal which...
chief inspector in florence or genoa... or higher still, maybe close to government.
as you know, it only takes good public relations and interviews in leading papers.
you see, lnspector, when one is as honest as you, intelligent, and one loves one's country, everything becomes simple and the path becomes obvious.
he talked for 2 hours, gave me his private number and naturally said to call him at any time, for anything.
the signatures on the jasmine account are by ravanusa, but terrasini's are on the poppy account.
forged endorsements released funds for the financiers and those that vanished in rome, naples, milan, turin... processed by bogus companies headed by reckless bankers, international traffickers, and maybe political organisations.
during the investigations, corrado meets titti, the junkie daughter of the suicide noblewoman and gradually falls for her.
his marriage to else has been on the rocks for a while.
titti tells corrado that a heroin trafficker called cirinna, killed her mother and lnspector marineo.
titti, terrified of cirinna and because of the drugs he gives her, had been too afraid to report him to the police.
corrado's investigations have come a long way, coming dangerously close to the heart of the criminal organisation.
through bank audits, the lnspector identifies the involvement of prominent citizens both in the drug trade and in the murders.
go to the office, act like god and give orders to the fools you work with.
but remember that from now on, we give the orders that count.
cirinna will stay in our hands and you'll avoid a dangerous situation.
you consider me a friend and i consider you a friend and we try to spare our friends trouble.
and profits and debts must be paid, sooner or later... if one wants to save one's skin.
after a thorough examination by prof. cristina, this morning sante cirinna was moved from jail to villa rosalia clinic for further tests.
i'm sure the lnspector knows more than i do about drug matters.
but i fear that... falling victim to his human qualities, and perhaps to help someone who's embroiled in that scene, he himself, has got lost in that world...
a world where neither we, nor the majority of our citizens has ever entered.
we have never walked down the dark paths he hasn't been afraid to venture down.
maybe you have a plan i'm not aware of, but unless we act, they'll take over and toss us into jail!
you're absolutely right, but you see, i needed to understand, to find a solution.
sir, it seems i'm a specialist in legal problems and conundrums.
so i've been asked to find a way to get your daughter home and make you happy.
we still have the issue of cirinna's gun, which killed deputy inspector leo de maria.
according to what we saw... the lnspector took it out of the dead man's hand and said it was cirinna's by putting it next to him.
maybe he wanted to do something kind... and he found that girl... who needed help.
addicts need their daily fix and to give it to her, and it's just my supposition,
corrado must have had contact with those in the drug trade.
and perhaps unwittingly, he found himself mixed up in the squalid world of traffickers.
her family wants to cure her, protect her, return her to life.
we've already booked the best clinic and you, don manfredi, may visit her to provide comfort for her.
i want the name of the bastard who raped the child.
okay, but even if someone did, we can't let that cop walk all over us.
besides, watching a man sleep, gives me like a sense of tenderness.
i did it with dad and grandpa as a child at our home in the country.
yes... but you see, it so happens... that i loved titti.
and i didn't want to run the risk that she'd be killed, you see?
when you try to stretch your legs the noose tightens and chokes you.
so you try to resist but you realise you're killing yourself.
he did well at the police academy, but i felt he had limitations like a lack of determination.
and to think that i recommended him for that quiet job in sicily.
just a few days ago, viewers, we noted with satisfaction how our city seemed to have escaped the bloodbath that's engulfing sicily.
but this morning, mr marineo, chief inspector, was found killed inside his car.
however, i've found new friends and that injustice will be redressed.
and if i get a certain job, my authority will count in many circles.
i was in a corner watching you as i sipped on my orange juice.

the wheel turns and we might get the wind in our sails.
i know, it's rather trite, but we mustn't see our actions as a catastrophe or a point of no return.
it might just be a response to an impulse of the moment.
the gun used against me is the gun that killed leo de maria.
the person responsible is called sante cirinna, a local petty crim.
you took marineo's body to the outskirts of town, returned to the office and waited for someone to raise the alarm.
and when it happened, you raced there to do your duty.
then she heard distant voices through the wall and witnessed a sudden tragedy.
marineo and eleonora found out that cirinna got titti onto drugs and threatened him.
i compared our job to that of a fisherman, who slowly pulls in his net without knowing which fish he'll catch.
i also said that the danger of this type of fishing is that once the fish spot the net they might flee before being caught and alert each other to the danger.
i'd be scared to go on tv, but he's clever and brave, isn't he?
because it criminally links so many different levels of our society.
and finally, when i arrived in this town, a high official told me to look for a gun.
we did find it and it's the same gun that killed deputy inspector leo de maria.
and it's behind the link that ties people and businesses, both legal and illegal, from murderers to officials... money.
that thread will perhaps allow us to find out why leo de maria was killed.
whoever wants to act will act and whoever wants to look on, no hard feelings.
deputy inspector leo de maria fallen in the line of duty
you're not going to prosecute the crime when it happens, as a chief inspector should.
but you want to flush it out with your laws, adapt it to your personal views, as dictated by those views.
look, i was born in here among monks and servants who said mass daily in the private chapel on cloths sewn by the nuns of the s. spirito convent.
the years went by without me realising it and i grew up not bothering to look outside the window.
i want to check all entries for the past 3 years including drafts and personal cheques.
then we'll see if this prosecutor is simply a wary man or rather, a dishonest, wary man.
let's strike the mafiosi wherever they are but let's not involve the innocent.
i'm not saying this town is clean, but we run the risk of tarnishing everyone.
if i granted your request, i'm sure you'd find something, but what about the innocent people?
honest working people who'd suddenly be maligned and in the glare of the press?
loyalty towards the rights of the individual and the right of society to be defended.
fine words, but tell me, are you refusing to authorise a bank audit of these people?
we can hit even harder if you'll help me persuade our prosecutor to audit the accounts of certain people.
a prominent banker, irreproachable professionals industrialists, and a famous lawyer are directly and indirectly the financiers and beneficiaries of an important drug ring.
you'll be responsible for the social unrest that might arise from hasty actions so you must stop him in time.
that fellow can have fun arresting petty criminals but he mustn't touch the banks.
an amount is taken out and goes to form a new so-called "lung" account because it fills and empties very quickly.
but out of a love of nature, we'll call it "jasmine".
so, once the deal is done, the amount goes into a new "lung" account, which we'll call "poppy".
part of the profit goes to the bank, but the most substantial amount goes back to replenish the accounts of the single financiers with 1 00% profit.
and i also speak french, but i'm not part of the jet set.
i'm here in this hole, defending my interests from 6am to 8pm!
oppressed by all possible privileges and mistress of a vulgar hoodlum.
you think you can free her from her habit but i'll bet everything that you'll fail.
for us, power will be the weapon against corruption, bureacracy, parasites... all that is rotten, including the mafia... whose criminal links pollute the sun of your beautiful sicily.
you see, lnspector, when one is as honest as you, intelligent, and one loves one's country, everything becomes simple and the path becomes obvious.
forged endorsements released funds for the financiers and those that vanished in rome, naples, milan, turin... processed by bogus companies headed by reckless bankers, international traffickers, and maybe political organisations.
but the largest slice stays in town and ends up in terrasini's account.
instead of guessing matches, we must guess who'll be the first in town to be shot by persons unknown!
and in our parts, when there's an upstart who stirs things up, somehow, there's always someone who'll silence him.
go to the office, act like god and give orders to the fools you work with.
but remember that from now on, we give the orders that count.
cirinna will stay in our hands and you'll avoid a dangerous situation.
you consider me a friend and i consider you a friend and we try to spare our friends trouble.
and profits and debts must be paid, sooner or later... if one wants to save one's skin.
after a thorough examination by prof. cristina, this morning sante cirinna was moved from jail to villa rosalia clinic for further tests.
i'm sure the lnspector knows more than i do about drug matters.
but i fear that... falling victim to his human qualities, and perhaps to help someone who's embroiled in that scene, he himself, has got lost in that world...
a world where neither we, nor the majority of our citizens has ever entered.
we have never walked down the dark paths he hasn't been afraid to venture down.
maybe you have a plan i'm not aware of, but unless we act, they'll take over and toss us into jail!
you're absolutely right, but you see, i needed to understand, to find a solution.
sir, it seems i'm a specialist in legal problems and conundrums.
so i've been asked to find a way to get your daughter home and make you happy.
we still have the issue of cirinna's gun, which killed deputy inspector leo de maria.
according to what we saw... the lnspector took it out of the dead man's hand and said it was cirinna's by putting it next to him.
addicts need their daily fix and to give it to her, and it's just my supposition,
corrado must have had contact with those in the drug trade.
and perhaps unwittingly, he found himself mixed up in the squalid world of traffickers.
a small favour every day, and you end up trapped and a victim of blackmail.
this is a humanitarian mission which has at heart the interests of miss pecci scialoia.
her family wants to cure her, protect her, return her to life.
yes, but tonight he'll have the honour of coming to my home.
i want the name of the bastard who raped the child.
you wear dark glasses and plug your ears, but life isn't just respectable pleasantries.
each plays in their own way but it would be foolish to ruin a good game when one has played as a partner.
titti had said such a silly thing, you, lnspector, would have arrested me.
you would have dragged me in front of a judge and i would have been stuffed...
so you try to resist but you realise you're killing yourself.
so you grit your teeth but you're out of breath, your bones seem to break, your heart pounds so hard that it'll burst.
and to think that i recommended him for that quiet job in sicily.
he seemed demoralised, with a difficult marital situation and he's ended up being such a problem for us!
you tried to force my locker once again, little bastard !
stop hitting me or i tell it to my mother !
i don't want to disturb you, but did you see chim ?
no, but you make me worry, was i supposed to ?
not necessarily but this little bastard ran away with one of my mopeds.
by the way, romeo fabrizzio, import-export: does it ring a bell to you ?
there's cops everywhere here: a cop for a ear of corn !
this winter, the bread won't be made with bran but with cops arse hairs.
there's a nice view on the plain, i'm sure you're going to enjoy your stay.
i hope she's not too much of a bore, 'cause she's a real pain in the arse !
tell me first: my guy is with the limpy girl, is that it ?
excuse me, colonel, but the limpy girl, as you call her, is part of the family.
all right get lost all of you have a good weekend.
hey dad, who are you going to put as winger against marshall?
i am different... i have no more value, than dust under your feet.
all my life i am told i am american and not truly vietnamise.
no way, i told him to come talk to me and he hasn`t.
but larry is my best friend, part of the family, almost.
listen to me, nguyen and her people were not our enemy.
i know larry`s father was killed over there and larry never got to know his dad.
nguyen made it. i know your father would be very happy about that.
i know how hard it is to lose a man like larry.
you`ve no idea how long l`ve wanted to hear you guys say that.
go tell nguyen how you feel, it`s been so tough on her.
immigrants poured in from all over the world, looking for a better life.
over 97 percent of them settled in a two-block area of new york city.
sure we did illegal things, but we never bothered the general public.
and every christmas, jocko returned a little cash back to the community.
here, at the atlanta genital institute teams of doctors are at work around the clock to cure this dreaded affliction.
hi, i'm dr. zillman, and i'd like to talk to you about your testes.
and for that reason, i'm naming as my successor johnny dangerously.
now i want you to give a warm welcome to a very shy, retiring, little lady who's come to us from a convent school in pittsburgh:
roman troy moronie is the man responsible for the mother's day massacre, the christmas day slaughter the lincoln's birthday mutilation, and the groundhog's day beheadings.
before we begin the questions, my client would like to read a statement.
we knock off kelly, and the whole city would be breathing down our necks.
if jocko was in charge, we'd be making cement loafers for him.
and on those chilly winter nights sally can wrap herself up in this number.
and on those hot summer nights, she can wrap herself up in ice!
i've devoted my entire life to crime since i was 12 years old.
i just think we ought to relax, that's all, and enjoy what we got.
i'd love to stick around and see how this whole thing turns out but i got a new store to open.
oh, you lousy, wop, slovak, chink, jap, polack, mick, krauts, hebe fags!
- too bad because she's singing like a canary, and we got her in her own cage.
it's gonna be my pleasure to send you to the chair.
- when cagney gets his in the movie a few minutes from now.
calling all cars, be on the lookout for johnny dangerously and two accomplices in a black sedan.
he weighed as much as teddy roosevelt and half of mckinley.
immigrants poured in from all over the world, looking for a better life.
over 97 percent of them settled in a two-block area of new york city.
there was a law that said that immigrants who wanted citizenship had to stay out of their apartments and walk around the streets with hats on.
when i die, hopefully in my bed i wanna know that the dundee mob will continue with the same traditions with the same high standards that have made us the new york yankees of crime.
and for that reason, i'm naming as my successor johnny dangerously.
that song you just sang, i figured that gave me the green light.
let's just say you're off red, but you're still on amber.
to me two darling sons, one a famous night club owner the other a crime fighter.
with a father like killer kelly it's a miracle neither of you turned out to be a piece-of-shit criminal.
and then, he turned his sights on my old enemy, moronie.
roman troy moronie is the man responsible for the mother's day massacre, the christmas day slaughter the lincoln's birthday mutilation, and the groundhog's day beheadings.
smoking don't make you look tough, it makes you look stupid.
if you've gotta put something in your mouth make it a stick of chewing gum.
if i leave it to you, johnny'll fry in the chair like his father.
well, your old mom just might have something for you tonight.
the governor and da kelly will attend the premiere of the new james cagney movie tomorrow night.
should be clear skies tomorrow night as the governor and da tommy kelly attend the new james cagney movie.
i'll have some stories to tell my grandchildren if i have any.
lil, what do you say we start a little gang of our own?

lil, what do you say we start a little gang of our own?
i suppose hiring a driver would have been too much to ask for.
well, it's not mildred's fault that the guy who owns this wagon... was too superstitious to chauffeur a coffin.
judging from old borg-ward's efficient filing system... odds are carlisle was sent to amad's family.
so our next step is to find out where amad was buried and have the body exhumed.
i'm sorry, sir, but for reasons i cannot explain, i must humbly refuse.
then perhaps you could recommend us to another mortuary where we might-
- that is, if we expect to get home by the turn of the century.
just what i always wanted to do on a sultry mediterranean night.
it's just that i... couldn't stand the thought of being alone tonight.
yes, it's amazing how a lonely bar offers comfort... when you find yourself, uh, alone.
we had the pleasure of traveling to malta on the same airplane.
permit me to say how very pleased i am... that we are also staying at the same hotel.
can i help it if i am by nature a suspicious man?
it was i who found that piece, and i intend to get my full share.
mr. steele and i have a very big day ahead of us tomorrow.
much as i would love to enjoy the romantic mediterranean sky from the seat of a gondola... uh, perhaps we should take a rain check, hmm?
i'm going to see to it that the fourth piece is delivered to me... and then, if we are lucky enough... and provided that we both live long enough to enjoy it... you and i will be very, very rich.
you caught a man stealing the maltese cross... from its display case at the historical society... chased him to a rundown hotel, up to a room where he strapped the cross on a falcon... let it go, and then bit on a poison capsule and fell dead?
for the moment, though, let's savor the thrill of discovery, eh?
i imagine benjamin carlisle felt much the same way, mr. steele.

i, on the other hand, was not in the least surprised.
as aiec's closest friend, i had shared his penchant for privacy... and his belief that friendships are measured in quality rather than quantity.
i'll be eternally in your debt if you'd direct me to... some quiet but peaceful establishment for gentlemen residents.
why, david, you'll stay with me, of course, as my guest.
that was in the days when the guest house was a guest house.
he continued his vague references to his theory... that aiec had met with foul play.
when i asked for an explanation... or inquired about his background since sandhurst...
david took the most curious tack... reacting as if i already knew everything about him.
my aunt odie later said he always said that... just before he started snooping into someone else's business.
now, i couldn't quite equate... spying on higgins with scientific study and progress.
david went off in search of clues... to the whereabouts of moriarty... while i waited for the museum chaps.
before they arrived, i discovered sir aiec's diary... and some rather disturbing entries.
now on the other side of the paint chip... cadmium-yellow primer.
now, that was only made in the first part of '7 4.
dirty, little, well-hidden place on, what i think you call the north shore.
believe me, watson... the man who owns this particular rolls-royce... didn't want that repair work discovered.
as i examined aiec's diary into the early hours of the morning...
i began to have the uneasy feeling... that david was not as mad as i had first presumed.
he took it in his head one day that he wanted... one of my tennis shoes for a chew toy.
and no matter where i hid that tennis shoe... he'd find it.
i had been a bumbling watson... obsessed with the now trivial matter of alec's past... not there to assist when his own deductions... had led him into grave danger.
i hadn't realized until that moment... how strong the bonds of friendship really are.
judging from the small punctures in my side... some form of drugged dart.
i eluded my captors... and in short order, i found some materials for this disguise.
when he returns, the doctor will be carrying... a syringe like i have.
when he goes to inject the poison... leap from the table and overpower him.
we must pretend to be fast asleep... until they are right beside us.
if we get separated, stall them... until i get back... with the evidence that i need.
david malcolm worth... alias stanley sigerson... is an escapee from a home for the insane.
and why, may i ask... would ml6 be so interested... in the whereabouts of one mentally troubled person?
when that person happens to have been a british secret agent... in russia for 30 years.
mr. higgins, he has enough information in that scrambled brain of his... to start a war.
it was no ionger even a matter of getting the camera lens.
it was more important to prove to myself and to him, i guess... that i couid get into that room.
i tried to ask you for it, but... you were acting so mysterious.
i guess i just had to find out what you were up to.
i was bequeathed the sad duty of acting as... executor to sir alec ramsey.
the few that gathered to grant this knighted veteran... of her majesty's service the final courtesy... were appalled by the tuppenny, ha'penny turnout.
i, on the other hand, was not in the least surprised.
as alec's closest friend, i had shared his penchant for privacy... and his belief that friendships are measured in quality rather than quantity.
i'll be eternally in your debt if you'd direct me to... some quiet but peaceful establishment for gentlemen residents.
why, david, you'll stay with me, of course, as my guest.
seems to me you'd be glad he's not talking to you.
i have to conduct the surveillance for a very important client.
i brought david home... and made him comfortable in the guest house.
that was in the days when the guest house was a guest house.
i began to notice that he took on a wry smile... every time i said his name.
when i asked for an explanation... or inquired about his background since sandhurst...
sir alec ramsey was probably one of england's... most famous explorers.
consequently, the british museum have laid claim... to all his personal effects.
my aunt odie later said he always said that... just before he started snooping into someone else's business.
now, i couldn't quite equate... spying on higgins with scientific study and progress.
david went off in search of clues... to the whereabouts of moriarty... while i waited for the museum chaps.
before they arrived, i discovered sir alec's diary... and some rather disturbing entries.
now, you recognize this poly-gloss black enamel paint... used exclusively by rolls-royce?
now on the other side of the paint chip... cadmium-yellow primer.
now, that was only made in the first part of '74.
so... all we have to do is check out a few body shops... and see if any 1974 rolls-royces... went in for bodywork.
there is a gentleman by that name who... well, if he had been responsible for such an accident... he certainly wouldn't be trying to hide it.
hoon ching is one of the most successful... and respected businessmen on this island.
it wasn't just the fact... that david had indeed located the body shop... or that he might embarrass one of our city's leading citizens... that prompted me to accompany him to hoon ching's residence.
an entry in alec's diary led me to the conclusion... that alec and david had been for some time in correspondence over a case.
i began to have the uneasy feeling... that david was not as mad as i had first presumed.
the wording of certain entries left no doubt... that alec was involved with something illegal... perhaps a crime as heinous as drug trafficking.
i hadn't realized until that moment... how strong the bonds of friendship really are.
i was deeply concerned for the safety of my old school chum.
judging from the small punctures in my side... some form of drugged dart.
i eluded my captors... and in short order, i found some materials for this disguise.
david malcolm worth... alias stanley sigerson... is an escapee from a home for the insane.

mr. higgins, he has enough information in that scrambled brain of his... to start a war.
it was no longer even a matter of getting the camera lens.
it was more important to prove to myself and to him, i guess... that i could get into that room.
i mean, i just came in to get this... this camera lens that i needed.
i tried to ask you for it, but... you were acting so mysterious.
he very kindly forgave me and we corresponded regularly... happily creating and solving the most complex crimes.
then several months ago, i received the most curious letter from him.
we also address ourselves to some of the most vital issues of our times.
for instance, if south-east asia were to be obliterated by a nuclear attack,
in fact, frasier and i have been to several places you and i frequented.
it's refreshing to go out with someone who doesn't slide across museum floors in their socks.
those paintings look a lot better if you go by fast.
anyway, i'll make sure they don't put me in the same room at the pequod.
i'm talking about one of ours, the fruit of my loins.
would you like to use my office, for a little privacy?
my attorney assures me that i got a very good case.
in fact, he thinks i can get all five kids and you as a maid.
the tortelli television hospital has just come off a record-breaking quarter.
i'll tell you, i got ten men working under me, and two of them is american.
even if i gave you those kids, they wouldn't want to go with you.
the young ones don't know who you are, the old ones hate your guts.
but if i'm alone with him for a second, i'll melt.
then, as a simple solution, we shan't let you alone with him.
ok, carla's in there facing the greatest crisis of her life.
i want everybody to be quiet for a moment, close your eyes and send her your most positive mental energy.
for instance, if south-east asia were to be obliterated by a nuclear attack,
norm would have to push a peanut up boylston street with his nose.
in fact, frasier and i have been to several places you and i frequented.
it's refreshing to go out with someone who doesn't slide across museum floors in their socks.
those paintings look a lot better if you go by fast.
anyway, i'll make sure they don't put me in the same room at the pequod.
i'm talking about one of ours, the fruit of my loins.
would you like to use my office, for a little privacy?
i don't want anybody thinking it's my fault so i figured i'd take one of our old ones.
you want me to give you and that twinkle one of my children?
my attorney assures me that i got a very good case.
in fact, he thinks i can get all five kids and you as a maid.
the tortelli television hospital has just come off a record-breaking quarter.
i'll tell you, i got ten men working under me, and two of them is american.
even if i gave you those kids, they wouldn't want to go with you.
the young ones don't know who you are, the old ones hate your guts.
that's right. i don't wanna be the kind of guy who rubs it in, so just let me say... i have a little bad news for you.
i bet the coach that if you won you'd be obnoxious, so i come out even.
but, look at me, a castle uncle, so worried i can't sleep at night
and if there are ohmu shells there, don't say it's bad to play in the princess's wasteland...
"that person, wearing a blue robe, shall stand in a golden field..."
"...in order to forge again the lost bonds with the ground..."
"at last they will lead everyone to an earth of blue purity..."
lord yupa, i believed that it was only an old legend.
we came to link the countries of the frontier areas to build a safe world.
you are on the verge of being destroyed by the wasteland.
i am leaving this place... until i get an opportunity to return secretly.
at any rate, see if you can stop those idiots from reviving it.
we don't know how much a thousand of years that will take
we can't keep on living in fear of the vapors and the insects.
the more i look at you, the more you seems a cute monster.
even for a penniless soldier like me, the ambition which was sleeping starts to re-appear
she told me it's the beautiful hand of a hard-working person!
even affected by the poisons of the wasteland, however, you say you will live with the wasteland?
"and guide the people to the pure land. a t last"
lord yupa, i always thought tha t was only a legend
last night, these villagers toiled despera tely to save one of your ships
we have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest ls this how you tolmekians treat such a nation. however weak !
we have come to unif y the frontier na tions and build peace in this region
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay
the castle windmill draws wa ter from deep within the earth
the sand, too, comes from the very bottom of the well
it' s a chiko nut it' s really good f or you
it doesn' t taste grea t, but i could ea t a whole boot-full !
the trees of the sea of decay grew to cleanse a world polluted by humans
they absorb toxins from the earth, genera te pure crystals, die and turn to sand
we can' t possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects f or thousands of years
at least we can find a way to keep it from spreading
burn the sea of decay, kill the insects, and restore the human world why do you hesitate !
steal it from us, just as we stole it from pejite
it' s too strong for our guns, but bury it in a hole...
i, too, wish to wait lf she really does return from deep in the sea of decay...
don' t be angry don' t be frightened i' m not your f oe
i' m sorry i' m sorry i can' t ask your forgiveness
let's go, soon, this will also be consumed in the sea of decay
1 ,000 years after the collapse of industrial civilization, the sea of decay, a swamp exuding toxic vapors, covered an earth strewn with rusting ruins, threatening human survival
the giant warriors were all said to have turned to stone
but a single one slept in the earth for 1 ,000 years
we have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest
is this how you tolmekians treat such a nation, however weak!
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay
in the 1 ,000 years of the sea of decay, countless times have humans sought to burn it away
yet... each time herds of ohms, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth, like a tidal wave
destroying nations, swallowing cities, the ohms' rage would not quiet until they starved to death
in time, the spores took root in the ohms' rotting flesh, and engulfed our vast earth in this sea of decay
the trees of the sea of decay grew to cleanse a world polluted by humans
they absorb toxins from the earth, generate pure crystals, die and turn to sand
we could easily start a fight, but why sacrifice more people?
fire and water are powerless against it, and it's only a matter of time before it starts to walk
my orders to invade pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength
once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization, rust and ceramic fragments covered the land.
over this wasteland, a deadly forest of fungi spreads, releasing poisonous vapors.
i can't see it any more but it's the lord on the left corner.
"that one, wearing a robe of blue, shall descend onto a golden field."
but, this one managed to sleep underground for a thousand years.
now that you mention it, it does seem to have human characteristics.
we have come to unite the borderland countries to construct a land without worry.
you are on the verge of being engulfed by the wastelands.
you can't know what will happen if you use that gun in this place.
in the battle a little while ago many ships fell into the forest.
the reason for the birth of the wastelands? you think about strange things.
the trees of the wastelands were born to clean this world that humans polluted.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take we can't keep living in fear of the poisons and the insects.
at the very least, we need a way to keep the wasteland from spreading any further.
even for a poor soldier like myself, long-dormant ambitions start to ache.
it's laughing! the likes of you should've slept underground 'til the end of time! chief! her highness's convoy was attacked.
it was out of fear that another country might possess such enormous power... i was order to conquer pejite.
now that its location is known, your neighbors will soon send huge armies.
that's right! if we don't hurry, the whole valley will be consumed!
return the hand-hook and flame-throwers! the tools for burning spores could be used as weapons.
your highness! while we hold them here, take everyone to shelter by the acid sea! understood.
hold on until the princess returns with the gunship! everybody, hurry.
to see if she can indeed return from the depths of the wastelands alive.
i wanted to have a nice, long word with her for once.
she told me it was the beautiful hand of a hard-working person.
even so affected by the poisons, you say you will live with the wasteland? you use fire.
princess, what are you doing? mito, you go warn everyone! princess!
without even a weapon -- those are not our flares! distance? about 20 leagues.
the anger of the ohmu is the anger of the earth.
of what use is surviving, relying on a thing like that? princess! it's the princess! a place like that?
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization, rust and ceramic fragments covered the land.
over this wasteland, a deadly forest of fungi spreads, releasing poisonous vapors.
if we're talking about health, the princess is famous for it.
but, it wouldn't do if the child imitated the princess's playing in the wastelands as well.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take
we can't keep living in fear of the poisons and the insects.
to see if she can indeed return from the depth of the wastelands alive.
i would have liked to have spoken with that girl once.
let's go, soon, this will also be consumed in the sea of decay.
1,000 years after the collapse of industrial civilization, the sea of decay, a swamp exuding toxic vapors, covered an earth strewn with rusting ruins, threatening human survival...
the giant warriors were all said to have turned to stone!
but a single one slept in the earth for 1,000 years.
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region.
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay
we have revived the miraculous skills and power that once allowed humans to rule this earth.
for those who submit to us, i promise a life free from fear of the toxins and insects of that swamp.
the ohms' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.
in time, the spores took root in the ohms' rotting flesh, and engulfed our vast earth in this sea of decay.
when the waters quiet, take off and wait for me above!
if i'm not back in 1 hour, return to the valley!
we can't possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects for thousands of years!
at least we can find a way to keep it from spreading.
to unite the borderland countries to construct a land without worry.
you are on the verge of being engulfed by the wastelands.
the ohmu continued to run until their own lives ran out.
in due time using ohmu's corpses as the seed-beds, the spores dropped their roots and more lands were swallowed into the wastelands.
when the water calms down, take off at once and wait up in the air.
if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!
the trees of the wastelands were born to clean this world that humans polluted.
they take the earth's poison into themselves purify it into clean crystals, then die and become pure sands.
if so, it seems we'd have no choice but to die out.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take-
the anger of the ohmu is the anger of the earth.
of what use is surviving, relying on a thing like that?
and lead everyone, at last, to a land of blue purity.
master yupa i thought that it was only an old legend.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take-
we can't keep living in fear of the poisons and the insects.
to see if she can indeed return from the depth of the wastelands alive.
i would have liked to have spoken with that girl once.
let's go, soon, this will also be consumed in the sea of decay.
1,000 years after the collapse of industrial civilization, the sea of decay, a swamp exuding toxic vapors, covered an earth strewn with rusting ruins, threatening human survival.
the giant warriors were all said to have turned to stone.
but a single one slept in the earth for 1,000 years.
we have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest.
is this how you tolmekians treat such a nation, however weak!
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region.
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay.
in the 1,000 years of the sea of decay, countless times have humans sought to burn it away.
yet... each time herds of ohmus, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth, like a tidal wave.
destroying nations, swallowing cities, the ohmus' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.

if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley.
we can't possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects for thousands of years.
at least we can find a way to keep it from spreading.
how beautiful ... even though this place is a forest of death where,
if not for this mask, my lungs would decay in five minutes.
we have revived the miraculous skills and powers that have once made the human race the masters of this planet.
to those who obey me, i promise a livelihood without fear of the forest poisons or the insects
when the water calms down, lift off at once and wait in the upper sky!
if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!
the trees of the fukai were born to clean this world that humans have polluted...
they take the earth's poison into themselves, turn it into clean crystals, then die and become sands.
if so, it seems like we have no choice but to die out.
we don't know how many thousands of years it would take,
we can't keep on living in fear of the vapors and the insects.
at the least, we need a way to keep the poison from spreading more than it has.
that it was built before the seven days of fire, right?
i don't know if that's true or not, but it supposedly went as far as the stars, or some such.
if, that is, she can indeed return from the depth of the fukai alive ...
i would have liked to have spoken with that girl once.
she told me it's the beautiful hand of a hard-working person!
even while being affected by the poisons of the fukai, you nonetheless say you will live with the fukai?
the giant warriors were all said to have turned to stone
but a single one slept in the earth for 1000 years
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay
in the 1000 years of the sea of decay, countless times have humans sought to burn it away
yet... each time herds of ohms, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth.
the ohms rage would not quiet until they starved to death
in time, the spores took root in the ohms' rotting flesh, and engulfed our vast earth in this sea of decay
when the waters quiet take off and wait for me above.
if i'm not back in 1 hour return to the valley.
my orders to invade pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength
once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies
burn the sea of decay, kill the insects, and restore the human world why do you hesitate!
steal it from us, just as we stole it from pejite
i'm afraid it is not the easiest thing to fly with!
(chuckles) she certainly knows how to read the wind come you two, we're almost there
[toeto] we would be very honored if you would choose a name for her
[valley woman] with your blessing fair winds are sure to favor her
it's good to hope for a daughter whose strong like the princess, but not for one who likes to play in the toxic jungle
[nausicaä] but mito, the jungle is where i found the ohm shell
[mito] all i do is worry when she's running around out there,
i'd trade a thousand ohm shells for a good night's sleep [men chuckles]
[gol laughs] sorry mito, we'd rather have the ohm shells and i think the princess should explore all she wants
[lord yupa] i agree, who else would rescue me when i'm in trouble?
it seems as if it spreads faster everyday, and the kingdoms that still survive are torn by war and starvation, the cities are plagued with fear, why can't the the other kingdoms live happily as you do here?
[old woman] it's because we have the wind from the sea to protect us from the jungle's poisons we know the poison cannot reach us here
[king jihl] lord yupa, isn't it about time you settled down here?
with my present condition, it would bring peace of mind to us all
"after a thousand years of darkness, he will come, clad in blue and surrounded by fields of gold, to restore mankind's connection with the earth that was destroyed"
[nausicaä] "and he will guide the people of this planet at last to a land of purity"
apparently one has lain dormant deep underground for the past 1000 years
[mito] if they unearthed it in pejite, what was it doing on a tolmekian ship?
i'm going to... [woman] put it down, kurotowa but she... [sighs] oh fine, but look at this mess, now i must acquire all new men!
[woman commander] so you're lord yupa, the greatest swordsman in the land
[kushana] i have in my possession mankind's greatest tool, the awesome force which once allowed human beings to rule the earth.
i guarantee that those who join me, will live without fear of the insects or the jungle's poisons ever again!
[kushana] those orders cannot be carried out, the giant warrior is so heavy, even our largest ship couldn't transport it
[kurotowa] your highness, you can't seriously want to stay here and start a new kingdom?
[lord yupa] don't worry about that, our only concern is that the warrior staying dormant
i'm going to leave the valley, then i'll slip back and wait for my chance
00:41:39,803 -- 00:41:40,529 [sniffs] its true the air is pure in here but i know these plants from the jungle, these are some of the most lethal
[nausicaä] i irrigated this chamber using water drawn from deep underground by the castle windmill
they're already enraged from all your ships crashing into their jungle look at them swarming [insects buzzing]
[nausicaä] the giant dragonflies are the sentries of the jungle soon they'll summon hordes of insects to this site, we must get out of here now,
[gol] princess, what in the world do you think you're doing?
[nausicaä] take off as soon as the waters are calm, and wait for me above the cloud line!
this is like the sand from the bottom of our well
it looks like these trees must die and fossilize, and then crumble into sand
[nausicaä] the trees of the toxic jungle must've evolved to purify the earth of all the pollution that we humans have made the trees absorb the pollution so it becomes inert, then they die and petrify and then crumble into purified sand,
that's how these underground caverns must've been formed and the insects, they evolved to guard this place
[asbel] if that's true, then mankind is destined to go extinct it'll take centuries for these trees to cleanse the earth, we can't survive with insects that long
somehow, we are going to have to find a way to stop this toxic jungle from spreading
[kurotowa] so, is this lowly soldier finally on the path to fame and fortune?
or on the path to destruction... [boy] lord yupa, mito and the others are back, [boy2] they're all waiting for you at the acid lake
i was ordered to attack pejite because we feared another kingdom would get ahold of the warrior's power once its existence is known, all the remaining kingdoms will send their armies here to claim it
you really only have one choice lord yupa, revive the giant warrior, use it to repel the invading kingdoms, and learn to live with the monster 01:13:21,920 -- 01:13:22,538 [clanking!
the insects must be stopped, you must revive the warrior and use it to destroy them and their jungle!
steal it from us as we stole it from pejite that's what i'd do if i were you
[kurotowa] we have no choice, hand over everything but their guns [royal guard] yes sir!
[captain] sir, the ship is ready to depart [kurotowa] try not to fail this time assemble all the tolmekian soldiers left in pejite and bring them to the valley [captain] yes sir!
this forest has protected the valley from the jungle's poisons for 300 years [valley man2] if only the tolmekians had never come
[gol] it looks like things are getting out of control we better get back there fast!
[pejite chief] we have to get the giant warrior out of the hands of the tolmekians no matter what it takes
[pejite man] we're doing this for the good of the planet, you've got to understand
[pejite chief] once the insects start stampeding, they can't be stopped
the tolmekians nearly killed off all our people, they must be stopped!
[pejite chief] you're wrong, the tolmekians want to take over the world!
[nausicaä] listen, every one of us relies on water from the wells because mankind has polluted all the lakes and rivers but do you know why the well water is pure?
or your mother, or the girl who took my place in the cell you need all the help you can get!
[asbel] you have to save the people of the valley, please!
[kushana] they expect her to come back here and rescue them, with their gunship
[kurotowa] that gunship could be a real pain in the neck, should we start a fight now and avoid the mess?
[kushana] do you know anything about that old ship they're hiding in?
[kurotowa] i've heard it was built before the seven days of fire
[gikkuri] you plan to burn down the jungle, but we've learned to use fire only in small amounts
[gol] that's right, too much fire gives birth to nothing fire can reduce a forest to ashes in a day, while it takes the water and the wind a hundred years to grow one anew
[gikkuri] we prefer the ways of the water and the wind
[niga] the princess will be devastated when she sees that our forest is gone [soldier] sir, do we have any orders yet sir?
[elderly woman] but mito, we're going to die anyway we should die in the valley
[mito] no, as long as the princess hasn't given up, we can't either!
[younger pejite] i think she's trying to tell us something, maybe we shouldn't shoot her [older pejite] anyone who interferes with the plan is an enemy besides, if we don't release this baby ohm in the valley soon,
we'll be the ones in trouble here she comes, wait till she gets close, and then fire
i'm so sorry is there any way you can forgive us?
how we've treated you so badly 01:42:40,751 -- 01:42:42,182 [bellowing] 01:42:44,551 -- 01:42:45,582 [shhssss!
[little girl in red cap] obaba, are we all going to die?
[obaba] if that is to be our fate, we can only wait and see
[kurotowa] they don't even flinch [soldier] i think we should retreat, sir
[kurotowa] don't be stupid soldier, there's nowhere to retreat to [clank!
[cheering shouting] 01:54:53,291 -- 01:54:54,535 [gasps] 01:54:55,591 -- 01:54:57,535 [all laughing]
a team nanban (594mgnav) release 01:55:05,289 -- 01:55:07,707 starring the voices of
i can't see it any more but, it's the lord on the left corner.
wearing a robe of blue, that one will descend onto a golden field. he will forge the lost bond with the land,
when the water calms down, take off at once and wait up in the air.
if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!
the trees of the wastelands were born to clean this world that humans polluted.
they take the earth's poison into themselves purify it into clean crystals, then die and become pure sands.
if so, it seems we'd have no choice but to die out.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take
the anger of the ohmu is the anger of the earth.
what's the use of surviving if we have to rely on a thing like that?
yet another village is dead... let's go, soon this place too will be consumed by the toxic jungle
a thousand years have past, since the collapse of industrialized civilization, a toxic jungle now spreads threatening the survival of the last of the human race
i should've come sooner no, i'm just glad you could come at all
lord yupa, there's something i want to show you when we get back to the valley,
i'm afraid it is not the easiest thing to fly with!
(chuckles) she certainly knows how to read the wind come you two, we're almost there
lord yupa, we had a baby born in the valley this year wonderful!
let's have a look oh, she's a fine baby, strong and healthy she reminds me of nausicaä as a child we would be very honored if you would choose a name for her with your blessing fair winds are sure to favor her
it's good to hope for a daughter whose strong like the princess, but not for one who likes to play in the toxic jungle but mito, the jungle is where i found the ohm shell all i do is worry when she's running around out there,
i'd trade a thousand ohm shells for a good night's sleep sorry mito, we'd rather have the ohm shells and i think the princess should explore all she wants
i found two more kingdoms to the south that have been consumed by the jungle
it seems as if it spreads faster everyday, and the kingdoms that still survive are torn by war and starvation, the cities are plagued with fear, why can't the the other kingdoms live happily as you do here?
it's because we have the wind from the sea to protect us from the jungle's poisons we know the poison cannot reach us here lord yupa, isn't it about time you settled down here?
with my present condition, it would bring peace of mind to us all hmm... that's impossible lord yupa must continue his search, it's his destiny
the answer is on the tapestry which hangs before you, although i can no longer see it, i remember it well, there is a figure in the upper left corner
"after a thousand years of darkness, he will come, clad in blue and surrounded by fields of gold, to restore mankind's connection with the earth that was destroyed"
obaba is just teasing me not true, that is the goal you seek the only goal i seek obaba is to understand the mysteries of the toxic jungle
i want to know if mankind is truly fated to be swallowed up by it or if there is still some hope that we may survive,
apparently one has lain dormant deep underground for the past 1000 years if they unearthed it in pejite, what was it doing on a tolmekian ship?
tolmekia is far to the west, and its rulers are very warlike that they had a pejite hostage on board worries me
last night, the people of this valley risked their lives attempting to prevent your airship from crashing and just this morning they finished giving your dead a proper burial this may be a small kingdom, but it clearly deserves your courtesy and respect!
if you are here to make war there must be a fitting reason, and it's only right to first send a messenger to announce your grievances!
they toppled cities, destroyed kingdoms, and killed thousands the ohm could not be stopped such rage did they feel the ohm fought 'till they died of starvation then spores took root in their corpses, and the land soon became part of the toxic jungle
that's why you do not interfere with it silence you old hag!
ah yes, i do see your point, but i'm just a soldier of tolmekia,
i'm not in a position to make that decision hmm, weasel
yes, an unexpected find for such a quaint valley those are my orders,
i'll leave for pejite first thing in the morning but, kushana, why must the princess go with you?
mito, thank you for accompanying the princess no i'm glad to go, but look at those greedy tolmekians, they're stripping us of everything!
don't worry about that, our only concern is that the warrior stay in dormant
i collected the spores and grew them down here myself don't worry, the plants aren't poisonous they're not poisonous?
its true the air is pure in here but i know these plants from the jungle, these are some of the most lethal
i was hoping to find a cure for father's illness, but... [sobs] it's too late now, i'm shutting down
i've already cut off the water, soon these plants will wither and die
you're too naive you shouldn't think we're best friends now, just because you saved me
listen, you don't understand the jungle this is no place for guns, if you fire that here, the insects will descend upon us in seconds
they're already enraged from all your ships crashing into their jungle look at them swarming
the giant dragonflies are the sentries of the jungle soon they'll summon hordes of insects to this site, we must get out of here now,
take off as soon as the waters are calm, and wait for me above the cloud line
mito, if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!
i'm nausicaä, i'm from the valley of the wind what is this place?
you're not going to believe this we're actually beneath the toxic jungle beneath the jungle?
this is like the sand from the bottom of our well
it looks like these trees must die and fossilize, and then crumble into sand
you sure spend a lot of time thinking about strange things the trees of the toxic jungle must've evolved to purify the earth of all the pollution that we humans have made the trees absorb the pollution so it becomes inert,
then they die and petrify and then crumble into purified sand, that's how these underground caverns must've been formed
and the insects, they evolved to guard this place if that's true, then mankind is destined to go extinct it'll take centuries for these trees to cleanse the earth, we can't survive with insects that long
somehow, we are going to have to find a way to stop this toxic jungle from spreading you pejites sound just like the tolmekians what?
i was ordered to attack pejite because we feared another kingdom would get ahold of the warrior's power once its existence is known, all the remaining kingdoms will send their armies here to claim it
you really only have one choice lord yupa, revive the giant warrior, use it to repel the invading kingdoms, and learn to live with the monster look
the insects must be stopped, you must revive the warrior and use it to destroy them and their jungle!
steal it from us as we stole it from pejite that's what i'd do if i were you
if we give them tools to burn the spores, they could use them against us instead we have no choice, hand over everything but their guns yes sir!
sir, the ship is ready to depart try not to fail this time assemble all the tolmekian soldiers left in pejite and bring them to the valley yes sir!
this forest has protected the valley from the jungle's poisons for 300 years if only the tolmekians had never come
it looks like things are getting out of control we better get back there fast
do you know anything about that old ship they're hiding in?
i've heard it was built before the seven days of fire
if you advise the villagers to surrender, i'll let you go or would you rather end up like pejite?
it's strange that you're a princess too you're not anything at all like our princess ah, take a look at my hands
i have the same illness as king jihl six months from now, my hands will be as hard as rocks but our princess told me that she truly loves these beat-up old hands of mine, when she looks at these hands,
she knows these are the hands of a hard worker how can you be so foolish?
the jungle is killing you yet you want to live in harmony with it?
you plan to burn down the jungle, but we've learned to use fire only in small amounts that's right, too much fire gives birth to nothing fire can reduce a forest to ashes in a day,
the princess stayed behind to try to stop the stampede from reaching the valley!
this is no time for a battle, everybody, get to high ground, hurry!
i'm responsible for this castle and she's made me sick with worry.
let her play in the sea of decay if she finds us ohm shells.
the ohms' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.
in time, the spores took root in the ohms' rotting flesh,
now do as i have said, i was not asking you.
but you highness, taking the princess to pejite, five hostages, the gun ship and food...
the sand, too, comes from the very bottom of the well.
with pure water and soil, the plants from the sea of decay are not poisonous.
when the waters quiet again, take off and wait for me on the surface.
if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley.
the trees of the sea of decay grew to cleanse a world polluted by humans.
they absorb toxins from the earth, generate pure crystals, die and turn to sand.
the tools that burn spores can also be used as weapons.
we have no choice but to release everything but their guns
fire can turn the forest into ashes in a single day.
while water and wind can sustain a forest for 1,000 years!
let's go, soon, this will also be consumed in the sea of decay
1 ,000 years after the collapse of industrial civilization, the sea of decay, a swamp exuding toxic vapors, covered an earth strewn with rusting ruins, threatening human survival
the giant warriors were all said to have turned to stone
but a single one slept in the earth for 1 ,000 years
we have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest
is this how you tolmekians treat such a nation, however weak!
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region
you live on the brink of extinction beside the sea of decay
in the 1 ,000 years of the sea of decay, countless times have humans sought to burn it away
yet... each time herds of ohms, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth, like a tidal wave
destroying nations, swallowing cities, the ohms' rage would not quiet until they starved to death
in time, the spores took root in the ohms' rotting flesh, and engulfed our vast earth in this sea of decay
the trees of the sea of decay grew to cleanse a world polluted by humans
they absorb toxins from the earth, generate pure crystals, die and turn to sand
we could easily start a fight, but why sacrifice more people?
fire and water are powerless against it, and it's only a matter of time before it starts to walk
my orders to invade pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength
once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies

for those who submit to us, i promise a life free from fear of the toxins and insects of that swamp.
yet... each time herds of ohmus, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth, like a tidal wave.
destroying nations, swallowing cities, the ohmus' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.
we can't possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects for thousands of years.
at least we can find a way to keep it from spreading.
we could easily start a fight, but why sacrifice more people?
fire and water are powerless against it, and it's only a matter of time before it starts to walk.

if i have to die, i want to die in the valley.
no, you mustn't give up, not while the princess has faith.
last night, these villagers toiled desperately to save one of your ships.
we have just now gently laid one of your dead to rest.
her highness kushana, division commander of the tolmekian frontier forces will speak.
we have come to unify the frontier nations and build peace in this region.
yet... each time herds of ohmus, blind with rage, have swarmed the earth, like a tidal wave.
destroying nations, swallowing cities, the ohmus' rage would not quiet until they starved to death.

my orders to invade pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength.
once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies.
if i have to die, i want to die in the valley.
no, you mustn't give up, not while the princess has faith.
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization, rust and ceramic fragments covered the land.
over this wasteland, a deadly forest of fungi spreads, releasing poisonous vapors.
but, this one managed to sleep underground for a thousand years.
now that you mention it it does seem to have human characteristics.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take
we can't keep living in fear of the poisons and the insects.
to see if she can indeed return from the depth of the wastelands alive.
i would have liked to have spoken with that girl once.
she told me it was the beautiful hand of a hard-working person.
even so affected by the poisons, you say you will live with the wasteland?
this nut tastes really weird lt's a chiko nut it' s really good for you
it doesn't taste great, but i could eat a whole boot-full!
the insects protect this forest ln that case, we' re doomed
we can't possibly survive, living in terror of toxins and insects for thousands of years
my orders to invade pejite were motivated by fear that another country had harnessed its strength
once its presence here is known, the great powers will send their armies
burn the sea of decay, kill the insects, and restore the human world why do you hesitate !
steal it from us, just as we stole it from pejite
you've seen the city don't worry. if the sea of decay swallows it, we'll burn it away
but the giant warrior isn't here i know, it's in the valley of the wind
your glider may get you there in time lt' s waiting
asbel told me everything i ll take your place put this on
the ohm s rage is the fury of the earth itself
there' s no reason to live if our lives depend on a monster
1000 years after the collapse of the giant industrial civilization, rust and ceramic fragments covered the land.
over this wasteland, a deadly forest of fungi spreads, releasing poisonous vapors.
if we're talking about health, the princess is famous for it.
but, it wouldn't do if the child imitated the princess's playing in the wastelands as well.
tthat one, wearing a robe of blue, shall descend onto a golden field. "
tto forge once again the lost bond with the land. "
you can't know what will happen if you use that gun in this place.
in the battle a little while ago many ships fell into the forest.
when the water calms down, take off at once and wait up in the air.
if i'm not back in one hour, return to the valley!
the trees of the wastelands were born to clean this world that humans polluted.
they take the earth's poison into themselves purify it into clean crystals, then die and become pure sands.
if so, it seems we'd have no choice but to die out.
we don't know how many thousands of years it will take
the anger of the ohmu is the anger of the earth.
what's the use of surviving if we have to rely on a thing like that?
these men promptly escaped... from a maximum-security stockade... to the los angeles underground.
today, still wanted by the government... they survive as soldiers of fortune.
we've just learned that crime lord tommy largo... has just kidnapped an innocent young girl.
now, the a-team has been brought in to help find this girl... but the clock is ticking.
i had no way of knowing that there was a shell in that barrel.
in the first place-- face, you gotta take murdock or we can't get what we want.
you know, if i were you, tommy... i would go out, and i would hire those guys.
i mean, with the help you got working for you now... people are liable to think you're an easy guy to push around.
'cause if he did, they kicked over the wrong place... looking for you, baby.
please, can't you just let my father and i go on with our lives?
i tried to tell him about the drift factor, but would he listen?
no. i mean, i'm supposed to land dead on target... when i'm tumbling butt over backwards... with a 50 mile-an-hour cross wind.
you know, i'm supposed to be... in front of stephen j's supermarket... at 1 2:00 sharp.
i got 300 hot, screaming kids waiting to see leo the lizard.
if i don't get leo the lizard down there... i'm gonna have a full fledged riot on my hands.
now, i want to see the owner of these premises about my lost lizard!
we're gonna start to look like a couple of chumps pretty soon.
hey, look, i got enough problems... with this grand jury thing coming up, huh?
after the rehearsals, i like to stay a while at the stage to quietly think through the day's work.
it is during the hours between afternoon and evening, when the large theatre is quiet and abandoned.
night after night, i sat there, in the lighting tower, and witnessed the marriage between the daughter and the lawyer.
it was the first time i experienced the magic of the actor.
this parody on a conviction that has turned sour and disintegrated?
why do i have to justify myself for that young person who doesn't even care what i say?
if i am convincing enough on the verbal, the emotional and the intellectual level...
you finally believe in me and you let your self-esteem blossom.
i felt that together with you, i can make the ever so heavy wheel spin again.
if it is so, i don't understand why you are so critical.
you say that you cry, but if you let me guess, i think you cry out of joy!
you know that something happens inside you, a regrouping and a structuration of your potential.
it happens in a practical way that might hurt... but makes you content and happy all the same.
when we talk outside of work, you are a much worse actress than when we're working.
people are thankful if you show the face they are expecting to see.
someone wants you to be happy for a gift and you show happiness.
someone wants you to show love and you receive love in return.
you're supposed to show compassion, be sexy, or funny, or sad...
that is my profession, and besides that my only real joy.
is it so important to be careful with emotions and their expressions?
in the marriage scene with the lawyer you let me wander back and forth like an animal in a cage.
i can probably not do it the way you want it done.
you have trouble standing still in the scene with the farewell.
stand still enjoy standing still, and stand with your whole body.
i asked you if you wanted to play edith's mother out of old friendship's sake.
you cried and thanked me and said that i, had made you insanely happy and that you were very happy that i hadn't forgotten you, et cetera!
it has never occurred to you that your doctor and your husband are trying to help?
i am absolutely positive that they are both absolutely positive that they are trying to help.
mikael called the police and our friend, the doctor, and he came together with a locksmith, policemen and caretakers.
i just wanted mikael to speak the truth, just that one time!
i have driven them furiously from house and home, and forced all the women of cadmos' tribe, with the emblem of the orgy, to head for the mountains.
among cadmos' daughters, they gather in the wilds, among cliffs and the ever so green pine forest.
yes, this town, where the shouts of bacchus have never been heard, shall atone for the insult of my mother and, wantingly or not, make remedy!
do you dread your own tumult so much, that you can't bear the unpredictable?
theatre is dirt, filth and sexual excitement, tumult, rattle and devilry.
i don't believe your pure theory for a moment, it is suspicious.
the make-up doesn't stick, it runs down and gathers in thick lumps.
i try to make my nails clean but they crack and get dirty.
not a day goes by that i don't think of you.
every night, before my soporifics knock me unconcious, i think of you.
i am happy that you exist, that you're sitting next to me in the "hedda gabler"-couch, that i can reach you with my hand.
i am happy that we have five weeks of common work ahead of us, that you are tied to me professionally, and thereby emotionally.
i am in love with you because you are a young, beautiful person.
because you are an exceptionally and uniquely equipped human being... not to mention that you are a good actress.
i wanted the child... despite it wasn't johan's, and despite that i wouldn't play in your production.
i was afraid that i never would have a child again.
i give you identification, care, tenderness, from 10:30 am to 3 pm.
i make the audience love you, put you in a flattering light.
johan sneaks around, and receives attention from compassionate female drama students.
the atmopshere is euphoric, at times interrupted by violent but harmless thunderstorms.
i am stupid, but your explanations have only made it more puzzling!
i suggest that you read the passage to yourself, loud and clear!
now it turns out that i am much more jealous than you are!
i start to rage over your beautiful and charming wife that has just visited you.
for the first time, you see that i am surly, old and quite ridiculous.
you're about to execute me and you raise your knife to sting me down.
i want to be the part that you'd never forget, that would make it impossible for you to return to "a dream play".
i understand that you are planning another production with another actress.
what worried me the most in this moment, was probably that i couldn't/i hear the church bells.
after the rehearsals, i like to stay a while at the stage to quietly think through the day's work.
i got to come with a musician who played the organ behind the stage.
night after night, i sat there, in the lighting tower, and witnessed the marriage between the daughter and the lawyer.
it was the first time i experienced the magic of the actor.
the lawyer had a hairpin between his thumb and his index finger.
why do i have to justify myself for that young person who doesn't even care what i say?
you want me to convince you that you're appropriate for the part.
you assume that i believe in you and you demand constant acknowledgement!
if i am convincing enough on the verbal, the emotional and the intellectual level...
that was the only silly thing i've heard you say during our five weeks of rehearsals!
you say that you cry, but if you let me guess, i think you cry out of joy!

without my private act, how can i protect myself from the world?
that is my conviction, my innermost conviction, but i never follow it.
i am too attached to this deprivated, dusty and dirty instrument.
can't he see how she observes the effects with her left eye and cries with the right one!
can't he tell how she leads the game and forces him into the most peculiar replies?
could you possibly be of the large kindness to try to remind yourself that i called you almost a year ago and told you about this production?
i asked you if you wanted to play edith's mother out of old friendship's sake.
it is a beautiful yard with an old chestnut tree just oustide the window.
in the summer, the light turns green in my room, just like an aquarium.
my husband and my doctor are conversating about rakel and her condition, while rakel lies on the floor in her little white room and masturbates.
it has never occurred to you that your doctor and your husband are trying to help?
i have a white cube at my disposal, where i can channel my screams, my prayers, my vomits and my fear.
i am privileged, as they say, and i am endlessly thankful!
i just wanted mikael to speak the truth, just that one time!
you know that i want the truth, no matter how disturbing it may be!
it was you who said there was a risk for suicide!
even though you know that i've never tried to hurt myself!
we had been your lovers, and you had raised us between your knees, and then you had rejected us, and searched for new victims.
even back then, you drank heavily, and when you were drunk, you were hard on me.

my rehearsal is a operation in an operating room, where self-discipline, cleanliness, light and stillness reigns.
i am happy that we have five weeks of common work ahead of us, that you are tied to me professionally, and thereby emotionally.
i am in love with you because you are a young, beautiful person.
not only is he uncommonly rude, he is also talentless, at least judging by his brecht production up at the studio.
that he by some miracle has succeeded to lie on top of you must be regarded as the triumph of mediocrity!
that the play can be shown for two weeks is even more fun.
it didn't turn out to be a production, it turned out to be a child.
i make the audience love you, put you in a flattering light.
i protect you from yourself, i lead you with my hand and make sure you don't fall.
i suggest that you read the passage to yourself, loud and clear!
it is a simple method when you persist in not wanting to...

on the northwest toll eastbound, traffic is moving nicely this morning from meacham road all the way down to river road.
westbound, there's now a 20-car backup at the devon avenue toll.
and on the northbound i-290 extension at thorndale avenue, we had a spinout there.
and that car was blocking the right-hand lane, and also blocking the lane that's coming off of the eastbound thorndale avenue entrance ramp, leading to the northbound i-290 extension.
i just thought that turning 16 would be so major, that i'd wake up with an improved mental state that would show in my face.
all that shows is that i don't have any sort of a tan left.
and some incredibly gorgeous guy that you meet, like, in france.
and you do it on a cloud without getting pregnant or herpes.
yes, three big ones, and they lust for wimp blood, so quit bugging me, or i'll sic them all over your weenie ass.
you know, i'm getting input here that i'm reading as relatively hostile.
sam, honey, do you think you could help the grandmothers with supper?
dad and i have to go to the club for dinner with the rice chex.
i think you're jealous that i'm getting married and that i'm getting all the attention.
you know, everybody in this family has just gone totally outer limits.
would it be totally off the wall if... if i asked if i could have sex with you?
yeah, well, you asking me is not as off the wall as why i won't.
god, i love it when your parents are out of town,
i fantasize that i'm your wife, and we're, like, the richest, most popular adults in town.
ted, won't we get pounded if we go to a senior party?
wease, we got $70, and we got a pair of girl's underpants.
are you the little bugger that's been calling up here all night and then hanging up?
would it be possible for you to tell me if there is a samantha baker there?
i'll either do it myself, or get someone bigger than me to kick your ass.
i mean, not many girls in contemporary american society today would give their underwear to help a geek like me.
i can get a piece of ass any time i want.
shit, i got caroline in the bedroom right now, passed out cold.
i have to go to this wedding and look like miss pretty princess in this dipshit's bridesmaid's dress.
i don't even have one-tenth of the bod to fill the stupid bust up.
i just thought that turning 16 would be so major... that i'd wake up with an improved mental state that would show on my face.
all it shows is that i don't have any sort of a tan left.
she's only eating carrots to increase the size of her breasts.
mister, you had better shape up, or you will miss your sister's wedding.
since i was about 12, i've been looking forward to my sweet 16.
you know, a big party and a band, with tons of people.
i just hope you burn the sheets and mattresses after he leaves.
i don't suppose it makes any difference to you, but there's a very weird chinese guy up in mike's room.
uh, do you think that there's any reason... that i should possibly stay home tonight?
well, it might be nice if you'd visit... with your grandparents and long duk dong.
i don't think it's healthy to get jacked about some guy that isn't a thing yet.
yeah, when you don't have anything, you don't have anything to lose, right?
i know i came on kinda like a poozer on the bus tonight and everything.
but that's just so my friends won't think, you know, i'm a jerk.
would it be totally off the wall if... if i asked if i could have sex with you?
yeah, well, you askin' me is not as off the wall as why i won't.
god, i love it when your parents are out of town,
i fantasize that i'm your wife, and we're the richest, most popular adults in town.
god did not put me on this earth to be awakened by filthy suggestions... from a foul-mouthed hooligan like you.
and as for our granddaughter, i'm sure she has more than enough sense... to stay clear of the likes of you!
but i feel compelled to mention, jake, if all you want is a piece of ass, i mean,
i'll either do it myself, or get someone bigger than me, to kick your ass.
shit, i got caroline in my bedroom right now, passed out cold.
i could violate her ten different ways if i wanted to.
you have any idea what that'll do to a guy my age?
i know exactly what it'll do to a girl my age.

sam, honey, do you think you could help the grandmothers with supper?
dad and i have to go to the club for dinner with the rice chex.

god did not put me on this earth to be awakened by filthy suggestions... from a foul-mouthed hooligan like you.
and as for our granddaughter, i'm sure she has more than enough sense... to stay clear of the likes of you!
when you do find the right guy, don't let him boss you around.
make sure he knows you wear the pants in the family.
i'll either do it myself, or get someone bigger than me, to kick your ass.
i mean, not many girls in contemporary american society today... would give their underwear to help a geek like me.
i have to go to this wedding and look like miss pretty princess... in this dipshit's bridesmaid's dress.
i don't have one-tenth of the bod to fill the stupid bust up.
there is a 20-car back up at the devon avenue toll.
the northbound i-290 extension at thorndale avenue had a spin out.
~ it would fall through the hole in your pocket ~
~ and you'd lose it in the snow on the ground ~
i thought turning 16 would be so major that i'd wake up with an improved mental state showing on my face.
all it shows is that i don't have any sort of a tan left.
all that really matters is that the kids are happy together.
just as long as my beautiful boy remembers that marrying means he's out of the girl of the month club.
are you the bugger that's been calling here all night and hanging up?
could you tell me if there is a samantha baker there and if so, may i converse with her briefly?
well, i don't think i'll be able to sleep if i don't feel this talk has helped you.
- so would you be a sport and lie to me?
i'll either do it myself or get someone bigger than me to kick your ass.
not many girls in contemporary american society today would give their underwear to help a geek like me.
i know exactly what it will do to a girl my age.
my first time in a car and you pull this shit.
on the northwest toll, eastbound traffic is moving nicely this morning... from beecham road down to river road.
westbound, there's now a 20-car backup at the devon avenue toll.
and on the northbound i-290 extension at thorndale avenue, we had a spinout there.
and that car was blocking the right-hand lane... and also blocking the lane that's coming off of the, uh, eastbound thorndale avenue entrance ramp... leading to the northbound, uh, i-290 extension.
so quit bugging me, or i'll sic them all over your weenie ass.
you know, i'm getting input here that i'm reading as relatively hostile.
i just hope you burn the sheets and mattresses after he leaves.
i don't suppose it makes any difference to you, but there's a very weird chinese guy up in mike's room.
uh, do you think that there's any reason... that i should possibly stay home tonight?
well, it might be nice if you'd visit... with your grandparents and long duk dong.
i don't think it's healthy to get jacked about some guy that isn't a thing yet.
yeah, when you don't have anything, you don't have anything to lose, right?
god, i love it when your parents are out of town,
i fantasize that i'm your wife, and we're the richest, most popular adults in town.
ted, won't we get pounded if we go to a senior party?
wease, we got $70, and we got a pair of girl's underpants.
are you the little bugger that's been calling up... and then hanging up?

since i was about 12, i've been looking forward to my sweet 16.
you know, a big party and a band, with tons of people.
sam, honey, do you think you could help the grandmothers with supper?
dad and i have to go to the club for dinner with the rice chex.
i think you're jealous that i'm getting married... and that i'm getting all the attention, hmm?

only to you in this bitter moment can i reveal my heart.
i have failed completely in my attempt to round cape horn and circumnavigate the globe.
as soon as we have put about it will be safe to light your galley fires again.

would you distribute the gifts to king tynah and his good people.
these are gifts from his majesty king george of england to yourselves.
it is their deep belief that the earth is rendered fruitful by the coupling of their gods.
and that the gods can be roused by the coupling of men and women.
it always makes me laugh, but when men lose their self-restraint they say they're natural.
they are more natural than men who have nothing to restrain.
good god, pigs in a sty have more comprehension or cleanliness than you buggers have.
now you'll get these decks clean or by god i'll make you lick them clean with your tongues if you don't mend your ways.
you will be silent or i will have you killed, you bastard!

mr bligh, when my spirit is gone, there will be nothing but flesh remaining.
i beg you, use that poor flesh to save the others.
this court finds that the seizure of his majesty's armed vessel, bounty, was an act of mutiny by fletcher christian and others of her crew.
and that her captain, lieutenant william bligh, is in the opinion of this court, to be exonerated of all blame on this occasion.
the question at issue is how you came to lose your ship.
to understand that, captain greetham, it is essential to know who were the mutineers aboard that ship.

yes, there is a thief on board this ship, which is unfortunate because you know what hardship that means for honest men.

the mutineers' fate remained a mystery for 18 years until their island was discovered by an american whaling ship.
they found one man, john adams, with nine women and 23 children.
the question at issue is how you came to lose your ship.
to understand that, captain greetham, it is essential to know who were the mutineers aboard that ship.
85 miles, sir. - 85 miles in 31 days, mr bligh.
you endangered your ship and your crew for 31 days in order to satisfy your ambition to circumnavigate the globe.
i have failed completely in my attempt to round cape horn and circumnavigate the globe.
my doubts about mr fryer's commitment to our endeavour have been confirmed.

and that her captain, lieutenant william bligh, is in the opinion of this court, to be exonerated of all blame on this occasion.
court is assembled by the right honorable lords, commissioners of the admiralty and i quote:
to enquire into the cause and circumstances of the seizure of his majesty's armed vessel, the bounty, commanded by lieutenant william bligh and to try the said lieutenant william bligh for his conduct on that occasion.
i have failed completely in my attempt to round cape horn and circumnavigate the globe.
my doubts about mr fryer's commitment to our endeavour have been confirmed.
as soon as we have put about it will be safe to light your galley fires again.
tonight i want as much hot mush as every man can eat.
at half-past twelve today, james valentine departed this life as a result of illness and fatigue sustained at cape horn.
this after all my care of the men is surely a result of our drunken surgeon's neglect.
would you distribute the gifts to king tynah and his good people.
these are gifts from his majesty king george of england to yourselves.
you have done no more than any wild animal would do.
it always makes me laugh, but when men lose their self-restraint they say they're natural.
yes, there is a thief on board this ship, which is unfortunate because you know what hardship that means for honest men.
last night, my personal store of coconuts was well up to the top of the netting.
it'll take us close to the most savage islands in these waters.
the fiji islands where cannibalism is perfected almost to a science.
and from there, my friends, god willing, we shall proceed onward to the great barrier reef itself.
then to the coast of new holland and from there across the timor sea to coupang.
because all i can promise you, lads, is relentless pain and hardship.
now, if you're prepared to make do and make sacrifices and furthermore are willing to swear by it,
mr bligh, when my spirit is gone, there will be nothing but flesh remaining.
i beg you use that poor flesh to save the others.

the question at issue is how you came to lose your ship.
to understand that, captain greetham, it is essential to know who were the mutineers aboard that ship.
85 miles, sir. - 85 miles in 31 days, mr bligh.
you endangered your ship and your crew for 31 days in order to satisfy your ambition to circumnavigate the globe.
i have failed completely in my attempt to round cape horn and circumnavigate the globe.
my doubts about mr fryer's commitment to our endeavour have been confirmed.
i mean to make good use of every hour of sailing time.

perhaps you prefer to postpone our business meeting until another day?
no .. no, luke wouldn't want me to wait another day.
that's by way of a suicide note .. if suicide it is.
forensics will not release it until we've eliminated the possibility of murder.
it appears you have won yourself an ally .. and a dealer.
i can offer you an exclusive contract to handle all of your husband's work.
i'm only interested in selling painting by painting, at the highest price.
mrs lorenz .. your husband's spectacular death will get buyers in the short term.
i think i can see into the future, to things that haven't happened yet.
the death that we all carry in our guts until it devours us all.
dead celebrities are a bit sticky, elliot .. no p.a.s, no tvs.
i've sent the toronto and quebec exhibits for late summer, though.
and that bit about luke arriving on the art scene at just the right moment.
when everyone is obsessed with the dry intellectualism of conceptual art.
well, if you could move it into the heart of london.
i also own a very secluded cottage on the south coast.
fortunately your acrylics dry faster or we wouldn't have anything left to sell.
i promised two more canvases before the end of the week.
well, if you spare some time to answer some questions ..
and give us your prints for elimination, i'll be very grateful.
anything to do with your husband or his paintings is reported to me, mrs lorenz.
sergeant, we should have a word with the two men who caused the disturbance there.
a pc doing a round, got an interesting item from one of the neighbors though.
she saw a bloke run out of the lorenz house last night, drive her car away.
i'll tell you what, i've got an appointment, but you shoot your best shot.
if you can break into this baby, we'll do some business, okay?
if you don't mind, i'd like to take a look around.
can you point me in the direction of these "weekend warriors"?
hey, uh, look, i'm gonna be in town for a couple of days.
i'd sure like another crack at this baby, so, uh... i'll catch you later, huh?
when i first met him i thought he had an attitude problem.
but when i got to know him, l--l realized he's not what people think he is.
no, not here, but this place reminds me of myself about 10 years ago.
the clubs, the rap, the turbo burgers, nothing changes but the sideburns.
intentional or not, i've got a feeling they're a smokescreen for the burglaries.
michael, if you don't mind i'd iike to know what this plan of yours is, since i have a feeling i'm going to be involved.
i just got a reply on that make i ran on you and according to that, you've never even had a traffic ticket.
no one's ever heard of you, fbi, state police, no one.
i wanna know what an invisible man like you is doing with two-bit trash like ron prescott?
if you're gonna arrest me, i'd like to know the charge.
and now some people don't want to treat me the same ..
(kitt) really, michael, you'd think of all the music in the world, they could find a better piece than that monstrosity.
and after that, i am coming after you and i am busting you.
if i have to bust you for having your shoestrings untied, i'm gonna do it.
wait a minute, that song, crumbiin' down, it was on the air when the burglar alarm went off.
the only other time i heard that song was up with the street racers which was when the last burglary took place.
(devon) there's a rumor around that the radio station wanted to hire kltt as their regular newsman.
well, they're gonna have to hire somebody now that anson's in jail.

last week they fought with the conquerors from the south side.
julio was knifed, and their leader was taken to the hospital with a bullet in him.
and what do you think i am, some kind of doctor?
there's no way, man, i'm not moving from here until the heat settles.
just before she fell asleep, she said that sometimes she feels like she's never gonna get better.
sometimes she gets so tired, like she stayed up past her bedtime,
so because this dude jimmy knifed you, everybody thinks you shot him?
hey, when someone buys it in the street, you've got to put the finger somewhere.
it seems there's an electrical storm between here and cedar city.
of course, it is possible that they could walk in here any minute.
if she's all that great, how come dimitri didn't marry her?
for one thing, every man she meets falls immediately in love with her... and dimitri has other interests.
i know it's short notice, but they're giving this luncheon on tuesday... at this famous restaurant, tour d'argent, in my honour.
we'll be staying at the romantic hôtel des artistes... for a whole week.
i know, but it would be a chance for the two of us to be alone together... in the most romantic city in the world.
that's half the reason i stayed up all those nights working.
look, i'm not the problem, and don't make it seem like i am.
all they'll do is to give you a plaque and a pat on the back.
if phyllis had won that contest... it would have taken me and the national guard to keep her home.
i hear it takes the national guard just to keep her satisfied.
what you are feeling right now... is the barrel of a smith and wesson .357 combat magnum.
this weapon can fell an elephant at a 100 yards... let alone a snake like you at point blank.
"'your future and that of your country hang in the balance."'
i will not be outwitted by a two-dimensional character... in a cheap romantic thriller.
my ancestors strangled, massacred, and hanged... several hundred protestants in here during the 16th century... a glorious era that shall never come again.
do you have any idea how much it costs to maintain a place like this?
she swung back and forth until she caught dimitri's hands... and then she untied him.

we shall just have to grit our teeth and bite on the bullet.
and i did suggest negotiations with south africa about reactivating the simonstown naval base.
absolutely sensible strategically, of course, and a great help with the falklands, but if one were in line for secretary-general of the commonwealth...
the relationship, which i might tentatively aver has been not without a degree of reciprocal utility, and even occasional gratification,
is approaching a point of irreversible bifurcation and, to be brief,
so i should end by wishing a happy christmas to you all, but in particular to a minister whom, in the brief time we've had him with us we've watched grow in standing, stature and sureness of touch.
so, seasonal felicitations to you all, but please, please, do remember the home secretary's campaign for the holiday:
it doesn't have to be public, just so long as everybody knows.
then when i'm in number 10, and eric's in northern ireland... we know who'll be the next chancellor, don't we?
humphrey introduced me to an official who pays farmers to produce surplus food and then he introduced me to another official who pays others to destroy all the surpluses.
then they pay thousands of bureaucrats to push masses of paper round to make it all work.
to be a success, you have to be in the limelight.
you have a very high profile as chancellor of the exchequer, and that has to be good for votes.
geoffrey, the pm's asked me to take you into my confidence.
i shouldn't be telling you this, but there are, how shall i say, security question marks over both the current candidates.
that's why the pm thought it all right for him to be chancellor.
but the yugoslavian one and the two south africans, not to mention the shady lady from argentina...
minister, it's not my place, but, er, previously the acceptable answer has been,
"while one does not seek the office, one has pledged oneself to the service of one's country, and if one's friends were to persuade one that was the best way one could serve, one might have to accept the responsibility
the party executive, major contributors, elder statesmen, patrons, the palace, perhaps.
tell each of them they have no alternative but to pull out and support someone who will protect them.
i shall feel obliged to share what i know with senior party members.

the minister was giving me an example the other day, weren't you, minister?
we've swallowed the wine lake and the butter mountain, we've watched our french friends beating up british lorry drivers carrying british lamb to the french.
we have bowed and scraped, doffed our caps, tugged our forelocks and turned the other cheek, but i say enough is enough!
they want to standardise it, by which they mean they'll force us to eat salami and bratwurst and other garlic-ridden greasyfoods that are totally alien to the british way of life.
do you want salami for breakfast with your egg and bacon?
they've turned our pints into litres and our yards into metres.
we gave up the tanner, the three penny bit, the two-bob piece and the half crown, but they cannot and will not destroy the british sausage.
but it's never been government policy to abolish the british sausage.
sausages are not only good to eat, they're full of top-quality nourishment.
but if my colleagues persuaded me the best place to serve it from was 10 downing street,
i might perhaps reluctantly be persuaded to undertake the responsibility whatever my own private wishes might be.
a time to stress what we agree about, not what we disagree about.
we should be looking for the good in our opponents, not always looking for faults.
next thing, i was carried along the passage and dumped in the car.
all the shutters went up and we drove out, and we flew again.
if i knew why the orders was given, i might see some sense in 'em, but to scrobble clergymen who can't afford a ransom worth a flea bite - plain foolishness.
he's roused the press, he's roused scotland yard, he'll soon rouse the nation - all to get hold of some perishing box!
legend has it that arnold went into the past by means of the box, but once in the past, he could not get out of it.
for the mystery and terror of the box is though it allows you to enter the past, you may not take the box with you.
old arnold did do the box trick like the bloke at brixton music hall.
whatever he did, he disappeared, and there are people who believe that ramon lully got the box when arnold entered into the past without it.
i'm up in the canopy of the jungle, the tropical rainforest.
here there is a greater bulk of life, both animal and plant - and a greater diversity too - than can be found anywhere else at all.
the wetness comes from the abundant equatorial rains, the warmth from the tropical sun.
between them, those two factors have created the jungle, which stretches in a broken green band right round the earth.
this particular patch lies in south america, right across the equator, stretching for 600 miles both north and south of it in a vast blanket, almost unbroken except for the rivers.
here there is probably more unexplored territory than anywhere else in the world.
travel east from here along the course of that greatest of rivers, the amazon, and you reach the atlantic.
continue along the line of the equator, across the ocean, and you come to the west coast of africa, another gigantic river, the zaire - that used to be called the congo - and another vast tract of jungle.
eastern africa doesn't get as much rain and the jungle dwindles into savannah, but across the indian ocean the great green rainforest reappears along the western edge of india and sri lanka.
it covers south-east asia, burma, thailand and malaysia, the huge islands of borneo and sulawesi and the smaller archipelagos of indonesia, and farther east still, new guinea.
beyond lies the vastness of the pacific, for the most part empty of land except for scatterings of tiny islands, until, having girdled the earth around the equator, you come back to the greatest expanse of all, the amazon jungle.
the kind of tree i've climbed doesn't grow in groups but as isolated individuals, and it's by far the tallest tree in this particular jungle.
it's a kapok, and it grows to over 200 feet high.
so that if the canopy of leaves formed by the rest of the jungle can be called a sea of leaves, then the crown of the kapok is an island which rises above that sea, and it has a climate all of its own.
it can rob a tree of its moisture by evaporation from the surface of its leaves, so the kapok has very small leaves.
but the wind also brings a benefit - it distributes the kapok seeds, which are extremely fluffy.
and they float gently across the top of the canopy for mile after mile.
the crowns of these giant trees are the home of the biggest and most fearsome of all jungle birds.
there are flying hunters very like this one in most jungles.
in south america the harpy, in africa the crowned eagle, and here in malaysia the hawk eagle.
all patrol above the surface of the canopy, occasionally plunging down into the leaves at great speed to seize a squirrel, a bird or even a monkey.
all produce just one nestling which they must feed with meat for almost a year until it too is big enough to hunt.
these high outposts above the jungle are excellent vantage points from which to scan life in the canopy below.
but few other creatures dare fly above that sea of leaves when there are eagles about.
coming down from the airy sunlit branches of the kapok, you leave the breeze and the dazzling sunshine and enter a different world.
here the warm still air is heavy with moisture, there's hardly a breath of breeze, the leaves above cut out much of the sunshine.
the canopy - millions of leaves stretching in a vast endless mosaic of green,each leaf exactly angled to collect the maximum amount of light.
many have a special joint at the base of their stalk that enables them to twist and follow the sun as it swings overhead.
there seems no limit to the variety of their shapes and their colours.
some prey on others, most derive their sustenance from the trees, collecting the seeds, sipping the nectar, sucking the sap and munching the leaves.
while they hold the leaves in position, other workers use the colony's grubs as tubes of glue, gently squeezing them so that they produce threads of sticky silk which they weave back and forth across the junction.
eventually they produce an enclosed globe within which they can rear their young.
the insubstantial green terraces of the canopy are the pastures of the jungle and a multitude of creatures graze on them.
these in south america are squirrel monkeys, but every jungle has its monkey troops that scamper with total confidence through the branches, fastidiously selecting the right kind of tree, the juiciest bud... or the particular shoot that most takes their fancy.
with so little breeze within the canopy, the trees can't rely on the wind to do the work of pollination.
most depend on insects and other animals, bribing them with lavish feasts of pollen and nectar.
the majority of bats eat insects, but in the tropics many have specialised in collecting fruit and live on nothing else.
there are a great number of different kinds of figs in the jungle, each with its own fruiting rhythm.
since the bats are such accomplished fliers, they can range far over the jungle and can always find figs of some kind, ripe somewhere.
some feast on them in the trees, many prefer to carry them away and feed in the familiar safety of their roosts.
the front teeth in its lower jaw project forward, and with them it scrapes away the bark causing the sap to run.
marmosets live in families, each with its own territory in the branches, and each has at least one of these sap wells which the family keeps open and productive and vigorously defends.
still though the air is, it carries the microscopic spores of ferns and mosses which lodge in the crevices of the tree bark and sprout.
as they flourish and decay, their remains accumulate into a compost on which other plants can grow.
their dangling roots collect moisture from the humid air, and so the broad branches become balconies loaded with orchids and bromeliads.
bromeliads are relations of the pineapple and each one has its own population of animal lodgers.
as they hatched, she allowed a tadpole to wriggle up onto her moist back.
now she must find a pond for it to swim in.
she reverses into the water and allows the surface tension to pull her tadpole off.
several species of arrow poison frogs use bromeliads like this, and most regard their parental responsibilities as being over at this stage.
they are food for the tadpole and will sustain it until it's big enough to catch insects for itself.
for such frogs, like so many creatures up here, the canopy is a complete world, suspended above the surface of the earth, that they never need leave.
when you descend from the canopy, you leave behind the most densely populated part of the jungle and enter a kind of aerial halfway house of spindly saplings, hanging lianas and bare branchless trunks.
here, i am about halfway down, about 70 feet above the floor, midway between the ceiling of leaves in the canopy and the carpet of leaves down below.
up here, there are very few leaves - these huge tree trunks don't sprout many.
there's nothing much but empty space, so very few creatures come here to feed, and apart from birds and some flying insects, the only creatures i'm likely to see are those that use these huge tree trunks and the dangling lianas
as vertical highways between the world above and the world below.
snakes with no legs and claws with which to hold on might not seem to be well suited to climbing, but in fact some can ascend the vertical trunks with astonishing ease.
this squirrel has a cloak of furry skin that stretches from its wrist to its ankle.
when it's about its normal business, the skin looks a bit untidy, as though the animal were rather sloppily dressed, but when the squirrel leaps, then it becomes the very summit of gliding grace.
most other mammals in this midway zone travel from tree to tree along the lianas.
marmosets are capable jumpers and confidently leap a yard or so.
it sometimes avoids too big a jump by throwing its weight back and forth on a sapling, so that it sways and carries it across to the next tree.
few large creatures visit this middle part of the jungle to feed, for there are comparatively few leaves here, but lizards scuttle up and down the trunks, for there, as almost everywhere else, there are insects to be collected.
they are laboriously carrying it all up here because it's up here, within the trunks, that they have built their nest.
other termites hang their nests from branches and these are often commandeered by others.
a bird originally dug this hole, but the bat took it over and now uses the termites' work as a convenient roost from which to hawk for insects.
the pillar-like trunks of the huge trees provide homes for a few birds.
a big bird like a macaw needs a nice open approach to its nest, and the hole is relatively safe, for few non-flying robbers can reach it.
this hole started when a dead branch fell, but the macaws have enlarged it greatly.
they usually have just two chicks, but keeping them properly fed is a considerable labour, for they will stay in the nest hole for over three months.
like all parrots, macaws feed their young by regurgitating chewed-up fruit from their crop.
only a few creatures can make them, but plenty will gladly move into them.
so, after one family has left, other creatures soon turn up to inspect the vacant property.
the golden lion marmoset, like all its family, is incurably inquisitive.
they may already have a hole of their own, but it's always worth inspecting alternative accommodation.
and their curiosity has paid off the hole contains a meal, a few cockroaches.
as it approaches the ground, the huge creeper-swathed trunk of the kapok flares out into buttresses which the tree needs for its stability, for its roots are very shallow.
the fact is that the forest floor is not a very fertile place.
this is partly because it is so dark, much of the light having been cut off by the tiers of leaves up in the canopy, and partly because the torrential rains wash away much of the nutriment that is in the soil.
and the processes which release that sustenance are in fact very swift.
for down here there's very little wind, so it's extremely humid; it's also very warm, and those two factors together suit the processes of decay very well.
within days of a leaf landing, they creep all over it, breaking down its tissues and returning its nutrients back to the soil, where the roots of the trees, close to the surface, quickly reclaim them.
and as the fungi themselves flourish, so they put up their spikes and umbrellas, from which they spread their spores through the jungle.
the most spectacular of all growths on the forest floor is not a fungus but a parasite
to find it, you must first discover its host, a particular species of vine that grows in sumatra.
if the plant is infected, a huge solid bud will periodically emerge from its roots.
when it's swollen to the size of a cabbage, it slowly, over a period of four days, opens.
the forest floor is littered with the debris of trees, huge fallen trunks, branches ripped off by a storm and leaves falling in a steady gentle rain.
it's here that the termites collect their food, removing it particle by particle and carrying it away for treatment in their nest.
their incessant labour, like the work of the fungi, is a crucial link in the life of the forest, for the termites are bringing the nutrients in the wood back into circulation.
few other creatures can eat dead wood and leaves, but lots can eat termites.
the tip of its long antennae tell it where there's prey.
yet another varied population of creatures lives within the leaf litter.
down here it's always moist, so soft-bodied, wet-skinned creatures can survive very well.
a planarian worm smoothes its way by laying down a carpet of slime.
one of the few creatures apart from termites that eat rotting wood.
such inhabitants of the litter are, in turn, food for hunters from beneath the soil.
this phasmid, a large flightless prickly stick insect, has a powerful kick.
it gives warning of its strength by rattling its useless wing covers.
the smaller, less savage litter feeders are collected by little mammals that trot through the leaves, deftly snapping up a termite here, a beetle there.
in the madagascar rainforest, a tenrec, a more distant cousin of the european hedgehog than its coat of prickles would suggest.
in african forests, the elephant shrew, highly strung, skittish, prone to career off at suicidal speed if it's startled.
its long sensitive trunk enables it to investigate the depths of the leaf litter with the minimum of noise and disturbance.
but there is one inhabitant of the forest floor who makes more varied use of more parts of the jungle than any other.
human beings have lived here for tens of thousands of years, perfecting the techniques and accumulating the knowledge that enables them to meet all their needs from the jungle.
the waorani in ecuador, or auca as they used to be called, are among the few people left who have not abandoned any of their ancient skills.
their favourite fruit is chonta, a kind of palm, but its trunk is armoured with the most ferocious spines and impossible to climb.
the waorani know how to deal with that - lash a small stick to the end of a pole with a strip of bark, put a ring of lianas around your ankles and then climb a smooth-barked cecropia tree growing alongside the unscalable chonta.
the cecropia doesn't grow next door to the chonta by accident.
the waorani plant one beside every chonta tree they find, clearing a space for it so that it can get sufficient sunshine to grow.
within only a few years, it's stout enough to be climbed.
the waorani know their individual chonta trees as well as if not better than a fruit farmer knows those in his orchard, and they visit them regularly.
they grow all over the jungle, and often the people have to make long journeys to collect their fruit and walk for hours carrying the heavy stems back to their huts.
the waorani now have a few metal cooking pots but they still make some from clay, coiled and then baked in an open fire.
hammocks are woven from palm fibre, cups and basins made from gourds, and the hut itself from branches thatched with leaves.
the parrot chicks also take their chonta pre-chewed from their foster parents' mouths, just as they would from the beaks of their real parents.
the people traditionally are entirely naked, except for a string around their waist.
the seeds of the achiote plant, when squashed, produce a vivid red paint.
black comes from charcoal mixed with the juice of the genipa plant.
face and body painting lasts a long time, for like many forest people, the waorani sweat very little.
in the humid air, sweat doesn't so readily evaporate and cool the body as it does for people elsewhere, and the waoranis' skin doesn't produce it in great quantity.
a vine is the source of that famous poison, curare, with which the waorani tip their blowpipe darts.
scrapings from it are wrapped in leaves and water poured through the mash to dissolve out the poison.
carefully, each dart is tipped with it and then put in front of the fire to dry.
fibres from the seeds of the kapok tree, deftly twirled round the back end of the dart,will give it an airtight fit in the barrel of the blowpipe.
such thumps are audible for miles, and in the forest, where you can't see for more than a few yards around you, sound is much the best form of communication.
the jungle animals certainly exploit it to proclaim their territorial rights and to summon their mates
in each jungle, there's one mammal up in the canopy which has become the champion singer:
in madagascar the indiri lemur, in south america the howler monkey and in south-east asia the gibbon.
sound is not so effective beside the thundering waterfall, so one frog that lives in such a place in borneo uses sign language.
tree lizards, up in the branches where they can easily see all over their small territory use a flag on their throat.
the cock has summoned a hen with his calls and now he leads her to his display ground.
the immense fans, lined with eyespots, are the greatly elongated feathers of his wing coverts
as many as forty male birds assemble in one patch of the forest, but each has his own cleared arena on the ground beneath him.
the performers squabble among themselves while they wait for their audience.
the female may or may not be impressed by the relative merits of the costumes or the dance steps, but in some way she makes a selection.
a tap on the back of the winner and he claims his prize.
it's as though this great age has enabled the forces of nature to produce specialised creatures to live in every tiny niche in this ancient and stable environment.
just consider, for example, how many creatures have developed not just a generalised camouflage but a close and precise impersonation.
a big storm is preceded by a violent gale which for a few minutes lashes the tall trees and rocks the canopy.
the huge heavy drops begin to fall, first slowly and then in drenching torrents.
in places, the floor of the forest becomes a flood, sweeping in sheets through the trees down to the rivers.
when the storm has passed, then the blessings of the water it has brought can be enjoyed.
the jaguar is an excellent swimmer and seems positively to enjoy doing so, for it's seldom found far from water.
it actually hunts as it wades, catching crocodiles and frogs and even fish.
one of the small creatures which certainly doesn't enjoy a soaking manages to pass the storm in perfect dryness and is still snug in its remarkable shelter.
the leaf of this heliconia is hanging in an unnaturally protective way.
maybe it had lost one of its huge branches from decay and was already badly out of balance before the storm.
the great weight of water hanging on its foliage was finally more than it could carry.
the death of this old tree was the starting gun for a feverish race.
the competitors are the spindly seedlings mostly buried under this wreckage of branches.
to begin with, shrubs appear which specialise in open sites like these.
they flower quickly and disperse their seeds to other temporary clearings, but in a year or so the sapling trees have over-topped them.
here, animals and plants, insects and birds, mammals and man live together in intimate and complex communities, each dependent on one another.
two thirds of the surface of this unique planet are covered by water, and it was here indeed that life began.
from the oceans, it has spread even to the summits of the highest mountains, as animals and plants have responded to the changing face of the earth.
this river, the kali gandaki, has cut its way, in the most remarkable fashion, right through the highest range of mountains in the world, the himalaya.
any higher and the weather will be too cold for it.
beneath the rhododendrons live several species of those most splendid of asia's birds, the pheasants.
until, that is, you see a cock impeyan pheasant, with the coronet of a peacock and the burnished, metallic iridescence of a tropical butterfly.
the impeyan's hen, like those of all pheasants, is comparatively dull.
this deepest of all valleys in the world enables you to walk within a few days from the tropics, in its lower reaches, to the equivalent of the poles on the slopes high above, and to see as you make the journey
how closely animals and plants are matched to the changing circumstances.
as you walk higher, the rhododendron forest gets thinner and hung with moss.
the air is moist and it can be quite warm during the day.
the little himalayan panda is certainly very well protected against the cold.
not only does it have warm, dense fur, but, like many animals that spend time in the snow, it has hair on the soles of its feet.
that keeps its feet warm on the snow and stops it from sliding around on ice.
now, in the summer, it also helps in getting a grip on wet, slippery branches.
it's primarily a vegetarian, collecting buds and leaves and fruit, but it also takes eggs from a bird's nest, if it can find one.
on the ground, and scarcely bigger than the panda, one of the shyest animals of the himalayan forests, a musk deer.
in these tangled trees, antlers would be a considerable handicap, and the musk deer doesn't develop them.
a male fights instead with the short sharp tusks in his upper jaw.
they feed on moss, lichen and leaves, and are so agile and well-adapted to a mountain life that they can climb steep cliffs in search of food.
when a musk deer or any other animal of any size dies, the vultures come.
these are griffons,very similar to those that circle the skies above indian villages down in the hot foothills.
they are common in this forest up to 7,000 or 8,000 feet.
so the lives of all these creatures are connected, one with the other, either directly or indirectly, and all are ultimately dependent upon the vegetation.
but of course both animals and plants are also greatly affected by the physical environment.
i've climbed several thousand feet now and things are beginning to change.
it's getting colder, and the rhododendrons are giving way to fir trees, and that will mean a change in the animals that live here.
even when winter comes,and the forests are deep in snow, it will remain active.
but it's a great traveller, and if the weather becomes very cold indeed, it will descend to lower altitudes for a spell.
in spite of its size, it seldom tackles any animal bigger than a mouse, and it lives for most of the time on just ants, grubs, nuts and leaves, so it seldom goes any higher than the forest can grow.
and now, getting on for 10,000 feet up, the forest is beginning to thin.
high though we are, the kali gandaki is still a very broad river.
remarkably, and indeed mysteriously, it doesn't rise from the flanks of these giant mountains but cuts right through them.
the people of the foothill have long since recognised the value of this extraordinary corridor that leads right through the himalayas, and all summer trains of mules trudge up the valley, taking barley and buckwheat to trade with tibetans for wool and salt.
all the way up the valley are villages where the muleteers can stay and rest, but during the summer few do so.
it is neither a true sheep or a true goat, but related equally to them both.
it will eat almost anything that's green, and is grateful to find it in this bleak land.
their cousins, yellow-billed choughs, go as high as any bird in the world, riding the rising wind currents to the height of the snow peaks themselves.
flowers at this altitude can only come from small cushion plants, huddled together against the cold.
their blood contains a particularly high number of red corpuscles and so can carry more oxygen in it than a lowlander's can.
certainly, when it comes to walking at these high altitudes, they're very much better adapted than i am.
so, all the living creatures in these high valleys are adapted to their environment, both their biological environment and their physical environment.
and yet, in terms of biological history, those adaptations are very recent indeed.
these immense mountains, the eternal hills, are in fact far from eternal.
they are younger than the plains of india to the south or the plateau of tibet to the north.
this is obviously a shell that's been turned to stone, a fossil.
although there are no molluscs alive today exactly like this one, there are some which are sufficiently similar for us to be sure that it lived in water.
and if we analyse the rock in which it's embedded, it's clear that that was mud laid down at the bottom of a sea.
but i am as far as possible as it is to be from the sea.
not only i am in the middle of asia, hundreds of miles from the sea, but i am over two vertical miles above it's level.
what forces could possibly have raised the seabed to these heights?
this fantastic fountain of fire rising 200 feet or so into the air behind me is molten rock.
fine ash is falling all around, there are gusts of choking, poisonous gas, and it's so hot that this is just about as close as i can get to it.
the sheer weight of these molten ingots of rock prevents them being swept away from the vent by the gale, so there's little danger of them suddenly coming our way.
less dramatic than the fire fountain but perhaps more sinister is this tide of black slag that is slowly creeping over the surface of the land.
sometimes so much lava is produced that it accumulates in flows 100 feet or so thick.
then the centre layers of it cool exceptionally slowly and very evenly, and this is the result.
here, at the giant's causeway, the top of the lava flow has been eroded away, for the eruptions took place 50 million years ago.
the cooling contractions have produced the effect you see in drying mud, though here the cracks extend to a much greater depth to produce six-sided columns about a foot and a half across.
in the hebrides, there's another lava flow that erupted at about the same time and formed fingal's cave.
the blanketing layer of lava that slowed down the cooling of the interior is still uneroded, and beneath it the near-perfect basalt columns rise almost 20 feet high.
basalt that doesn't contain very much gas wells out from below almost quietly.
but if the lava has been extruded under great pressure, it may be full of gas, and then it behaves very differently.
sometimes a flow sweeps down over a forest, incinerating the trees in its path.
most dramatic of all, the lava sometimes wells up inside a crater and can't escape.
the bubbles of gas that burst from its surface may be 50 feet across.
sometimes, having got rid of much of its gas, like beer losing its fizz, it sinks back down the vast pipe up which it rose and returns to the lava chamber a mile or so below.
these icelandic volcanoes erupt from huge cracks or fissures which regularly open up in a line which runs right across the width of the island.
but that line itself is only the northern end of a huge line of weakness that runs for thousands of miles southwards from iceland right round the side of the globe.
iceland lies between norway and greenland, south of the arctic circle.
the crack, ridged over by lava, is for the most part underwater, which is why its existence wasn't known until the beginning of this century.
in places, it rises above the sea to form volcanic islands:
the azores, the cape verdes, ascension, st helena, tristan da cunha.
but the basalt forms not only the ridge itself but the sea floor on either side.
by dating it chemically, we know that the farther it is from the centre of the ridge, the older it is.
this means that basalt is welling up in a molten state at the ridge and then, as it solidifies, is moving away on either side.
we still don't fully understand the forces that power the process, but it seems that 50 to 60 miles below the earth's surface it's so hot that the rocks are molten and currents in them are welling up beneath the ridge, causing eruptions,
and then flowing away on either side, pulling the great plates of the ocean floor with them.
it was this movement that dragged apart africa and south america and created the atlantic ocean.
but where it meets the continent, it dives downwards, perhaps pulled by the descending current in the crust below, producing a deep trench in the ocean floor.
as it goes down, it takes with it some of the sediments that have accumulated at the bottom of the ocean and also some water.
these new ingredients melt and interact with the rocks of the interior to produce a mixture that is crucially different from the lava that erupted at the ocean's ridge.
for one thing, it contains much more dissolved gas and steam.
as it rises up in the cracks on the edge of the continent, it cools and solidifies, choking the vents.
the effect is like screwing down the safety valve of a boiler.
on the northern side of the volcano, there were not even trees to be seen.
a huge avalanche of rock, blown out by the blast, had slid for 15 miles down the side of the mountain, burying everything.
almost a century earlier, on the opposite side of the pacific, another catastrophic eruption had taken place on the tiny island of krakatau, in the straits between java to the east and sumatra to the west.
in 1883 it was an island five miles long and three miles wide, with three volcanic peaks on it, the highest rising to almost 3,000 feet.
the column of smoke rose up until it was five miles or so up into the sky.
ships that were sailing nearby had their decks covered in ash and pumice, and at night electric flames played over the rigging.
because on the morning of august 27th, monday, at 10 o'clock, the roof of that lava chamber collapsed.
millions of tons of sea water poured onto the red-hot lava.
3,000 miles away on the small island of rodriguez in the south atlantic, the commander of the garrison heard it and thought it was distant gunfire at sea.
the explosion also produced a tempest of wind, which swept out entirely round the globe seven and a half times before it finally died away.
but most catastrophic of all, the explosion produced a tidal wave.
it swept towards the coasts and as it approached became a wall of water over a 100 feet high.
the two nearby islets were buried beneath massive deposits of ash.
and where the tallest peak had stood, the sea was 900 feet deep.
all volcanic eruptions spew out sulphur in one form or another, including those underwater.
here it doesn't form yellow crystals, but reacts with the sea water to produce clouds of black sulphides.
until this bizarre colony was discovered, we had believed that all creatures on earth derived their energy through plants from the sun.
even the deep sea creatures fed on fragments falling from the sunlit surface.
eventually, there is some shift deep in the earth's crust and the focus of the intense heat moves away slightly and the eruptions come to an end.
but if water should percolate down from the surface through the rocks and aproach the magma chamber, it's still so hot that the water is superheated and forced up again, like water in the spout of a boiling kettle.
on the way, it may dissolve minerals from the rocks through which it passes, and then, as it emerges as hot springs, the minerals will be deposited in terraces, like these in rotorua, in new zealand.
in some parts, the superheated steam on its way to the surface has dissolved the softer rocks thru which it passes and brings them up as boiling mud.
elsewhere, the boiling water shoots spasmodically into huge fountains, and the whole area is wreathed in steam.
such a place is typical of land where volcanic fires are on the wane.
famous hot springs of yellowstone in the rocky mountains of north america are also heated by a vast chamber of molten rock some distance down beneath the surface.
the water welling up from these crystal-clear, chemically rich pools is so hot that no creature can live in them.
when they trickle over the brim, they begin to cool, and there rich colonies of bacteria and mats of algae begin to grow.
in places, they flourish so thickly that they break the surface and divert the flow of water so that in parts they're cool enough to allow brine flies to settle.
they lay their eggs directly in the warm mat of the algae.
each has a long white thread to its case, like a seed.
the hot volcanic springs of the rift valley in africa also support their own crops of bacteria and the small algae that feed on them.
but here the creatures that come to harvest them are much bigger.
flamingoes, sometimes as many as a million of them on this one lake.
these lesser flamingoes feed entirely on single-celled algae that proliferate in vast quantities in these steaming soda-rich waters.
flocks like these remove 150 tons of these microscopic plants from this lake every day.
their bills have sieves inside them which strain off the algae as the water passes through them.
it's easy to see how creatures can benefit from the chemical riches of volcanoes dissolved in the waters of hot springs.
it's more difficult to imagine how any living thing could derive nourishment from a basalt lava flow.
its surface in many places is as smooth and as hard as glass, and neither frost nor roots of plants can initially make any impression on it.
centuries may pass after an eruption before there's any sign of the surface of such a flow beginning even to weather.
this flow for example on the flanks of mount kilauea in hawaii is some 3,000 years old, and yet still it shows the rippled, ropy surface that formed when it was liquid.
but in the end the surface does erode and plants do get root in the cracks.
they in turn can support all kinds of other life, and so the lava flow is eventually colonised, but not only on its surface but in its depths.
for these basaltic lava flows are often not as solid as they seem.
when the lava first flows out of the vent like a river, that on the outside of the flow will cool quicker and solidify, forming walls on either side of the flow.
the top too cools quicker, and that causes a crust to form over the flow, so that eventually the lava is flowing down a long tunnel.
when that happens, the walls and ceiling of the tunnel act as insulation, keeping the heat in, so that the lava flow remains liquid and so continues for mile after mile.
when eventually the supply of lava stops, that tunnel may drain, leaving a long cavern like this one.
out of the reach of rain and frost and even dust, the surface of the lava looks exactly as it must have done, when the last trickle was draining away, and the floor was so hot that anything touching it would be turned to a cinder.
molten lava had dripped from the ceiling, it had swilled round the sides and spurted out in little dribbles from cracks in the newly congealed walls.
they've found their way down through the cracks, and here they dangle, catching water as it percolates through the lava and trickles down them.
among the rootlets, there are animals that live nowhere else in the world.
many of them have also lost their wings and their eyes.
in the blackness, they find their way about by touch, and, like many cave insects elsewhere, have developed long legs and antennae.
i'm some three miles from the crater, and still the scene is one of devastation and sterility.
it's not just that this unweathered ash is not very fertile, but it's also that it so loose that it's difficult for plants to get root.
its flanks too are covered for the most part with ash, and they're still buried regularly with new layers from fresh eruptions, yet the process of colonisation is already under way.
not only are there giant grasses, like this wild sugar cane, but trees:
ten years later there were twice that number, and over 100 species of birds and insects as well.
some seeds must have floated here from java, some 20 miles away, and they still continue to do so.
other smaller ones were probably carried here by birds, either on their feet or in their stomachs.
but the ash is still here beneath the lattice of roots of the jungle trees.
somehow or other, rats and lizards and pythons have all reached here.
there are now many hundreds of different species of plants, and the winds have assisted the passage of a great number of flying insects, whose descendants now form large and permanent populations, pollinating the flowers, feeding on their fruits,
but as far as smaller creatures are concerned, the number of species is increasing all the time.
and on the flanks of volcanoes all round the world, men clear fields and plant crops, even though they know they may be sitting on a time bomb.
only 20 years ago it erupted, killing 2,000 people and leaving 150,000 homeless.
but still the balinese will not leave fields that are so fertile they can produce two or three rich harvests of rice every year.
this junction already existed 65 million years ago, when india was an isolated island in the middle of that ocean.
since then, as the ocean floor has continued to spread, the continents have shifted and india has moved towards asia.
as the two continents approached, the sediments between them crumpled and eventually piled up over the junction, so instead of the line between them being marked by a chain of volcanoes, it's buried deep beneath an immense range of mountains, the himalaya.
so these great peaks of sandstone and limestone rising five miles into the sky are not only the highest mountains in the world, but among the youngest.
and that is how this ammonite, this sea-living creature, came to rest over two miles high in the himalaya.
and that too is the explanation of how the kali gandaki river managed to cut its way clean through the highest range of mountains in the world.
it was flowing south from the ancient plateau of tibet even before the great mass of india collided with asia.
as the sediments between the two land masses buckled and rose over millions of years, the river maintained its course, cutting down through the rocks as swiftly as they rose.
and so now it still flows south to the plains of india, and does so through the deepest gorge in the world.
mountain ranges have been created in this way several times, during the history of the earth
so we have begun our portrait of the planet up on the roof of the world, and we will go from high altitudes to low, from the poles to the equator.
and in the next programme we'll go even higher, to the most inhospitable environment of all, the world of snow and ice.
water molecules, distilled from the sea by the heat of the sun, condense in the sky.
as they fall gently through the air, they pack together into shapes that echo their six-fold symmetry and form infinitely varied crystals of ice.
they settle on the high mountains and compact into snow and ice that is, chemically, almost pure water, much purer than the sea from which it mostly came.
on mount rainier in the united states, permanent snow begins at 7,000 feet.
you might think that this was one of the most inhospitable places on earth for life.
after all, no vegetation grows on these snowfields, so there can be no animals that feed on it, like marmots or mice or rabbits, and if there are no herbivores, there can't be any predators like hawks
and these, together with the minerals dissolved in the melt water, are all the algae need to grow and reproduce.
the heavy fall of winter snow will bury them feet deep, but in spring, when the surface melts, they divide, develop tiny beating hairs and swim up to the surface in the sunshine.
as they age and the minerals are used up, they change colour, forming huge smears of red in snowfields all over the world.
eventually, the snow algae produce spores as fine as dust and in that form they are blown from one snowfield to another.
but in late summer they fly up from the valleys up to these high peaks and here assemble in the rocks.
when the winter snows come, the ladybirds remain underneath the snow in the rocks, and then in the spring, as now, the snow melts and the sun warms the ladybirds, and they become active and fly off back to the valley to feed on aphids.
the ladybirds are only temporary residents of the mount rainier snowfields.
other insects manage, almost unbelievably, to live all their lives in this seemingly inhospitable snow.
some, like this primitive relation of the cockroach, a grylloblattid, have a body chemistry so well adjusted to function at low temperatures that if you pick them up, your hand's warmth will kill them.
permanent snow lies directly on bare rock, but lower down, where it comes and goes, there can be a little vegetation to be grazed.
they all carry big horns, and the senior males, in autumn, indulge in the most alarming courtship battles.
it's net easy for plants to grow on steep, high slopes
the warming by day and freezing by night makes the gravelly soil slip downwards, so it's difficult for plants to keep a hold.
with few plants, grazing animals are rare, though there may be more than there appear to be at first sight.
these, in the himalayas, are blue sheep, so nimble and sure-footed they simply able to reach almost any vegetation on the steep slopes.
but if these are rare, rarer still is the animal that preys on them, the snow leopard.
during the summer it stays high, at between 12,000 and 15,000 feet, hunting small rodents and birds as well as mountain sheep.
snow leopards have been seen as high as 18,000 feet in summer.
but when winter comes there are very heavy snowfalls, it retreats to the valleys.
game is now so scarce that there's barely enough to support more than one leopard, so this animal hunts alone.
mount kenya, also volcanic, is 2,000 feet lower but still has its own glaciers
each has its own animals and plants specially adapted to life at low temperatures.
at these altitudes, plants like these have to face two totally conflicting problems every 24 hours.
every night the temperature falls so low that they're in danger of freezing solid.
but than as the day wears on and it gets warmer, this water is in danger of evaporating and the plant of losing its night-time insulation.
but it isn't just rainwater that's accumulated in this rosette of the plant.
but there's another kind of lobelia which deals with these two problems in a quite different way.
this one grows very tall and has extremely long leaves, each fringed with tiny hairs which acting much the same way as the fur of an animal, trapping air between them, so that they insulate the stem from chills.
they also prevent the wind from robbing the plants of moisture.
each group of lobelias is owned by a pair of sunbirds which collect the insects the plants attract.
an occasional leopard may come up and hunt them, but apart from that, nothing.
and so they can come out during the few brief hours of sunshine and bask on the rocks without any fear, just as they're doing now.
but at these altitudes, there's only grass and lobelias, and they share it with the little furry-eared rat.
mount kenya, like its neighbours kilimanjaro and ruwenzori, is an isolated patch of snow and ice surrounded by the baking hot
men have recognised that vicuna wool has an unexcelled softness and warmth and hunted the animal for it until it's close to extinction.
the people of the andes have domesticated another wild camel, the guanaco, to produce heavy-fleeced versions which not only produce excellent wool bus serve as beasts of burden.
here, in ecuador and peru, close to the equator, wild camels live at around 14,000 feet.
but as you travel south down the andes, the snowline gets lower.
half-way down, 2,000 miles south of cotopaxi, the line of permanent snow has dropped from 16,000 feet to 13,000 feet.
a thousand miles farther south still, the mountains are not really so high but are almost completely covered with snow, which comes down to within a few hundred feet of the sea.
so, on the southernmost tip of south america, in patagonia and
tierra del fuego, the guanaco doesn't live at great altitudes, but almost at sea level.
yet it needs its warm coat just as much, for here, even in summer, it's very cold, and during the winter the whole land is snowbound.
the reason that it gets colder as we get close to the pole is not complicated.
rays from the sun strike the earth at the equator at right angles.
but as you travel round the curve of the earth, the rays become more and more glancing.
so a given amount of heat falling on the equator is distributed over a very much greater area in the polar regions and has to travel through more of the earth's atmosphere, which weakens it still further.
so down in patagonia, the sun's rays are very much less intense and carry much less heat, and the glaciers flow right down to the sea.
farther south still, across the near-frozen seas off cape horn, you reach chains of small volcanic islands that run down towards the antarctic continent itself:
remote, little-known archipelagos such as the south sandwich and, here, the south orkneys.
there are only two flowering plants that can manage to survive in this bleak, icy country.
one is a kind of thrift and the other is a small, stunted grass.
the capacity of these simple plants to endure cold is phenomenal.
some species can even survive being frozen solid for weeks on end.
within this miniature tangled jungle lives a whole menagerie of tiny animals.
primitive creatures little bigger than pinheads manage to survive by slowly chewing away at the lichens and mosses during summer.
in winter they almost grind to a halt, yet they survive unfrozen because their blood contains a kind of antifreeze and remains liquid even when the temperature falls well below zero.
the majority are vegetarians, but there are also carnivorous mites among them which clamber around the grazing herds, picking off individuals as they fancy.
in this extreme cold, the processes of life are greatly slowed down, not only those of growth, but those that lead to old age and death.
so such tiny creatures, as these, which elsewhere might live for merely months, survive for two or three years within the green mossy carpets.
but not all of antarctica is covered by snow and ice.
in parts of the interior there are valleys where almost no snow ever falls.
this is as desolate a part of the earth as exists.
the cold is extreme, it's drier even than the centre of the sahara, it's dark for half the year and it's scoured by a never-ending howling wind.
and the wind is responsible for these carvings in the solid granite.
crystals of salt form beneath tiny flakes on the surface, and grow slowly, but so powerfully that particles are broken loose.
the wind then sweeps them up and hurls them at the rock face, eroding it still further.
desolate though this waste of shattered rocks may seem, there is life even here.
algae have penetrated the microscopic spaces between the rock's constituent particles and there managed to grow.
glaciers flow down these dry valleys, fed by the ice cap that covers the centre of the continent.
they're among the world's fastest moving, advancing as much as 300 feet in a year.
as they surge downwards, their surface is torn into thousands of crevasses.
during the summer, even though the winds are bitterly cold, the sun is sufficiently strong to melt a little of the glacier's surface.
where it accumulates in pools, blue-green algae grows vigorously, its dark colour enabling it to absorb a high proportion of the sun's feeble heat.
these pools and streams are the only places in all of antarctica's interior where life flourishes in any abundance.
the earth, right at the beginning of the history of life before any higher plants or any animals had appeared, must have looked something like this.
it must have lost its way, perhaps because of sickness, and misguidedly crawled up here from the coast, 25 miles away.
although the land of the antarctic is almost sterile its waters are extremely fertile, so its margins, particularly the beaches of its off-shore islands, are rich in life.
every year they come ashore to the beaches to pup and mate.
they're not true seals but eared seals, for they have small external ears.
they also have hind flippers that can be brought forward, which enables them to move quite fast on land, something that true seals can't do.
these fur seals retained the fur their land-living ancestors, and indeed they thickened it.
there's an outer guard hair and then there is a very thick layer close to the skin, and that traps air in it, so it act as an insulator and keeps the animals warm when they go swimming.
but the trouble with fur as an insulator is that if you dive too deep, the pressure of the water will queeze out the air, and then it's no use.
so fur seals, for the most part, fish in the surface waters.
true seals, like these pups of the elephant seal , have a different kind of insulation.
their fur on their body is sparse, but beneath the skin they have a thick layer of oily fat, blubber, which surrounds their entire body.
elephant seals dive to great depths to hunt squid, finding their way in the dark with sonar helping their huge eyes, but they don't get chilled, for pressure has no effect on the insulating qualities of blubber.
with every year, the blubber which kept them so warm in the freezing seas loses its power.
because every year the sea elephants have to moult, and in order to grow new skin they have to bring a blood supply close to the surface.
so blood vessels open up through the blubber and the skin is flushed with blood just below the surface.
if they stayed in the sea in that condition, they'd chill very quickly.
the huge adult males develop a bladder on top of their noses, like a kind of trunk.
but they also justify their name of sea elephant by their immense size.
the bulls may grow to 20 feet long and weigh three tons.
if you wanted to pick a creature to symbolise the frozen antarctic wastes, you might well choose a creature like this.
these are macaroni penguins on the island of south georgia, halfway between the tip of south america and the antarctic.
but it seems the original penguins evolved in relatively warm climates.
even today, there are species of penguins that live on the equator, in the galapagos islands.
so this dense coat of insolating feathers with a layer of fat beneath it was probably originally developed simply to keep them warm in the seas anywhere, but it serves them just as well in the freezing antarctic winds,
the bigger a body, the smaller the surface area of its skin in proportion to its volume.
so a big penguin retains it's heat better than a small one.
they have a cousin, living farther south, which grows even bigger.
it, too, has fearsome problems in raising its chics and it solves them in the most dramatic way imaginable.
they lay their eggs not in spring, but at the end of summer.
their breeding grounds are on the permanent sea ice near the coast.
the females return to the sea to feed, leaving the males with the eggs.
they shuffle back and forth, each with an egg on his feet, held carefully above the ice.
as the gales intensify, the males huddle together to give one another shelter.
then, 65 days after it was laid, the chick begins to hatch.
but soon after, the female reappears with a full stomach and takes the chick onto her feet and gives it its first proper feed.
from now on the parents will take turns to trek back and forth to the sea, bringing food for their youngsters.
those that have lost one will try and adopt any that wanders by others will even incubate pieces of ice.
repeatedly, the parent in charge manages to find something from the pit of its stomach to feed the ever-hungry chick.
until the chicks lose their down and get their adult plumage, they can't swim and so can't feed for themselves.
but being so big, they, like the king penguins, take a long time to grow to full size, and week after week their parents must make the long march to the sea to collect food for them.
though the winter is almost over, there is still bad weather.
blizzards rage over the ice, and the young when becoming independent huddle together in groups of their own amongst the parent birds.
as the sun rises higher each day, the adults suffer in a different fashion.
on sunny days they get too hot in their insulating blanket of feathers, and eat snow in order to cool themselves.
the chicks still have their downy feathers and still can't swim.
but ten months after the eggs were first laid the chicks fledge, and over the next few weeks, the whole comunity makes it way down to the sea, which now, with the spring break-up of the ice, is close at hand.
auks and penguins, similar though they are, are not closely related.
they've come to resemble one another by adopting a similar lifestyle at opposite ends of the earth.
unlike antarctica, that isolated continent surrounded by sea, the arctic is connected by land to more temperateparts of the world.
so the land animals of europe and north america have been able to reach it, colonise it and become adapted to its particular demands.
on land, it feeds on small rodents, and on ice floes, it may hope to catch a few birds.
it's just as well the little auks have kept their powers of flight.
its whiteness is an obvious adaptation to the snow and ice, but so is its huge size.
the principle of a big body retaining heat better than a small one, applies to bears just as it does to penguins, and polar bears are very much bigger than their cousins in temperate lands farther south.
polar bears, if forced to, will eat all kinds of things but their preferred food is flesh, particularly that of seals.
they especially like the blubber just below the skin of the seal, and often leave the meat for the scavenging gulls and foxes.
among the glaucous gulls is the much rarer and pure-white ivory gull.
the polar bear's white coat and great size are not its only adaptations to life in arctic.
it gets a good grip on the ice with long, sharp claws and thick hair on the soles, which also makes them excellent paddles in the water, for the polar bear spends a lot of time swimming during the summer.
ringed seals are much hunted by polar bears, and when on the ice, must be constantly on the alert.
they have to have regular holes in the ice through which they can leave the water, or at least stick up their heads in order to breathe.
a polar bear will wait for many hours, motionless, beside such a hole.
they also stalk seals that are rash enough to lie out on the ice.
the polar bear has lost, but about once in every five hunting days, it does kill, and that is enough.
the most powerful effective hunter of all, however, on the northern ice, is man.
eskimo, or inuit, as they prefer to call themselves, came up to the arctic in very early times.
superb hunters, they were able to live for many months in the winter on nothing whatever but raw meat.
they were so skilled in the technics at living out on the ice that with nothing more than a knife of bone they could make a waterproof house from snow in an hour or so.
if they can circulate the waters of the polar seas down towards the equator, they would keep them relatively warm.
and maybe they did so 100 million years ago, when the continents were distributed like this.
but since then, the continents have shifted, the polar seas become more enclosed and any such currents interrupted.
at the other end of the world, during the same period, the antarctic continent drifted south until it came to rest over the south pole.
there is no way now that ocean currents there could keep that part of the world warm either, and so an ice cap formed.
once that happened, the whiteness reflected back 90% of the heat in the already feeble rays of the sun.
so ice now covers the whole of antarctica and the seas of the north pole.
over the past million years there have been other variations, probably connected to the varying strength the sun and the ice cover has waxed and waned.
at the moment fortunately for us we're in one of the warmer phases, but even so, antarctica is still buried beneath ice a mile thick, and in the north, ice and snow extend for 1,000 miles away from the pole.
eventually, as you come down the mountain or away from the pole, the land becomes warm enough to prevent it being covered by ice and snow throughout the entire year.
this is the tundra, and it's a land full of strange shapes and patterns.
fine muds and sands retain more moisture than coarse gravel, so when they freeze, they expand more and push the gravel away from the center to produce these geometric shapes.
a foot or so down, the soil is still frozen, permafrost, so the melted water the summer can't soak away and the land is covered with bogs and ponds that often lie within the polygonal ridges,
so that the land looks almost as though it's been cultivated by man.
in places, the underground ice pushes upwards into a mountain called a pingo.
it looks like a small volcano, but instead of hot lava in its heart, it has cold, blue ice.
although the ice relaxes its grip for only a few weeks in summer, a surprising number of plants and animals manage to find a permanent home here.
small flowering plants keep low, for in a few weeks close to the ground there is little wind and the sun's rays can be quite warm.
it grows extremely slowly in these cold temperatures, and this one may well be a century or so old.
in shallow burrows in the topsoil live the harvesters of this meagre crop of leaves and grass:
and what is more, the babies grow so quickly that the first to be born in the spring can themselves produce young before the winter returns.
in summer, all the tundra plants put out their leaves and there's lots to eat.
she may have laid as many as eight eggs, but only one chick has survived.
as the days lengthen, herds of caribou migrate up from the south.
their calves were born early in the season and the herd moves as much as 15 miles a day
they have to keep traveling in order to find enough food to sustain them all.
the first snow geese to arrive and build a nest already have goslings, and are foraging as a family.
later arrivals are still on the nest, and can't leave until the last of their eggs has hatched.
they provide food for the red-necked phalarope, and there are plenty to gather.
a square yard of fresh water here can produce 100,000 insects in a season.
now the blackfly larvae, that have spent the winter as eggs attached to stones in the shallow pools, are also beginning to emerge.
activity now is intense, for it is light for almost the whole 24 hours of the day.
but by late august, the snow geese begin tosense the imminence of winter and start to head southwards again.
the caribou, too, come to the end of their grazing, and start to plod back across the tundra.
as they go, they continue to feed, building up the reserves of fat they will need to sustain themselves through the winter.
as the weather gets colder and colder, the need to find shelter becomes more urgent and the herds may cover 25 miles in a day.
and then, at last, the returning travellers reach the first tall trees
it's the beginning of the great coniferous forest that lies south of the tundra right round the globe.
the snow geese will fly on for thousands of miles yet, but the caribou have reached their wintering grounds.
the forest is a sanctuary which will protect them from the bitter cold of the coming winter and it's here that we shall be coming in the next programme.
these mountains stand in the middle of the biggest desert on earth, the sahara.
it stretches right across the width of africa, three and a half million square miles of it.
the artists may have been ancestors of the nomads who today follow their herds of long-horned piebald cattle just south of the sahara.
but we know what they looked like, because they left their portraits.
but there are one or two living survivors from that time.
this ancient cypress, judging from the number of rings in the trunks of others like i is probably between 2,000 and 3,000 years old.
in fact, it was probably already growing here when the last paintings were being made.
it still bears fertile seed, but there are no little seedlings growing here to replace it.
the drying out of the sahara seems to be connected with the great changes in climate at the end of the last ice age.
as the glaciers retreated northwards across europe, so the rains that fell regularly along their southern edge left africa and moved up into europe, and the sahara was robbed of its rains.
indeed, it seems that most of the world's great deserts were formed around that time, and most, if not all of them, are therefore comparatively recent environments.
to see why deserts lie where they do, we can look at the sahara from the west.
the equator runs away from us across the width of africa.
it's along this line that the sun's rays strike from directly overhead, and therefore with the greatest strength.
but as it rises and cools, the moisture condenses first to form clouds and then to fall as rain.
when the air comes down again over the sahara to the left and the kalahari to the right, it's lost most of its moisture and creates few clouds.
the sahara, with few clouds to shield it from the sun, becomes roastingly hot during the day.
and at night, with no blanket of clouds to keep in its warmth, it gets desperately cold.
deserts are not placed symmetrically around the world, because the continents themselves are distributed in a very irregular way.
they're ridged with great mountain ranges, which interfere with the even flow of air, and the planet's spin creates vast eddies in the atmosphere, which further complicates things.
but even so, deserts do lie in two broad zones on either side of the equator.
the pattern in africa, with the sahara in the nort and the kalahari and the namib in the south, has its equivalent in the americas.
south of the lush equatorial jungles of the amazon, beyond the great range of the andes, lies the atacama desert.
on the other side of the equator, beyond the drenched tropical rainforests of panama, stretch the deserts of mexico and arizona.
across the pacific, the greatest expanse of water on the globe, lies, south of the equator, australia, most of which is covered by desert.
its northern tip gets close enough to the equator to collect some rain.
beyond them, as we complete the circuit of the globe, the huge desert of the middle east that covers iran, iraq and jordan,
syria and israel, the vast sandy emptiness of arabia, and runs on to join the sahara.
a black widow spider has set her snare of silk underneath a thorn bush.
in the intense struggle, the black widow loses one of her legs.
she manages to get more ropes of silk around the scorpion, hampering it still further.
the scorpion hangs on to its trophy, but to no purpose.
wolves, perhaps surprisingly, are quite common in these middle eastern deserts, but they're not like those farther north.
they're smaller, lighter-coloured, and with only the thinnest fur, and they scavenge as much as they hunt.
the animals must go back to their dens and hiding places to shelter from the heat that is to come.
the sun returns, and very soon the desert will be heating up once again.
the mammals that were active during the night have to find shelter.
the day belongs not to them, but to creatures that get their heat directly from the sun:
actually, he very seldom uses his poison in defence, and it's still quite early in the morning and he is so cold that he isn't very active.
but in only about an hour, the desert will get so hot that he won't be able to stand it, and he, too, will have to seek shade.
so in this short period of the early morning and in the cool of the evening is the time when he hunts.
a tortoise, but he's far too big and well-armoured for a gila monster to tackle.
it's time for even a reptile to get out of the sun
movement generates heat, so now nothing moves unless it absolutely has to.
and there are some creatures that remain motionless even when you get within a few inches of them.
one of them is on the ground right in front of me now, though you may find it difficult to see because it's so well camouflaged.
the sand grouse chicks start doing it almost as soon as they emerge from the shell.
they also immediately peck for seeds, but there's little moisture in a seed, and unless they drink, they will die.
these feathers have a special spongy structure so that they can absorb lots of water.
once he has a full load, he flies back to his fami
during the day, the parents sit on the nest, not to keep the chicks warm, but, on the contrary, to keep them cool by shading them.
the bird not only flutters its throat, but protects itself from the sun by using its tail as a parasol.
the hedgehog that lives in the desert of the middle east has unusually large ears.
blood circulates through capillaries close to the surface of the skin and is cooled by the breeze.
the dorcas gazelle also has radiator ears and is one of the best-adapted desert mammals.
it's one of few that can survive without drinking at all.
even at the edge of these sand flats, where the ground is more broken, there is no sign of animal life whatever.
all animals now have sought the shade and shelter from this ferocious sun.
its leaves grow at about 70 degrees to the vertical, so that in the morning when it's less hot and in the evening when the plant needs light, the face of its leaves face the light.
during the middle of the day, it shows only the edges and doesn't heat up so much.
this is one of the most widespread of plants in american deserts, and its roots are better at extracting the last molecule of water from parched sands than those of any other american plant.
this has led to an extraordinary state of affairs that's only just been discovered.
it seems that the creosote bush was the first plant to establish itself in the arid mojave desert when the desert first appeared.
once it had established its extensive root system, it extracted moisture from the sand so efficiently that it was extremely difficult for any other plant to grow alongside it.
and that applied not only to any other kind of plant but also to its own seedlings.
so an individual creosote bush tended to spread not by setting seeds and producing a new generation, but by sending out new stems around its base.
and as these spread outwards, so the stems in the middle tended to die away, and the bush grew into a ring shape like this.
so these are not separate individual creosote bushes, as it might appear, but this is just one big ring-shaped individual plant.
over the centuries, the rings widened and changed their shape until now some are over 25 yards across, like this one.
of course, the individual stems and leaves of this plant are not very ancient.
the first ones to grow, which appeared in the middle, decayed and disappeared long ago.
now it's estimated that this plant began growing between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, in fact, when the mojave desert first appeared, and that makes it the oldest known living organism in the world.
in the mojave, the plants may have to survive for as long as ten years without rain, but if rain falls a little more frequently, as it does nearby in arizona, plants can have different survival strategies.
to many of us, the very symbol of the desert is the cactus.
but in fact, this family of fleshy-stemmed plants lives only in the americas.
there are several hundred species of them, but among the biggest is the saguaro.
the saguaro has solved the problems of surviving in great heat and drought very successfully indeed.
its stem is pleated like an accordion, so when rain does fall, the cactus can expand and quickly absorb as much water as possible before it disappears.
after a single storm, a saguaro can take up as much as a ton in a few days.
its leaves have become thorns, so reducing the surface area from which the plant might lose water by evaporation.
the stem itself is green and has taken over the job of photosynthesis.
the thorns protect the young plant from browsers, but they also break up the wind currents, so that the cactus is wrapped in still air, and evaporation of moisture from the stem is kept very low.
i'd be tempted to cut inside that saguaro and raid its reservoir of water.
but that would probably be a mistake, because the water in the saguaro contains a poison.
but there are lots of desert-living plants which do have drinkable water within them, and desert-living people all over the world have become expert botanists, able to recognise from just the tiniest little leaflet or straggling where they can get a good drink.
none are more skilled than the bushman people of the kalahari.
by the end of the dry season, all their water holes have usually dried up.
for liquid, they must now rely almost entirely on plants and their ability to recognise the right ones.
since it cannot be drunk, people use it to moisten their skin, and as it evaporates, it brings a delicious refreshing coolness.
200 miles west of the kalahari lies an even hotter, drier desert:
patches of grass sprouted after a rare shower and lived for a few weeks, but that was over four years ago and now only the dusty withered stems are left.
there is one plant that grows here, though, and nowhere else, and one that is very odd indeed.
the scientist who first described this extraordinary plant was an austrian called dr welwitsch, who came here in the last century.
he discovered many plants in africa, but this perhaps is his most famous and the one that bears his name:
this one is a female, and these are the female's structures.
these are young ones, which sprouted this year, and these are fully developed ones from last year.
in structure, they are very like the cones of a fir tree.
the male plant has growths rather like stamens, which produce pollen, so welwitschia seems to be a kind of link between coniferous trees and true flowering plants.
but if it hadn't frayed at the edges, it would be about 400 yards long, because this individual plant is thought to be about 1,500 years old.
it's these amazing leaves that enable the plant to collect water in this rainless country.
the rest is channelled down to the ground, where it's sucked up by roots just below the surface of the sand.
the fog also provides life-saving drinks for some of the desert animals.
often, the clouds that do build up above a desert sail off elsewhere without bursting, and the land remains parched.
but when eventually rain does come, it's the trigger for immediate and urgent action.
all their movements are simply the result of the dead tissues absorbing water.
the dead seed-heads have held the seeds securely during the drought.
now, since it's rained and there's a chance of them germinating, they can be distributed.
for some plants, the heavy raindrops are enough to dislodge the seeds.
others utilise the physical effects of absorbing water to shoot the seeds away.
now the seeds themselves, lying on the ground, begin to move.
as the hairs absorb water, they swell and stiffen, so raising the seed into the right position for its first rootlets to strike straight downwards into the ground.
but sometimes in the arizona desert, maybe once in several years, there are real cloudbursts, and the desert is transformed.
the males are the first to emerge from the soil where they've been buried for the past year or more.
hastily, they make their way to one of the pools that have appeared in the desert, and there they begin calling, summoning the females.
with such a protein-rich diet, they grow even faster than the algal feeders.
here they are the favoured few, more likely to survive if the pool evaporates quickly.
even among this tiny proportion of survivors, the mortality will be huge.
but with luck, a few will join the adults as the desert dries and bury themselves to wait for the next shower of rain many months from now.
but quartz, the commonest, is very hard, and that remains as grains of sand.
the wind catches them, sweeps them away, and collects them together as sand dunes.
trudging up the face of a dune like this is extremely hard work.
the sand is so dry and the grains are so polished by the wind rubbing them together that the surface is continuously on the move, and it's quite impossible to get any firm foothold.
and, of course, that problem faces notjust me, but all the animals that live among these dunes.
some of them have developed some extremely ingenious solutions to the difficulty.
it skims across the surface by throwing its body into loops, which only touch the sand at two points.
this not only enables it to move fast, but keeps most of its body off the hot surface.
at midday, the sand is so hot that it's painful to touch.
the namib fringe-toed lizard prevents its feet from scorching by gymnastics.
an animal can't construct a tunnel like a mouse hole or a rabbit burrow because the sand simply falls in behind it.
so instead it has to wriggle through the sand almost as though it's swimming.
you can see that it's a lizard when you look closely at its face.
its mouth and eyes are covered by transparent scales that protect them in the sand.
the most extremely specialised of these hunters in the dunes is not a reptile but a mammal.
it's very rarely seen, and your best chance of finding it is at night.
these are its tracks, and that depression a place where it caught something.
this is where it has burrowed again, and where, with luck, and if i dig very fast, i might catch it.
the great sandy deserts of the world in arabia, central australia and the sahara have repelled even the hardiest of human travellers.
few people have managed to survive in them for long totally unaided.
they travel from one side of the sahara to the other, carrying great cakes of salt, which they trade for cloth and grain and dates.
but even the tuareg can only make these journeys with the help of an animal desert specialist:
its toes are reduced to two, but connected by skin, so that they splay out on the sand and don't sink deeply into it.
their nostrils are closable, so they can shut out sand grains during a sandstorm.
their hump is full of fat, which in emergencies can be converted to water.
but the process wastes the fat's calories and is only used when the camel hasn't drunk for a long time.
at one or two places in the sahara, water can be reached by digging deep into the ground.
here, camels can at last refill their stomachs, and they take a lot of filling.
if the wind veers and blows steadily from another direction, nothing can stop the sand.
eventually the advancing dunes may well overwhelm this oasis, and then this small world that's been brought into existence in the desert by the presence of water will be extinguished.
the force that drives the dune, of course, is the wind, and the wind, too, has its own world of living organisms.
many of the spiders and beetles and other insects that live in the oasis arrived by air.
and many of the plants, too, coming as windblown seeds or carried by birds.
and that world, the world of the wind and the sky, we'll be exploring next time.
each year brings a great change between winter and summer, and this in turn imposes an annual rhythm in the lives of animals and plants.
up north in the great evergreen forests, conditions in mid-winter are cripplingly severe.
and the reason trees like these don't grow much farther north is not only because of the extreme cold, but because with the long months of winter darkness, there is simply not enough light in the year for them to grow.
here in northern norway, 300 miles, 500km north of the arctic circle, there is just enough light, but it does get extremely cold.
70 degrees of frost have been measured here,in northern forests and during the winter there are very heavy falls of snow.
the cold not only threatens to freeze the liquid within the trees, it also denies them one of their essential supplies:
so in winter this land is effectively as parched as a desert and the pine trees have as great a need to conserve their water as a cactus.
all plants lose some water from the surface of their leaves, but the long thin pine needles are protected by a near-impermeable rind.
and the pores through which they breathe, and from which they could lose water by evaporation, are kept out of the wind by being placed in lines along the groove that runs the length of the needle, each in a tiny pit ringed with a ridge.
these dry, waxy leaves are almost inedible, but the seeds in the cones are a different matter,
and what's more they are a few kinds of food available in the forest during the winter.
the crossbill has a special beak which enables it to separate the brown segments of the closed cone and prise out the nutritious seeds.
moose get little nourishment from pine trees, apart from the shaggy moss that here and there hangs from the branches.
they chew the sappy twigs and bark of birch, but there's not enough to keep them going.
if it wasn't for the fat reserves they built up during the summer, few would survive.
the winter forests can support very few plant-eaters, but there are just enough to provide meals for one or two hardy hunters.
bigger prey are worth much longer chases, and the lynx pursue roe deer with great persistence.
a single deer will provide food for the whole lynx family.
in this bleak land, even the most ferocious and capable hunters do not scorn to scavenge.
an eagle owl will take cold deer flesh just as eagerly as the warm bodies of voles.
a wolverine, the biggest of the weasel family, and more than a match for an eagle owl.
the coniferous forest grows right round the globe in a belt that, in places, is 1,200 miles across.
from scandinavia, it extends across northern europe and siberia to the shores of the pacific.
during the last ice age, when the seas were lower, the bering strait did not exist, so the trees continued without interruption into north america, across northern canada to the atlantic.
and because of this one time continuity all the trees in this vast forest and all its permanent inhabitants in america, asia and europe, are very much the same.
but when spring comes, visitors journey up from warmer parts and the forest on each continent takes on its own individual character.
in scandinavia, a hawk owl, a nomad that has spent the winter in the gentle conditions farther south, comes cruising up north again looking for food and a nest site.
unlike other owls, it's primarily a daytime hunter, and relies not so much on its acute hearing as its sharp eyesight as it waits for the melting snow to reveal rodents.
in pine trees, from norway to siberia, the cock capercaillie is starting to claim his territory.
this giant grouse is one of the few creatures that eats pine needles.
the hawk owl is in search of a hole in a tree, for it's already found its partner.
but many tree holes are already occupied, for great numbers of owls have travelled up to feed on the voles.
their sharp beak with which they pick out insects also serves as an excellent chisel, but even so, most prefer to work in dead trees where the wood is softer.
there are ants near this tree too, which the woodpeckers rely on them as for food during the winter.
the wood anemones are already in flower, and so are the pines.
each tree produces both, male and female flowers, which mature at slightly different times, so the female flowers are likely to be fertilised by pollen from other trees.
now it is as warm as it ever will be in the northern forests.
summer visitors are arriving, and the trees echo with their song.
and the lure that has brought them so far is the sudden emergence of myriads of insects.
this bedraggled creature is hardly recognisable, for its wings have not yet expanded.
here the moths will lay their eggs so their caterpillars can feed on the young shoots
the wood ants have missed their chance to catch the adult moth, but now they're looking for the caterpillars among the branches.
the colour and the pattern of the caterpillar conceals it from birds which hunt by sight, but is no protection against ants which search by smell and touch.
finally the body is hauled down to the nest for all to consume.
when a foraging ant discovers them, they dab a spot of this resin on its head, like this
the resin damages the ant's eyes and antennae, so disorientating it that it can hardly walk straight.
the wryneck is a member of the woodpecker family that has specialised in eating ants, and particularly relishes their cocoons.
like its cousins, the wryneck nests in holes in trees, but it doesn't excavate them for itself.
here in the far north, close to the arctic circle, the sun during the summer hardly sinks below the horizon and the nights are brief.
the eagle owl hunts just as effectively in the twilight as in the dark.
it has grown fast and its adult feathers are already appearing through its down.
the tail of a red squirrel is left over from a previous meal, and it even takes that too.
this female produced her four young only three weeks ago, but she is already pregnant again and will soon abandon this family and start a new one.
all the owls, some visitors, some residents, scour the forest for voles.
more voles mean better-fed owls, which produce bigger clutches of eggs and rear more chicks.
and as the number of owls increases, so they spread out into new territory.
but the frontier is no barrier to the bird they call the phantom of the north, the great grey owl, and in years when the vole population is high, the owl comes across these frontiers and into the finnish pine forests.
and i know they are here already because i have just picked up this.
and this, i can see, has actually got vole skulls in it.
but to discover exactly what the state of the vole population is at the moment,
i'll have to look inside the nest of a great grey and to do that i'll need this.
all owls are fairly ferocious and the great grey owl certainly can be, so as part of the standard equipment of looking for owl nests you need this.
up there is one of their nests, and the female has just flown off.
she's perching in that tree over there, keeping a very close eye on me.
if i go up and have a look in the nest,
i may be able to get some idea as to how the vole cycle is going.
so it is very likely that the female and her mate will soon be on their way back to russia.
there's now just a month left of the short northern summer.
many of the birds that came up here to harvest the insects and to breed will soon be moving back again to avoid the severities of the coming winter.
some, like the redwing, will go to open pastureland down south.
the brambling prefers beech woodland, and will leave almost as soon as it has finished its summer moult.
the hawk owl is driven south by hunger, for as the forest gets colder, there is less and less food to be found.
they are not covered with a thick, protective rind but are thin, delicate structures.
during the summer water is more accessible, so there is less need to take rigorous measures to conserve it.
indeed, during hot days the trees evaporate large quantities to keep cool.
so the pores through which they breathe are numerous, and not in pits as they are in the pines.
these succulent, soft leaves, unlike pine needles, are relished as food by all kinds of creatures.
large animals, like deer, take many of them, but the greatest quantity by far is gathered by insects.
the forest canopy in late summer has more birds in it than at any other time of the year.
there are returning migrants newly arrived from the north, resident breeders gathering food to feed their second families of the season, and young fledglings starting to forage for themselves and still not sure what is edible and what isn't.
nearly all of them are hunting for insects, and the crop they take is huge.
not surprisingly, the insects have evolved many ways of protecting themselves.
they snip off half-eaten leaves so as to give the minimum sign of their presence.
they disguise themselves as a blob of cuckoo spit or a bird dropping, but if they move, as eventually they must, their concealment is lost.
the nuthatch habitually works its way down the trunk, and that way may see insects that have been overlooked by tree creepers that habitually come up it.
one of the most expert of all bark-feeders,and in some ways the most specialised of all the birds living in the tall trees of these forest are the woodpeckers.
its tall feathers have strong quills and serve as props for its body.
its bill has a resilient pad at the base which cushions its brain from the shock of its drilling.
europe has ten species, but here in north america there are over twice as many.
this one, a sapsucker, drills holes in trees not for insects, but for sap.
it digs lines of these wells many different kinds of trees.
each little hole points slightly downwards so that the sap does not trickle out but collects in a small pool inside, and the sapsucker collects it with its tongue.
in late summer, the parent sapsuckers lead their fledglings to the wells and leave them to feast not only on the sap but on the insects it attracts
this american woodpecker uses its drilling skills to bore neat sockets in dead tree trunks.
some are wrapped in soft and tasty flesh to tempt the animals to eat them and so transport them to new sites.
others are packed with nourishment, not for animals, but to provide food for the germinating seedling, but the animals eat them just the same.
even the hard and unpromising-looking acorns of the american pin oak are collected by racoons.
the squirrel's habit of burying acorns for a winter store has been the beginning of many an oak.
the black bear, on occasion, will eat fish and voles and even carrion, but much of its diet is vegetable.
it will dig for roots and even eat pine cones, but it has a very sweet tooth and just now it relishes the fruit.
all sorts of mammals are now clambering around in the trees in search of fruit.
the possum, a strange primitive animal of the americas related more closely to kangaroos than to rats, eats almost anything.
and there are many other creatures too, chewing their way through the dead leaves, extracting what nutriment they can and leaving the remainder to be dealt with by fungi and bacteria.
they themselves are hunted by monsters in miniature, pseudoscorpions, horrific in close-up, but, perhaps fortunately, the size of a pinhead.
snails are giants in comparison and, since they carry their shells around with them, they might seem to be fairly well protected against any creatures smaller than a bird.
but one particular beetle has specialised equipment for dealing with them.
almost every range of mountain in the us has its own species with its own particular colours, but, being nocturnal, they're rarely seen.
shrews eat most small living things they come across, and they are formidable hunters, for they are one of the few mammals that has a poisonous bite.
the salamander's only defence is to produce an acrid liquid from glands on its tail
the first time a shrew encounters this, it usually takes no notice and eats the salamander, but apparently the taste is not very nice, for on later encounters, like this one, one sniff is enough to remind the shrew that the meal won't be a good one
the birds that came visiting up here during the summer have now retreated south, and some of these small mammals have crawled into holes and gone to sleep.
their heartbeat has almost stopped, their bodies have become as cold as stone.
not only warmth but intense cold will bring them out, for although their body temperature falls while they hibernating, if it drops to freezing point, they will die.
so in really cold spells, they must get up and warm themselves with a little exercise, even though it dangerously depletes their fat reserves.
when spring at last comes, the brown carpet of rotting leaves is suddenly flooded with colour.
the plants that live close to the ground now make haste to sprout and flower and soak up the spring sunshine before the trees above produce their own leaves and cut out the light.
the bear's den is empty, but the owners haven't gone far.
there's still not much to eat, only a few leaves, nor will there be until the first of the berries come into fruit in summer, but meanwhile at least the sun is warm.
the spring showers soak the woodlands and create just the moist, warm conditions needed by the fungi to produce their fruiting bodies.
these must be mature and ready to discharge their microscopic spores by the time the dry winds of summer begin to blow, so that their spores, like dust, will be carried all through the forest.
once, the woods of north america stretched over the eastern half of the continent in an almost continuous band hundreds of miles deep.
today, the majority has been felled to make space for farmland and cities, but enough remains to make plain their splendour.
but the terminal buds of young pines are surrounded by a shock of needles.
they burn at a relatively low temperature, and by the time the flames have consumed them, the main fire has swept by, and the bud at the top of the stem, from which new growth will come, is still unharmed.
fires like these are not just the work of careless people, they occur naturally.
the spark that regularly sets fire to these forest is lightning.
in this part of the southern states, violent thunderstorms are common and lightning often strikes the taller trees, scoring a deep groove down the length of the trunk as it flashes down to earth.
and this at my feet is the tinder which set it aflame.
these are pine needles, and they're so full of resin and they're so dry that they flame up very easily.
but the fire they produce is not very hot, and it's also very short-lived, so that if any creature can survive fire for just one or two minutes, then it can survive a fire like this.
the rattlesnake, like many other ground-living animals, regularly takes refuge from the midday sun in holes, so now it knows exactly where to go to escape the fire.
but this hole is already occupied by its digger and owner,
but in the back of the burrow lies another refugee, an indigo snake, and it, on occasion, eats rattlesnakes.
but the fire is passing and the rattlesnake can return to the forest.
but a tree killed by fire can't resist, and these beetles take advantage of the situation.
they have pits behind their legs which are sensitive to infra-red rays, and therefore they can detect the slightest rise in temperature, and with these to guide them, they travel from all over the forest to the wake of the fire, and arrive in hundreds.
the fire has cleared away the old growth on the ground, and by reducing the pine needles to ash has released their nutrients into the soil, and now the ground sprouts more flowers than at any other time.
because of regular fires, big bushes can't establish themselves here, so swampy areas are not colonised and sucked dry by them as happens elsewhere, and open marshes remain where pitcher plants can grow and where frogs can swim and breed.
the woodpeckers here can't excavate their nest in dead trees as do woodpeckers elsewhere, for in this fire-ravaged forest they would risk incineration, so the red-cockaded woodpecker drills its holes in living pines.
but the wood is so hard, it takes several woodpeckers about two years to dig the hole.
resinous sap seeps out around the hole where the outer layers of the tree have been breached.
so the birds make their hole low down on the trunk where the inner sap-free heartwood is thick enough to accommodate the entire nest.
the flow of resin is diverted to the outside by drilling pits like sap wells above and below the hole.
it's in these laboriously excavated holes that the red-cockaded woodpecker raises its young.
the holes are very conspicuous, for each is surrounded by a sheet of yellow congealed resin.
the rat snake is a great robber of nests and stealer of chicks.
but now the other function of all that resin, deliberately produced around the nest by the woodpecker, is about to become clear.
the chemicals in the resin seem to irritate the snake beyond endurance, and it arches its body away.
this injury was also caused by fire, and this is also a coniferous tree, but a very different one.
to start with, it's over 40 feet across along its base and it's 267-1/2 feet high.
it's just taller and it's estimated to weigh 1,385 tons, and that makes it the most massive living organism in the world.
although these trees are growing almost as far south as the southern pines, the climate here, 2,000 metres up in the sierra nevada mountains, is much colder and snow lies on the ground for almost half the year.
it's as though, by climbing to this height, we have returned climatically to the great forests of the north.
during the ice age, these sequoias grew over much of north america.
but when, some 8,000 years ago, the earth began to warm, they died out except for these isolated groups high up in the mountains.
we've travelled some 2,000 miles southwards since we started at the tree line near the arctic circle, and in all that vast territory the majority of the forest trees have been conifers, so it seems only right and proper that we should end with these,
they can survive both the short, dark days of winter with their bitter cold, as well as the long sunny days of summer with their raging fires.
but if we continue a further 1,000 miles southwards, we come to the tropics, and there the climate is radically different.
it's no longer very variable but remarkably constant, with much the same amounts of light and rain and heat throughout the year.
there the other great group of forest trees, the broadleaved trees, come into their own.
that is the jungle, and that's where we'll be in the next programme.
it stretches right across the width of africa, three and a half million square miles of it.
creatures that can't live anywhere in the sahara today, because there's simply not enough vegetation for them.
these aren't the only wild animals that has been painted on these rocks.
the artists may have been ancestors of the nomads who today follow their herds of long-horned piebald cattle just south of the sahara.
but we know what they looked like, because they left their portraits.
but there are one or two living survivors from that time.
this ancient cypress, judging from the number of rings in the trunks of others like it, is probably between 2,000 and 3,000 years old.
in fact, it was probably already growing here when the last of the paintings were being made.
it still bears fertile seed, but there are no little seedlings growing here to replace it.
the drying out of the sahara seems to be connected with the great changes in climate at the end of the last ice age.
as the glaciers retreated northwards across europe, so the belt of rains that fell regularly along their southern edge left africa and moved up into europe, and the sahara was robbed of its rains.
indeed, it seems to be that most if not all of the great deserts in the world, were formed around that time,and most, if not all of them, are therefore comparatively recent environments.
to see why deserts lie where they do, we can look at the sahara from the west.
the equator runs away from us across the width of africa.
it's along this line that the sun's rays strike from directly overhead, and therefore with the greatest strength.
the heated air rises along the equator and flows away, north and south, to cooler parts of the world.
because it's warm, it carries with it a lot of moisture.
but as it rises and cools, the moisture condenses first to form clouds and then to fall as rain.
by the time the air comes down again over the sahara to the left and the kalahari to the right, it's lost most of its moisture and creates very few clouds.
so the sahara, with few clouds to shield it from the sun, becomes roastingly hot during the day.
and at night, with no blanket of clouds to keep in its warmth, it gets desperately cold.
deserts are not placed symmetrically around the world, because the continents themselves are distributed in a very irregular way.
they're ridged with great mountain ranges, which interfere with the even flow of air, and the spin of the planets itself creates vast eddies in the atmosphere, which further complicates things.
but even so, deserts do lie in two broad zones on either side of the equator.
the pattern in africa, with the sahara in the north and the kalahari and the namib in the south, has its equivalent in the americas.
south of the lush equatorial jungles of the amazon, beyond the great range of the andes, lies the atacama desert.
on the other side of the equator, beyond the drenched tropical rainforests of panama, stretch the deserts of mexico and arizona.
across the pacific, the greatest expanse of water on the globe, lies, south of the equator, australia, most of which is covered by desert.
its northern tip gets close enough to the equator to collect some rain.
and beyond them, as we complete the circuit of the globe, the huge desert of the middle east that covers iran, iraq and jordan,
syria and israel, the vast sandy emptiness of arabia, and runs on to join the sahara.
a black widow spider has set her snare of silk underneath a thorn bush.
in the intense struggle, the black widow loses one of her legs.
she manages to get more ropes of silk around the scorpion, hampering it still further.
the scorpion hangs on to its trophy, but to no purpose.
the sun returns, and very soon the desert will be heating up once again.
the mammals that were active during the night have to go to shelter.
this is the gila monster, one of only two poisonous lizards in the world.
actually, he very seldom uses his poison in defence, and in any case, it's still quite early in the morning and he is so cold that he isn't very active.
but in only about an hour, the desert will get so hot that he won't be able to stand it, and he, too, will have to seek shade.
so in this short period of the early morning and in the cool of the evening is the time when he hunts.
movement generates heat, so now nothing moves unless it absolutely has to.
and there are some creatures that remain motionless even when you get within a few inches of them.
fluttering the throat evaporates moisture from the mouth and so cools the bird.
it consumes much less energy than heaving the chest and panting, as many mammals would do in this situation.
each time, before the meal is handed over, the chicks get a drink, whether they like it or not.
during the day, the parents sit on the nest, not to keep the chicks warm, but, on the contrary, to keep them cool by shading them.
and the sitting bird not only flutters its throat, but protects itself from the sun by using its tail as a parasol.
the ground squirrel of the namib desert does the same thing, and very effectively, too, carefully angling itself as far as possible to keep its body in the shade.
and so do those of the american jackrabbit, which perhaps has the biggest ears of all in proportion to its body.
the dorcas gazelle also has radiator ears and is one of the best-adapted of all desert mammals.
it's so hot that no creature can survive permanently out here.
even at the edge of these sand flats, where the ground is more broken, there is no sign of animal life whatever.
all animals now have sought the shade and shelter from this ferocious sun.
but there are some organisms that can't get out of the sun.
plants, being fixed to the ground, have to stay out in the heat of the day and simply endure.
but all of them have special devices to help them to do so.
during the middle of the day, it shows only the edges and so it doesn't heat up so much.
not only that, but the plant extracts salt from the salt-laden ground and excretes it as a white coating on the surface of the leaf, which, like the white costume of an athlete, reflects the heat and so keeps the plant that much cooler.
this has led to an extraordinary state of affairs that's only just been discovered.
it seems that the creosote bush was the first plant to establish itself in the arid mojave desert when the desert first appeared.
once it had established its extensive root system, it extracted moisture from the sand so efficiently that it was extremely difficult for any other plant to grow alongside it.
and that applied not only to any other kind of plant but also to its own seedlings.
so an individual creosote bush tended to spread not by setting seeds and producing a new generation, but by sending out new stems around its base.
and as these spread outwards, so the stems in the middle tended to die away, and the bush grew into a ring shape like this.
so these are not separate individual creosote bushes, as it might appear, but this is just one big ring-shaped individual plant.
over the centuries, the rings widened and changed their shape until now some are over 25 yards across, like this one.
of course, the individual stems and leaves of this plant are not very ancient.
the first ones to grow, which appeared in the middle, have decayed and disappeared a long time ago.
but now it's estimated that this plant started growing between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, in fact, when the mojave desert first appeared, and that makes it the oldest known living organism in the world.
in the mojave, the plants may have to survive for as long as ten years without rain, but if rain falls a little more frequently, as it does nearby in arizona, plants can have different survival strategies.
to many of us, the very symbol of the desert is the cactus.
but in fact, this family of fleshy-stemmed plants lives only in the americas.
there are several hundred species of them, but among the biggest is the saguaro.
the saguaro has solved the problems of surviving in great heat and drought very successfully indeed.
its stem is pleated like an accordion, so when rain does fall, the cactus can expand and quickly absorb as much water as possible before it disappears.
after a single storm, a saguaro can take up as much as a ton in a few days.
its leaves have become thorns, so reducing the surface area from which the plant might lose water by evaporation.
the stem itself is green and has taken over the job of photosynthesis.
the thorns protect the young plant from browsers, but they also break up the wind currents, so that the cactus is wrapped in still air, and evaporation of moisture from the stem is kept very low.
these huge saguaro cacti can live for over 200 years and stand nearly 50 feet high.
i'd be tempted to cut inside that saguaro and raid its reservoir of water.
but that would probably be a mistake, because the water in the saguaro contains a poison.
but there are lots of desert-living plants which do have drinkable water within them, and desert-living people all over the world have become expert botanists, able to recognise from just the tiniest little leaflet or straggling stem where they can get a good drink.
none are more skilled than the bushman people of the kalahari.
by the end of the dry season, all their water holes have usually dried up.
for liquid, they must now rely almost entirely on plants and their ability to recognise the right ones.
since it cannot be drunk, people use it to moisten their skin, and as it evaporates, it brings a delicious refreshing coolness.
200 miles west of the kalahari lies an even hotter, drier desert:
patches of grass sprouted after a rare shower and lived for a few weeks, but that was over four years ago and now only the dusty withered stems are left.
there is one plant that grows here, and indeed nowhere else, and one that is very odd indeed.
the scientist who first described this extraordinary plant was an austrian called dr welwitsch, who came to this part of africa in the middle of the last century.
he discovered many plants in africa, but this perhaps is his most famous and the one that bears his name:
this one is a female, and these are the female's structures.
these are young ones, which sprouted this year, and these are fully developed ones from last year.
in structure, they are very like the cones of a fir tree.
the male plant has growths rather like stamens, which produce pollen, so welwitschia seems to be a kind of link between coniferous trees and true flowering plants.
but if it hadn't frayed at the edges, it would be about 400 yards long, because this individual plant is thought to be about 1,500 years old.
it's these amazing leaves that enable the plant to collect water in this rainless country.
the rest of the water is channelled down to the ground, where it's sucked up by roots just below the surface of the sand.
the fog also provides life-saving drinks for some of the desert animals.
often, the clouds that do build up above a desert sail off elsewhere without bursting, and the land remains parched.
but when eventually rain does come, it's the trigger for immediate and urgent action.
all their movements are simply the result of the dead tissues absorbing water.
the dead seed-heads have held the seeds securely during the drought.
now, since there has been rain and there's a chance of them germinating, they can be distributed.
for some plants, the heavy raindrops are enough to dislodge the seeds.
others utilise the physical effects of absorbing water to shoot the seeds away.
now the seeds themselves, lying on the ground, begin to move.
as the hairs absorb water, they swell and stiffen, so raising the seed into the right position for its first rootlets to strike straight downwards into the ground.
but sometimes in the arizona desert, maybe once in several years, there are real cloudbursts, and the desert is transformed.
the males are the first to emerge from the soil where they've been buried for the past year or more.
hastily, they make their way down to one of the temporary pools that have appeared in the desert, and there they begin calling, summoning the females.
with such a protein-rich diet, they grow even faster than the algal feeders.
here they are the favoured few, more likely to survive if the pool evaporates very quickly indeed.
even among this tiny proportion of survivors, the mortality will be huge.
but with luck, a few will join the adults as the desert dries and bury themselves to wait for the next shower of rain many months from now.
but quartz, the commonest, is very hard, and that remains as grains of sand.
the wind catches them, sweeps them away, and collects them together as sand dunes.
trudging up the face of a dune like this is extremely hard work.
the sand is so dry and the grains are so polished by the wind rubbing them together that the surface is continuously on the move, and it's quite impossible to get any firm foothold.
and, of course, that problem faces not just me, but all the animals that live among these dunes.
and some of them have developed some extremely ingenious solutions to the difficulty.
it skims across the surface by throwing its body into a series of loops, which only touch the sand at two points.
this not only enables it to move very fast, but keeps most of its body off the hot surface.
in midddle of the day, the sand is so hot that it's painful to touch.
the namib fringe-toed lizard prevents its feet from scorching by gymnastics.
but eventually it gets so hot, the only thing to do is to shelter beneath the surface where the sand is very cool.
but burrowing through this kind of sand also has it's problems.
an animal can't construct a tunnel like a mouse hole or a rabbit burrow because the sand is so smooth, it simply falls in behind it.
so instead it has to wriggle through the sand almost as though it's swimming.
and you can see that it's a lizard when you look closely at its face.
for it has a mouth and two eyes covered by transparent scales that protect them in the sand.
the most extremely specialised of these hunters in the dunes is not prehaps a reptile but a mammal.
it's very rarely seen, and your best chance of finding it is at night.
these are its tracks, and that depression a place where it caught something.
this is where it has burrowed again, and where, with luck, and if i dig very fast, i might catch it.
they have to take all the food that they and their camels will need with them.
water is carried in skins slung beneath the camels' bellies to minimise evaporation and keep it as cool as possible.
their nostrils are closable, so they can shut out sand grains during a sandstorm.
the hair on their body is restricted to the top, where it shields against the sun.
but the process wastes a lot of the fat's calories and is only used when the camel hasn't drunk for a long time.
it can in fact live without liquid water for four times as long as a donkey and ten times as long as a man.
here, camels can at last refill their stomachs, and they take a lot of filling.
but if the tuareg can't cross the sahara without the camel, the camel can't do so without the tuareg, for only men can dig wells for the essential water.
eventually the advancing dunes may well overwhelm this oasis, and then this small world that's been brought into existence in the desert by the presence of water will be extinguished.
the force that drives the dune, of course, is the wind, and the wind, too, has its own world of living organisms.
many of the spiders and beetles and other insects that live in the oasis arrived by air.
and many of the plants, too, coming as windblown seeds or carried on the feet of birds.
and that world, the world of the wind and the sky, we'll be exploring next time.
these mountains stand in the middle of the biggest desert on earth, the sahara.
and, in turn, those oven-like temperatures rob the land of all its moisture.
all in all, there could hardly be a more hostile environment for life on earth.
obviously, at the time these pictures were painted, there was good grazing here.
indeed, there was sufficient vegetation to sustain not only wild animals, but whole herds of cattle.
but eventually the rains began to fail, the pastures disappeared, and with it the cattle and their keepers.
but there are one or two living survivors from that time.
this ancient cypress, judging from the number of rings in the trunks of others like it, is probably between 2,000 and 3,000 years old.
in fact, it was probably already growing here when the last paintings were being made.
indeed, the cypress itself only survives because it sends its huge roots deep into the ground to tap underground water.
the drying out of the sahara seems to be connected with the great changes in climate at the end of the last ice age.
as the glaciers retreated northwards across europe, so the rains that fell regularly along their southern edge left africa and moved up into europe, and the sahara was robbed of its rains.
indeed, it seems that most of the world's great deserts were formed around that time, and most, if not all of them, are therefore comparatively recent environments.
to see why deserts lie where they do, we can look at the sahara from the west.
the equator runs away from us across the width of africa.
it's along this line that the sun's rays strike from directly overhead, and therefore with the greatest strength.
the heated air rises along the equator and flows away, north and south, to cooler parts of the world.
when the air comes down again over the sahara to the left and the kalahari to the right, it's lost most of its moisture and creates few clouds.
the sahara, with few clouds to shield it from the sun, becomes roastingly hot during the day.
and at night, with no blanket of clouds to keep in its warmth, it gets desperately cold.
deserts are not placed symmetrically around the world, because the continents themselves are distributed in a very irregular way.
they're ridged with great mountain ranges, which interfere with the even flow of air, and the planet's spin creates vast eddies in the atmosphere, which further complicates things.
but even so, deserts do lie in two broad zones on either side of the equator.
the pattern in africa, with the sahara in the north and the kalahari and the namib in the south, has its equivalent in the americas.
south of the lush equatorial jungles of the amazon, beyond the great range of the andes, lies the atacama desert.
on the other side of the equator, beyond the drenched tropical rainforests of panama, stretch the deserts of mexico and arizona.
across the pacific, the greatest expanse of water on the globe, lies, south of the equator, australia, most of which is covered by desert.
its northern tip gets close enough to the equator to collect some rain.
farther north still, beyond the jungle that blankets indonesia and malaysia, thailand and burma, across the great snow-covered range of the himalayas, stretch the vast deserts of central asia:
if you want to see what made these tracks, you have to wait until the sun sinks and the desert begins to cool.
a striped hyena, one of the commonest of the bigger desert animals in this part of the world.
in the intense struggle, the black widow loses one of her legs.
she manages to get more ropes of silk around the scorpion, hampering it still further.
methodically, the spider trusses up her victim and hangs it in her larder.
wolves, perhaps surprisingly, are quite common in these middle eastern deserts, but they're not like those farther north.
the sun returns, and very soon the desert will be heating up once again.
the mammals that were active during the night have to find shelter.
this is the gila monster, one of only two poisonous lizards in the world.
actually, he very seldom uses his poison in defence, and it's still quite early in the morning and he is so cold that he isn't very active.
but in only about an hour, the desert will get so hot that he won't be able to stand it, and he, too, will have to seek shade.
so in this short period of the early morning and in the cool of the evening is the time when he hunts.
movement generates heat, so now nothing moves unless it absolutely has to.
and there are some creatures that remain motionless even when you get within a few inches of them.
fluttering the throat evaporates moisture from the mouth and so cools the bird.
it consumes much less energy than heaving the chest and panting, as many mammals would do in this situation.
each time, before the meal is handed over, the chicks get a drink, whether they like it or not.
during the day, the parents sit on the nest, not to keep the chicks warm, but, on the contrary, to keep them cool by shading them.
the bird not only flutters its throat, but protects itself from the sun by using its tail as a parasol.
the ground squirrel of the namib desert does the same thing, and very effectively, too, carefully angling itself as far as possible to keep its body in the shade.
so do those of the american jackrabbit, which perhaps has the biggest ears of all in proportion to its body.
the dorcas gazelle also has radiator ears and is one of the best-adapted desert mammals.
it's so hot that no creature can survive permanently out here.
even at the edge of these sand flats, where the ground is more broken, there is no sign of animal life whatever.
plants, being fixed to the ground, have to stay out in the heat of the day and simply endure.
but all of them have special devices to help them to do so.
during the middle of the day, it shows only the edges and doesn't heat up so much.
not only that, but the plant extracts salt from the salt-laden ground and excretes it as a white coating on the leaf, which, like the white costume of an athlete, reflects the heat and so keeps the plant that much cooler.
this has led to an extraordinary state of affairs that's only just been discovered.
it seems that the creosote bush was the first plant to establish itself in the arid mojave desert when the desert first appeared.
once it had established its extensive root system, it extracted moisture from the sand so efficiently that it was extremely difficult for any other plant to grow alongside it.
and that applied not only to any other kind of plant but also to its own seedlings.
so an individual creosote bush tended to spread not by setting seeds and producing a new generation, but by sending out new stems around its base.
and as these spread outwards, so the stems in the middle tended to die away, and the bush grew into a ring shape like this.
so these are not separate individual creosote bushes, as it might appear, but this is just one big ring-shaped individual plant.
over the centuries, the rings widened and changed their shape until now some are over 25 yards across, like this one.
of course, the individual stems and leaves of this plant are not very ancient.
the first ones to grow, which appeared in the middle, decayed and disappeared long ago.
now it's estimated that this plant began growing between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, in fact, when the mojave desert first appeared, and that makes it the oldest known living organism in the world.
in the mojave, the plants may have to survive for as long as ten years without rain, but if rain falls a little more frequently, as it does nearby in arizona, plants can have different survival strategies.
to many of us, the very symbol of the desert is the cactus.
but in fact, this family of fleshy-stemmed plants lives only in the americas.
there are several hundred species of them, but among the biggest is the saguaro.
the saguaro has solved the problems of surviving in great heat and drought very successfully indeed.
its stem is pleated like an accordion, so when rain does fall, the cactus can expand and quickly absorb as much water as possible before it disappears.
after a single storm, a saguaro can take up as much as a ton in a few days.
its leaves have become thorns, so reducing the surface area from which the plant might lose water by evaporation.
the stem itself is green and has taken over the job of photosynthesis.
the thorns protect the young plant from browsers, but they also break up the wind currents, so that the cactus is wrapped in still air, and evaporation of moisture from the stem is kept very low.
these huge saguaro cacti can live for over 200 years and stand nearly 50 feet high.
i'd be tempted to cut inside that saguaro and raid its reservoir of water.
but that would probably be a mistake, because the water in the saguaro contains a poison.
but there are lots of desert-living plants which do have drinkable water within them, and desert-living people all over the world have become expert botanists, able to recognise from just the tiniest little leaflet or straggling stem where they can get a good drink.
none are more skilled than the bushman people of the kalahari.
by the end of the dry season, all their water holes have usually dried up.
for liquid, they must now rely almost entirely on plants and their ability to recognise the right ones.
since it cannot be drunk, people use it to moisten their skin, and as it evaporates, it brings a delicious refreshing coolness.

the great sandy deserts of the world in arabia, central australia and the sahara have repelled even the hardiest of human travellers.
few people have managed to survive in them for long totally unaided.
they travel from one side of the sahara to the other, carrying great cakes of salt, which they trade for cloth and grain and dates.
but even the tuareg can only make these journeys with the help of an animal desert specialist:
its toes are reduced to two, but connected by skin, so that they splay out on the sand and don't sink deeply into it.
their nostrils are closable, so they can shut out sand grains during a sandstorm.
their hump is full of fat, which in emergencies can be converted to water.
but the process wastes the fat's calories and is only used when the camel hasn't drunk for a long time.
at one or two places in the sahara, water can be reached by digging deep into the ground.
here, camels can at last refill their stomachs, and they take a lot of filling.
if the wind veers and blows steadily from another direction, nothing can stop the sand.
eventually the advancing dunes may well overwhelm this oasis, and then this small world that's been brought into existence in the desert by the presence of water will be extinguished.
the force that drives the dune, of course, is the wind, and the wind, too, has its own world of living organisms.
many of the spiders and beetles and other insects that live in the oasis arrived by air.
and many of the plants, too, coming as windblown seeds or carried by birds.
and that world, the world of the wind and the sky, we'll be exploring next time.
these tough, persistent plants continue to grow even when they're trimmed day after day by grazing teeth.
they are able to withstand all this rough treatment because the point from which a grass leaf grows is at its base close to the ground and is permanently active.
so grass provides a continuous banquet for creatures big and small.
down among the tangled grass stems live not only creatures that eat grass but others that feed on the grass-eaters.
among the most industrious of these tiny labourers are the termites.
on many tropical grasslands, they flourish in such numbers that, one way or another, they consume more of the grass than big creatures like antelope, cows or kangaroo.
in the savannahs of brazil's, there are more termite mounds on an acre than anywhere else in the world.
and termites are highly nutritious - so much so that the giant anteater is able to exist by feeding on them and nothing else whatever.
this creature has very poor eyesight and very poor hearing, and finds its way around mostly by smell, so, as long as i keep downwind of it, there's no reason why it should be particularly disturbed by my presence.
you might think that that would make it very vulnerable to enemies.
the fact is, out on the savannahs here, it's got very few enemies.
the only things that might attack it are a jaguar or a puma, or if it was a baby, a savannah fox.
it was always thought that those legs are actually for ripping open termite hills, and they may be used to some extent for that purpose.
but it seems more likely now that they are primarily defensive weapons, because when they actually come to feed, this creature doesn't do so much of a sweep with its front claws as to use them very, very carefully to open the exit tunnels in the termite hills.
once it has done that, it pokes its nose into the tunnel entrance and flicks out its 20-inch-long tongue, coated with sticky mucus, and picks off the worker termites clinging to the tunnel walls.
after about half a minute, before the soldier termites, which have powerful bites, can rally to the defence of the opened tunnel, the anteater moves on.
it is a wanderer, always on the move, sleeping at night out in the open, blanketed against the cold by its huge hairy tail.
having no permanent den, the female carries her youngster with her, piggyback.
other termite hunters live on the surface of the mounds themselves.
beetle larvae lurk in burrows and lure flying ants and other insects to them by the luminous glow of their heads.
the defenders of the colony, the soldier termites, engage the enemy ants.
these termite warriors have jaws so specialised for fighting that they can't feed for themselves and have to be tended by the workers.
others have blades that strike outwards and others nozzles on their forehead through which they squirt a sticky poison spray.
other ants are vegetarians, like the termites, and use their jaws to demolish the living grass plants, scissoring up the leaves, sawing through the stems and carrying off the plant piecemeal.
grass consists largely of cellulose and that is a very difficult substance to digest.
termites do it with the help of bacteria in their gut.
the grass-cutting ants have another and quite extraordinary method of making its nutriment digestible.
laboriously, they haul the pieces of grass back to their nest, which may be as much as 100 yards away and have several hundreds small entrances.
inside an entrance, a tunnel leads down into a vast labyrinth of corridors that may extend for 80 or 90 feet in a horizontal direction and lead to as many as 2,000 interlinked chambers.
such a nest may contain as many as 20 million ants.
the workers carry their cuttings deeper and deeper into the nest.
and here, 15 feet below the surface of the ground, in special chambers, they feed the grass to a fungus.
the waxy skin that covers the leaf surface is stripped away and then the pieces are cut up into even smaller fragments.
the gardeners push the prepared morsels of grass into the mass of the fungus.
dead pieces of fungus and coarse, unsuitable fragments of leaves are carefully removed and carried away.
with unflagging energy, porter lines of ants carry the waste down the long corridors to the lowest chambers of all, 20 feet below ground, that serve as the colony's refuse tips.
others, like the scissor-tailed flycatcher, proclaim their territorial rights by visual display, flying incessantly and conspicuously above their chosen plots.
the seriama, a catcher of snakes and insects, surveys the days prospects from the top of a termite hill.
just what it likes, and no small bird, no matter how aggressive, is able to repel a hungry tegu.
eggs on the ground are very much at risk to creatures like this.
softly, he summons the female, who is incubating her eggs in the hole beneath.
the burrowing owls nest in holes in the ground, taking over ones that have been abandoned by armadillos or even digging them for themselves.
so it is very important that they get their flight feathers as quickly as possible, and already, only a couple of weeks after hatching, they are showing through the down.
out in the fresh air, there is space to preen and a chance to sunbathe.
their nest is probably as safe as it would be even if they remained sitting on it,for their eggs are marvellously camouflaged and very difficult to see.
the adult tinamou, on the other hand, is just as well-disguised as the plover's eggs.
and he is polygamous, with half a dozen or so females, all of whom will lay in his nest.
but with so many contributors, the compiling of a clutch can be a tricky business.
sometimes several females, each with an egg ready to be laid, will turn up at the same time and there's some confusion as to who's going to have the first turn.
he doesn't seem to want them to lay in the main clutch.
they've come from many different females and been laid over a period of eight days, but all hatch together.
the young pipe to one another while they're still inside their shells, stimulating the eggs that are a bit behind to speed up their development.
the advantage of hatching simultaneously is that the young, soon after they emerge, can go off and feed together under father's watchful eye.
the open grassland is full of dangers and there are very few places to hide from the many enemies that lie in wait for the chicks.
the maned wolf will certainly take one if it gets the chance.
it hunts alone, never forming packs, seldom even seen with its mate.
trees don't grow on the open plains of argentina and brazil because, for much of the year, there is too little rain.
during the dry season, the shallow lakes are reduced to stretches of baked mud.
capybara, giant semi-aquatic guinea pigs, crowd into the few shrinking pools that remain.
cayman are compelled to spend much of their time out of water, and turtles jostle for places along the contracting margins with the capybara.
many others, such as burrowing rodents that might otherwise crop the grass of the plains, can't do so because they can't survive being flooded like this every year.
the grass, however, grows tall and lives through even this hardship.
2,000 miles farther north still, water lies on the plains for many months on end, as snow on the prairies of north america.
here the temperature can drop to 46 degrees below zero centigrade.
their temperature falls and their breathing rate slows - they hibernate, using the absolute minimum of their body reserves accumulated during the summer.
a cousin of the ground squirrel, another rodent called the prairie dog, does remain active, and during milder spells it ventures out onto the snow to nibble what leaves it can find.
the bison manages to survive even the coldest weather out on the prairie.
big animals are not as easily chilled as small ones, and the bison is the most massive animal in north america.
the bison, being so big, have no difficulty in sweeping away the snow and reaching the frozen tufts.
bison share the prairies with pronghorn antelope which, in winter, often visit areas that the bison have just cleared of snow.
they are the swiftest animals in north america, capable of speeds of 50 mph at full stretch.
coyotes, a small relation of the wolf, have little chance of catching a young healthy pronghorn.
the bitter cold and the shortage of food kills many animals at this time.
for the coyotes, a carcass is precious, a mass of meat in an otherwise barren land.
as spring approaches, the temperature rises, even below ground, and the winter sleepers begin to awake.
rattlesnakes, forced to take shelter from the cold, frequently take over the deeper burrows made by prairie dogs and there, ten feet below ground, sit out the winter beyond the reach of the lethal frost.
sometimes as many as two or three hundred will share the same hole.
as the spring sun warms the air, so they too slowly come to life.
the prairie chickens leave the tall grass country where they spent the winter and assemble on shorter turf, for they are about to start their spring dances.
each male stays on a small patch of ground that is his dancing stage, and there erects his feathery horns, inflates his wattles and starts his stamping dance.
the bison, being such a big animal, has a long gestation period, nine months.
so, soon after the young are born, courting starts again, and for the bulls that involves battling with rivals.
these jousts, which can be very punishing and even end in death, establish a ranking among the bulls.
the victors can then seek access to the cows, which is another problem.
the bison herds have a particular liking for the grazing around the prairie dogs' towns, for the prairie dogs are good farmers.
they deliberately cut down unpalatable plants and remove dead material, and their constant cropping means that the grass leaves around their burrows are all young and succulent, and the bison like that just as much as the prairie dogs do.
the rattlesnakes also haunt the town, on the lookout for young prairie dogs.
the shortness of the cropped turf makes it easy for the town sentinels to see approaching danger.
like antelope and sheep, they are ruminants,dealing with the problem of digesting cellulose by regurgitating pellets of grass they graze and giving it all a second chew.
they also maintain a digestive broth of bacteria in their huge stomachs.
today, most of the prairie has been turned over to the raising of domesticated cattle for beef, or ploughed up to grow domesticated grass, wheat.
by the beginning of this century, less than a thousand wild bison were left.
but today, thanks to careful conservation, there are some 35,000 living in reserves.
the prairies receive comparatively little rain because they lie in the centre of a huge continent and the rocky mountains screen off the rain.
across the northern pacific, the biggest continental mass of all, eurasia, also contains a heartland where relatively little rain falls the grass-covered steppes of russia and eastern europe.
and here another grass feeder survives that once formed vast herds, an extraordinary antelope, the saiga.
its huge nose contains, internally, a convoluted arrangement of passages lined with mucous glands that apparently serve to warm and moisten the dry air of the steppes and filter out the dust.
the steppes are not as fertile as the prairie and are ravaged by regular and disastrous droughts.
but the saiga seem to have adapted to this and have a quite extraordinary rate of reproduction that enables them to recover their numbers after such a catastrophe with great speed.
the females, when they are a mere four months old and only half-grown, mate and produce their first calf.
after it is weaned, they grow rapidly, so that by the beginning of the next breeding season, they are full-size, and then they quickly breed again, and this time three quarters of them will produce twins.
these animals, too, were hunted close to extinction, but when people realised that these natural inhabitants of the steppes could turn their grass into meat much more efficiently than any domesticated animal, indiscriminate hunting was stopped and now
here there is enough rain to create rivers and waterholes, so in the moist soils around them and on rocky outcrops, a few trees manage to grow.
in the more regularly watered parts, thorn trees stand, distanced from one another, their widespread root systems managing to collect just enough water to sustain them.
it sweeps rapidly over the plains, killing the tree seedlings but leaving the growing buds of the grasses, close to the ground, quite unharmed, and green shoots of grass appear within days.
so the fire, which starts so easily in withered grass stems, is one of the factors that keeps the country open, for grass.
the grasslands of africa stretch in an immense and almost continuous arc from the sahara in the north down through east africa and on to the great game plains of southern africa and the cape.
during the eight million years or so of recent history, they've varied quite a lot in their extent.
at the moment, they are not as big as they have been in the past.
but during this period of time, the grasslands have developed, and as they have done so, the animals that lived on them have evolved, the nature of one reacting on the nature of the other.
today, there's a greater variety and a bigger concentration of grass-living creatures on these african plains than anywhere else in the world.
different lengths of neck, different sets of teeth, different appetites, such variety means that almost every growing leaf, short or long, of every kind of plains plant, is eaten by something.
this vast tonnage of meat on the hoof has led, inevitably, to the appearance of an abundance of meat-eaters.
and they too are varied, to exploit the variety of meat available.
before grass spread over the plains, the ancestors of grazing antelopes must have lived in bush country, rather as dik-dik do today.
the bushes don't produce many leaves, but they are highly nutritious and there are enough in an acre or so to sustain a pair of these tiny antelope.
so the dik-dik mate for life and are permanent residents of their territory.
they know it intimately and have their own trails and hiding places, and they mark out its frontiers with special notices.
the buck is stimulated to follow and habitually goes through exactly the same sequence of smelling, urinating, scratching and dunging.
when the ceremony is over, the buck marks the nearby bushes with a sticky perfumed wax from a gland just below his eyes.
impala, however, live in more open country and feed not only on bushes but on grass.
here they can't hide and they find their safety in numbers.
with so many sharp eyes and acute ears, it's very difficult for a hunter to approach them undetected.
but such a lifestyle obviously makes it impossible for the animals to live in permanent pairs on their own territory as the dik-dik do.
those that win will leave the bachelor herds and set up individual territories.
when the victors have established themselves, the does visit them, one after the other.
it is a very exhausting business for the bucks, repeatedly mating and fighting off challengers.
after about three months of this, the once dominant bucks are worn out.
but the patchy distribution of rain over the african plains means that they can't stay permanently in the same place.
they quickly exhaust pasture on one patch of the plains and must move on to an area where rain has recently fallen and the grass is springing again.
so the wildebeest are constantly on the move and their social arrangements have to be different from the dik-dik and impala.
during the short breeding season, the males set up small territories along the migration routes.
they advertise their pretensions by prancing around and snorting, seeking showy contests with rivals to demonstrate their virility to passing females.
the problem then is to keep the females in their territory and prevent them from moving on to a rival's patch.
the varying growth of the grass over the year affects the lives of people as well as animals.
in the eastern part of the grasslands, in the sudan, the people keep herds of semi-domesticated cattle.
the people can't settle in permanent villages, for their cattle exhaust the meagre pasture, just as wildebeest do, so periodically they too have to move.
it is a nice question as to whether the animals are being driven by the people or whether the people are, willy-nilly, following the herds.
many people in the sudan regard not only their semi-wild cattle as their own personal property, but also the fully wild game that regularly passes through their territory.
the white-eared kob, the males black and white, the females a delicate tan, live in the southern sudan.
here, during the rainy season, the does give birth to their young.
as the rains end and the plains begin to dry out, the herds begin to move north, following the new flush of grass that springs from the receding waters.
as they go, the herds are funnelled together by two rivers that flow closer and closer to one another until eventually they join and the kob have no alternative but to attempt to cross it and here the merle people await them.
for the merle, this is an annual bonanza and a great celebration.
in spite of the merle's ambush, the vast majority of the kob reach
there they will find enough food to sustain them throughout the critical months of the dry season.
and there, too, they mate, so that next year herds will reappear to make the river crossing and provide the merle, once more, with meat.
and the grass, too, will spring again, this remarkable plant that can survive intense grazing and burning and flooding.
and then it's reduced to little more than sand and the land becomes a desert.
and it's to deserts that we're going in the next programme.
there is a "killing husband" line one you palm, associated with your mouth.
even you have more husbands, they will be blown to death.
there is no rest day in the middle of the month
get the writ, you can be the leader of the association.
of course it is me, how much you prepare to donate to me today.
the little ghost is not here today, you definitely would die.
of course i don't have fate with you, but i have fate with your grandson.
two persons of same sex expel each other, who has fate with you?
there is no next chance, you still want to stab in my back.
you shouldn't dream that i would go back with you to the opening ceremony.
you see, my dear watson, it is not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each dependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself.
if, after doing so, one simply knocks out the central inferences and presents one's audience with the starting point and the conclusion, one may produce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect.
now, thurston, you told me, four weeks ago, had an option on some south african security which expired in a month, and which he desired you to share with him.
your checkbook is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.
you have not used the logical principles which i constantly expound.
sherlock holmes is cheerful, so, sherlock holmes must have a case.
i was a bachelor and thought i'd remain one until three years ago i came down to london on a visit.
it's a rare thing for me, but-- well, i had a mind to see the queen's golden jubilee.
she'd tired of america, traveled about, and finally settled in england.
well, not to make a labour of it, before my holiday was over,
i was as much in love as any man ever has been.
to my surprise and joy, she-- she reciprocated my feelings, and we were married.
if you marry me, hilton, i promise you marry a woman who has nothing personally to be ashamed of.
but you'll have to take my word for it, and allow me to be silent forever as to my life before we met.
if that's too much to ask, then you must go back to your derbyshire and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.
it's little enough to ask, and i shall never let you go.
america is her past, and the subject of a solemn promise.
yes, but she's not had an easy hour from that moment.
oh, yes, well, i thought she was getting over the letter, and then these-- these drawings appeared.
it's just a childish scrawl, but it made everything worse than before.
some of the farmers take in lodgers, but i've not heard of any lately.
then i suggest that you return to derbyshire, mr. cubitt, and keep a sharp lookout.
well, i had that one washed off, then it must have reappeared.
you know, it's a pity you didn't get a closer look at this chap.
holmes, i do wish you would try and eat a bite.
i just need an answer to my telegram from america, and the story is complete.
but the crime was only committed at 3:00 o'clock this morning.
how could you hear of it in london and get to the spot as soon as i?
will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that i should act independently?
i should be proud for us to work together, mr. holmes.
but i must warn you, there seems very little to investigate.
mr. hilton cubitt has been shot through the heart and he's dead.
we could see the candle alight on the table and so we came in.
then, oh dear, as terrible a thing as ever i saw or ever fear to see.
otherwise, it would not have spread so quickly through the house.
we know that door was open, that window, too, must also have been open, but only for a short time.
this is the cartridge case of the bullet which killed mr. hilton cubitt.
holmes, if three shots were fired, why did mrs. king and saunders only hear two shots?
the least you can do is to clear her of that.
i guess the very best case i can make for myself now is to tell you the absolute, naked truth.
it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you.
i guess you probably know that elsie's father's the most powerful man in chicago.
abe slaney was condemned to death at the darby assizes, but his sentence was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances in the certainty that hilton cubitt had fired the first shot.
mrs. cubitt made a complete recovery, and lives still at ridling thorpe manor.
you had chalk between your forefinger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.
you put chalk there when you play billiards, to ease the cue.
your checkbook is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.
so, you do not propose to invest your money in that manner.
now, normally that produces black moods and the infernal lethargy of the cocaine bottle.
you have not used the logical principles which i constantly expound.
well, that is what a mr. hilton cubitt, of rridling thorpe manor, derbyshire, is anxious to know.
that conundrum came by the first post, and he is to follow by the next train.
his family has owned land in derbyshire for over 500 years, so i presume that mr. cubitt is as respectable as he is worthy.
with a fresh face, an open countenance, and wearing a brown bowler hat.
she says nothing, tries to appear normal, but i've never seen anyone so upset.
in white chalk on a garden seat, it is a precise copy?
it's a rare thing for me, but- well, i had a mind to see the queen's golden jubilee.
i put up at a boardinghouse in rrussell square, because parker, he's the vicar of our parish, he was staying there.
well, not to make a labor of it, before my holiday was over,
i was as much in love as any man ever has been.
if you marry me, hilton, i promise you marry a woman who has nothing personally to be ashamed of.
but you'll have to take my word for it, and allow me to be silent forever as to my life before we met.
if that's too much to ask, then you must go back to your derbyshire and leave me to the lonely life in which you found me.
it's little enough to ask, and i shall never let you go.
now, i have every faith in her, you must believe that.
whatever there was in her past, i'm sure it's no fault of hers.
some of the farmers take in lodgers, but i've not heard of any lately.
then i suggest that you return to derbyshire, mr. cubitt, and keep a sharp lookout.
it's perfectly natural she should receive a letter from america, she's from america.
yes, but it is not natural to throw it onto the fire unopened.
well, i had that one washed off, then it must have reappeared.
you know, it's a pity you didn't get a closer look at this chap.
will you associate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that i should act independently?
i should be proud for us to work together, mr. holmes.
but i must warn you, there seems very little to investigate.
mr. hilton cubitt has been shot through the heart and he's dead.
we moved her to her bedroom, sir, and sent fred walker for the doctor and the police.
and there was no sign of a break-in, or of an intruder?
otherwise, it would not have spread so quickly through the house.
we know that door was open that window, too, must also have been open, but only for a short time.
this is the cartridge case of the bullet which killed mr. hilton cubitt.
holmes, if three shots were fired, why did mrs. king and saunders only hear two shots?
the saddest of all, mrs. cubitt, self-ad ministered in her despair.
now, do any of you know of an inn in the neighborhood called elrige's?
i want you to take this note to a mr. abe slaney of elrige's farm.
do not say that the note is from me, and make no mention of what happened here last night.
because you followed her and made her life a misery, she now lies under grave suspicion of murdering the husband she loved.
the least you can do is to clear her of that.
i guess the very best case i can make for myself now is to tell you the absolute, naked truth.
it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you.
i hope that if ever again i have an important case,
i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.
and so the dancing men, which had so often been the agents of evil, were finally used on the side of justice.

because you followed her and made her life a misery, she now lies under grave suspicion of murdering the husband she loved.
the least you can do is to clear her of that.
i guess the very best case i can make for myself now is to tell you the absolute, naked truth.
it is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you.
i hope that if ever again i have an important case,
i shall have the good fortune to have you by my side.
and so the dancing men, which had so often been the agents of evil, were finally used on the side of justice.
abe slaney was condemned to death at the darby assizes, but his sentence was changed to penal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances in the certainty that hilton cubitt had fired the first shot.
i bet your parents say the same things about the music you listen to when you were a kid.
are you kidding in my day we had songs that meant something, words that make you feel... yeah you`re right i agree,

will be same story but here and there there a little changes, may be different ending.
well the sea captain and the lady will get married in the end won`t they?

go to the beach... talk, sing some old songs, roast some hotdogs maybe?
i haven`t had roasted hotdogs on the beach since i was a kid.
l`m a little worried about my friend mark he didn`t come home last night.
not to worry, see right down there on the beach is mark`s and stella too.
well mark, don`t you think you`re kind of rushing into this
you just met her you don`t know anything about her listen, i know she`s had quite a past if that`s what you`re talking about.
look l`m just asking you to go a little slower that`s all.
l`ve gone slow my whole life all it`s ever got me is alone.
you don`t need a woman to love or share your life with.
if you were my friend you would say 'mark i am happy for you`.
i don`t know why some people live as long as they do and others are taken when they are.
but i do know up until the time you met stella, you never knew the joy of giving and loving so completly.

ah, nice try brainbox, but this is a recipe by jimmy young, for alcoholic yorkshire pudding.
then a terrible disaster has occured master, for are meant to be attacking the madness government in camden, yet here we are in vincible, wherever that may be.
invincible, burp, is one word, and it means, right bunch of hardnuts.

knight rider, a shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist.
michael knight, a young loner on a crusade to champion the cause of the innocent, the helpless, the powerless, in a world of criminals who operate above the law.
and then stuffed $5,000 in his pocket and left him lying in the dust like a common criminal.
you said your husband was killed because he got too close.
my guess is the clay was molded around a rather substantial core of pure gold.
all right, look, the odds are i won't find a thing out there tonight.
speaking of blank spots, we got a warehouse full of gold here, we got a lawyer named abrahms who was killed, we got something called "boca culebra" he stumbled onto, all parts of a big jigsaw puzzle.
now, i'm telling you, we can help each other out here.
and i think you'd be better off back at dc at one of your society luncheons or bridge games.
for your information, the only society luncheons i attend are for charity.
but the thought of what a weapon like that might do to me is rather perplexing.

i think you and i'd better get a few things straight.
first of all, i'm here to conduct an investigation, not play social doormat and empty-glass holder for you and your highbrow, low-minded friends.
i said, why did you have to tell him you were married to a treasure hunter on a caribbean island?

i've got to get back in the beach house, get to that computer in the study.
it's our last chance to figure out boca before it's too late.

give me everything you can find on the snake, the tunnel.
eduardo o'brian's using a c-141 cargo plane to transport the weapons out of the country.

if the captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger.
captain, please, we'll take the risk, but we've got to find out what it is.
he entrusted you with his very essence, with everything that was not of the body.
he asked you to bring him to us and to bring that which he gave you, his katra, his living spirit.
i'd have given my life if it would have saved his.
believe me when i tell you, he made no request of me.
where's the logic in offering me a ride home, you idiot?
if i wanted a ride home, would i be trying to charter a space flight?
on the planet below, i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon.
if you do not surrender immediately, i will execute them one at a time as enemies of galactic peace!
i know this will come as a pleasant surprise to you, but our ship was a victim of an unfortunate accident.
sorry about your crew, but as we say on earth, c'est la vie.
this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world, a world our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish.
he did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one.
this entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behavior concerning mr. spock.
sir, security reports the door to spock's quarters has been forced.
he asked you to bring him to us and to bring that which he gave you- his katra- his living spirit.
sir... your son meant more to me than you can know.
a violation of treaty- your presence here is an act of war.
you have two minutes to surrender, or we will destroy you.

lieutenant saavik and my son david are exploring the genesis planet, which he helped create.

you fixed the barn door after the horse has come home.
how much refit time till we can take her out again?
this entire crew seems on the edge of obsessive behaviour regarding spock.
sir, security reports the door to spock's quarters has been forced.
don't quote rules to me. i'm talking about loyalty and sacrifice.
one man who's died for us, another with deep emotional problems.
once you control the ship we will transfer our flag there and take genesis from their memory banks.

eight weeks, sir, but you don't have eight weeks, so i'll do it for you in two.
mr scott, have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?

the fact that your mom doesn't know that i'm dating her sister, it's a lot weird.
i think they did a storyline like this on the valley once.
boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy finds out girl is surrogate mother's illegitimate half-sister.
i'm guessing it's too soon to joke, seth, even for a cohen.
so we can talk about stuff, confidential stuff, and it's cool?
yeah, listen, man, after all the trouble i caused, i'm happy to have a chance to help, so come on.
while i was in cabo with my family, uh, i ran into an old girlfriend, and, uh, we were at squid row, late, and, uh, we kind of kissed.
all right, well, first question, um... this old flame, do you still have feelings for her?
i know-- because you have a conscience, whatever, so you got to be honest with summer, then.
tell her you feel terrible, and tell her that all it did was make you realize how much you like her.
excuse me for wringing a little joy out of the one bitof good news i've had for some time.
well, never mind the fact that the news came at the expense of your family.
or did you fail to notice kirsten's absence at the hearing this morning?
i know i've got some work to do on my relationship with my daughter.
okay, i'm trying to do the math here and, uh... well, i have a few questions.
i will answer all of your questions tonight at the modest mouse concert, okay?
so what i'm trying to do is cultivate more of a, more of a bad boy image.
yeah, i don't think that's going to get the job done.
these walls are paper thin and everyone hears every little sound
everyone's a voyeurist, they're watching me watch them, watch me, right now
they're shakin' hands, they're shakin' in their shoes oh, lord, don't shake me down
everyone wants two of them and half of everyone else who's around
i need to get away from here before i do any more damage to myself or to my kids... to, to julie.
i love newport, but it's, it's no good for me right now.
i lost my house, my family, i tried to kiss you, which i-i still feel terrible about.
i spent the summer drunk on a boat with your 25-year-old sister, and now i'm getting back together with a woman who, who started this in the first place.
i'd be freaking out, too if my mom and dad were getting back together, and, like, kept this huge secret from me.
yeah, so, uh, we haven't had a chance to talk about our winter breaks yet.
but if the cohens are really my family, then you are my family.
which means kissing me is like kissing your sister or step-aunt.
the one you're trying to impress by drinking a fifth of jack?
i think his name was john, but yes, and dad, it went horribly, okay?
i mean, she could have at least been a hooker and helped you get into princeton.
come around in this fine town where their freedom makes the world go around
i've had a lot of time to sit here, vibrating at a very high frequency and think.
and i realize this is a really important moment for us.
but, listen, anytime you want to come live with me, you just let me know, okay?
and i will send a boat or a plane, whatever, okay?
ice-age heat wave, can't complain if the world's at large, why should i remain?
walked away to another plan gonna find another place, maybe one i can stand
rice, bread, it's all the same just as long as your full.
let's not worry about tomorrow as long as there's wine today.
if you embrace me when i say "ha" you'd probably rape me if i said "oach"
i did not go there ten years ago, it was yesterday.
he's the man of my dreams, my hero my prince charming...
a beautiful prince with his white horse, just like a fairy tale...
you may thihk i'm naive, but i know about thihgs like this.
if you had met him today, you'd be just the same way.
we shall have a very pleasant time here you and i, mrs. tesman.
that is what you are looking forward to, isn't it, mr. brack?
in the old harbor... the dockers are holding their annual feast.
the programme includes many guest artists... the municipal band... singers, conjurers, mimes...
but we've decided to have our feast anyway... if only symbolically... in honor of that old man out there at sea...
so we'd like to ask his wife... to give us some remarks

the irony is while you've been closing plants in the west, you've been building them in the east.

the flower of your beauty will be as permanent as a precious jewel, untarnished by the passing centuries.
now we know why spectrox is the most valuable substance in the universe.
they can have all the spectrox they want when i have the head of morgus here at my feet.
i want the head of that perfidious, treacherous degenerate brought to me here, congealed in its own evil blood.
very well, set a party to work checking the mud barriers.
i took the liberty of ordering that to be done, sir.
you'll pay, jek, because we took the risk to get them here on time.
you'll pay because if you don't we won't be doing business no more.
it was so wet you'd pick your finger... pick your mold off between your fingers.
i heard this screaming... and they had a guy pinned down for maybe ten seconds... screaming like it was a hundred years.
i think it's a female... pregnant... because it's dragging its feet... and leaving a trail of blood.
and then as it passes me i see that its... its fur has got blood on it... just its fur... and its... its belly is full and... it's dragging its feet.

at 1 8-mile fortress imperial couriers will be waiting for us.
but the turks and the bandits might have killed us all already.
there have been 3 mysterious death in the past 3 months.
all of them are re-known scientists with one thing in common, they were voted by the century magazine top ten future leaders.
we have reason to believe that your life's in danger, dr. ken.
so this flimsy piece of paper is the certificate of top ten future leaders?
he was reported missing in edinburgh and was selected as the chairman of the global bank last month.
mi6 has been treating this case as a kidnapping by the terrorists!
the boys upstairs asked him to gather some info and give it to some guy.
sir i was wondering who's the big shot till know it's you detective chiu.
if someone can somehow cause an explosion to another human, and if that someone wants to kill me, nobody can ever protect me!
mr. ken, i think i have to tell you one thing,
mr. anderson is the third victim, two of the chosen ten already died,
and i think you'd better trust me, let my boys take care of you.
i'm too used to panadol, should try some aspirin next time!
try some chocolate, would do you no harm if you overdose.
besides movie, you can enjoy internet, supermarket shopping, florist and so much more!
if i insert this additional sim card, you can credit the card directly from your account, very convenient!
i can determine their time of death to be around 10:00pm -1o:07pm.
how did you come to such a conclusion without any evidence?
but why did the japanese dissolved entirely and not the other two guys?
one is human explosion, one turns to ashes, but what about the remaining dead bodies?
sure we have the technology but we don't have a genius like you guys.
that's true, we might not be very good at creating but we are the best at breaking in... but hey, not breaking the law though.
you only have 15 minutes to enter this security system, if you cannot enter the correct password, the gate would close immediately.
if we try to break in manually, it would take years.

you are the 1,500 people would to gods and recreate a perfect world.

but captain janeway is always saying that voyager is a ship of opportunity.
that is true, but opportunities for promotion on a starship must be earned.
i really am interested in learning more about engineering systems, maybe even volunteering for a few duty shifts.
in fact, i have a couple of questions about the impulse response filters...
will there be any planets where we can take on supplies?
there is a station near the border... a kind of supply depot for mining and trading ships.
they don't really need a cook and i don't think our captain really requires an ambassador.
i've tried to find some other area where i might be useful, but... the truth is...
i don't know what we'd have done if he hadn't come up with them.
well, yes, wix has always had a knack for finding those hard-to-iocate items.
i have the opportunity to sell medical supplies to an outpost whose people are dying of a lung disease.
it's a good cause and it will make me enough to pay bahrat and get my ship back.
then, we return to the space station and meet with one of the physicians from the outpost.
with your transporter technology, we could be in and out of the station within minutes.
i want to know how a weapon from voyager could have been involved in this incident.
the shooting took place in an abandoned section of the station.
looking for anything that might help me apprehend whoever did this.
i've promised mr. bahrat the full cooperation of every member of this crew during his investigation.
several traders from the station were aboard voyager on the day of the incident.
we can't rule out the possibility that one of them managed to steal a phaser.
but lieutenant torres has been good enough to allow me to poke around here and there-- as time permits, of course.
she has mentioned your desire to become familiar with starfieet engineering protocols.
someone will serve 50 years of cryostatic suspension for that murder.
if i were to let this go unpunished, there would be anarchy on this station within days.
i-i just took one step, a step that seemed perfectly reasonable, and that step led to another and another and before i knew it,
i was involved in something i didn't know how to handle.
that is, i'd expressed my desire to "learn the ropes," as it were, and i have completed my study of starship security protocols.
i think you'ii find that i'm fully qualified to serve in the capacity of a starfleet security officer.
there is a station near the border... a kind of supply depot for mining and trading ships.
i suggest we stop there for provisions before we go into the nekrit expanse.
maybe not on the crew of a magnificent starship, but i'ii get by.
to tell you the truth, um... it's not quite what i told you.
mr. wix was able to find those magnetic spindle bearings we were looking for.
i don't know what we'd have done if he hadn't come up with them.
oh, and remind lieutenant torres, uh, when she has a moment,
i'd still like to go over a few things with her.
i can't afford to give bahrat what he wants to get it back.
do you begrudge me an opportunity to make a fair trade?
first, we have to get to a nearby freighter to pick up the medical supplies.
then, we return to the space station and meet with one of the physicians from the outpost.
with your transporter technology, we could be in and out of the station within minutes.
then, i couid finally get away from here and get back to a taiaxian colony.
don't tell anyone that we're delivering medical supplies to the station-- not even one person.
if bahrat finds out, he'ii take 20 percent and i can't afford that.
i never told you what it was like in there, did i?
about eating worms to stay alive... sleeping in a cell where the vermin chew on you all night... being punished in ways you couldn't imagine.
i examined the scene of the shooting and confirmed the federation weapon signature-- a type-2 phaser blast.
14 voyager crew members were off the ship at the time of the incident.
i made a mistake, which happens to people, but if i'd admitted that mistake, it wouid have been a iot better.
but i lied about it and it nearly ruined my iife.
i thought i'd log a little time in the jefferies tubes if that's all right.
i was unaware you were officially on an engineering work detail.
you're going to spend the next two weeks scrubbing the exhaust manifolds.
that should give you time to think about what i've said.

now, doctor, how is it you know this mad doctor, essex ?
i first became aware of his obsessions in the year of our lord, 1859, while in the employ of lord grey, his patron and father-in-law.
i have made detailed observations on mutated humans, incorporating some of your theories.
i must caution you, these are dangerous times for free-thinking men of science.
oh, mr. darwin, may i present dr. james xavier, family physician to grey hall.
so, dr. xavier, do you believe me a heretic or merely a madman ?
though essex was qualified to treat his wife's disorder, it was considered improper then, as now, for a physician to treat members of his own family.
james, can you give me any good news about my daughter ?
you are the most precious thing in all the world to me.
and that is why i must do everything within my power to make you well.
i shall never forget the day i arrived, along with darwin, to witness the unveiling of essex's "great work. "
you've caught me in good health and high spirits, dr. essex.
inspector, i implore you to accompany me to mansell street !
this may be a chance to stop the most diabolical madman the world has ever known !
all i could find in the rubble was the madman's journal.
lord grey spent his remaining years quietly working on behalf of the mutant humans of london.
now, doctor, how is it you know this mad doctor, essex?
i first became aware of his obsessions in the year of our lord, 1859, while in the employ of lord grey, his patron and father-in-law.
gentlemen, i wanted to speak to you about my own research.
i have made detailed observations on mutated humans incorporating some of your theories.
i must caution you, these are dangerous times for free-thinking men of science.
i shall very much look forward to reading it, when you publish it, sir.
in light of the lukewarm reception my theories received here, sir,
i believe it is i who am in need of your support.
oh, mr. darwin, may i present dr. james xavier, family physician to grey hall.
so, dr. xavier, do you believe me a heretic or merely a madman?
if my wife's condition has changed at all, it is for the worse.
will you be coming by to check on her this evening?
though essex was qualified to treat his wife's disorder, it was considered improper then, as now for a physician to treat members of his own family.
james, can you give me any good news about my daughter?
you are the most precious thing in all the world to me.
and that is why i must do everything within my power to make you well.
so they aided him in seeking out these curiosities in the traveling carnivals and dumb shows, where they were obliged to earn their keep.
i shall never forget the day i arrived, along with darwin, to witness the unveiling of essex's "great work".
as you know, my interest lies not in the gradual mutations that occur over millennia, but in the leaps that manifest themselves in a single generation.
gentlemen, allow me to introduce you to the men of tomorrow.
even the most advanced techniques of medical science were to no avail.
and though essex still fought to save rebecca, his growing fascination with human mutation became all consuming.
essex was gone, his laboratory and notes destroyed in the fire.
all i could find in the rubble was the madman's journal.

it retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime.
it actually says that in the booklet that comes with it.
"the most popular gun in american crime." like they're proud of that shit.
and they ain't want one, they want two, 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
[woman on video] it shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket, 9-millimeter luger at 1,270 feet per second.
at ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
black man show up with 10,000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it.
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
you think i wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass, huh?
and if you know beaumont, you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years, includin' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
if you gonna come in on this thing with me, you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
now, i got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in cabo san lucas.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings, or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta, you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
otherwise you'll be in sybil brand three weeks... before the public defender gets around to ya.
- hey, jackie, do you know a guy named beaumont livingston?
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change, but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get,
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces, they calling that shit "intent."
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession."
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction.
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.
if she had that shit-- and mind you, i'm saying if-- that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
- i could give you a lift home, if you like.
-♪ and i'll take to the sky on a natural high ♪
-♪ loving you more till the day i die ♪ -♪ on a natural high ♪
-♪ take to the sky on a natural high ♪ -♪ i don't know you ♪
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent.
you know, the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 1 5,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate, then i'll get probation, maybe.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
♪ the color of the sun and his eyes were green ♪
♪ he had the nerve and he had the blood ♪
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
- they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing, and that's what you are wiling to do for me.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year, you pay another $100,000.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess--
i'm going to do what you suggested-- offer to help and see what happens.
what i meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself, but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year, plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn?
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again, and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so--
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there, that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
♪ uh, i mean, damn me and you forever hand in hand ♪
♪ i'm married to the firm, boo you got to understand ♪
♪ i'll die for 'em, gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em ♪

look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know--you.
so he says, "fuck that, " and moves over into guns.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
i'm really sorry about that, man, but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach, and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying, and about four blocks away i got this young 1 9-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia, barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
well, you can't trust melanie, but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a. t.f.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 9 1 5-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 3 1 3-3688.
it's on the card i gave you when we first met.
[ ordell] it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do what the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous, and they love thinking that he's scared of' em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
i want you to put it in this bilingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's bilingsley shopping bag.
♪ i tried so many times and that's no lie ♪
♪ it seems to make you laugh each time i cry ♪♪
- no, no, i did wonder what he was doin' there.
i wondered what he was doin' there, but i thought it had nothin' to do with us.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
meet sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $50,000 and go home.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform--
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr. walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.

if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman.
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me, and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.

according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta, you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
so you get off with a slap on the wrist, but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines.

one, you in a hospital; two, you in jail; three, you ass is dead.
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.

they retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45.
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
now, i try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimetre... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
plus, he's from kentucky, and i think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down south out here.
if he runs, and i have to go to kentucky to bring him back... you pay the expenses.
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman.
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker.
and if you know beaumont... you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change... but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get...
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces... they calling that shit "intent."
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession."
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction.
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.
and mind you, i'm saying if... that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing... and that's what you are willing to do for me.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess...
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself... but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at 29.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again... and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there... that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
i'm real sorry about that, man... but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
well, you can't trust melanie... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a.t.f.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
now, the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in.
he's more interested in ordell than he is in the money.
if he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction... but he wouldn't walk off with the money, it's evidence.
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's billingsley shopping bag.
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about.
see, if there wasn't nothin'... in that bag but them towels... then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin'... about them knowing' each other?
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
meet sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $50,000 and go home.
that's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out.
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her... split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out... where my goddamn money is.
it retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45.
and they ain't want one, they want two, 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.

i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
black man show up with 10,000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it.
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
uh, if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.

a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces, they calling that shit "intent."
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession."
you're not my client till you get busted and i bond you out.
well, we ain't got no, uh-- what you call that shit?
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction.
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent.
you know, the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate, then i'll get probation, maybe.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess--
i'm going to do what you suggested-- offer to help and see what happens.
what i meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself, but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
well, i've flown over seven million miles, and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year, plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn?
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so--
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know--you.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
i'm really sorry about that, man, but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.

or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
it's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous, and they love thinking that he's scared of' em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
i want you to put it in this bilingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's bilingsley shopping bag.
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it al?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
see, if there wasn't nothin' in that bag but them towels, then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.

that's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr. walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie, either, but i could handle her.
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.

you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings... or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
so you get off with a slap on the wrist... but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines.
cut to 13 years later, you're 44 years of age... flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin' piece of shit mexican airline there is... where you make what, $13000 a year?
if you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this.
if you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court.
well, um, she had on her, i believe it was 50 grand in cash.
all right, before we start talking about stewardesses... let's get beaumont out of the way first.
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand.
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year... you pay another $100,000.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums.
well, i've flown over seven million miles... and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
look here, louis, i got to run out for a little while.
so, since you like getting high so much... why don't you hang out here with mel, watch a little tv?
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know... you.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
that shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous... and they love thinking that he's scared of 'em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out... 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you're in a hospital, two, you're in jail, three, your ass is dead.
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she don't want to be my friend no more... well, you just tell her to think about old beaumont.
and if she go to the police... you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie either, but i could handle her.
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it...
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me.
they retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45.
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
now, i try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimetre... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.
it shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket... 9-millimetre luger at 1,270 feet per second.
at ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
plus, he's from kentucky, and i think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down south out here.
if he runs, and i have to go to kentucky to bring him back... you pay the expenses.
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman.
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker.
and if you know beaumont... you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings... or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.

well, um, she had on her, i believe it was 50 grand in cash.
all right, before we start talking about stewardesses... let's get beaumont out of the way first.
and mind you, i'm saying if... that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
take to the sky on a natural high i want you to be mine
and i take to the sky on a natural high i just take to the sky
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand.
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug- related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing... and that's what you are willing to do for me.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year... you pay another $100,000.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess...
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at 29.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again... and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em lie for 'em
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em uhh, sugar
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know... you.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood.
well, you can't trust melanie... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a.t.f.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
now, the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's billingsley shopping bag.
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about.
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr walker.

then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out... where my goddamn money is.
but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find
but you don't what you'll do until you're put under pressure
#been down so long gettin' up didn't cross my mind #
#but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find #
it retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.

now, i try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimeter... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
black man show up with 10,000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it.
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
uh, if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.

now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me, and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
otherwise you'll be in sybil brand three weeks... before the public defender gets around to ya.
- hey, jackie, do you know a guy named beaumont livingston?
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change, but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get,
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
if she had that shit- and mind you, i'm saying if- that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
- i could give you a lift home, if you like.
- # and i'll take to the sky on a natural high #
- # loving you more till the day i die # - # on a natural high #
- # take to the sky on a natural high # - # i don't know you #
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my rent.
you know, the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate, then i'll get probation, maybe.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
- they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing, and that's what you are wiling to do for me.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums.
i'm gonna go in and talk with nicolet and dargas today.
i'm going to do what you suggested- offer to help and see what happens.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro, you look exactly the way you did at 29.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year, plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn?
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again, and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so-
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there, that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
# uh, i mean, damn me and you forever hand in hand #
# i'm married to the firm, boo you got to understand #
# i'll die for 'em, gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em #
- # and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em # - # lie for 'em #
- # it's me and you hand in hand # - # forever #
- # i'm married to the firm, boo you got to understand # - # that we be #
# i'll die for 'em, gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em #
- # and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em # - # uhh, sugar ##
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know-you.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
let him and the stewardess get the money over here, and then just take it from them.
# a man we passed just tried to stare me down #
i'm really sorry about that, man, but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach, and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying, and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia, barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
it's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
i can do what the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous, and they love thinking that he's scared of' em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out, 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you in a hospital; two, you in jail; three, you ass is dead.
# i tried so many times and that's no lie #
# it seems to make you laugh each time i cry ##
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like- 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
see, if there wasn't nothin' in that bag but them towels, then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
- no, no, i did wonder what he was doin' there.
i wondered what he was doin' there, but i thought it had nothin' to do with us.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin' about them knowing' each other?
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform-
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out.
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have that motherfuckin' boat.
she don't want to be my friend no more, well, you just tell her to think about old beaumont.
and if she go to the police, you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie, either, but i could handle her.
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.
#been down so long gettin ' up didn't cross my mind #

hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
there's this group of koreans over in koreatown starting' this neighbourhood watch thing.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
you think i wanted to spend $10000 on your ass, huh?
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
now, i got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in cabo san lucas.
i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant.
if i don't want to go to all that trouble, i'd just take you in on suspicion now.
he just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute.
i'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything.
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change... but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get...
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces... they calling that shit "intent".
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession".
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction.
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.
okay and i'll take to the sky on a natural high
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
take to the sky on a natural high i don't know you
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug- related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums.
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself... but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
well, i've flown over seven million miles... and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
look here, louis, i got to run out for a little while.
so, since you like getting high so much... why don't you hang out here with mel, watch a little tv?
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there... that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
i'm married to the firm, boo you got to understand that we be
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
i'm real sorry about that, man... but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
he's more interested in ordell than he is in the money.
if he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction... but he wouldn't walk off with the money, it's evidence.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous... and they love thinking that he's scared of 'em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out... 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you're in a hospital, two, you're in jail, three, your ass is dead.
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
see, if there wasn't nothin'... in that bag but them towels... then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin'... about them knowing' each other?
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
meet sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $50,000 and go home.
that's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out.
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her... split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie either, but i could handle her.
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it...
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me.
it actually says that in the booklet that comes with it...
"the most popular gun in american crime." like they're proud of that shit...
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45...
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer...
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem...
now, i try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimetre... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems...
it shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket... 9-millimetre luger at 1 270 feet per second...
at ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun...
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses...
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1 250 off of this nigger...
plus, he's from kentucky, and i think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down south out here...
if he runs, and i have to go to kentucky to bring him back... you pay the expenses...
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman...
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife...
there's this group of koreans over in koreatown starting' this neighbourhood watch thing...
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business...
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before...
and if you know beaumont... you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years...
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass...
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me...
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way...
you can get a $250 000 fine, plus two years in prison...
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with...
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings... or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself...
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law...
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
so you get off with a slap on the wrist... but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines...
cut to 13 years later, you're 44 years of age... flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin' piece of shit mexican airline there is... where you make what, $13 000 a year?
if you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this...
if you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court...
well, um, she had on her, i believe it was 50 grand in cash...
all right, before we start talking about stewardesses... let's get beaumont out of the way first...
and mind you, i'm saying if... that was her own personal shit to get high with...
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high.
take to the sky on a natural high i want you to be mine.
and i take to the sky on a natural high i just take to the sky.
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high.
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand...
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business...
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options...
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe...
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about...
one thing... and that's what you are willing to do for me...
i want $100 000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation...
now, if i have to do more than a year... you pay another $100 000...
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess...
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me...
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can...
bring the money in himself... but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines...
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me...

that shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy...
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work...
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag...
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's billingsley shopping bag...
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag...

no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr walker...
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money...
she don't want to be my friend no more... well, you just tell her to think about old beaumont...
and if she go to the police... you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory...
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent...
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it...
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now...
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything...
then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?

you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro, you look exactly the way you did at 29.

i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
there's this group of koreans over in korea town starting' this little neighborhood watch thing.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
you think i wanted to spend $10,000 on your ass, huh?
and if you know beaumont, you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years, includin' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings, or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta, you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
[dargas] can she afford a good one, is more like it.
otherwise you'll be in sybil brand three weeks... before the public defender gets around to ya.
if you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this.
if you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now, we will give you to customs and they will take you to court.

you know, the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% oft hose were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate, then i'll get probation, maybe.
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
♪ he had the nerve and he had the blood ♪
♪ there never was a horse like the... ♪♪ [tape ejects]
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing, and that's what you are wiling to do for me.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year, you pay another $100,000.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... [blows] in my albums.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro, you look exactly the way you did at 29.
well, i've flown over seven million miles, and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air, which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year, plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn?
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...

see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
i'm really sorry about that, man, but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach, and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying, and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia, barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
it's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
[ordell] it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do what the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that shit work my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
i want you to put it in this bilingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's bilingsley shopping bag.
go in there, grab that bitch by the hair, drag her fuckin' ass outta there!
that's my goddamn money we... ♪ she didn't know what she was headed for ♪
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it al?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
see, if there wasn't nothin' in that bag but them towels, then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin' about them knowing' each other?
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr. walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie, either, but i could handle her.
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it,
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.

they retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800.
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45.
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
now, i try to steer my customers toward a 9 millimetre... 'cause it's damn near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jammin' problems.
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
plus, he's from kentucky, and i think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down south out here.
if he runs, and i have to go to kentucky to bring him back... you pay the expenses.
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman.
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker.
and if you know beaumont... you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change... but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get...
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces... they calling that shit "intent."
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession."
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction.
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you.
and mind you, i'm saying if... that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing... and that's what you are willing to do for me.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess...
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself... but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at 29.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again... and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there... that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
i'm real sorry about that, man... but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
well, you can't trust melanie... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a.t.f.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
now, the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in.
he's more interested in ordell than he is in the money.
if he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction... but he wouldn't walk off with the money, it's evidence.
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's billingsley shopping bag.
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about.
see, if there wasn't nothin'... in that bag but them towels... then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin'... about them knowing' each other?
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
meet sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $50,000 and go home.
that's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out.
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her... split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out... where my goddamn money is.
it actually says that in the booklet that comes with it.
"the most popular gun in american crime." like they're proud of that shit.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger in the world had to have a .45.
and they ain't want one, they want two, 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fucking jamming problem.

i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
[woman on video] it shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket, 9-millimeter luger at 1,270 feet per second.
at ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
black man show up with 10,000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it.
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talking that court-cost shit.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
uh, if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talking like they serious as hell... giving me time for that machine gun shit.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighborhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i am not worried,'cause by and large asians are very dependable.

in 1985, while a stewardess for delta, you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
if you don't know beaumont, why do you suppose beaumont knows you?
[clears throat] look, miss brown, we don't give a fuck about you.
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change, but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get,
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away.
if she had that shit-- and mind you, i'm saying if-- that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?

yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess--
i'm gonna go in and talk with nicolet and dargas today.
i'm going to do what you suggested-- offer to help and see what happens.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro, you look exactly the way you did at 29.
well, i've flown over seven million miles, and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.

i got mel over in hermosa beach, and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying, and about four blocks away i got this young 19 year old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia, barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
well, you can't trust melanie, but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.

then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got them watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i got them thinking that ordell's real nervous, and they love thinking that he's scared of them.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out, 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
[man] hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you in a hospital; two, you in jail; three, you ass is dead.
just keep driving to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothing about.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
see, if there wasn't nothing in that bag but them towels, then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.

i ain't going no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfucking money.
come on, man, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have that motherfucking boat.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.
then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothing to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is.
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me.
it actually says that in the booklet that comes with it.

they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
there's this group of koreans over in koreatown starting' this neighbourhood watch thing.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
you think i wanted to spend $10000 on your ass, huh?
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
now, i got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in cabo san lucas.
i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant.
if i don't want to go to all that trouble, i'd just take you in on suspicion now.
he just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute.
i'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings... or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
so you get off with a slap on the wrist... but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines.
cut to 13 years later, you're 44 years of age... flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin' piece of shit mexican airline there is... where you make what, $13000 a year?
if you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this.
if you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court.
well, um, she had on her, i believe it was 50 grand in cash.
all right, before we start talking about stewardesses... let's get beaumont out of the way first.
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand.
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year... you pay another $100,000.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums.
well, i've flown over seven million miles... and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
look here, louis, i got to run out for a little while.
so, since you like getting high so much... why don't you hang out here with mel, watch a little tv?
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know... you.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
that shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous... and they love thinking that he's scared of 'em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out... 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you're in a hospital, two, you're in jail, three, your ass is dead.
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she don't want to be my friend no more... well, you just tell her to think about old beaumont.
and if she go to the police... you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie either, but i could handle her.
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it...
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me.
but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find.
but you don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure.
they retail for 380, i get 'em for 200, sell 'em for 800...
they advertise this tec-9 as the most popular gun in american crime...
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer...
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem...
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway...
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of...
black man show up with 10 000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it...
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court cost shit...
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
uh, if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name...
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d...
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit...
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business...
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before...
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable...
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods...
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker...
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car...
you think i wanted to spend $10 000 on your ass, huh?
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass...
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me...
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way...
now, i got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in cabo san lucas...
i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant...
if i don't want to go to all that trouble, i'd just take you in on suspicion now...
he just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute...
i'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything...
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown...
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law...
now, you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change... but if i was a 44-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this one shitty, little job i was fortunate enough to get...
i don't think that i'd think i had a year to throw away...
a 44-year-old black woman caught with less than two ounces... they calling that shit "intent.".
the same thing happen to a movie star, they call it "possession.".
i'd say you were in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction...
whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so, uh, more power to you...
okay and i'll take to the sky on a natural high.
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high.
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high.
take to the sky on a natural high i don't know you.
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business...
i figure about 80% of those were drug-related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options...
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe...
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years...
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation...
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to...
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off...
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount...
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time...
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions...
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again...
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums...
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department...
i bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at 29...
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry...
you know i make 16 000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn...
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared...
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again... and i ain't got nothing to start over with...
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway...
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em.
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em lie for 'em.
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em.
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em uhh, sugar.
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing...
so i might as well give them somebody they already know... you...
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit...
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers...
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up...
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda...
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop...
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood...
well, you can't trust melanie... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie...
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around...
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a.t.f...
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302...
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688...
that's on the card i gave you when we first met...
now, the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in...
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else...
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night...
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal...
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it...
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous... and they love thinking that he's scared of 'em...
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit...
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out... 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you...
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance...
one, you're in a hospital, two, you're in jail, three, your ass is dead...
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is...
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about...
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out...
see, if there wasn't nothin'... in that bag but them towels... then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it...
but she put them books in there to trick our ass...
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it...
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it...
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear...
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out...
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis...
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her... split the half million amongst themselves...
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money...
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie either, but i could handle her...
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it...
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there...
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me...
but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find.
but you don't what you'll do until you're put under pressure.
when them hong kong flicks came out, every nigger had to have a .45.
they ain't want one, they want two, 'cause they want to be "the killer".
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45. got a serious fucking jamming problem.
now i try to steer my customers toward a 9mm 'cause... it 's near the same weapon and it ain't got half the jamming problems.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont 's his christian name.
my pleasure of living demands that... i have a good-lookingwoman, that i` m with a good-lookingwoman.
i couldn`t go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
now, let me tell you how we gonna retaliate, all right?
tomorrow, i'll take you to century city, introduce you to my lawyer.
these koreans over in koreatown are starting a neighborhood watch thing.
and they need some weapons so they can show they mean business.
i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is i ain't never done business with the koreans before.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no trunk of no car!
you think i wanted to spend us$ 10,000 on your ass?
if you're gonna come in on this thing with me... you got to be prepared to go all the way.
i got me so far a half million dollars in lock boxes in a bank... down in cabo san lucas.
there's something about the job, it makes them hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys who are really suspicious... and disagreeable human beings, or with two goodhearted guys... like mark and myself.
this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in nineteen eighty-five, while a stewardess for delta... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
you get off with a slap on the wrist, but this fucks your shit for good... with the big airlines.
cut to thirteen years later, you're forty-four years of age... flying for the shittiest shuttle mexican airline that there is... where you make, what?
and if you refuse to cooperate and continue to cop a shit attitude... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court... and, with your prior, the judge will give you two years.
you'll probably only end up serving a year and some change, but... if i was a forty-four-year-old black woman... desperately clinging on to this job i was fortunate enough to get... i don't think that i'd think that i had a year to throw away.
you're not my client till you get busted and i bond you out.
well then, we ain't got no... what do you call that shit?
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... fifteen thousand bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80 percent of those were at least drug related.
so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... i'll get probation.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happened to come by this information?
if we are friends again, why don't you point that gun somewhere else?
i'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it 's on.
what i meant was to have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
i want to talk to them first. i know more now about 0rdell's money.
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i'd bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at twenty-nine.
and after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
i make us$ 16,000 a year, plus benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again and i got nothing to start with.
we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i didn't get to know him, but i knew enough to know i didn't miss much.
that 's too much exposure. i ain't going nowhere near that money.
you don't have to. i told them you never pick up the money yourself.
and i'm managing to get your money out of mexico in your hands.
and i'm managing to do it all under the nose of the cops.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this place for simone over in compton, where you staying.
and about 4 blocks away, i got this 19-year-old girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop, out of georgia, country as a chicken coop.
the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down in the food court and your girl comes in.
went back to my office and found out that you took my gun.
got another gun and the stun gun... went to this guy`s house in el monte and waited for him to come home.
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you go out for a little while, while i work this deal.
when my ass is on the line, no, you fucking don't!
'cause if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
we can't risk doing it out in the open, or even in the dining area.
that 's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
that 's why i didn't check it, because the bag felt right.
i didn't think anything of it. i did wonder what he was doing there.
i wondered what he was doing but i thought it had nothing to do with us.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes!
why, if i don't know nothing about them knowing each other?
the idea was to try in the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it... meet sheronda, give her the bag with the us$ 50,000 and go home.
she came in, grabbed the bag, took off, but i couldn't go after her... because i was in my fucking underwear!
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster.
i ain't going no goddamn where anyway till i get my money!
come on, man, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't have that boat!
and that 's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothing to do with that bullshit about melanie.
but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find
but you don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a .45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
i get the merchandise to him, he gets it out to my customers, on all my bulk sales anyway.
before i set that nigger up, he didn't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
black man show up with 10,000 cash, first thing they wanna know is where i got it.
then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court cost shit.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
uh, if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.
hey, look here, man, i'm still scared as a motherfucker, o.d.
they talkin' like they serious as hell... givin' me time for that machine gun shit.
there's this group of koreans over in koreatown starting' this neighbourhood watch thing.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i want to help you, but i won't be locked in no goddamn trunk of no car.
you think i wanted to spend $10000 on your ass, huh?
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
now, i got me, so far, a half million dollars in lock boxes... in a bank down in cabo san lucas.
i have the right to make you wait here with ray while i go get a warrant.
if i don't want to go to all that trouble, i'd just take you in on suspicion now.
he just wants to peek inside the bag for a minute.
i'll keep my eye on him so he doesn't take anything.
let's take a look here at the file on jacqueline brown.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.

i figure about 80% of those were drug- related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
or if i stand mute, i can get as much as five years.
they'll offer you simple possession, a couple of months of county time... and a year or two of probation.
do you happen to know who put the dope in your bag?
who gave me the money and who i was givin' it to.
they found this guy in the trunk of a car with his head blown off.
they knew about the money and they knew the exact amount.
they tell you how they happen to come by this information?
or else they pretty scared about what he might say to keep from doing time.
yeah, i bet they asked you a whole shitload of questions.
oh, i got a few, but i can't afford to start all over again.
i mean, i've invested too much time and money... in my albums.
he had his doubts at first, but he's always trusted me.
and he wants to believe more than anything else that he still can.
bring the money in himself... but he ain't gonna wanna stand in no customs lines.
so, either he recruits another cabo stewardess or he continues to trust me.
well, i've flown over seven million miles... and i've been waiting on people for 20 years.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
i'll do anything i can to help you get his ass, short of wearing a wire.
and in return for my help, i need permission to leave the country, and immunity.
you smoke too much of that shit, that shit's gonna rob you of your ambition.
not if your ambition is to get high and watch tv.
look here, louis, i got to run out for a little while.
so, since you like getting high so much... why don't you hang out here with mel, watch a little tv?
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
anyway, i keep that picture because, of all the fucking time i was there... that's the only picture i've got of me in japan.
i'm married to the firm, boo you got to understand that we be
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
i'm real sorry about that, man... but i had to be somewhere all of a sudden.
i figured, well, shit, louis ain't had no pussy for a while.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
i don't know whether you still have it, but it's on it.
he's more interested in ordell than he is in the money.
if he does anything suspect, it'll be cutting corners to get the conviction... but he wouldn't walk off with the money, it's evidence.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
- if we don't do it my way, then fuck it!
that's why we can't take the risk in doing it out in the open... or even in the dining area.
that's why we got to do it in the fitting room with a woman.
then she's going to peep out the dressing room, wait on you... to give her the sign there ain't nobody watching.
she's going to leave the store, get in the car, mission accomplished.
so, what are you going to be doing during all this?
now that you got 'em watching my ass, i'm gonna be in a titty bar waiting on louis... to call me and tell me everything's cool.
i got 'em thinking that ordell's real nervous... and they love thinking that he's scared of 'em.
you know, a good cop will never let you know that he knows you're full of shit.
how can i do anything stupid when i'm being watched every second?
you know, i'm glad you pointed that out... 'cause it saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you.
hey, there's only three reasons you couldn't make your court appearance.
one, you're in a hospital, two, you're in jail, three, your ass is dead.
she got pissy with me 'cause i wouldn't let her carry the bag.
and then she started runnin' her fuckin' mouth about, you know, like... 'cause i couldn't remember where the car was parked right away when we came out.
well, you know, if she got to it, why didn't she take it all?
oh, i'll be sure and ask that bitch before i blow her brains out.
see, if there wasn't nothin'... in that bag but them towels... then maybe she didn't get a chance to take the money... out of her suitcase and the a.t.f. got it.
but she put them books in there to trick our ass.
you know all them motherfuckers is crooked as a barrel of snakes, don't you?
why should i think something's weird if i don't know nothin'... about them knowing' each other?
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
meet sheronda, give her the shopping bag with the $50,000 and go home.
that's why she came into the dressing room, grabbed the bag, took off.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
he walked into a strip bar sometime around 3:30 and never came out.
the bar was on ninth, what, less than a mile and a half from where they found louis.
she'd already tried to get jackie to go in with her... split the half million amongst themselves.
what she did was take quite a risk to make sure you got your money.
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
see, i ain't trust melanie either, but i could handle her.
if she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there... and we gotta go someplace else and get it...
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
all right, now, when we get up in here, you go up in here slow, all right?
i want you to keep your ass in front of me.
but i knew there was a better way of life and i was just trying to find
but you don't know what you'll do until you're put under pressure
and they ain't want one, they want two... 'cause all them niggers want to be the killer.
but what them flicks don't tell you and what they don't know... is that a.45 got a serious fuckin' jammin' problem.
it shoots 500 rounds of full metal jacket... 9- millimetre luger at 1,270 feet per second.
at ten pounds, it's really heavy for such a small gun.
'cause it's the same gun that nigger on new york undercover uses.
'cause of that nigger, i'm gonna make 1,250 off of this nigger.
plus, he's from kentucky, and i think they're kind of prejudiced... against brothers from down south out here.
if he runs, and i have to go to kentucky to bring him back... you pay the expenses.
my pleasure of living... demands that i have a good-looking woman, that i'm with a good-looking woman.
i couldn't go out with a woman old enough to be my wife.
they need some weapons so they can show the neighbourhood niggers they mean business.
now, i'm gonna sell them the other two machine guns, all right?
the problem is, i ain't never done business with these koreans before.
i ain't worried, 'cause by and large asians are very dependable.
i'm gonna tell 'em i'm goin' in the trunk to show 'em the goods.
when i open the trunk, you pop up and rack this motherfucker.
and if you know beaumont... you know there ain't no goddamn way he can do ten years.
if you know that, then you know beaumont's gonna do anything beaumont can... to keep from doin' them ten years... including' tellin' the federal government any and every motherfucking thing... about my black ass.
now, that, my friend, is a clear-cut case... of him or me... and you best believe... it ain't gonna be me.
now, louis... if you gonna come in on this thing with me... you've got to be prepared... to go all the way.
you can get a $250,000 fine, plus two years in prison.
you want to talk to us about this, or do you want to talk to customs?
there's something about that job makes those people really hard to get along with.
you can go down and talk with those guys... who are really suspicious and really disagreeable human beings... or you can talk with a couple of good-hearted guys like mark and myself.
according to this, this isn't the first time you've run afoul of the law.
in 1985, while a stewardess for delta... you were busted while carrying drugs for a pilot?
so you get off with a slap on the wrist... but all this criminal activity fucks up your shit for good with the big airlines.
cut to 13 years later, you're 44 years of age... flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fuckin' piece of shit mexican airline there is... where you make what, $13000 a year?
if you cooperate, tell us what we want to know, we'll help you get out of this.
if you refuse to cooperate, continue to cop a shit attitude like you're doing now... we will give you to customs and they will take you to court.
well, um, she had on her, i believe it was 50 grand in cash.
all right, before we start talking about stewardesses... let's get beaumont out of the way first.
and mind you, i'm saying if... that was her own personal shit to get high with.
is white guilt supposed to make me forget i'm running a business?
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
take to the sky on a natural high i want you to be mine
and i take to the sky on a natural high i just take to the sky
loving you more till the day i die on a natural high
if i can't fly, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time trying to find my brand.
you know... the other day i figured out that i must have written about... 15,000 bonds since i've been in the business.
i figure about 80% of those were drug- related, so... if you want, i could help you figure out your options.
so far, they told me if i cooperate... then i'll get probation, maybe.
the way i see it, you and me got one motherfucking thing to talk about.
one thing... and that's what you are willing to do for me.
i want $100,000... in an escrow account in my name... if i'm convicted up to a year or put on probation.
now, if i have to do more than a year... you pay another $100,000.
would you, uh, care to hang on to it for a while?
it wouldn't be legal, but if it makes you feel better, i guess...
you know, i can't really feel too sorry for you in this department.
i bet that, except for possibly an afro... you look exactly the way you did at 29.
then after my bust, the best job i could get was with cabo air... which is the worst job you can get in this industry.
you know i make 16,000 a year... plus retirement benefits that ain't worth a damn.
and with this arrest hanging over my head, max, i'm scared.
and if i lose this job, i gotta start all over again... and i ain't got nothing to start over with.
- see, i get high later on when i come back.
see, i get high at night when i get through with all my business.
you know, we didn't have that much to say to each other anyway.
i never really got to know him, but i knew enough to know... that i wasn't missing much, so...
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em lie for 'em
i'll die for 'em gimme a chair and then i'll fry for 'em
and if i got to take the stand i'm a lie for 'em uhh, sugar
look, the only way they're going to give me permission to fly... is if i agree to help 'em, which is what i have to appear to be doing.
so i might as well give them somebody they already know... you.
see, you can sell guns wherever there's a demand, and nobody gives a shit.
he's acting like he's this big international arms dealer... when, come on, face it, the only people he ever sold to were dopers.
you know, she's just one of the bitches i got set up.
i got mel over in hermosa beach... and i rent this little place for simone over in compton where you're staying... and about four blocks away i got this young 19-year-old country girl named sheronda.
i found her on the bus stop two days out of georgia... barefoot, country as a chicken coop.
took her to my place in compton, told her it was hollywood.
well, you can't trust melanie... but you can always trust melanie to be melanie.
well, i don't understand why you keep her the fuck around.
i was just calling to find out how everything went today at a.t.f.
if you want to call me, my home number is... 915-9302.
or you can reach me at my office, which is... 313-3688.
that's on the card i gave you when we first met.
now, the money's gonna be in a del amo shopping bag, all right?
i get some food, sit down here in the food court, then your girl comes in.
no, i mean you right now, not if you were somebody else.
if i saw an opportunity to walk away with a shopping bag full of money, would i take it?
it ain't like i'm asking you to go somewhere and spend the night.
i just want you to go out for a little while while i work this deal.
i can do whatever the fuck i wanna do with it.
with my ass on the line, oh, no, you fuckin' don't!
that shit works my nerves, you and that motherfucker being so buddy-buddy.
hey, if i wasn't so buddy-buddy with that motherfucker, this wouldn't work.
i want you to put it in this billingsley shopping bag.
and that is exactly what i expect to see... when i look inside sheronda's billingsley shopping bag.
just keep drivin' to ninth, where all them car dealerships is.
we gonna leave this heap in the parking lot and pick up... a car the cops don't know nothin' about.
the idea was to try on the suit, see if i liked it.
if i did, they would wrap it up, and i would put back on my uniform... 'cause sheronda is expecting me to wear it.
but i couldn't go after her, because i was in my fucking underwear.
and i had to put on this suit because i could put it on faster than my uniform...
no, no, no, i done told you, i can't leave here tomorrow, mr walker.
i ain't goin' no goddamn way anyway till i get my motherfuckin' money.
she don't want to be my friend no more... well, you just tell her to think about old beaumont.
and if she go to the police... you tell her i will name her ass as my accessory.
she wants to give it to you herself, and she wants to collect her ten percent.
she also wants to explain why she had to hang on to it.
if she wanted to set you up, you'd be in custody by now.
when you told her that you'd name her as an accessory, that scared her more than anything.
then that's why she wanted to give me my money, ain't it?
it ain't got nothin' to do with that bullshit about melanie, huh?
i'm gonna shoot you in the head right then and there.
then i'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out... where my goddamn money is.

then they gonna want to keep a big chunk of it, start talkin' that court-cost shit.
would you say that beaumont is his first or his last name?
if i had to guess, i'd say beaumont's his christian name.

if i don't want to go to all that trouble, i'd just take you in on suspicion now.
