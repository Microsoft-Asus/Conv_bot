teal'c may have killed hanno's father,... but in doing so he saved you, and you,... and all of you.
teal'c's death will not change the past,... but his continued life can help all of our future.
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
we don't stop pursuing war criminals, because they have a change of heart.
like it or not, what the jaffa have done to these people... and thousands of other people is a crime.
now teal'c spent many years serving the goa'uld doing some damned distasteful things.
surely both of you must realize that this was bound to happen sooner or later.
general hammond, i have spent a lot of years in the service of my country,... and i have been ordered to do some damned distasteful things.
perhaps you can better learn ways to battle the goa'uld and the jaffa.
well, don't worry, teal'c, there's not going to be any body to donate.
you must not allow colonel o'neill... to deny the retribution the byrsa deserve.
you know i have to admit, teal'c, for once i agree with jack.
now o'neill has proved to me not only where his loyalties lie but yours as well.
if you believe that it was o'neill that informed the goa'uld, you are mistaken.
i thought at first that they were from a parallel culture... but it looks like they might be way ahead of us.
we've determined humans on other planets originated here on earth, right?
umm... we'd be colonising space right now if it hadn't been for the dark ages.
there was a period of over eight hundred years where science was heresy and anathema.
it might benefit everyone... if your people and ours could be friends.
i demand you return everything that you have taken from us and allow us to go home.
ours were reported to be quite beautiful... and, when i saw you... well... you seemed to fit the description.
and then i learned from doctor jackson that you're also a brilliant scientist.
if they don't want to be here, we've got to relocate them somewhere.
you know, general, we have done some fairly good deeds out there.
- you don't need to know how... only that we did... and we can do it again any time we need to.
colonel, general hammond would like to see you and your team right away, sir.
i don't believe the president meant... to release these people until they have been through quarantine.
we don't have any idea what kinds of diseases they might be carrying.
i think it'll be kind of tough to find a civilian law to cover this.
i'll have you removed from this program for ever if you do this.
think you could find a language that would communicate to these people...
that we're human like they are and that we're friendly ?
see, it's that "near as i can figure" part that's got me a little worried.
what if their idea of a simple trial is a simple beheading ?
that we wish we could change and we sure as hell can't forget.
but the whole concept of chain of command undermines the idea of free will.
worse yet is the face of the victims whom i selected...
as they realize they are about to take their final human breath.
we have to look at this as sort of like the sentencing phase.
we need to prove to these people that he doesn't deserve to die.
but now i know that it was a different teal'c that chose sha're.
and i know that if there were any way for him to help me get my wife back,
as a member of the clan, he would never be left behind.
so, in other words, your group could only move as fast as its slowest member.
these people's laws in this regard are no different from our own.
we don't stop pursuing war criminals because they have a change of heart.
he can help you, but he is no good to you like this.
now i give you my word he will not try to run away.
we've determined humans on other planets originated here on earth, right?
then given our present state of technology, could they be ahead of us?
i demand you return everything that you have taken from us and allow us to go home.
well, it could take a while for those volcanoes to quiet down.
our final task was to close the gate... so that no- one could return and be harmed.
well, wherever you were going, we can recalibrate the co- ordinates from here.
well, the bottom line here is your survivors have become refugees.
if they don't want to be here, we've got to relocate them somewhere.
maybe go pay a visit to some of our old friends.
captain carter, i want you and doctor jackson... to get the multi- purpose room on 5c readied as a refugee housing centre.
i read about your conflict with colonel kennedy in his report.
i assure you, such an attitude will not prevail with me, in either direction.
we don't have any idea what kinds of diseases they might be carrying.
you're playing in my ballpark now... and i have the full authority of the president.
they...called us very young, which i suppose is a hair more polite than calling us primitive, but, same idea.
anyway, they sealed their stargate,... and i don't know how to communicate with them to get it open.
that long ago my hero bequeathed as heritage to his serfs and vassals
when he left all behind to g0 to a foreign land
she is coming like a hero she comes to save me
let the world pass away as i rush to her injoy
when all that i could not previously understand was revealed to me
how happy i was that my friend was free of guilt
the cameras indicate the husband went to the apartment that morning?
there's no way he could've gone in, rigged a noose and hung her.
you connected fibers from the rope used to tie hands to my client.
any fibers from the rope used to hang the victim traceable to my client?
remember what the shrink said when we were exploring lincoln as marcia's killer?
when somebody becomes addicted to being the object of entertainment which clearly lincoln is, they can develop pathological desires.
whatever evil i may be capable of, mr. espenson i could never harm another human being.
especially one i spent the better part of 11 years loving.
if he does have her, her life could be in danger.
i realize that, but i can't get a warrant with what you're telling me.
if he loves attention as you're saying, then he might invite you in.
maybe you could see something i could take to a magistrate and get a search warrant.
he has a nose for who's telling the truth and for who's a truthful person in general.
and the thing is, you struck him as one of those generally truthful people who's not telling the truth here.
you tried to make her tragic death look like a murder.
i'm sure charges of perjury are swirling around in your head about now.
fortunately, by law, if a witness retakes the stand and corrects his false statements, he can avoid those charges.
so here's your chance, mr. wilkes, to set the record straight.
we're out on a ledge, 14 floors to a spectacular death.
probably gives us a sense of our mortality, which in turn...
there's nothing so life-affirming, i suppose as a little death tucked in the back of our mind.
when i die, i want my remains sprinkled the hell off of here.
[ garth ] but i think you might have shot her.

[ harry ] but i knew it was more than a legend, so i followed my gut instinct.
- i just had a hunch that this thing was true.
this is the home of what is believed to be the world's largest primate, a 2,000-pound gorilla named joe.
joe has been at the california animal conservancy for a little over a month now.
i think i know how to convince his current owners to part with him.
[ harry ] now, this fellow is one of only 300 wild yaks... remaining on the planet.
it's my favourite restaurant 'cause they let you take off your shoes.
my granddad used to bring me fishing down here when i was a kid.
i can just see a guy telling joe he's gonna get you home by midnight.
well, nobody's ever had to tell joe what time they'll have me home by.
mr baker, i swear to you, joe is still not himself.
he's nervous and agitated, and he shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now.
i'd like to bring up to the podium the director of our conservancy- [ joe growling ] - [ gasping, chattering ]
well, i suppose there's no need to add to that introduction.
- [ harry ] but, um, tonight, instead of focusing on what we've lost, we'd like to introduce you to something that we've found.
ladies and gentlemen, behind this curtain is the newest member... of the california animal conservancy.
in fact, i want to make it clear that we will be doing... anything necessary to ensure the safety of the public.
[ male reporter ] with the number of lawsuits the conservancy is now facing, will you shut down the facility to the public?
"and i'm in charge of this facility." l mean, who does he think he is?
i bet that man has never spent one night outside in his entire life.
it's not just a coloured spray, like some of you might be thinking.
it's just a plain, ordinary cosmetic, and it just washes out in the evening.
i think mr world traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl.
just close your eyes, and then he's gonna do that, and then you say, "you found me!" come on!
behind me is the habitat of what the experts are calling... one of the worlds's most important zoological finds of this century.
this is the home of what is believed to be the world's largest primate... a 2,000-pound gorilla named joe.
i think i know how to convince his current owners to part with him.
now, this fellow is one of only 300 wild yaks remaining on the planet.
yeah, well, i guess most guys are afraid of a girl's father.
i can just see a guy telling joe he's gonna get you home by midnight.
- he's nervous and agitated... and he shouldn't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now.
look, if you can just please delay the party just a few more- lt's too late, jill.
it's 20,000 acres there where the animals are free to run.
here it's such a shame to see joe living in a man-made habitat... and being used as an attraction to raise money.
- but, um... tonight, instead of focusing on what we've lost... we'd like to introduce you to something that we've found.
ladies and gentlemen, behind this curtain is the newest member... of the california animal conservancy.
no, i'm gonna hang back and make sure nobody notices joe's gone.
give you guys a chance to make a run for it.
yeah, you should see some of the stuff we found in the post-party melee.
we've got the fun job of figuring out who all this stuff belongs to.
with all the contributions people sent in for joe... we were able to buy a beautiful land preserve that's even big enough for him.
we dedicated the joe young wildlife park today... and it was one of the happiest days of my life.
but i knew it was more than a legend, so i followed my gut instinct.
- i just had a hunch that this thing was true.
this is the home of what is believed to be the world's largest primate, a 2,000-pound gorilla named joe.

in fact, i want to make it clear that we will be doing... anything necessary to ensure the safety of the public.
with the number of lawsuits the conservancy is now facing, will you shut down the facility to the public?
if you're ever in botswana and feel like taking me out for a good meal at a fine restaurant--
that is, if you're not too afraid to let joe know what time you'll be--
i promised to write you when joe was settled, and now i finally can.
with all the contributions people sent in for joe, we were able to buy a beautiful land preserve that's even big enough for him.
okay, when we catch up to him, i want you men to herd him towards me!

half-god, half-man, young hercules longs to find his place in the world, the father he's never known, and what it means to be a hero.
before the man became legend, before the legend became myth, came the greatest adventure of all.
both sides are so blinded by hate and distrust, that they won't listen.
well, you know, if you wanna trick someone, you make them so angry, they can't think straight, and sure, they'd do anything you want.
i was lonely without you, ted, so i got a hamster instead.
yes, but does he ever stop running in that fecking wheel?
no, he's had to use it ever since he rode this into his feed tray.
don't worry, i think there's just something wrong with the brakes.
how could you get a perfectly square bit of black dirt on a window?
mrs doyle can't do any cleaning since she fell off the roof.
only the farm takes up most of the day and at night i just like a cup of tea.
i might not be able to devote myself full time to the old racism.
someone had the guts to stand up to them at last!
coming over here, taking our jobs and our women and acting like they own the fecking place!
i didn't know you had to follow up a good idea with loads more.
i'm sorry, ted, i'm going to sleep in the spare room.
i'd forgotten i can turn my head right around like this!
that stuff from habit hat arrives today so when it comes give father jack...
so big you can see it from anywhere in the world.
chairman mao, secretary of the communist party of china, the world's biggest communist party, and in my view, the best.
yes, the problem there is, you see, there's been a change of plan.
..so he was having an affair with the sister when his wife was in hospital.
his dream was to own his own stable, with prize-winning horses.
but he was afflicted by a disease that affected his speech.
yes, i'll be staying here a while, as long as i don't mess it up by doing something stupid.
most of these accounts seem in order, father smith, but could i ask father crilly about one or two of these things he's put down under "expenses"?
yes, but does he ever stop running in that fecking wheel?

historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
but as time passed and the country neared the millennium, something went awry.
the ideal of sportsmanship began to take a back seat to excessive celebration.
the athletes caring less about playing than planning the vulgar grandstanding that inevitably followed even the most pedestrian of accomplishments.
players sold their services to the highest bidder, much like the hired guns of the old west.
after playing for new england, san diego, houston, st. louis, a year for the toronto argonauts, plus one season at the desert inn,
soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change in search of greater profits.
the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles, where there are no lakes.
its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young.
you know, remer, someday i'm gonna be a big sports star.
with baseketball we can start fresh, not allow teams to change cities, or players to be traded.
and everybody will get paid the same, like when i was a kid and players were treated like...
bob costas, this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago this game was played only on driveways.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago those girls were only in grade school.
coop at the triple line, and jansen sets up for the psych-out.
if coop can make this one, the beers' long wait will be over.
hey, coop, looks like your boy denslow's gonna buy the farm.
ted denslow was a hero, because his vision brought baseketball from local driveways into big arenas, but more importantly, into the hearts and tvs of america.
his untimely death casts a pall over an otherwise sweet victory!
maybe we could lay some carpet, if you know what i mean.
at this time, i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room, so i can have a private moment with coop.
now that we're alone, coop, there's something i wanna tell you.
remember when you had the crabs and this lotion made you feel better?
you're asking me to go against every reason we created this game.
before you make any hasty decisions, discuss it with your teammate.
9th inning, the beers are just one out away from making the play-offs.
they'll have to get by big ed tuttle and the l.a. riots.
with the first 7 months out of the way, the play-off picture is now emerging:
with last night's victory over boston the beers must beat indianapolis to advance to charlotte, then to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
if no clear winner emerges, a two-man sack race will be held till a champion is crowned.
after the gruelling regular baseketball season, we're now in month 9 of the play-offs.
according to angelique bones, a nosy bitch who lives up the street, he took only a toothbrush, a wallet, a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to calcutta.
police have several possible scenarios of what happened to the man affectionately known to the world as "coop".
here's a computer-enhanced simulation of what he might look like today.
from milwaukee, wisconsin, it's the denslow cup, where the defending champion, the dallas felons, meet their perennial challengers, the milwaukee beers.
many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport, but fascinated by the flickering images and the pretty colors.
high up in the stands, pyrotechnic expert sergio "lucky" ferouch is readying another spectacular halftime fireworks display.
his new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
we are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned.
a game where guys with bad backs and bad knees can get together and compete as guys who are goosed up on steroids.
but more than anything, isn't this game about being with your friends and having a good time?
historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
but as time passed and the country neared the millennium, something went awry.
stadiums and arenas... became nothing more than giant billboards... to promote commercial products.
- players sold their services to the highest bidder, much like the hired guns of the old west.
san diego, houston, st. louis, a year for the toronto argonauts, plus one season as a greeter at the desert inn,
- i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami.
the jazz moved to salt lake city where they don't allow music.
the oakland raiders moved to l.a. and then back to oakland.

dude, i can't believe those ass-wipes fired you... for not shutting off our gas for six weeks.
it was losing the truck that pissed them off the most.

and everybody will get paid the same, just like when i was a kid, and players were treated like--
bob costas, this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games... in recent memory.
just five years ago, this game was played only on driveways.
- coop, i know this is a dark time for you, but i'd like to get your thoughts on what happened today.
well, tim, today i lost the big game and a dear friend.
oh, the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids, right ?
well, we prefer to think of them as health-challenged... and survival-impaired.
and on a sad note, the sports world was devastated tonight... by the passing of ted denslow.
by all accounts, the late beers owner seemed to be the only one... surprised by his death.
at this time, i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room... so i can have a private moment with coop.
now that we're alone, coop, there's something i wanna tell you.
joining us in the booth this evening, big fan of baseketball, tony nochelino, who plays, as you know, latino cutup scooter... on the new hit comedy series what's the difference ?
airing between recycled junk, starring lisa campbell, and same old crap, featuring teen heartthrob mark swenson.
all part of the great fall lineup... on our network's "who gives a rat's ass" thursdays.
- and, tony, it is great to have you with us.
we're going to be voting next week... on making some changes in baseketball's rules.
- i want to tell the others that you're with us.
if a woman wants a mate ho is responsive, she will reveal to him the secret of a woman's duality.
she will tell him about the interior woman, that one who added to herself makes two.
- well, they want to make your dream come true, as long as it doesn't involve, like, a miracle cure or something like that.
well, hell, the guys on death row only get a meal, right ?
how about killing an endangered species, like a bald eagle or a giant panda ?
joey, i don't think that's in the true spirit of the foundation.
i called ya, i called ya, i called ya, but you did not look around, yeah
i pay my, i pay my i pay my money to the welfare line
- the fans here, of course, all wearing yellow ribbons... in support of this brave little boy.
and his hero, joe cooper, promising to hit three home runs, a promise that could mean the difference between life and death...
i don't know, but he's one for 11 and he smells like christian slater.
coop in the home run circle, getting ready to take his shot.
in fact, with the exception of coop, the beers are ice-cold.
oh, man, that doesn't even qualify as an air ball !
anyway, i just wanted to assure you there's no reason... for your girlfriend's foundation to go into chapter 11-- or for that matter, 12, 13 or 14.
uh, but i think i may have a solution to her problem.
with the first seven months of the baseketball post-season out of the way, the play-off picture is now starting to emerge.
so with last night's victory over boston, next week the beers must beat indianapolis... to advance to charlotte-- that's in an effort to reduce their magic number to three.
right, and the beers can advance to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
so, if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta... in the american southwestern division east northern, then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup, unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto.
then oakland would play l.a. and pittsburgh in a blind choice round-robin.
if no clear winner emerges from all this, the two-man sack race will be held...
if you would have agreed to cain's changes it never would have gotten this far !
- dude, because of you, jenna's foundation is totally screwed !
according to angelique bones, a nosy bitch who lives up the street, he took with him only a toothbrush, a wallet, a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to calcutta.
police theorize several possible scenarios of what happened... to the man affectionately known to the world as "coop."
here's a computer-enhanced simulation of what he might look like today.
from milwaukee, wisconsin, on the shores of lake michigan, it's the denslow cup, where the defending champion dallas felons... meet their perennial challengers the milwaukee beers.
many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport itself, but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright, pretty colors.
high up in the stands, pyrotechnic expert sergio "lucky" ferouch... is readying another spectacular, halftime fireworks display.
his new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
all of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned.
if i were a woman, i'd sure like to be his girlfriend.
walking in the park, hand in hand, wrapping my legs around him, cuddling in the spoon position, our hearts beating in unison, staring into his eyes over our morning coffee--
a game where guys with bad backs and bad knees... can get together and compete on the same field... as guys that are all goosed up on steroids.
but more than anything, isn't this game about gettin' together with your friends and havin' a good time?
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair, not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle.
- hell, those little shits never pay full price anyway !
and squeak scolari crosses the plate again... as the beers have come roaring back since the break.
bob, this is more like the beers team we've seen all season.
the ball coop has used every day of his career is gone, and a time-out has been called as the beers star tries to regroup.
excuse me, driver, do you think you could go any faster ?
as they skate off, all you can think about is a team that conquered adversity, a team that overcame the odds, a team that defied the critics, a team that blah, blah, blah, blah, a team that, uh--
and so, the ideal of sports once again blossomed from a tiny seed, nurtured, as always, by the dreams of the young.
there was a time in america when contests of athletic prowess were a metaphor for the nobility of man.
historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
stadiums and arenas became no more than giant billboards to promote commercial products.
players sold their services to the highest bidder, much like the hired guns of the old west.
after playing for new england, san diego, houston, st. louis, a year for the toronto argonauts, plus one season at the desert inn,
i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami.
the jazz moved to salt lake city where they don't allow music.
the oakland raiders moved to l.a. and then back to oakland.
you know, remer, someday i'm gonna be a big sports star.
you know, remer, someday i'm gonna own a big sports bar.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago this game was played only on driveways.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago those girls were only in grade school.
at a time like this you can't help thinking about guys like john elway, guys who kept coming close and then finally got there.
if coop can make this one, the beers' long wait will be over.
i've been the director of the "dream come true foundation" since october.
the one that grants wishes to sick and dying kids, right?
the sports world was devastated by the passing of ted denslow.
the late beers owner seemed to be the only one surprised by his death.
at this time, i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room, so i can have a private moment with coop.
now that we're alone, coop, there's something i wanna tell you.
this game is made all the more special by the fact it's "free range chicken night".
the beers up by two, but the dealers are only one out.
"if a woman wants a mate to respond, she will reveal to him the secret of a woman's duality.
she will tell him about the interior woman, that one who added to herself makes two. "
- remer, can i talk to you over there real quick?
you know, joey, i've hit my fair share of homeruns, too.
the fans here all wearing yellow ribbons in support of this brave little boy.
and his hero, joe cooper, promising to hit 3 home runs, a promise that could decide between life and death for this brave boy.
until joey grows up, and gets his driver's license and starts going out with girls
and meets the right one and forgets about baseketball altogether goes home, does some push-ups, fucks the sleeve of his favorite jacket.
with last night's victory over boston the beers must beat indianapolis to advance to charlotte, then to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta in the s.w. division east northern, then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup, unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto.
joseph r. cooper, the most loved sports figure in the country... vanished.
elsie melcher, a neighbor who asked not to be identified, says
from milwaukee, wisconsin, it's the denslow cup, where the defending champion, the dallas felons, meet their perennial challengers, the milwaukee beers.
hello, i'm al michaels along with bob costas inviting you to join us here at beers garden for denslow cup v.
we have over 100 million people tuned in to see this game.
many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport, but fascinated by the flickering images and the pretty colors.
when joe cooper discovered that beerswear factory workers were kids, not old enough for prostitution, he personally flew there.
his new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
we are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned.
if i were a woman, i'd like to be his girlfriend, walking in the park, hand in hand, wrapping my legs around him, cuddling in the spoon position and staring into his eyes over our morning coffee.
now we've risen to the highest level, but you're throwing it all away.
if you've forgotten what baseketball means to america, you have only to look at this board, the malaka-laka balance board of trust.
squeak scolari crosses the plate again as the beers have come roaring back since the break.

soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities... in search of greater profits.
the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles where there are no lakes.
its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young.
[ coop ] you know, remer, someday i'm gonna be a big sports star.
dude, i can't believe those ass-wipes fired you... for not shutting off our gas for six weeks.
it was losing the truck that pissed them off the most.
joe bryant, wigm, at the scene where an unusual new driveway game... has captured the imagination of at least one neighborhood.
[ announcer #2 ] an entire league has sprung up around this quirky--
now, you kids with your loud music and your dan fogelberg, your zima, hula hoops, and pac-man video games, don't you see ?
people today have attention spans... that can only be measured in nanoseconds.
with baseketball, we can start fresh, not allow teams to change cities... or players to be traded.
and everybody will get paid the same, just like when i was a kid, and players were treated like--
the beers still behind by three runs... and now down to their last out.
and the pressure on these players has got to be enormous.
[ announcer #2 ] what a game these fans are seeing.
that gentleman, of course, beers owner ted denslow, the father of professional baseketball, along with his lovely new wife, yvette.
bob costas, this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games... in recent memory.
just five years ago, this game was played only on driveways.
you make that shot, or i'm gonna shove your head so far up your fucking ass... you'll have to wear yourself as a hat !
and in the dugout, doug remer giving his teammate some last-minute encouragement.
with the outside shooting of coop and the deadly accuracy of doug remer, what happened out there ?
well, you know, it was a team effort, and i guess it took every player working together to lose this one.
- [ screaming ] - where the dallas felons have defeated the milwaukee beers...
- in denslow cup iv by a score of 13 to 11.
oh, the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids, right ?
well, we prefer to think of them as health-challenged... and survival-impaired.
by all accounts, the late beers owner seemed to be the only one... surprised by his death.
and it appears time just finally ran out... for the old cocksucker.

joining us in the booth this evening, big fan of baseketball, tony nochelino, who plays, as you know, latino cutup scooter... on the new hit comedy series what's the difference ?
airing between recycled junk, starring lisa campbell, and same old crap, featuring teen heartthrob mark swenson.
all part of the great fall lineup... on our network's "who gives a rat's ass" thursdays.
- and, tony, it is great to have you with us.
if a woman wants a mate ho is responsive, she will reveal to him the secret of a woman's duality.
she will tell him about the interior woman, that one who added to herself makes two.
- well, they want to make your dream come true, as long as it doesn't involve, like, a miracle cure or something like that.
well, hell, the guys on death row only get a meal, right ?
how about killing an endangered species, like a bald eagle or a giant panda ?
joey, i don't think that's in the true spirit of the foundation.
i called ya, i called ya, i called ya, but you did not look around, yeah
i pay my, i pay my i pay my money to the welfare line
hey, you know, joey, i've hit my fair share of home runs, too.
that's nice, but coop's gonna hit three home runs for me.
- the fans here, of course, all wearing yellow ribbons... in support of this brave little boy.
[ michaels ] and his hero, joe cooper, promising to hit three home runs, a promise that could mean the difference between life and death...

so, two outs, and doug remer heading for the triple square.
the aliens now coming up with the top of their order.
which, if you're scoring at home, is the same three guys who came up last inning.
it's because of us that i can't bow down to a guy like cain.

[ announcer ] ladies and gentlemen, for your seventh-inning stretch entertainment,
- [ calypso ] - the national baseketball league is proud to present... a salute to our south sea neighbors:
[ p.a. announcer ] ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention now... to the malaka-laka balance board of trust, symbol of brotherhood in many polynesian countries.
assuming the roles of the downtrodden but happy natives, with their good-luck pineapple, your milwaukee beers !

hello, i'm ai michaels along with bob costas inviting you... to join us here at beers garden for denslow cup v.
we have over a hundred million people throughout the world tuned in to see this game.
many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport itself, but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright, pretty colors.
these are not the kind of people to be looked up to or emulated.
[ robert stack ] the severed and mutilated head was postmarked denver.
his new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
all of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned.
if i were a woman, i'd sure like to be his girlfriend.
walking in the park, hand in hand, wrapping my legs around him, cuddling in the spoon position, our hearts beating in unison, staring into his eyes over our morning coffee--
now we've risen to the highest level, but you're throwin' it all away !
if you've forgotten what baseketball means to america, you have only to look at this board-- the malaka-laka balance board of trust.
i guess that's why it kills me to see you like this.
if we can't be friends, then the heart and soul are out of this game.
we have sullied the waters of the lagoon of peace !
i'm begging you, for the love of our caribbean brothers, dudes, stop this madness !
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair, not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle.
- hell, those little shits never pay full price anyway !
when's the last time you made a home run without la-z-boy ?
[ costas ] al, we have seen some classic denslow cup battles in the past, but i can't remember one that ever rivaled... the drama and excitement of this one.
as they skate off, all you can think about is a team that conquered adversity, a team that overcame the odds, a team that defied the critics, a team that blah, blah, blah, blah, a team that, uh--
[ narrator ] and so, the ideal of sports once again blossomed from a tiny seed, nurtured, as always, by the dreams of the young.
there was a time in america when contests of athletic prowess were a metaphor for the nobility of man.
historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
the ideal of sportsmanship began to take a back seat to excessive celebration.
the athletes caring less about executing the play than planning the vulgar grandstanding that inevitably followed even the most pedestrian of accomplishments.
soon it was commonplace for entire teams to change cities in search of greater profits.
the minneapolis lakers moved to los angeles, where there are no lakes.
fist fighting and brawling permeated every sport, overshadowing any athletic competition.
as the problems mounted, the fans became less and less interested.
its seed merely lay dormant in the dreams of the young.
you know, remer, someday i'm going to be a big sports star.
i don't want to go to a party with a bunch of losers from high school.
but, dude, this is brittany kaiser's house, and i really, really want to fuck her.
dude, i can't believe those asswipes fired you for not shutting off our gas for six weeks.
it was losing the truck that pissed them off the most.
now, you kids with your loud music and your dan fogelberg, your zima hula hoops and pac man video games, don't you see?
people today have attention spans that can only be measured in nanoseconds.
to do it all again, i guess i'll have to wait until then
if i get drunk, well, the better i'll understand my baby
coop is heading for the triple square, and bob costas, this has to be one of the most exciting baseketball games in recent memory.
hard to believe that just five years ago this game was played only on driveways.
and it's hard to believe, just 5 years ago, those girls were only in grade school.
so coop at the triple line, and jansen sets up for the psyche out.
you either go out there and make that shot, or i'm going to shove your head so far up your fucking ass, you have to wear yourself as a hat!
and in the dugout, doug remer giving his teammate some last-minute encouragement.
it certainly does seem to be raining shit on joe cooper right now.
on paper, the beers had the far superior team with the outside shooting of coop and the deadly accuracy of doug remer.
i've been the director of the dream come true foundation since october.
oh, the ones that grant wishes to sick and dying kids, right?
and on a sad note, the sports world was devastated tonight by the passing of ted denslow.
by all accounts, the late beers owner seemed to be the only one surprised by his death.
i want you to know i had nothing but respect for your late husband.
unfortunately, he was the one person who stood in the way of making any kind of changes in baseketball that might increase the owner's profits.
maybe we could, uh, lay some carpet, if you know what i mean.
at this time, i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room, so i can have a private moment with coop.
now that we're alone, coop, there's something i wanna tell you.
remember when you had the crabs, and the only thing that made you feel better was this lotion?
but until we allow teams to move cities and players to change teams and take advantage of lucrative corporate tie-ins,
i'm afraid you and your colleagues are going to have to continue working for...
how about killing an endangered species, like a bald eagle or a giant panda?
well, joey, i don't think that's in the true spirit of the foundation.
the fans here, of course, all wearing yellow ribbons in support of this brave little boy.
and his hero, joe cooper, promising to hit three home runs, a promise that could mean the difference between life and death for this brave little boy.
two for two with a walk, four runs batted in, and he's already hit two home runs tonight.
and you have to wonder just what charlie hough must be thinking as reggie steps into the box here in the eighth.
well, when you weren't at the hospital, i came right over.
apparently, there was some sort of terrorist attack on the post-op ward.
top of the seventh, and those cheers you're hearing are from the nearly 15,000 on hand here for anal probe night.
so, two outs, and doug remer heading for the triple square.
with the first seven months of the baseketball post-season out of the way, the playoff picture is now starting to emerge.
so, with last night's victory over boston, next week the beers must beat indianapolis in order to advance to charlotte.
that's in an effort to reduce their magic number to three.
right, and then, the beers can advance to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
so, if the beers beat detroit, and denver beats atlanta in the american southwestern division east northern, then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup, unless baltimore can upset buffalo and charlotte ties toronto.
then oakland would play la and pittsburgh in a blind choice round-robin.
according to angelique bones, a nosy bitch who lives up the street, he took with him only a toothbrush, a wallet, a steamer trunk and a plane ticket to calcutta.
police theorize several possible scenarios of what happened to the man affectionately known to the world as "coop."

now we've risen to the highest level, but you're throwing it all away!
if you've forgotten what baseketball means to america, you have only to look at this board, the malakalaka balance board of trust.
i guess that's why it kills me to see you like this.
if we can't be friends, then the heart and soul are out of this game.
bob, this has to be the most spectacular extravaganza i have ever seen!
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair, not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle.
and squeak scolari crosses the plate again as the beers have come roaring back since the break.
bob, this is more like the beers team we've seen all season.
the ball coop has used every day of his career is gone, and a time-out has been called as the beers star tries to regroup.
excuse me, driver, do you think you could go any faster?
there was a time in america when contests of athletic prowess were a metaphor for the nobility of man.
historic moments, forged by the love of the game, celebrated the human potential to achieve excellence.
stadiums and arenas became no more than giant billboards to promote commercial products.
players sold their services to the highest bidder, much like the hired guns of the old west.
after playing for new england, san diego, houston, st. louis, a year for the toronto argonauts, plus one season at the desert inn,
i'm happy to finally play here in the fine city of miami.
the jazz moved to salt lake city where they don't allow music.
the oakland raiders moved to l.a. and then back to oakland.
you know, remer, someday i'm gonna be a big sports star.
you know, remer, someday i'm gonna own a big sports bar.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago this game was played only on driveways.
hard to believe that just 5 years ago those girls were only in grade school.
at a time like this you can't help thinking about guys like john elway, guys who kept coming close and then finally got there.
if coop can make this one, the beers' long wait will be over.
i've been the director of the "dream come true foundation" since october.
the one that grants wishes to sick and dying kids, right?
the sports world was devastated by the passing of ted denslow.
the late beers owner seemed to be the only one surprised by his death.
at this time, i'd like to ask everyone to leave the room, so i can have a private moment with coop.
now that we're alone, coop, there's something i wanna tell you.
this game is made all the more special by the fact it's "free range chicken night".
the beers up by two, but the dealers are only one out.
"if a woman wants a mate to respond, she will reveal to him the secret of a woman's duality.
she will tell him about the interior woman, that one who added to herself makes two. "
- remer, can i talk to you over there real quick?
you know, joey, i've hit my fair share of homeruns, too.
the fans here all wearing yellow ribbons in support of this brave little boy.
and his hero, joe cooper, promising to hit 3 home runs, a promise that could decide between life and death for this brave boy.
until joey grows up, and gets his driver's license and starts going out with girls
and meets the right one and forgets about baseketball altogether goes home, does some push-ups, fucks the sleeve of his favorite jacket.
with last night's victory over boston the beers must beat indianapolis to advance to charlotte, then to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta in the s.w. division east northern, then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup, unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto.
joseph r. cooper, the most loved sports figure in the country... vanished.
elsie melcher, a neighbor who asked not to be identified, says

[ p.a. announcer ] representing their white colonial oppressors, the dallas felons !
and now, let's all join our caribbean brothers... in the ceremonial south sea handshake above the lagoon of peace.

somebody get this man a hot dog ! you're absolutely right, jim.
ted denslow was a hero because his vision brought baseketball... from neighborhood driveways into big arenas, but more importantly, into the hearts and tvs of america.

- yes ! go, beers ! hey, smitz, you wanna see a scary face ? yeah !
so with last night's victory over boston, next week the beers must beat indianapolis... to advance to charlotte-- that's in an effort to reduce their magic number to three.
right, and the beers can advance to the national eastern division north to play tampa.
so, if the beers beat detroit and denver beats atlanta... in the american southwestern division east northern, then milwaukee goes to the denslow cup, unless baltimore upsets buffalo and charlotte ties toronto.
then oakland would play l.a. and pittsburgh in a blind choice round-robin.
goddamn it, remer, i told you this was gonna happen, didn't i ?
if you would have agreed to cain's changes it never would have gotten this far !
joseph r. cooper, perhaps the most loved sports figure in the country-- vanished.
according to mrs. elsie melcher, a neighbor who asked not to be identified,
here's a photograph of joe cooper taken just days before his disappearance.
here's a computer-enhanced simulation of what he might look like today.
from milwaukee, wisconsin, on the shores of lake michigan, it's the denslow cup, where the defending champion dallas felons... meet their perennial challengers the milwaukee beers.
hello, i'm ai michaels along with bob costas inviting you... to join us here at beers garden for denslow cup v.
we have over a hundred million people throughout the world tuned in to see this game.
many of them, of course, with no understanding of the sport itself, but nonetheless fascinated by the flickering images and the bright, pretty colors.
when joe cooper discovered that the workers in the beerswear factory were youngsters, not even old enough for prostitution, he personally flew to calcutta.
his new, all-adult workforce now makes a decent wage, enjoys full medical benefits and in-house child care.
all of us here are glad that such a terrific human being like joe cooper has returned.
if i were a woman, i'd sure like to be his girlfriend.
ladies and gentlemen, please direct your attention now... to the malaka-laka balance board of trust, symbol of brotherhood in many polynesian countries.
assuming the roles of the downtrodden but happy natives, with their good-luck pineapple, your milwaukee beers !
now we've risen to the highest level, but you're throwin' it all away !
if you've forgotten what baseketball means to america, you have only to look at this board-- the malaka-laka balance board of trust.
i guess that's why it kills me to see you like this.
if we can't be friends, then the heart and soul are out of this game.
we have sullied the waters of the lagoon of peace !
i'm begging you, for the love of our caribbean brothers, dudes, stop this madness !
bob, this has to be the most spectacular extravaganza i have ever seen !
you can cram three seats into the space it takes for one wheelchair, not to mention the wasted space it takes for the oxygen bottle.
and squeak scolari crosses the plate again... as the beers have come roaring back since the break.
bob, this is more like the beers team we've seen all season.
when's the last time you made a home run without la-z-boy ?
al, we have seen some classic denslow cup battles in the past, but i can't remember one that ever rivaled... the drama and excitement of this one.
my gourmet club is holding elections to see who will win this year's golden apron...
wait, i can see i'm gonna need a hanky for this.
someone proposed that instead of lecture, this year's finalists should compete by hosting dinner parties in their homes.
so why don't you invite them all over and cook them a meal?
maybe chef marcel can make your truffles look like little meteors zooming around the plate.
we make fun of him, but every now and then he has a fantastic idea.
oh, yes, that should send the seal mobile racing over here.
and just how do you suggest that we dispose of a dead seal?
i have arranged a small meteor shower for our entertainment this evening.
so feel free to claim your spots now on the observation deck.
the carlston's were on there way to take possession of the castle.
that they had inherited after the death of an aged uncle.
i don't get it, i filled the tank up this morning.
i don't mind checking, i know a thing or two about cars.
i told you that i came here to set my brother free!
i've used my power to staunch the wound but you will still have a scar.
the warmth that connects human lives together through their hearts is connected to me as well.
no wonder i could feel human warmth from half of you.
sealed demon in my left hand, lend me your strength and show your power now!
however, he will be the emissary of justice who came from the very depths of hell in order to protect us.
there's a rumor that a worker went missing during the renovation of our school!
if i'm not mistaken, he was buried alive in the wall!
since the spirit moves within the walls, if we do this,
when it appears and the wall starts swelling these cans will ring
the universe and the earth, give me the power to defeat evil and bring justice!
demon sealed in my left hand, show me your true power!
demon sealed in my left hand, show me your true power!
however, he will be the emissary of justice who came from the very depths of hell in order to protect us.
in any event, let's go check out the town where bukimi-chan used to live.
maybe we can find out the reason why she's still around.
the universe and the earth, give me the power to defeat evil and bring justice!
demon sealed in my left hand, show me your true power!
listen, the offside is the play when passing the ball when it is in your opponents control.
position the offside to a place that won't disturb other players and then enter the offside position.
well, even if he's good at just one thing he's still useful, i suppose.
i sold my soul to the devil, the price was cheap.
until i knock off this rock, i don't get to eat.
sometimes it's like that's the only reason why i hustle, to step on toes, strong-arm and show a little muscle.
so much more, the user need only apply the drug externally on the skin to be affected.
us dea fears the drug is on its way to this country via various conduits in jamaica and throughout the west indies.
my crib was out in st. albans still, not too far from where we grew up, right by the vet's hospital.
i mean, it's not iike tommy's crib or nothing but i iove living around the way.
it seem like that's all you wanna talk about is drugs.
i got other shit going on in my life, though, you know?
black was feeling real hot about not getting the same cut as me.
on the real, i'm feeling a lot of motherfucking heat off that couch.
i heard the nigga was trying to act like he wanted to stick sincere or some shit.
bunds hated to be fucked with but he really hated when niggas fucked with me even worse.
he about the only nigga i know that still fucking drink 40 ounces man like it's the fucking '80s, man.
every time you turn around, this nigga got a bottle to his mouth like a baby bottle.
you come into my house, don't you ever bring scare business to me.
you're looking at the toughest ras clot jamaican in the united states ofamerica.
he been calling here every fucking 1 5 minutes for the last two hours.
on top of it, i think he's camped out around the corner somewhere.
i thought it might be some beef with kisha or something.
but when i seen how shook he was, i knew it was something else.
as long as he knew how to control niggas' minds, he could make shit happen anywhere.
learn how to put the motherfuckin' weed in the bags first.
i mean, we all have knowledge of self but still, we was actin' like fuckin' idiots.
now, more than ever, i couid see error in our ways.
we'll do everything in our power to give you all the help that's necessary.
but be warned, we've got a lot of operatives in place.
meanwhile, knowledge and shameek started scheming on how they was gonna find bundy, you know, for a little payback visit.
knowledge knew where kisha lived, so he knew tommy wouldn't be far behind.
oddly enough, the more tommy got into character the more, you know, the truth was like the light.
no matter what clouds are true, eventually the sun will come out and you cannot stop the sun from shining.
i hope everything is right with you and the minister as well, all right?
what you want me to do with the car and all that?
you gotta promise me that you'll just say, "fuck this shit" and leave it alone.
you gotta swear that you will not go lookin' for them.
i knew you were coming so i sent everyone away because i believed my final moment was at hand.
before you pull that trigger and take my life i would like the chance to tell you some things perhaps to think about after i am gone.
black, he just was a dumbass nigga wich used to smoke trees...
i knew he was a fuckin problem as soon as knowledge put it down.
as long as he knew how control nigga's minds... he can make shit happen anywhere.
first learn how to put the weed in a bag and then get money.
he had to study and really be a part of it.
cause it wasn't be easy to get close to the minister.
why you don't get your stinky ass out of my motherfuckin house... and take out your broke-ass niggas with you?
we're just here lookin for this nigga, hoping maybe since... can tell us where he is.
i don't feel a need to play the whole part in the entire movement.
but, if you just raise your family right, if i just live righteously, i be aight...
i hope everything is right with you and the minister as well.
what you wan' me do with the car and all that?
you and i... are just a small part of god's plan.
the evil men of this world have applied every method possible... to deceive its occupants.
i sold my soul to the devil, the price was cheap.
it was cold on this level, it was twice as deep.
sometimes it's like that's the only reason why i hustle, to step on toes, strong-arm and show a little muscle.
ain't no real dough, that's why a nigga feels so frustrated.
he was just some dumb-ass nigga we used to smoke trees with and crackjokes on.
i knew he was a fuckin' problem as soon as knowledge put him down.
it's reported that this heroin is dramatically more potent than previous forms of the drug.
so much more, the user need only apply the drug externally on the skin to be affected.
wise and lakid, they wanted to be like us so bad.
they was too young, but bunds kept these little niggas around all the time, man.
i'm up in the motherfucking booze store motherfucking news flash came on showing the whole shit.
you know we had to give it to a couple of security guards in the club.
you're looking at the toughest ras clot jamaican in the united states ofamerica.
i run shit, i kill for nothing and i made lots of money.
i know you don't really know me that well and all.
i hate to burden you, but... lt's not a burden. lt's cool.
remember, i said i came down here to check niggas in the whole notch especially you, son.
i brought a present and the whole shit from my man.
the more and more i was reading the minister's book, the more i realized how fucked up our whole thought process was.
i mean, we all have knowledge of self but still, we was actin' like fuckin' idiots.
now, more than ever, i couid see error in our ways.
it seemed time had flipped shit to a new fuckin' page.
when i finally got to ox house, yo, there was cops everywhere.
i seen that nigga laid out, the fuckin' top dog with his throat slit from ear to ear.
but he went around the way to lay at his stepmom's crib and get his plans together.
and that's where life as he knew it came to an end.
but be warned, we've got a lot of operatives in place.
if you show any weakness or if you betray us, it'll be your resignation.
he had to study and really be a part of it 'cause it wasn't gonna be easy to get close to the minister.
meanwhile, knowledge and shameek started scheming on how they was gonna find bundy, you know, for a little payback visit.
knowledge knew where kisha lived, so he knew tommy wouldn't be far behind.
oddly enough, the more tommy got into character the more, you know, the truth was like the light.
no matter what clouds are true, eventually the sun will come out and you cannot stop the sun from shining.
for the first time the sun was finally shining' on bundy.
now, remember, the dope has to be secured in that office.
it's extremely important that he's found with shit on the premises.
you and i are just a small part of god's plan.
the evil men of this world have applied every method possible to deceive its occupants

"he is innocent and oblivious. i've done him a favour by accepting him"

we live once, we die once, we get married once and love...
and we remind these stubborn weak men that bonds of the heart are based on feelings not principles.

you gave this to tina when she was beginning a new life.
today you are going to begin a new life and i am sure, you and rahul will be happy.

i even went to her son adi's boarding school ... pretending to be his dad
my uncle assigned her the responsibility ... of finding me a suitable bride
"so, no matter what i do, he won't look at me"
even if he does look at me... he'ii never smile at me

mummy says that by praying grandma will get impressed and will leave the big house for us in the will.
a mother is someone who makes us realise how good we are there is no one better than us.
her happiness is in our laughter and sorrow in our sorrow.
today you are a big girl and you will be able to understand what i have to tell you.
today, i will tell you a story about your father, me and anjali.
and the girls are wondering what the boys are staring at and that is why even they are staring at you.
and look if you have any problems just come to me or to rahul.
if he can't teach her then how will he teach us and you shut up.
so, tina, you will sing a song in hindi and fast because we don't have much time.
the students who were going to perform today have recorded a tape of their rehearsals.
i'll play that tape and you just have to move your lips.
moonlit sky, you and me, hello mr. how do you do?
anjali, you don't have any concern forthe reputation of your college?
"i know not, this drunken stupor of love that's consuming me?"
"no one knows, why one loses one's peace, when in love"
i hope i can get myself to say this to her...
i wanted to say it to her so often but couldn't get the courage and whenever i meet her i decide to, but... somehow...
"the heart cried and the eyes welled up there's nothing more left to say"
"you did not remember me there's nothing more left to say"
i neverthought that my daughterwould marry out of compromise and not love
i'm your mother and i want you to be happy too.
and we remind these stubborn weak men that bonds of the heart are based on feelings not principles.
but these bonds are created by telling the other person about one's inner feelings.
but guruji said that there is no auspicious date before december...
mother, dates don't bring happiness, destiny does and no one can change that.
how can i come between this love that was never mine in the first place?
and anyway, someone told me that i'm so handsome, i can get anyone.
i am leaving these 8 letters for her 1 each of her 1st 8 birthdays.
these letters have everything that i want to tell my daughter
my dear if you don't pay attention to prayer what will you teach your children.
the way we think and the things we say have a deep impact on our children.
papa says prayers will keep god happy and he will protect us.
mummy says that by praying grandma will get impressed and will leave the big house for us in the will.
a mother is someone who makes us realise how good we are, there is no one better than us.
her happiness is in our laughter and sorrow in our sorrow.
today you are a big girl and you will be able to understand what i have to tell you.
today, i will tell you a story about your father, me and anjali.
you know i just got back from london and haven't had the time to unpack.
sir, it's tina's first day here, she's just gotten back from london and hasn't had the time to unpack.
"l know not, this drunken stupor of love that's consuming me?"
"no one knows, why one loses one's peace, when in love"
somewhere hidden in this deep friendship is deep love and i don't want to come in the way of this love.
the whole college knows that rahul and anjali are just friends and nothing else.
i neverthought i'd say this to someone, but i really love you.
i hope i can get myself to say this to her... i wanted to say it to her so often but couldn't get the courage and whenever i meet her i decide to, but... somehow...
"you did not remember me, there's nothing more left to say"
"the heart cried and the eyes welled up there's nothing more left to say"
"you did not remember me there's nothing more left to say"
"the heart cried and the eyes welled up there's nothing more left to say"
it is said that this game gets matters of the heart to the fore.
i will say a word and you have to say the first word that comes to your mind.
"your love has something to say will you listen to my heart!"
"he is innocent and oblivious. i've done him a favour by accepting him"
tell your friend... lf she doesn't marry me in december... i'll...marry this basketball.
we live once, we die once, we get married once and love ...
and we remind these stubborn weak men that bonds of the heart are based on feelings not principles.
but these bonds are created by telling the other person about one's inner feelings.
you gave this to tina when she was beginning a new life.
today you are going to begin a new life and i am sure, you and rahul start preparing forthe wedding.
how can i come between this love that was never mine in the first place?
and anyway, someone told me that i'm so handsome, i can get anyone.
i want herto be able to answer all these questions herself.

but a home based on a compromise is a house, not a home.
" those were strange times when you were so close "
" where are you lost, i'm right here if only you would look "
they make principles but don't realise that no principle can override the heart.
and we remind these stubborn weak men that bonds of the heart are based on feelings not principles.
you gave this to tina when she was beginning a new life.
today you are going to begin a new life and i am sure, you and rahul start preparing forthe wedding.
l'll drag you to the marriage pandal, i told you so didn't i?
you know, i always wanted to see that love in your eyes that i have in mine.
i want herto be able to answer all these questions herself.
i am leaving these 8 letters for her 1 each of her 1st 8 birthdays.
mummy says that by praying grandma will get impressed and will leave the big house for us in the will.
prayer... yes, my favourite actress's name is puja and even my best friend's name is puja.
a mother is someone who loves us so much, that we sometimes can't understand it.
a mother is someone who makes us realise how good we are, there is no one better than us.

"either i was insane earlier or i've just become so. "
"dreamy eyes and unkempt hair, what have you done to yourself. "
actually my dad used to say that don't tell this to anyone at college.
he says that a man should bow to 3 women to mom-to one's mother, to the goddess durga... and...
isn't this the novel where the butler murders the married couple?
why are you wasting yourtime reading such a thick book, ask me!
somewhere hidden in this deep friendship is deep love and i don't want to come in the way of this love.
the whole college knows that rahul and anjali are just friends and nothing else.
i neverthought i'd say this to someone, but i really love you.

i'm sorry. i had promised anjali that i would not give her address to anyone.
we were hopeful that... i understand sir, but i made a promise to anjali.
i neverthought that my daughterwould marry out of compromise and not love i'm your mother and i want you to be happy too.

for this company to survive, we will hire an accounting agency.
it is unavoidable to ask you all to leave this company.
tell yourself that you support... the safety of building and its people.
you are older, your memory maybe half or a third, you have to work harder.
i wished the cable to break and let us fall together.
when i came home and told this to my husband, he got very angry.
remember, when we went to a store, tommy must have wanted a toy, he suddenly started hollering.
so at the cashier, you stated "ai-ai", everyone around was shocked, but you had to keep on dancing and singing with all might.
if g is 3500kg per hour, in boiler at pressure of 5kg per cm2, what is the correct scale evaporation?

look, doc, i was a little rough on you back there, but...
you want patrick back just as much as his father does.
i was going to his room in the night to check on him.
i standed over him, until my eyes were adjusted to the dark.
look, i know that you think about patrick like he was your own son.
and you probably saw some pretty horrible things happened to children when you worked for the fbi.
you are afraid the same thing is going to happen to him.
but i swear to you all that i want to do is to help this boy.
yes, i am sorry that i had to lie to you before.
but i knew that the pharmaceuticals company would send their lawyers after me.
"dear parents, in an effort to ease congestion while the city completes roadwork at the school,"
"pickup for the students will be moved from south end of the school to the north,"

[man #2] i need a chest tube and a setup tray.
[woman on p.a.] dr. franklin, please call the pharmacist on extension 23.
but he's going to be in that bed for at least two more weeks.
look, doc, i was a little rough on you back there, but-
when i was a boy, i was stolen from my parents.
i can help you get patrick back... but you're going to have to trust me.
- you've opened the school to a number of disadvantaged students.
i'm sorry if i seem a little surprised to see you-
i hate myself for siding with raines, but the creep's got a point.
this emotional umbilical you have with jarod is... becoming a problem.
i'd stand over him until my eyes adjusted to the dark.
and when i'd see him breathe, i'd know he was okay.
look, i know that you think about patrick like he was your own son.

heart rate, blood pressure, pulse ox, time of magnesium injection central line placed, pacemaker captured.
after seeing your m and m on dr. swanson last year i thought it best to be well-prepared.
and i'm going to make a flap, two centimeters from where i insert the device.
i'll cut through the muscle and pericranium so the flap will come right off the skull.
thank you, but i'm not looking to you for defense of my actions.
in fact, i feel that m and m has become a forum to place blame cover up mistakes, or be grateful that there's not a lawsuit.
i would argue that, actually, we should embrace our mistakes and learn from them to improve the system.
i erred not because i was untrained or incompetent but because i was exhausted, having been up for 36 hours.
if you disagree with me, why don't you ask yourself next time you fly:
do you really want that man in the control room to be on his 36th hour?
i dropped it down a drain pipe when i got on my bike.
none of this would've happened if that car hadn't hit me.
but why don't we just put it down to faulty construction?
a casual relationship has to grow into something or it dies.

so i guess you guys tried every other option for patrick?
we've done the hearing aids, intensive oral training, speech training looked into special teachers, special schools.

you are a cop, but you always forget your gun, that means, you are not armed.
if you are not armed, why not work as a security guard?
if you want to make a better living in hong kong, you should try your best to find a rich boyfriend.
then, you are able to spend as much money as you want.
i've been a cop for 20 years, my intuition hasn't come wrong.
sure you can't feel anything, you just stick to the double mopping.
ten years ago, a tragic massacre happened in guangzhou, her family, total 8 were killed, she is the only one left.
she went crazy by witnessing it and was sent to lunatic asylum.
i worry that you'd ask me to assist your investigation any time you like.
and you want me to witness in court... and, some magazines... may interview me... i just took you five hundred, it's wasting my time!
or i could erm... ..drop my fee... if you'll join me for some erm...ale tonight.
is it just a cup of ale you want my sister to raise, eh?
but open the gates again and bid them all welcome, brother prior.
you think i should line up with the cripples and touch the holy relics.
i think it's a pity, and i'll put it no stronger than that.
but i think it's a pity you let all the pilgrims just walk out of the room.
i should have kept them locked up here where they had no right to be?
given there may be a murderer among them, it could have been a good idea.
i'm sure you'll agree, it is unusual for someone to be walking around with a dead body trussed up in a leather sack.
but before i can tell you more... ..i'll have to examine him more closely.
father, will you agree with me, this corpse must be buried?
father...we might have a murderer among us here in the abbey.
from the cold, dead scalp of st matthew of harrogate... (pilgrims gasp)
..who, as we all know, was struck down by the evil lord tarristock as he tried to defend the little children of his mistress.
it confirms that this could have been enough to kill the man.
from a blow to the head which might have been an accident.
in the meantime, it is essential that all the pilgrims should remain within the abbey walls.
must we live in fear of our lives until brother cadfael is...done?
the pilgrims must go out with st winifred when her reliquary is carried from the abbey on cripples' day.
if we prevent pilgrims from travelling, they cease to be pilgrims.
a final pilgrimage, perhaps, forced upon him by those that were carrying him.
he might, of course, have been alive when he started out and then killed on the way.
oh, perhaps, but... why carry a whole body round with you?
i mean, he could have boiled it down before he got here.
i think his legs are as strong as yours or mine.
i think he attacked luc... because he's afraid that luc is going to take you away from him.
it's because you look the way you do... ... vash the stampede.
your very existence seems to cause me a measure of irritation.
this way, you can see to the bodies of your friends.
if you are indeed closer than family, you must give them a proper burial.
if i was so inclined i could have killed you three times.
you like to drop in out of nowhere and say things to stir people up.
i can't believe i was beaten by that featherbrain of a man!
mr. vash, i want an explanation of exactly what went on here.
a fragment of memory lost in the ravine between life and death...
is it something which will point the way to spiritual awareness?
i don't mind paying the rent, but you could do some shopping.
if kristy wasn't in town, i'd kick this bitch out right now.
he has stolen a valuable object from a foreign lady with the excuse, to want to repair it.
not even a private would have been fallen so deep, like officer tolstoi did!

i ask every night to god its a bit of wisdom,
and prevent you to commit the same mistake that russian cadets there 20 years.
your mother tried to unravel the mysteries this country huge and incomprehensible.
russia can steal, cheat, but the word of no more value the most official seal.
on the ice half- naked men to thrash before asking forgiveness.
they go to war singing, a wedding in tears and everything is taken seriously.
at first, it is true, my pay will be modest and my family is not rich.
nothing allows me to start a family but if i could have hoped one day win your hand and heart,
he persuaded him to postpone punishment, no other younger can not sing figaro.
the grand duke was there and an annulment scandal outside the walls of the school.
do not understand, is to be blind as was jane for years.
she was in love for the first time, convinced it was forever, and believed have explained everything to andrey.
how this boy out of jealousy hit me me, his general public with a bow?
i may look silly but if you want it all it will tell how you seduced and destroyed.
jane rolled on a path of siberia without knowing where she was going or what she was doing there.
she knew only all that remained to him, that was his secret,
hey, isn't it bad for you to drink it in one shot, annie?
you coming back to life is worse on me than this glass.
i am very sorry, but that is a 44-ounce cup, and the largest coffee cup is 20 ounces.
therefore, i must charge you... 99 cents, plus tax-- the price of a large fountain drink.
i love you, and... you care more about your career than you care about me.
casey, i do love you... but you are boring the shit out of me.
you know what they did in ancient rome... when a visitor violated somebody's hospitality?
they cut off his dick and they nailed it to the fucking gate!
i had a little business to finish up in houston, and i wanted to tell you adios face to face.
i want you to pedal your ass back here, pick up your shit... get the fuck out of my house.
i am having a little bit of trouble... coming up with reasons not to blow the back of your fucking head off!
you're not sounding like that happy little suburbanite i saw this morning.

some jamaican showed up here, and he tried to kill me.
and now one of your bimbos is sitting in my living room!
- he broke jimmy's arm-- with a ten-pound ball peen hammer.
three years ago lesterjames, a.k.a. ballpeen, was a big, stud motherfucker.
he fucked her every way you can think of and then some.
finally, he gets ready to go again, and he figures... he'd really degrade this bitch and make her blow him.
the problem is, a story like that gets around, you know how it is.
so to combat this, anytime he even heard anybody talk about it, he'd use this fuckin' hammer on them.
- over the years, this kind of shit gets out of control.
so one day, ballpeen is late for a meeting, and jimmy made the mistake of asking if he'd been jerking off.
so, i know how much room even my white-boy dick... takes up in a bitch's mouth, right.
my question... is how the hell this little bitch... got this big, nigger dick in her mouth... chomped it off all in one bite?
being married, you should fucking know how much women hate that question.
but being a typical male, you ignore your better judgment... and ask anyway, huh?
i should just do your wife a favor and blow your head off.
it's as if every mood swing can be written off as...
there will come a time... when even you can't handle it anymore.
you'll pack it up or you'll put a bullet... in that pretty little head of yours.
i hope i didn't interrupt anything too romantic for you, but that whore could go all day long.
besides, i was getting tired sitting down in the cab of my truck.
a bunch of mexicans sitting around this big wooden vat... chewing on agave, right?
they do this days and days spitting into this giant vat.
i ain't got nothing better to do... while i wait here for my old friend, nick.
just so you know, i ain't going to let you bleed to death.
if you hadn't brought your friends along... what would i have done with my day, man?
i'd a missed out on being beaten and raped, abused, tied up, generally fucked up.
why don't we... handle our business like a couple of grown-ups.
i mean, casey, you know i didn't pop over here... for some social visit.
i am very sorry, but that is a 44-ounce cup, and the largest coffee cup is 20 ounces.
therefore, i must charge you 99 cents, plus tax, the price of a large fountain drink.
- every night, alone, i might add and you sit here, and you study for hours.
and every night i wait on you, and you don't even notice me.

three years ago "lester james", a.k.a. ballpeen, was a big, stud motherfucker.
had a stable of bitches he fucked on a regular basis, but every couple weeks...
she could have gnawed on it for a while, but -
- i don't think there's a motherfucker in here let that happen.
but being a typical male, you ignore your better judgment and ask anyway, huh?
i should just do your wife a favor and blow your head off.
they do this days and days spitting into this giant vat.
then when it's full, then they leave that there to ferment.
if you hadn't brought your friends along what would i have done with my day, man?
i'd a missed out on being beaten and raped, abused, tied up, generally fucked up.
well, i'll tell you something, casey, if i was you, -
- i'd clean up this mess, because your wife's going to come home and she's not going to be very happy.
i am humbly sorry, but you must pay 99 cents plus tax... for that cup.
just pay the bitch the $1.08... and let's get the fuck out of here.
i love you, and... you care more about your career than you care about me.
casey, i do love you... but you are boring the shit out of me.
i knew that you would have very little enthusiasm for this deal.

i'm here to help you stay clearheaded, should you need me.
how effective am i going to be when i'm concentrating on the hand swish?
how focused will i be if i worry about a seizure?
any woman who lets a strange man finger her wattle has a problem.

so all i'm saying is that when you fall in love... the emptiness drifts away... because you find something to live for... each other.
and the way i've seen you two... looking into each other's eyes all day long...
you know, that information... might have been a little more useful to me yesterday.
i've been talking to my friends the last couple of days...
i've been thinking about what happened to you... and it's all for the best.
i know you were in love and everything... but that wears off.
you can just look at a couple... and you can tell right away... they're gonna stay together forever.
like donald and ivana... and woody and mia... and burt and loni.
you've just inspired me to hire a d.j... so thank you.
good luck finding a d.j. who can move and shake like this.
i always just envisioned the right one... being someone i could see myself growing old with.
and glenn will be a really good-looking older man... like blake carrington.
i say that it's ok for it to be an open-mouth kiss.
and i say that it's the type of occasion... where people dress up, so it's not appropriate.
why do you think you'd be a good hire for this bank?
i'm ready to work hard... and when i put my mind to something, i go all the way.
i thought that teaching was a big part of your life.
it was, but now i'm doing some stuff... to better my situation.
i just don't know if he's the right guy for me.
and i've been spending a lot of time... with this other man, robbie hart.
she went to your house... to tell you she was falling for you... and linda answered the door in her underwear.
she was so upset... she and glenn jumped a plane to vegas.
and the way i've seen you two... looking into each other's eyes all day long...
i can tell that you're gonna live for each other... for the rest of your lives.
now on behalf of mr. and mrs. harold veltri... you guys have a nice dinner.
george stitzer's gonna take over on lead vocals... so take it away, george.
i let him look at my boobs at the christmas party.
not my finest half-hour... but it's been a pleasant working environment ever since.
actually, i don't know how serious the guy is... who gave this to me.
i feel like i'm doomed to wander the planet alone forever.
you're going to blow everybody away... at your fiftieth anniversary party.
if i sing to frank without making any mistakes... he would know how hard i've worked... and how much i still love him after all these years.
you know, that information... might have been a little more useful to me yesterday.
i've been talking to my friends the last couple of days...
if we get a second alone, we usually go to sleep.
if it's a special occasion... she might do this exotic dance for me.

living in your sister's basement with five kids... while you're off every weekend doing wedding gigs... at a whopping 60 bucks a pop?
once again... things that could have been brought to my attention... yesterday!
if we get a second alone, we usually go to sleep.
if it's a special occasion... she might do this exotic dance for me.
now that he's gone to the city to get a real job... he doesn't have time to give me lessons.
why do you think you'd be a good hire for this bank?
i know you got some little crush on her... but you gotta face the facts.
she'd rather go to bed with a real man... not some poor singing orphan.
i realized i was wrong... and i want to take care of you for good.
i can learn to deal with the fact... that you're a wedding singer and not a rock star.
one of our first-class passengers... would like to sing you a song... inspired by one of our coach passengers.
and since we let our first-class passengers... do pretty much whatever they want, here he is.
and the way i've seen you two looking into each other's eyes all day long...
i can tell that you're gonna live for each other... for the rest of your lives.
ok, well, now on behalf of mr. and mrs. harold veltri... you guys have a nice dinner.
george stitzer here's gonna take over on lead vocals... so take it away, george.
always takes them at least three weeks... to realize they shouldn't date anyone at work.
for some reason, you like being the guy... that helps them realize that, don't you?
oh, you're such a sweet boy... letting an old woman pay you with meatballs.
oh, yeah, well, they taste so good... it's like i'm ripping you off, rosie.
you guys are off to a great start, don't you think?
i mean, cindy showed up... so, right away, scott, you got to be pretty psyched, right?
now let's cut the stupid cake... because i know the fat guy's going to have a heart attack... if we don't eat again soon.
and while we do that, here's a little mood music for you.
you see, me and your sister, we used to be wild.
she was very adventurous... and we got into some crazy shit, but now the thrill is gone.
i just would not want to do that in a church... in front of god and all of our relatives.
i mean, it would gross them out to see me like...
well, i think i'm starting to get the hang of it.
yeah, she's starting to scare less and less people when she sings.

he's been down in the basement since it happened... five days now.
i think he's having some kind of a mental situation... you know, an episode or something.
i mean, cindy showed up... so, right away, scott, you got to be pretty psyched, right?
hey, buddy, i'm not paying you to hear your thoughts on life.

i told you last night, robbie, i realized i was wrong... and i want to take care of you for good.

before he was 30, alexander's search for conquest and glory had brought him as far as india.
here the legend is told that indian holy men led him to the speaking tree, a sacred tree which could speak all the languages of the earth and foretell every man's destiny.
the tree spoke. lt rebuked him for thinking he could conquer india.
alexander, it said, would die young, but his name would be remembered for ever.
alexander the great was born here in macedonia in northern greece in the shadow of mount olympus, the home of the gods.
and the gods are as important characters in his story as he is.
this is not the tale of an ordinary person who thought in ordinary ways.
like everyone who's been fascinated by his legend, i suppose i set out hoping to discover the truth about the man who conquered much of the world before he was 30.
after all, it's one of the most famous stories in all history.
to this day, no one has traced the whole of alexander's great journey on the ground.
and yet he was a brilliant organizer and leader in war.
alexander's mother, olympias, was only about 12 when philip fell in love with her.
she was beautiful and intelligent, but she was also manipulative, possessive, ruthless.
she was addicted to weird religious cults, gave herself with wild abandon to ecstatic dancing.
so what was it that inspired alexander to take on the might of persia?
revenge. 150 years before, the persians had marched across these plains to devastate greece.
suddenly, unexpectedly, alexander was king and head of an army which had already crushed southern greece.
in spring 334 bc, he set out for persia on his war of revenge.
on his chest the gorgon's head whose image was supposed to turn onlookers into stone.
and his first act was to throw his spear to the shore, claiming that asia was his by right, won by the spear.
and the two young men ran naked round the tomb of his ancestor achilles.
below the hill of troy, they saw where achilles had dragged hector's body behind his chariot.
their deeds here had won them eternal glory, and alexander thirsted for that above all things, says the historian arrian.
on top of windy troy, they went into the temple of the goddess athena.
inside the temple alexander was shown weapons said to have been used by the heroes in the trojan war.
he left his and took them with him, including a shield said to have been achilles', which was taken with him all the way to india.
coming here and honouring, sacrificing for the heroes, giving blood to their ghosts,
alexander was trying to co-opt them, to have the heroes fighting for him in his war against asia.
the persian empire was the largest which had yet existed on earth.
the persians ruled from ethiopia to the black sea, from the aegean to india.
alexander soon defeated the persians' local governor and opened up the coast.
all the way down the western seaboard of turkey, there were greek cities under persian rule, powerhouses of greek civilisation.
just as he had enlisted the help of the heroes of troy, he now sought the support of one of the most powerful of the olympian gods, apollo, whose oracle had once drawn pilgrims here from all over the greek world.
belief in oracles like didyma and their ability to tell the future was part of alexander's religious faith.
in his mind, the war would be fought on the level of the gods, too, gods whose shrines had been desecrated by the persians.
back in the time of the great persian war, the persians had sacked didyma.
he went down into the shrine and, as the historian callisthenes told the tale, as if by magic, the spring came back to life.
however it happened, the oracle had found a voice after 150 years, and it said alexander would triumph over the persians.
as the macedonian army marched on south, the problem now for alexander was that the persians controlled the sea.
alexander now took a very daring and controversial decision which was contested by some of his high command.
they cost him a fortune, provided by his greek allies, so he decided to have done with them.
the war, he thought, could be won on land by denying the persians their naval bases.
most of them were young men with all that energy to burn off.
on this night, one of the phalanx brigades, the infantry, camped outside the walls.
two of them put on their weapons, marched out and decided to attack the walls of the citadel of halicarnassus.
in the confusion, both sides threw in more troops and both took heavy losses.
next day, humiliatingly, alexander had to ask for the return of his dead.
but on the persian side, the greek mercenaries were now seriously worried.
ephialtes would lead a daring dawn raid, with 2,000 commandos, to burn alexander's mobile towers and their battering rams.
the first group of 1,000 commandos rushed out of the walls bearing flaming torches, carrying buckets of pitch, anything that would burn.
just then, macedonian reserves, who were the veterans, old men who'd fought under alexander's father, brought themselves into the action.
show the young men how to do it. lt was they who pushed the attackers back inside the city.
that night, memnon evacuated his forces by sea to the island of kos.
alexander paused now and let the newly-weds in the army go home for the winter.
finally, the wind changed and the shivering troops were able to get out of the water.
the expedition historian, callisthenes, claimed the sea had bowed to alexander.
that beach walk was the first hint that going precisely in his footsteps might reveal more than just where he'd been.
but it's hard to pin down people in history, because, like us, they're always on the move, as we constantly reinvent them to suit our own times.
we followed him north into the plains of central turkey and entered an older world more akin to the one he knew.
at a village where we stopped, the people pointed out an old caravan route.
alexander came here to meet reinforcements from greece, but he was also drawn by a strange legend.
the americans have been excavating here for nearly 50 years, in the place for ever associated with the tale of the gordian knot.
in the dig hut, we celebrated alexander's birthday, the 20th of july.
as guest of honour, i was awarded the gordian hat, decorated with knot and sword.
the legend said there was an old cart in the temple whose shaft was tied with a most intricate knot.
whoever undid it, so the story went, would become lord of asia.
arrian says that when they got here, alexander conceived of a "pothos", a desire to go up to the acropolis to see this extraordinary cart.
when he got up there, presumably he goes through the gates, and then there's a temple that the greeks say was to zeus, and nearby this ancient cart had been preserved.
he couldn't for the life of him see how he could undo it.
it was probably rather like the kind of knots we call turk's-head knots, a big knot with all the ends tucked up inside so you just can't see where to begin.
some say that alexander pulled out the pin that held the shaft and the yoke together, loosened the knot so he could pull the yoke out.
according to others, though, alexander pulled out his sword, said, "lt doesn't matter how the knot is undone,"
the problem grows more acute from this point in the story.
look at the two historians who are our guides on this journey.
he was a former military man, provincial governor, well-known author, a decent chap.
you could imagine him being a special columnist for the "daily telegraph" or the "washington post" today.
he was interested in the scandals, the murders, the war crimes, the purges and plots.
curtius knew that men are motivated by lust for power and sex.
but one of the decisive battles of history took place here.
darius lined up along the banks of the river payaz between the mountains and the sea.
by the sea, he'd massed cavalry forces to overwhelm alexander's left wing.
but on his left, by the mountains, darius had placed untrained infantry, protected by archers, a sure sign he feared they couldn't cope on their own.
he knew this was the weak point because of the terrain and the archers.
as soon as he had seen those archers, he knew this was where to attack.
this is the moment, preserved on a great mosaic from pompeii.
alexander storms into the history books like a hurricane, wild-haired and wide-eyed.
we followed him on south down the lebanese coast, with the help of the un.
most cities here surrendered without a fight, but tyre refused him.
alexander decided to build a causeway out to it across the waves.
what you can see now, the peninsula covered with all the high-rise buildings, has actually been caused by the silting up of the siege causeway which alexander built and which literally joined the island to the land for ever.
23,000 people were trapped down there, more than half of them women and children.
after the walls were breached, the people crowded into the temple of hercules, where the christian church stands today.
this is the land of battles, as we say, between the most great emperors in the world, from 3,000 bc until now.
then one of the guests pulled out his copy of the muslim holy book, the koran.
and there again was two-horned alexander, zul-qarnain, in one of the archangel gabriel's revelations to the prophet muhammad.
"they ask thee concerning zul-qarnain, say i'll tell you something of his story.
"we established his power on earth and we gave him the ways and the means to all ends."
so allah, god, made him the most powerful ruler on earth - with power.
and, above all, a centre of world culture to compete with athens itself.
with enormous amount of wealth and money, they invited the best minds in the world to come and settle in alexandria.
in the third century bc, within one century after its foundation,
alexandria could claim the great names of euclid, the great mathematician,
and only now are archaeologists finding material evidence of the vision behind it.
it shows a side of the king's character we hadn't seen so far, not just the warrior, but a far-sighted thinker,
from the nile valley, it's 700km to siwa, and the last stage goes straight into the desert, for alexander eight or nine days'journey.
he came through the little oasis of gara, and we camped close by.
they've been on a campaign for two or three years and now they've got a few weeks off in egypt and they're camping out, lighting fires underneath the stars,
drinking a bit of date wine, having a bit of fun.
i think the journey to siwa must have been an exciting experience for them.
this part of the journey, the greeks talk about a landscape without any features.
"not a single tree or mountain by which we could get our bearings, just a great ocean of sand."
it was, says the historian curtius, as if they'd entered a vast sea, and their eyes looked around in vain for a sight of land.
they ran out of water and were saved by a sudden shower.
they lost their way, but birds appeared and led them back to the track.
siwa stands in the middle of the desert, but it's wonderfully fertile, miraculously so.
not surprising, then, that for so long people came here expecting miracles.
they refreshed themselves in a pool known as the spring of the sun. lt's still here.
he set foot on the sacred path with hephaestion and his closest companions, their clothes still dust-streaked from the desert.
the answer was delivered by the priests, written on papyrus, literally a letter from heaven.
as they gave it to him, they greeted him in greek as the son of god.
the siwa episode tells us that alexander always journeyed with one eye on the here and now and the other on eternity.
he was an opportunist and a visionary rolled into one, which made him very unpredictable and dangerous.
i think he took the direct route east to the nile, an epic journey in its own right.
in one lonely oasis on this route we found the first evidence of alexander as god king.
as far as you can see, because it's mostly damaged - you'll see the inscription here is badly eroded - you can still see a certain cartouche here.
the cartouche is that oval shape that contains the name of an egyptian king.
the sign of the sun would have been on top of it.
so he would be the son of the god ra, then another cartouche that will have his name.
he is one of these people who lived very short but he left his stamp, not only on the history of ancient times but on the history of mankind.
soon, on the walls of the greatest egyptian temples, he would be shown like the pharaohs of the past, the successor of khufu, seti and ramses the great.
and in luxor, in the holy of holies, the 24-year-old macedonian appears honouring his father ammon and pouring libations over the phallus of the god min.
son of ammon, beloved of ra, king of the two lands;
2,300 years ago, alexander the great invaded asia, his goal to conquer the persian empire.
we followed in his footsteps, a 20,000-mile journey from greece to the plains of india.
in the third year of the war, alexander marched into egypt.
there, at the oracle of siwa, he was proclaimed son of god, a true pharaoh.
we were now on one of the great travel routes of history.
this was once the persian royal road, later part of the silk route which joined the mediterranean with china.
he now staked everything on a battle near the town of gaugamela.
we stopped for water near where alexander must have camped that september.
when alexander came here, the 50-degree summer heat was dying down.
as it turned out, this was as close as we could get to the site of the battle.
tantalizingly, it was only a few miles to the south of us, out there on the flat plain of kurdistan,
but it lay beyond the front line of saddam hussein's iraqi army and was out of reach.
his troops are also running down a line between the cities.
the british and americans running operation provide comfort over kurdistan offered to help out, for alexander and darius met on what today's military analysts still see as a fault line of history.
on the awacs screens, we saw the current military situation over northern iraq.
the crew fed in what was known to alexander's intelligence experts in september 331 bc.
on the night of the 20th there was an eclipse which stopped them in their tracks until the army seers told them it was a good omen.
and then they sighted the persians probably about the 25th, the scouts did, and they rested for four days.
his plan was his wings would hold the persians off for long enough to see a gap open in the persian line through which alexander could push to hit darius himself.
everything depended on the macedonian troops, on each unit carrying out its instructions even if they couldn't see a thing around them.
mid-december he reached the karkheh river near susa, just inside today's iranian border.
i'd brought with me an intelligence map made for the british invasion of this region in the first world war.
where you could find good water and where it was undrinkable.
here, marked on this map of 1915, is the ancient royal road from babylon to susa, running all the way across this landscape and down to susa, alexander's destination.
and up there with them, like a fairy-tale villain, is the great iskander, alexander himself.
at the climax of the day, they carry huge mirrored coffins to commemorate the dead heroes of islam.
in few countries is the sense of the wounds of history so alive, the idea that the great defeats should never be forgotten.
and iran's two greatest defeats were by the arabs and before them by alexander.
it's the tomb of the prophet daniel, who was cast by the persian king into the lions' den.
and in the bible story of daniel, there's a strange vision of the coming of alexander.
in a dream, the prophet saw four terrible monsters coming out of the sea.
the last of them was alexander's macedonians, a frightful beast with iron teeth which devoured everything in its path.
in that image, you've got something of the cyclonic force of alexander's arrival on the iranian scene.
as the iranians said, he was a demon with disheveled hair, born of the race of wrath.
in late december, alexander left susa, his army doubled now, reinforced to 70,000 men by a vast flow of manpower from greece.
he would now strike at the very heart of the empire beyond the zagros mountains.
he now took a short cut straight through the mountains to take the persians by surprise.
going up this valley, you can hardly believe that alexander would have risked the elite of his army, 20,000 men, in this kind of terrain.
he was looking for a short cut through the zagros mountains to get to persepolis as fast as he could.
they must have known that there was such a short cut.
it was a very ancient route, used possibly for thousands of years, known to the ancients as the key to anshan, the old name for the heartland of persia.
it was difficult, narrow passes, but it led straight on to persepolis through the pass which the greeks called the persian gates.
his troops were suffering heavy casualties and he ordered the trumpeter to sound the retreat.
the army pulled out of the pass, leaving the dead where they fell.
alexander camped back at the mouth of the pass, as we did.
he was furious with himself for leading his men into a trap.
and is there another way from somewhere around here that can get to the back of the pass?
urgently now, alexander asked that same question of his local prisoners.
at nine in the evening he gave the orders to go.
hs route has never been found, and zavoreh and his brother couldn't agree over which way he went.
when they came up the gully and they got to the top, this is it, isn't it?
on top, at about 6,000 or 7,000 feet, there's a plateau.
the macedonian troops are still filing up that narrow gorge we've just come through.
alexander and his generals sit down to work out the final stages of the plan.
alexander himself with three squadrons of cavalry, including the companions, one infantry brigade and light-armed skirmishers and archers, maybe 4,000-odd troops, was to head straight over there, round to the back of the pass, behind the persian position.
and 3,000 infantry, under the general ptolemy, were to be left just here.
these were probably the specialist long shields who were part of the old macedonian royal bodyguard.
so, in the dead of night, the last stages of this incredibly risky and dangerous operation began to unfold, and on them the whole fate of the war would depend.
alexander had the wonderful knack of cheering his men, calming their fears by his fearlessness.
soon after dawn, we came down into the middle of the persian gates.
just before dawn, alexander launched his attack on the rear of ariobarzanes' defenses.
at the same time, the macedonians sent their trumpet signals all the way down the pass to craterus, who now moved his troops up to attack the wall where the macedonians had been beaten the previous day.
ptolemy and his 3,000 infantry had been left behind to come down the gorge where we came during the night.
he launched his attack on the side of the persian position.
ambassadors from 35 countries had queued here to receive the blessing of the great king and the god of wisdom, ahura mazda.
here had come ionian greeks bearing gifts of dyed cloths and beehives.
these would have been real gold bracelets, presumably ripped out by the greeks.
he would have had facial cosmetics, the beautifully curled beard, and attended by all the flunkies of the court:
the bearer of the ointment pot and the towel and the fly whisk and the sunshade.
to the greeks, this must have reinforced all their stereotypes about oriental people and their political systems.
in persian eyes, their state was the embodiment of justice, guided by the god of wisdom, ahura mazda.
alexander had moved on persepolis so fast that he found the treasury intact;
some thought the crimes committed by the persian kings in greece 150 years before required further punishment.
no one knows precisely what happened next, but the legend told by the greek historians was so famous it has become fact.
after all the king's great achievements in asia, she said, it would be the crowning glory if he allowed his friends to burn the palace down, to avenge what the persians had done in greece and to allow women's hands to extinguish the glory of king xerxes.
and with those words, it's said, the king himself took fire.
the procession was formed, the torches were lit and the flute girls struck up a tune.
the drunken revelers reeled up the great staircase and into the palace.
after king alexander, thais was the first person to throw her torch into the state rooms.
imagine it, the fire running up gilded curtains to the cedar-wood roof.
these people are zoroastrians, the followers of the ancient religion of iran, older by far than christianity or islam.
and the zoroastrians have preserved the persian story of alexander's conquest.
their prophet, zoroaster, who lived 1,000 years before alexander, had been praised by the king's teacher, aristotle.
but alexander would never meet with the magi, the persian priests.
he never made offerings to their god, even though arrian says he was usually so careful of religion.
in fact, the zoroastrians say he persecuted them and desecrated their temples.
but that night, in the heart of old iran, even after 2,300 years, the zoroastrians told the story as if it had happened only yesterday.
as you know, and we accept this, we know he was a great military man, and he conquered many little countries and finally he defeated our empire.
he forced our youngsters, girls and boys, to marry greek soldiers.
and, worst of all, he burned our scriptures, our religion bible, which is called gatha, and it's the word of our prophet, zoroaster.
for more than 2,000 years, they believe it's been kept alive, carried from place to place.
and today, in a village in the yazd plain, it still burns, the fire before which darius worshipped.
here he heard the news that darius had decided to flee eastwards towards afghanistan.
in the tea houses of isfahan, the storytellers can still tell the tale of darius's last days.
darius must have camped somewhere like this on his last tragic night.
then he and the desperate persian nobles held a war council.
perhaps, they said, god may then look upon us with more favor.
darius refused to give up the throne, and they arrested him and bound him in golden chains.
and then from the royal tent came the sound of wailing as the king's servants wept for their king and for their whole world.
when alexander heard that darius had been deposed and was only just ahead, he drove his weary troops on through the night.
their solution was to throw their track out in a great loop south of the mountains into the desert.
it's longer, about 50 miles, exactly the distance the greeks said alexander covered that night.
but it's quicker, and it leads to a little railway halt in the middle of nowhere called gerd ab.
just below the station is a long-dried-up wadi which circles the hills.
as alexander rode on, searching for darius, an ordinary greek soldier called polystratus walked down to the pool to quench his thirst.
by the edge of the pool polystratus saw a covered wagon, the animals wounded with spears.
he went over and lifted the cover and inside, covered in blood, was darius himself, the great king, at the point of death.
polystratus filled his helmet with water and gave the king a drink.
then darius held his hand and gave him a message to take to alexander.
he thanked him for treating his mother and his wife and children so honorably.
but it was here, surely, at ab hore, which means the place where you can find drinking water.
the legend of darius's death is still told by the last of the tale-tellers who used to travel the back roads of iran with their painted backdrops.
they camped north of the elburz mountains in what's now turkoman country.
they've always bred fine horses here and alexander could make good his losses.
but as the army enjoyed itself, there were nagging worries about the king's real plans.
the rumor had now spread that he really wanted to go on and conquer the whole world.
that night, the turkomans told me tales of alexander, who's one of their great folk heroes.
like muslims right across asia, they call him the two-horned one.
in their songs, alexander climbs the heavens, plumbs the oceans and finds the spring of eternal life.
and he meets a tribe of female warriors, just as he does in a famous greek tale.
but the historian curtius says his appetite was not as great as hers and he spent 13 days trying to satisfy her.
finally, he gave her rich presents and off she went back to her own country and he went back over the elburz mountains and headed towards afghanistan.
before he marched east, alexander moved into the northernmost province of iran by the caspian sea.
and riding in his track, we entered ancient hyrcania, the land of wolves.
our guide was louise firoz, who's lived out here with the turkomans for 30 years.
our goal was alexander's wall, an ancient defense work like hadrian's wall or the great wall of china, which legend says was built by alexander to mark the northern edge of his empire.
off to your right is the beginning of central asia here, and on the left, on the other side of alexander's wall, is the beginning of the middle east.
this encloses the sweet water on this side with the elburz mountains and its springs, and on this side you have nothing but brackish springs, and very few of those, also.
here, for the first time in the expedition, they reached the limits of their knowledge.
they didn't know, as we do, that the caspian is a landlocked sea.
you could sail out there and turn off to the left and go all the way round to northern europe.
you could sail off that way all the way round the world to india.
but it was in alexander's nature, says arrian, to search far beyond into the unknown.
soon the goal of his expedition would begin to change, as the prospect of a bigger world beckoned.
he founded a new city close by, another alexandria, one more step to uniting the world under greek rule.
for his teacher aristotle had taught him it was fitting the greeks should rule barbarians.
he's wearing a greek toga, the kind of fusion of east and west, that happened in the arts, too, in afghanistan.
this was an absolutely unique civilisation, and this museum was the chief record of it in the world.
now we had no idea what to expect on the road ahead.
as alexander saw it that winter, the eastern part of the persian empire was still unconquered.
he chose the longer, eastern route, went up the panshir valley, heading for the khawak pass.
travelling up the panshir valley today, it's almost impossible to believe that a great army could have made its way through here, but they did.
throughout the whole of history, armies had to find a way over the hindu kush and this tended to be the favourite route.
tamburlaine the great, for example, came this way on his way from the oxus to india in 1398 and your main problem, especially in the spring, was not the terrain but with the cold and especially the lack of food and provisions,
and as it turned out, that was exactly the problem that alexander faced.
the local people had buried their winter supplies to foil the macedonian foragers, so alexander's men had to take their own food with them.
we were obviously here for the night, so we went back to the nearest village.
what is the name of the village where we leave the cars
ln fact alexander's sappers and engineers were one of the keys to his speed of movement.
they did this kind ofjob for him all the way to india.
this road was actually only made up for cars a few years ago, and until that point, it was really a track that only horses could use, and although alexander's army must have been able to come along the river
valley in those wide open spaces in the early part of the panshir.
finally we reached our goal, the horse station below the pass, and there was commander halil.
it's a bit like a wild west out here, and for a moment, the atmosphere seemed threatening.
our pack horses took 100 kilos each, the same as alexander's.
his men, though, had to carry their own gear in backpacks.
and here on the path that night, i could almost feel the magnetism of alexander's leadership, and the sheer excitement that his men must have felt, marching with him.
next day, the track went higher, the air was thinner, and the land more barren.
for us, as no doubt the greeks, walking was now an effort.
as the crossing went into its second week, they ran out of grain and started killing the pack animals for food, but there was no firewood for cooking, and they had to eat the flesh raw.
this they did, says arian, with the juice of a medicinal plant silphium.
can you ask which part of the plant they used for medecine?
they were over 11,000 ft. now, and the starving troops were suffering from chronic fatigue brought on by altitude sickness.
we brought few supplies with us and we took our snacks where we could find them.
and there the road stretching away down to the land of baktria and former soviet central asia, and around are the mountains of the hindu kush.
the greeks knew that these mountains were part of a continuous chain which split asia in two and was the source of all the great rivers of asia, and following alexander's footsteps up here, with this wind,
you can really feel, whatever you think about him, what an amazing achievement it was, to drive an army over these mountains.
nothing stopped him, said the historian arian, nothing put him off.
just below the summit, a cairn of stones is said to mark the burial place of the greeks who didn't make it.
on the other side of the hindu kush, in northern afghanistan, they found good fishing in the rivers.
as chance would have it, i'd met the head of the local garrison in london before we set out.
he'd written me a letter of introduction to his front-line commander.
i told you when i was in london i would finally get here.
welcome to my country, and we can keep this later, you know, for next time if you come.
'the people of this part of baktria,' the greeks said, 'are prosperous.
they grow grapes here and have all manner of fruits.' lt was a little haven.
we hired a battered russian pick-up and drove on in alexander's tracks.
bessus was on the run, and alexander pursued him like a hunter towards the river oxus, which divides afghanistan from central asia.
and sat tight while tim helped the driver to mend the engine.
it was summer now and alexander was racing to the river oxus.
they had to cross this great belt of shifting sand dunes, and they had no water.
they probably had to camp here for two nights, and then they made the fundamental, unbelievable mistake of broaching the wine supplies because they had nothing else to drink.
it made them feel better for the moment, said one of the alexander historians, but the after-effects were terrible.
maybe they had no choice, but alexander's elite ended up hung-over and dehydrated, stumbling over sand dunes, trying to find the oxus river.
the greeks reached this place just about the same time of the day, late afternoon, early evening and when they saw the river, the troops were so thirsty that they all piled down to the river bank and just started drinking,
and there were a lot of deaths due to over-consumption of the water of the river, which isn't particularly good apparently.
ln fact, during the night, the army had been given instructions to surround the town, and at a pre-arranged signal, they began to attack with the intention of massacring everybody inside.
the brachidae had suspected nothing, but despite their kinship of language, their desperate entreaties, the fact that they were holding olive branches in their hands, the symbol of peace, the savagery didn't stop until everybody had been killed.
i imagine he felt that however you gloss it over, a war crime is still a war crime.
alexander now received word that support for bessus was crumbling in the face of the macedonians' lightning advance.
alexander pushed on to the syr darya river, the outermost edge of the persian empire.
here he founded a city which he called alexandria the farthermost.
to understand why he stopped here, we have to imagine the world as he saw it.
as far as he knew, he was near the northern edge of the world here.
i think the greek colonists might have felt quite at home here, figs and olives in the market.
alexander said he hoped the town would one day become rich and famous.
the empire was linked by a system of post horses and racing camels.
the troops received letters from home, medical supplies came out here by the ton.
that summer, the famed horsemen of baktria were gathered, the solphians too came out in revolt.
for 2,000 years or more, they bred the finest horses in asia here, and they fought the kind of war
you can imagine what he was up against when you see them play buzkhashee, but this, just a game.
'alexander couldn't beat us because we were such good horsemen,' the old man said.
a macedonian column was wiped out near samarkand, their first defeat for 30 years.
at his base on the syr darya river, he suddenly found himself crippled and at bay.
alexander was now at one of the lowest points in his entire career.
surrounded by enemies, he was suffering from a leg wound, he had malnutrition, dysentery coming on, his throat wound had not healed, so he could hardly speak.
his voice was so quavering that people even close to him couldn't hear him.
he couldn't stand in the ranks, he couldn't ride a hose, he couldn't give his army encouragement and instructions, the very thing on which his generalship depended.
here, that september, took place one of the most fateful incidents of alexander's life.
just outside the city gate lies the mound of the ancient tongue, and remains of a sovdian palace.
'my father never gave me the credit for my part in his victories,' he said, 'bore me ill-will and jealousy.'
cleitus, who was one of the old guards, stood up, and he said,
'everything you have achieved was based on what your father did.
ln fact your father's achievements are far greater than yours, and he won them fighting men, not women.'
at this point, alexander who'd been relatively calm and unruffled flew into a rage.
he threw fruit at cleitus, tried to grab a spear in order to hit him, and kept calling out in macedonian to give the alarm for the royal bodyguards to come in.
alexander grabs a long spear from one of the guards at the door and runs him through.
there's blood everywhere, and alexander collapses on to the body in a drink-sodden heap in floods of tears.
some said cleitus got what was coming to him, and the king now suspended freedom of speech, but at the tomb of tamberlaine, another tyrant or hero, depending on your point of view, the words of eye-witness came to mind
who spoke of the fear which people round alexander now felt.
the ringleaders were holding out in the rugged mountains on the tajik-uzbek border.
with their wives and children, they'd taken refuge on an inaccessible peak known as the sogdian rock, but where was the rock?
hearing of our search for the rock, over breakfast the local men showed us an old manuscript of the alexander legend.
there were old traditions, they said, that alexander had come this way, and that the lost citadel of sogdian lay in the mountains close by.
stories like this are ten a penny in these parts, where you'll find alexander's legend everywhere.
but my ears pricked up when they began to tell us about a mountain a day's walk from their village.
arian says, that he had to go on and seize it in the pursuit of glory.
the ambassador simply said, in response to alexander's demand for them to surrender,
the story was remembered ever after as proof of alexander's almost superhuman powers.
but now comes the most amazing twist in the tail, for a peace was finally brokered, not through war but through love.
alexander's expedition would open up the heart of asia and for a thousand years after the greeks,
balkh would be the greatest crossroads on the silk route to china.
you can see its ruins below us, a wall stretching for 7 miles with the remains of 100 buddhist monasteries,
zoroastrian fire temples, and later christian and jewish settlements, and the huge mosques of the muslim period.
when the arabs came here in the 7th century, they called it simply 'the mother of cities'.
fate, though, still had another card to play in this story.
using the pages' plot as a pretext, he arrested callisthenes and had him tortured and crucified.
of all alexander's deeds, it was said, this left the bitterest taste, for everyone agreed
we followed in his footsteps, a 20,000-mile journey from greece to the plains of india.
by the eighth year of the war, alexander had defeated the peoples of central asia.
now he turned towards india, heading for what he believed would be the end of the earth.
our journey now brought us from afghanistan into the north-west frontier of pakistan, by the khyber pass.
they'd come to see the khyber railway, built under the british empire.
i was looking for traces of an older past, but the strategic importance of the khyber has never changed since the dawn of history.
as he came over these passes, he'll have remembered the words of aristotle, who said that from here one could see the ends of the earth and the ocean the greeks believed surrounded it.
alexander now knew for sure that this was wrong, that vast and densely populated lands lay ahead, and he was driven to see them.
they follow ancient gods and speak a language distantly akin to greek.
the people welcomed alexander and they told him an amazing story.
i drank wine that night with the descendants of alexander's army.
alexander now marched on up the valley of the river swat.
we set out to climb pir sar in the macedonians' footsteps.
it's wild here, and the district officer gave us guides and armed police to drive off wolves and bandits.
much worse than crossing the khawak pass in the hindu kush.
it almost made me believe they couldn't have come this way.
but if they did, if this was the way, then it is the most amazing demonstration of their absolute determination to overcome their enemies, to show the indian people that there was nowhere to hide and that all resistance would be futile.
next day, in a chill dawn, we looked down on the indus from 8,000 feet.
at six o'clock, after cold water and biscuits, we blearily prepared to carry on.
it never ceased to amaze me how alexander was able to inspire his men.
one tradition says it took seven days and nights with the soldiers working in relays.
each soldier had to cut 100 stakes, and the engineers presumably were digging big piles in the side of this space here, and they laid a mat of trees, earth and so on.
and it rose higher and higher until maybe more than 100 feet above my head.
it must have looked like one of those trestle railway bridges you see in the wild west.
within the week, they'd built the causeway up enough to allow their catapults and artillery to concentrate on the indian defenders, and then the fate of the rock was sealed.
the indians tried to surrender, but alexander swept along the ridge and massacred them or drove them off the cliffs.
there were 64,000 infantry, 12,000 cavalry, camp followers, women, children, scientists, poets, even entertainers.
and the surveyors who were still measuring every step from greece to the end of the earth.
here a greek city grew up, the first in the subcontinent.
a city of neat lines, a place of colonists, set apart from the hubbub of the native town next door.
for centuries after, greek was spoken in these streets, just as english is now.
in bazaars you can still find the coins of alexander's successors,
when you come over the great salt range, suddenly a wonderful view opens up.
the jhelum river, the first of the five rivers of the punjab, and beyond, the plains of india, stretching as far as the ganges, the heartland of indian civilization.
on the far side, according to the historian, was a ravine where he hid his cavalry and other forces during the day and the night and crossed it across to the island which still exists.
out of this whole range of hills, this is the only place he could have crossed.
that is a classic movement of encircling, or outflanking move, where you have either both flanks or the center lean across the enemy's force to attract their attention.
show as if they were going to cross, or keep them amused, in general terms.
but the cavalry, he says, came across on rafts that they'd prepared beforehand.
they must be... with planks on top, stuffed with straw, local rush and things.
porus had little chance against one of the hardest armies ever.
it was a horrible scene; rain, churned-up rice paddies, the macedonians jabbing their long spears into the elephants' eyes.
the march restarted around midsummer, right in the middle of the monsoon rains.
it must have been the last straw for the greeks - the wet, the muggy heat, the mosquitoes.
we followed alexander by road and entered today's india north of the sikh holy city of amritsar.
nearby we picked up two taxis to take us on to alexander's appointment with destiny, by the banks of the river beas.
india was a short peninsula jutting into the great ocean which circled the earth.
as far as he knew, they didn't have far to go.
two or three weeks' march from the beas was a far bigger river, the ganges.
and a great kingdom with a vast army and thousands of war elephants.
"most of the men who came with us from greece have left their bones on the roads of asia.
"those that remain are battered in body and weary in spirit.
"but the will of the gods can't forever be taken for granted.
"surely the time has come now to set a limit to our endeavors."
he set sail mid-november, the main army marching with him along the river bank.
they cast off to the sound of bands and were watched by the indians, who followed for a while in amazement.
now we start to get the first reports of atrocities and the large-scale massacre of civilians.
in the new year he attacked a big city in the lower punjab.
he put a siege ladder against the wall and he went up himself, led the troops.
behind him were only three men, two of his bodyguards, one holding the sacred shield from troy, and an nco, abreas.
and then, at that moment, surrounded by indian defenders, exposed on the wall, he took his life into his own hands and leapt into the fortress rather than outside, leaving the rest of the army behind.
the indian defenders closed in on him and he was forced to throw stones at them, beat them off with his sword.
the bodyguard peucestas straddled him, holding the sacred shield from troy, trying to beat off the indian attackers.
you can imagine the paramedics rushing alexander back to the camp.
over the years, alexander had taken punishment which would have stopped an ox.
leg and thigh wounds, a catapult bolt in the shoulder, 21 wounds in all.
the story here is that the arrow was poisoned and alexander never really recovered.
now, the greek historians don't mention this, but the traditional doctors here, the hakeems, claim descent from alexander's doctors.
they practice what they call greek medicine, so perhaps they should know.
but poison or not, both doctor and patient knew that alexander was very close to death.
alexander planned his return from india as a combined operation by land and sea.
with the help of the pakistan navy, we tried to trace his fleet's progress along the bleak coast of the makran.
there's one other little story that he tells in this, which is particularly interesting.
he says that about ten miles off the shore, roughly, there was an island, and it was uninhabited, no human being ever went there.
the greeks were frightened of stories that you shouldn't step on this island.
they sailed round the island, shouting to check there weren't any spirits before they went on it.
this part of the makran has flash floods in the autumn, when alexander came through.
the local baluchis told us whole villages can be swept away.
it's only 100 miles but it goes through the harshest terrain.
the greeks found impoverished settlements of aboriginal people they called the fish-eaters, too poor to give them supplies.
we've had half a liter of water and two oranges each.
i don't think we took the preparations for this leg very seriously.
he was leading the army on foot, as he often did to encourage the troops, and everybody was absolutely desperate for thirst.
some soldiers found a tiny bit of water in a dried-up stream bed and brought it to him in a helmet.
the greeks always cited this story as being proof of his noble character.
i find it a little frightening that after all he'd put them through, they could still be won over by his tricks.
out here you really do wonder why on earth he brought his army through this appalling wilderness.
it makes you wonder whether he wanted to punish them for not following him to the ends of the earth.
he was now wearing the robes and tiara of the persian shah.
he could no longer be a mere conqueror, a seeker after glory.
he still had great plans, among them to conquer the west, but fate, or the will of the gods, was closing in.
there, suddenly, after a massive binge, his dearest friend and lover, hephaestion, died.
5th june they moved him to the other side of the river.
there he slept a little, but the fever did not abate.
the macedonian veterans now believed he was dead, and pushed their way into the palace to see him a last time.
the motive in almost every heart was grief and a sort of helpless bewilderment at the thought of losing him.
and that is that all the evils unleashed by men of war in our own time teach us that we should reject alexander's ideals.
but alexander was a man of his time, not of ours.
at midnight, when every dog in town is tucked into bed, we're gonna blow a magic dog whistle.
well... and all those darling fidos and fidettes will get that zombie look.
and they'll drag their master's gift right out of the doggy doors and bring 'em here to me.
if chuckles here gets all the goodies, what do you get?
* when the lights go out, i dream about my puppyhood
* and this pint-sized mug who took me in one day
* we used to trash the joint from 6am to midnight
* play tag and all them indoor sports like tug of war with boxer shorts
* hey, who knew teddy bears' insides looked just like snowflakes?
* but then too many hours had passed, i had to make a pit stop fast
* we hit the dumpsters then the dumps, kicked chihuahuas' puny rumps
* at night i snooze wherever i choose, ain't no way on earth i can lose
* but when the lights go out, i dream about my puppyhood
* and in these crazy dreams i never hear him say
that's why we've got to unleash part two of the miracle.
come ye storms and grow in strife, split the sky with lightning rife.
* you could be a million things that obviously you ain't
* you're slippin' and you're slidin' and soon you're gonna fall
* you're writin' your own ticket, the script is in your paws
- * it's your time to shine - * be divine
this will be a story to repeat for years to come.
i just feel so bad for those pups because we don't have any p-r-e-s... um, gifts left.
i'll fix you some soup right away! where are we? it's a small village about 200 lies from lr.
the villagers lent us this house so we could care for your wounds.
how is the well? by the schedule, we should reach the water vein in one week.
all right, let's splurge on dinner tonight! do you mean it?
! if only i hadn't followed him, it might have turned out differently.
then, he... ...he wouldn't have had to suffer like this! you're wrong! you wanted to be with him, didn't you? what's wrong with acting with your heart? my big sister told me that i should never hold back.
you guys probably don't know this... ...but a lot of weird shit has been going on in this area.
did something happen? there have been mass disappearances in 12 towns, and lr is a war zone.
about 10 days ago... ...he was brought here by a pair of girls.
he was in horrible shape, full of holes like swiss cheese.
please believe me! that's not funny! ma'am! could a normal human being do all those things?
! it has to be his doing! you're wrong! then, why... ...why did stefan die so horribly?
but this man knows how to live as a human being.
don't feed me your garbage! we have a right to shoot this monster! we lost our friends, families, and neighbors! we have a right to hate him! no one has the right to take the life of another.
no one... ...has the right to take the life... ...of another! everyone has a future.
rem... isn't that right? stay back! i said, stay back! stop.
- take this with you! i think it would make mr. wolfwood happy! are you sure? sure! th-this is pretty heavy.
of course! that's because it's so full of mercy! well, i'm off! i couldn't... i couldn't say anything.
so on the first evening a pebble from somewhere drops upon the world.
so on the second evening the children of the pebble join hands and compose a waltz.
no one has the right to take the life of another.
no one has the right to take the life of another!
sara jane, i understand you've been seen with that grissom boy again.
suppose i don't have to guess very hard who you heard that from.
i've been around a little bit longer than you have, little lady.
i might just know a few more things than you give me credit for.
i think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone who gives less of a shit about how the sheriff feels.
let me see if i can't make this a little cleare for you, johnny boy.
the sheriff told you to have a word with him, not beat him bloody.
yeah, well he's lucky i don't rip off his head and shit down his goddamn neck!
but i do know that johnny del didn't even lay eyes on his daddy till he was nine years old.
and that was the day they let his daddy outta prison.
next thing they're out the door with lives of their own.
and it's just you, old and alone in an empty house.
i mean, do you know you have that gallery opening tomorrow?
no, but if you hum a few bars, i'll try to pick it up.
she was so thrilled she treated me to a little lady godiva impression.
apparently the oils in the saddle reacted badly with her cellulite cream.
it took an hour and a full bottle of nail polish remover to get her free.
today her thighs were so raw the only way she could find comfort was to straddle a frozen butterball turkey.
you're passing up orpheus and eurydice to shoot pool at a sticky-floored saloon?
my partner terrence is skipping a family wedding just to participate.
no choice since your son decided to go to my pub again.
imagine being so dense that you can ruin someone else's evening and not even be aware of it.
sherry's coming over and i'd hoped to have the place to myself.
you ought to talk to frasier, and i'm not saying this to get you out of here.
i guess "here's mud in your eye" sounded mean the first time, too.
i'm sorry if that sounds harsh but i don't know what else to do.
i know that because i held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold one up in the other room.
how nice it would be if any we could get into the looking-glass house?
they didn't keep this room nearly as tidy as they should.
here are the white queen and the white king walking arm in arm.
if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't you make it yourself.
i know you are a friend, a dear friend and an old friend.
i mean,... imagine how convenient it would be if you manage to go home without it.
for instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would shout out:
he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright.
and this was odd, because it was the middle of the night.
the sea was wet as wet could be, the sands were dry as dry.
you could not see a cloud, because no cloud was in the sky:
"if this were only cleared away," they said, "it would be grand!"
"if seven maids with seven mops swept it for half a year.
we cannot do with more than four, to give a hand to each."
the eldest oyster looked at him, but never a word he said:
the eldest oyster winked his eye, and shook his heavy head
meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster-bed.
all hopping through the frothy waves, and scrambling to the shore.
the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so,
"but not on us!" the oysters cried, turning a little blue.
"after such kindness, that would be a dismal thing to do!"
just then flew down a monstrous crow, as black as a tar-barrel;
which frightened both the heroes so, they quite forgot their quarrel.
i pin it here, and i pin it there, but there's no pleasing it.
well, it, it can't go straight, you know, if you, you pin it all on one side.
and, as in uffish thought he stood, the jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came!
is something between bellowing and whistling, with a sort of sneeze in the middle.
however, you'll hear it done, maybe, down in the wood yonder.
he said "i look for butterflies that sleep among the wheat,
i turn them into mutton-pies, ans sell them in the streets.
i sell them unto men," he said, "who sail on stormy seas;
and that's the way i get my bread a trifle, if you please."
but i was thinking of a plan to dye one's whiskers green,
and always use so large a fan that they could not be seen.
so, having no reply to give to what the old man said,
i cried "come, tell me how you live!" and thumped him on the head.
and so go on from day to day getting a little fatter.
i shook him well from side to side, until his face was blue:
"come, tell me how you live," i cried, "and what it is you do!"
he said "i hunt for haddocks' eyes among the heather bright,
to keep the menai bridge from rust by boiling it in wine.
i thanked him much for telling me the way he got his wealth,
but chiefly for his wish that he might drink my noble health.
and now, if e'er by chance i put my fingers into glue,
i weep, for it reminds me so of that old man i used to know
whose look was mild, whose speech was slow whose hair was whiter than the snow,
whose face was very like a crow, with eyes, like cinders, all aglow,
who seemed distracted with his woe, who rocked his body to and fro,
would you like me to read you a bit of this?
you may read it if you've a mind to, nobody's hindering you that i know of.
"when i was young, my ringlets waved and curled and crinkled on my head:
and then they said 'you should be shaved, and wear a yellow wig instead.'
but when i followed their advice, and they had witnessed the effect,
they said i did not look so nice as they had ventured to expect.
i didn't know i was to have a party at all.
but,... if there is to be one, i think i ought to invite the guests.
you know, i've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me today.
and... it's a curious thing, all of it seems to be... about fishes in some way.
a control over anger is very important impatience gives birth to problems.
it is true that these bomb blasts have hurt our souls.
he wants to say that i can't perform my duty, mother.
he's talking about his duties outside the house, grandma and i'm talking about the one inside the house.
grandma, you tell me what is the duty of a father?
to give the best of education and upbringing to his children.
butecause it has a border security force and fearless and courageous police officers like iqbai khan!
the border security officer, infact, the deputy commandant... iqbai khan is awarded the president's gold medal for his bravery.
to keep the fire burning in their house they are killing others!
when an educated man can yet trapped in their ploy what will happen to our country?
and save this country from the likes of satyanand and shah alam!
we have got to show them our strength unity and power!
if i wish then aiongwith you i can't destroy your family members in one second.
it will not even take a second to blow your brains off.
i fulfilled your job by planting a bomb in the hospital.
if you go to there with your friend then death will welcome you.
on the basis of the prima facie evidence the court is sure that shah alam took the lead in the bomb blasts and riots.
hence the court orders his arrest and start an inquiry against him.
these are the people who are hand-in-giove with lawyers and pimps!
peopie have no roofs over their head but even the bathrooms of these people are air conditioned!
they are responsible for riots that took place ...from 1 94 7 to 1 997!
these people are behind every killing right from gandhi to gandhi!
best time was in the morning before they started the engines.
i'd come up on the bridge and watch the sun rise over the flight deck and the canopies.

she lost her only child and afterward nearly die of fever.
well, i sorry for it but it doesn't make her brave.
i charge them so much money that they have every right to be.
so on that evening you arrived home in your carriage after dark.
i don't care how rude you are to me you stupid man.
as long as you send one wretched subordinates to look for lily whom might not only listen to but also care about.
hope's carriage left the musette at nine and returned at midnight.
and that tip bit cost me a ton by the way.
suppose that it would please you that i'll never see george again.
if you don't hold him it'll be because he's not worthy of you.
have you been able to forget your disapproval of him and look at him?
you see, i've noticed that really moral people think about what they do.
but i must asked to leave the conduct of this inquires to us.
mr. pitt i wouldn't dream of interfering if this matters had taken place with in the great wide world witch you think me so inexperienced.
i had unfortunately dropped too many clues, before i realised who your sister must be.
the poor child had come to my house expecting to find an invalid widow on whom practice good works instead... she finds her father's mistress.
well, is my believe he only one intended victim, chloe abernathy.
the others were smokescreen except sarah corde what possible was killed because she overheard something
i have the commonsense to know that it may be unwelcome.
unfortunately i don't have the means to stop feeling what i do.
they have seen their christian duty and they were carrying it out.
they will be judged accordingly in as much as their handmaidens of the lord.
love like thunder in his heart, to take a mortal bride.
and from their union came a son, half human and half god,
ares has tried everything to draw me back into his world of destruction.
he's threatened me, tempted me, framed me for a crime i didn't commit.
you'll use any excuse to get close to her, won't you?
father, you of all gods, must understand that, well, some mortal women can just...
my quarrel is not with mortals, but with the gods who imprisoned me beneath the earth.
if i let you pass, do you pledge to leave the mortal world alone, and take your fight to mount olympus?
i'm sending out a calming aura to neutralize the bad titan vibes.
and if that doesn't work, i plan to hide in my shell.
and he made me an offer which would make up for all his years of neglect.
he would take me to mount olympus, where i would become an immortal.
if i could change her, do you think i'd stay a bunny rabbit?
not that i don't, uh, sympathize, believe me, but, hey, these things happen
maybe there's more to bein' human, than actin' brave and strong.
maybe it's list'ning' to your heart, and knowing' when you're wrong.
as long as hera and the titans control it, we have no powers.
well, i don't mean to be insulting, but, you didn't do so hot when you had powers, did you?
one candy bar and i would have been on my way.
if i give you a couple of truffles, can i suggest places for you to go?
now, have you asked your husband to come in and see me with you?
couples therapy is more effective when i get to speak with both partners.
no, but i so love your voice, let's hear it anyway.
trevor, one letter from me and you know where you're going.
that must be when you stumble into a girls night out and then ask the largest pair of breasts at the table if you've seen them there before.
well, maybe if you had your girls night out at places other than decad. and club gomorrah's we might be a little less confused.
i understand that, man of milk, but let me tell you something, it's not fantasy island.
women are not gonna morph out of coconuts and wrap their limbs around you.
and the winner is the guy who, come dawn, has collected the most.
one of you let me know when he starts making sense.
you won't find your dream man until guys start wearing their resumes on their chests.
not a bad idea, women have been doing it for centuries.
and i am not desperate, i am really open, open to the possibilities of finding someone.
someone with similar belief systems, similar interests, life goals, someone compatible,
i think the counting crows are derivative neo-hippie, self-indulgent hacks providing a lifestyle soundtrack for annoying self-aware yuppies in training.
i think anyone who sells a trillion records will suffer a critical backlash at the hands of musical dilettantes.
okay, alex, first of all, you are the associate managing editor of the sun times and that makes you, in some very strange way, my boss.
second, you are at a club called gomorrah's, which puts you in any number of high risk categories.
well, i got a note from my rabbi that allows me to carry this little problem solver right here.
so why don't you get back in your car and move on.
so, anyway, i'm standing there in this rented tux, the whole family's there.
my brother carl, he's stationed in germany, he flew home for it.

there's water distension of the dermal layers consistent with immersion, along with some evidence of invertebrate scavenging on the exposed skin.
it's an emulation of the chinese animus concept of body decoration.
you take on the characteristics of the animal or the demon you wear on your skin.
the hormones have been chemically attached to either the lactose or the opiate itself using very sophisticated science.
this is what emma was trying to investigate and why she was in possession of drugs.
his brother was ordered executed by the dai lo in taiwan.
ordinarily their kuan ti code would keep him quiet, but ho couldn't forgive his brother's death.

general giap's instructions for us to steal back the rice on behalf of the peasants has paid great dividends.
saigon command has located the enemies radio transmitter here at ap bac.
we will land the first airborne force here, and the second here.
the ordinary soldiers are willing but they're officer's priority is to protect diem's regime rather than to stop communist insurgence.
what about all those things that we get, the casualty figures, battle reports, the briefings.
an officer willing to risk his career to tell the truth about vietnam.
he set out to spread the word to everyone and anyone who would listen.
i was assured that i would have an audience with the joint chiefs.
it appears there was a conflict in scheduling and uh, the chairman is anxious to hear your briefings at a later date.
i thought maybe you could have been the kind of father you never had.
make sure i can have a decent home for these kids.
you, you can't roll out the tanks like it's world war ii.
i mean, goddamn, hasn't the pentagon learned anything in three years.
two hundred and forty americans killed, four hundred and seventy wounded.
most of these casualties were suffered in the battle of la drang valley.
well, sir, our conclusion is the enemy is about to strike at the capital.
gentlemen, that is exactly what the enemy wants us to think.
because they're going to lay siege to the marines here at khe sanh with regular forces to trick us into believing that they're going to uh, invade the capital with the vietcong.
we hold back our forces, they overrun the marines for a spectacular victory just like they did the french.
snipers and suicide commandos have the palace, the radio stations, the philippine embassy, four american villas.

that's what we're trying to explain to you if you just uh, pay attention.
john, in all fairness, you've always been an advocate that the u.s. take control here in saigon, yes?
i'm highly confused and i find this contradictory because in fact, with this restructuring the south vietnamese are not in command but you are, mr. vann, while the u.s. forces go out the back door.
no one is going out the back door, i can assure you.
u.s. policy has not changed from day one in terms of our involvement in helping the people of the republic of vietnam.
nixon ordered all american combat troops out of vietnam by june of 1972.
the south vietnamese, although backed by american air support and advisors would have to fight the war themselves.
ten years down the road, we were back to where we started.
maybe five divisions down the ho chi minh trail to here.
we also know that there's heavy artillery, even tanks further north.
he's gonna try to fight this thing in a conventional fashion.
if we can persuade him to send his troops out of these hills around kontum...
then mount a stage retreat back to where we are at kontum.
that will pull these north vietnamese divisions out of the hills and when they do, we are gonna call in the b-52's and carpet bomb each of these squares.
we are gonna wipe out the second, third and fifth division of the north vietnamese army.
my old colleague, colonel ba will conduct the forward command defense and withdrawal.
our strength, as well as our convictions, have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom's cause.
it is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence and, in that contest, we cannot stand aside.
the south vietnamese soldier is a magnificent fighter, highly motivated, tough, and intelligent.
the body counts given to this office are nothing short of remarkable.
i know you're all experienced soldiers but we have been sent here as ad-vi-sors.
their president diem is decent and god-fearing, our god, by the way.
he is emphatic that this is a war between the legitimate vietnamese government and their communist invaders.
now we all know that red china and moscow are behind this, huh?
so we have every right to supply and support these people but it is their fight and they are in charge.
so give them your best cos they are giving us theirs.
president diem has awarded colonel cao the vietnamese cross of gallantry.
we are honoured to have his sister-in-law, madame nhu, who will make the presentation.
"they can never win because they use only those of our people who are also huang phi.
"the peasants are with us because they hate the huang phi."
(broadcaster) american advisors work to bring the level of training and combat readiness of these forces as high as possible.
superior equipment and mobility are used to full advantage to carry the fight to the enemy, swiftly, wherever his presence becomes known.
saigon command has located the enemy's radio transmitter here at ap bac.
we will land the first airborne force here and the second here.
the ordinary soldiers are willing but their officers' priority is to protect diem's regime, rather than to stop communist insurgency.
what about all those things that we get, the casualty figures, battle reports, the briefings?
we supply guns to the peasants and they turn straight around and give them to the vc.
at ap bac we were being shot down by our own weapons.
we must regain the goodwill of the peasants restore the good faith of the people.
to win the war in vietnam, we must take back the rice revolution, throw out the rice dealers and give them back their rice.
often when military men get put in pressure situations, they find themselves in a difficult position.
they see sex as a kind of an outlet, it's a release.
john fitzgerald kennedy, president of the united states, shot by an assassin as he drove through the streets of dallas, texas.
(tv) he is three years old on this day, november 25th.
you can't roll out the tanks like it's world war ii.
i mean, god damn, hasn't the pentagon learned anything in three years?
most of these casualties were suffered in the battle of la draug valley.
the united states is indeed at war, a full-dress war against a formidable enemy.
(burnett) vann threw himself into the war effort with a passion few others could muster.
he ran pacification programmes, mobilised his allies among the south vietnamese forces, coordinated american support and still found time to bombard friends and foes alike with his theories on how to turn the war around.
i'm afraid we are back to where we started, mr vann.
(john) well, god damn it, we'll just have to clear it out again.
nobody's been more critical of how this war's been fought than me.
but you think it's your duty to spread this defeatist loser crap.
well, sir, our conclusion is the enemy is about to strike at the capital.
gentlemen, that is exactly what the enemy wants us to think because they are going to lay siege to the marines here with regular forces, trick us into believing that they are going to invade the capital with the vietcong,
fred, i want you to have every available man ready to move at a moment's notice.
sir, i don't believe a strategist like general giap would risk his troops openly against us.
now cia men and mps have gone into the embassy and are trying to get the snipers out.
we've got two more alert forces that are trying to push him out this way but he's heavily fortified.
(johnson) i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
i, richard milhous nixon, do solemnly swear that i will faithfully execute the office of president of the united states.
well, that's what we're trying to explain to you if you just, er, pay attention.
john, you've always advocated that the us take control here in saigon, yes?
(ambassador) us policy has not changed from day one in terms of our involvement in helping the people of the republic of vietnam.
(burnett) nixon ordered all american combat troops out of vietnam by june of 1972.
the south vietnamese, although backed by american air support and advisors, would have to fight the war themselves.
ten years down the road we were back to where we started, but this time john paul vann was in charge.
intelligence says the enemy's moved large numbers of troops, maybe five divisions, down the ho chi minh trail to here.
we also know that there's heavy artillery, even tanks, further north.
if the south vietnamese troops can't hold the line, it's over.
the south vietnamese are good soldiers, they just need some leadership.
that will pull these north vietnamese divisions out of the hills and when they do, we are gonna call in the b-52s and carpet-bomb each of these squares.
we are gonna wipe out the second, third, and fifth division of the north vietnamese army.
there's not a man in this room, not a man on that line out there i wouldn't die for.
no matter what we've done with our lives, you and i can be proud today because we have the noblest of all professions.
he said no greater love has a man than he lay down his life for another.
and by god this day will not end but i will see you all safely through it and we will hold this ground.
well, you see, steven, there's your truth and there's my truth and they're two different things.
all i know is up that road is old general giap and when he and i speak to each other, we never lie.
he had fought to redeem the unredeemable, to salvage the doomed enterprise called south vietnam.
in death he had triumphed over defeat while the rest of us are left to ask...
vietnam was divided between ho chi minh's communist north... and the southern regime of diem.
the communists launched an insurrection to capture the south... so america sent 11,000 advisors to bolster diem's army.
each one of you will be assigned to a division of the south vietnamese army... to act as a senior advisor.
the south vietnamese soldier is a magnificent fighter... highly motivated, tough and intelligent.
theirs is a splendid effort, and it is our job to support 'em.
i know you are all experienced soldiers, but we have been sent here as... advisors.
he's emphatic that this is a war between the legitimate vietnamese government... and their communist invaders.
we all know that red china and moscow are behind this.
president diem has awarded colonel cao... the vietnamese cross of gallantry.
we are honored to have his sister-in-law, madame nhu... who will make the presentation.
american advisors worked to bring the level of training... and combat readiness of these forces as high as possible.
superior equipment and mobility are used to full advantage... to carry the fight to the enemy swiftly... wherever his presence becomes known.
we're eyeball to eyeball... with the communists all over the world, and these guys are out shooting rabbits.
"general giap's instructions for us... to steal back the rice on behalf of the peasants... has paid great dividends."
at ap bac, we were being shot down by our own weapons.
the u.s. army advisory program... is a complete sham... totally ineffective.
he was our hero, an officer willing to risk his career... to tell the truth about vietnam.
he set out to spread the word to everyone and anyone who would listen.
i was assured that i would have an audience with the joint chiefs.
it appears there was a conflict in scheduling... and the chairman is anxious to hear your briefing at a later date.
everything that goes in and out of here gets accounted for.
you got ten cans of oil, nine sacks of flour, you write it down.
the united states is indeed at war-- a full-dress war against a formidable enemy.
vann threw himself into the war effort with a passion few others could muster.
but you seem to think it's your duty to spread this defeatist loser crap.
oh, winning and losing-- that's what it's all about, isn't it?
fred, i want you to have every available man... ready to move up there on a moment's notice.
sir, i don't believe a strategist like general giap... would risk his troops openly against us.
our cia men and mps have gone into the embassy... and are trying to get the snipers out.
we've got two more alert forces trying to push him out this way... but he's heavily fortified--
the enemy appears to be trying to take over south vietnam.
the vietcong has very deceitfully... taken advantage of the tet truce... in order to create maximum consternation in south vietnam... particularly in the populated areas.
i shall not seek and i will not accept... the nomination of my party for another term as your president.
i, richard milhous nixon, do solemnly swear that i will faithfully... execute the office of president of the united states.
i'm highly confused, and i find this contradictory... because with this restructuring, the south vietnamese are not in command... but you are, mr. vann, while the u.s. forces go out the back door.
no one is going out the back door, i can assure you.
u.s. policy has not changed from day one... in terms of our involvement in helping the people... of the republic of vietnam.
nixon ordered all american combat troops out of vietnam by june of 1972.
the south vietnamese, although backed by american air support and advisors... would have to fight the war themselves.
ten years down the road, we were back to where we started.
if they can break through the line here and head for the sea... they'll have cut our forces in half and have a clear shot at saigon.
if the south vietnamese troops can't hold the line, it's over.
he's gonna try to fight this thing in a conventional fashion.
if we can persuade him to send his troops out of these hills... he'll be vulnerable, and that's where we could crush him.
you and the fuckin' kennedys, the good old boys who sent us here--
now you all want to change your minds because there's blood and guts on tv.
we are gonna hold the line here at tan canh... and mount a stage retreat back to where we are, kontum.
that will pull these north vietnamese divisions out of the hills... and when they do, we are gonna call in the b-52s... and carpet bomb each of these squares.
we are gonna wipe out the second, third and fifth division... of the north vietnamese army.
my old colleague, colonel ba, will conduct... a forward command defense and withdrawal.

he said, "no greater love has a man... than he lay down his life for another."
and by god this day will not end... but i will see you all safely through it... and we will hold this ground.
all i know is up that road is old general giap.
when he and i speak to each other, we never lie.
he personified our good intentions, our arrogance... our courage, and ultimately our folly.
he had fought to redeem the unredeemable-- to salvage the doomed enterprise called south vietnam.
"john paul vann died on june 9, 1972... when his helicopter crashed in a rainstorm."
"three years later, the u.s. ambassador... fled by helicopter from the roof of the embassy in saigon... nas the north vietnamese army entered the city."
it was a very auspicious time when he saw your daughter.
that's why he won the case which was going on for years.
a girl, who loves her brother so deeply can also love my sister just as much.
when on that day, i saw you at the temple, i felt as though god had sent mother's love to my jyoti.
to obey you to do your work, serve you, and to take care of you.
how many times do i tell you, that your place is not at my feet...
- you've got presents for my folks but what about me?
- for you i've got such a nice one that you'll sway all your life!
- the door to my heart opened that's why i shut this door.
you bashed up my brother i didn't feel angry at all.
- and these village folks they listened to all this like some film story.
if the one who was bashed up isn't bothered, why should we?
have you even taken her our for a ride, even once?
she's eager to go out with you but she feels shy to tell you.
the one who wears your ring and lives with you, is known as one's wife.
but this kind of relationship is known as an illicit relation.
when a woman becomes a widow her father gives her a white sari to wear.
take this as that white sari, and take your sister and get lost!
if you love your people more than you love me, then you may go.
but if you wish to remain my wife then take that sari and come in.
it's written that once the wood is placed, it can't be removed.
a daughter has come to see her father for the last time.
a man who sells his sister can make his wife a slut too!
do you wish that tomorrow your sister also becomes a prostitute?
tape was taken at a branch of the republic national bank on west 14th about a half an hour after kevin says he was carjacked.
maybe i'm missing something, but i don't see two black men.
the gas station attendant remembered the kid, but didn't remember any black guys.
and kevin says he wasn't familiar with the city, but two weeks ago his car was ticketed on the lower east side for an expired meter.
i was just leaning against the storefront, catching a smoke, and the window just fell in.
and when the cops showed up 10 minutes later, you were still in there?
kevin, we're all men of the world here, we know how things go with the ladies.
yeah, sometimes they go a little rough, things get out of hand.
that and stickin' a straw up his nose every five minutes.
that kid stanton was scoring off me, for like the last couple of months, but i didn't want him bringing his girlfriend to my crib, so i told him i'll meet him in the park.
not to mention he was damn nearly killed by these animals.
and he didn't want his parents to know he was a speed freak.
i have to talk to him to confirm he was your source.
i'd love to talk to him, too, but he hasn't returned my pages in a week.
a request pursuant to the freedom of information act revealed no warrant for that tap.
it doesn't matter the police got their information from an informant.
detective rivera, i'm gonna look into this wiretap, and if you've lied to me, you better pray i never find out.
so i'm asking you once more, where did you get your information?
your honor, the illegality of the wiretap taints this arrest and any evidence, including statements by either defendant, arising out of that arrest must be suppressed.
even if her client had standing to object to the wiretap of a third party, which he doesn't...
i'd love to have rivera along when i break the news to them.
all the times i've seen narcotics detectives shade the truth on the stand.
well, the way it works in narcotics, a detective will install a tap himself and maybe his partner will know about it, that's it.
what kind of history did rivera have with mathis and benvenidez?
we already know he keeps some of his informants off the books.
i pulled all of his grand jury testimonies from last year, nothing about mathis.
i found a copy of a search warrant application, to be executed the night of may 12th in expectation of finding a half kilo of methamphetamine.
except i can't seem to find a report on the raid.
rivera's always looking to make the big bust, tries to turn every nickel bag collar into the french connection.
so this may 12th thing was supposed to be a career boost?
yeah, so some mope facing a capital charge says that, so what?
so we found a record of a call from a payphone on west broadway.
the phone logs downstairs show a corresponding call being forwarded to the narcotics unit.
and the duty roster shows you catching calls at your desk.
i mean, the taxpayers want the drug problem to go away, so they lean on the politicians.
the politicians want to keep their jobs, so they lean on you guys.
the d.a.s lean on the cops, the cops lean on their snitches.
and sometimes somebody leans a little too hard and somebody gets hurt.
and when questioned about that call, what did detective rivera tell you?
he said that he had received no call from mr. benvenidez, that he may have been in the restroom at the time.
if he wants to rely on the cpl, he should comply with it.
with all due respect, mr. mccoy, what's the harm in letting detective rivera testify?
hell, i was making $5 a week at the hardware store without anybody shooting at me.
assuming you pay $5 a head, that gets us all of seven men.
as i recall, your quiet town was full of drunken scum looking to lynch a man.
if i have to bend the facts a little to keep our town safe and if the next bunch of drunken scum decides to steer clear then it was worth another black mark on your already less-than-stellar reputation, mr. larabee.
you see, i took the liberty of researching your past in my late husband's files.
you read secondhand trash and you think you know a man.
then you read some dime-store novel about kit carson that got you all fired up.
figured you'd come out west, try your hand as a gunfighter.
to find the mystical ace of spades one must become sensitized to its vibration.
now, of course, i will expect you to applaud as i have taught you.
that's real sweet, ma'am but can y'all please cut me down here, please?
the wind blew, the clouds parted and out came the sun.
there are two kinds of people in this life, my friend.
those who seek battle and seem not to fear death like them.
well we gonna raise the stars and bars over that little village.
i want it to be the last thing these boys ever see.
i'm a ghost of the confederacy and i will not die.
he's so full of laudanum, you could chop his head off...
do you think monica realizes how much our parents spent on this?
do you think my sister's teeny, tiny, little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here?
i saw someone that looks just like you on the subway.
i was going to say hi, then i figured he doesn't care he looks like you.
and, by the way, that is not how one addresses a person on the telephone.
first one identifies oneself and then asks for the person with whom one wishes to speak.
somebody is on their way to ruin the wedding, and i have to warn somebody.
so if you don't give me that number, i'm gonna come over there and i'm gonna kick your snooty ass all the way to new gloukenshire!
oh, okay, i'm going to have to kick her ass too.
we're excited that ross and emily are getting married at montgomery hall.
we'll just tell them that there was, like, a problem with, like, the engine.
i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to step aside, miss.

as my lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health until death parts us.
i've ordered chicken, and salad, and cake for a 1 50.
what should be the most wonderfull day of my life is rapidly turning into just sunday with a spectacular amount of food.
if you insist on wearing that in public you're gonna spend the afternoon all by yourself.
if you make me choose between you and the hat, i choose the hat.
i need you to bring me photos of ross and a small piece of chocolate and a glass of tepid water.
is this where you throw stuff in a bag with graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?
i'm afraid i'm going to have to ask you to step aside, miss.
look, if i don't get to london he is gonna marry that other girl.
actually, you guys mind staying here with me for a while?
you know, we gotta get up early and catch the plane to new york.

i know, but i have to tell him how i feel.
he deserves to have all the information to make an informed decision.
i'm afraid i'll have to ask you to step aside, miss.
if i don't get to london, he'll marry that other girl!

this is kind of my little toast or melba toast, if you will.
i knew ross when he was going out with his first girlfriend.
i'm afraid that plane was already put away from the gates.
you call that plane and tell them swing around to pick me up.
you know what we just tell them that was a problem with like "engine".

you know, we gotta get up early and catch the plane to new york.
you know, clearly i have feelings for him, but feelings don't mean love.
you know, i mean, do i still have loving feelings for ross?
but that doesn't mean that i'm still in love with him.

there's definitely something in the works, but the details are encoded.
in order to break the code, we need you to get in here.
when we visited mom... last year at the cemetery, we did something different.
after you put flowers on her gravesite... you found three rocks.
i chose to be the person you saw... the girl who killed her sister.
i still can't say for sure what happened on the landing that day.
you deserve what you're about to get... but i thought you should know your son was never harmed.
you were a good enough father to spare him from knowing who you really are.
of course, i didn't realize it was a choice at the time, but it was.
i chose to be the person you saw... the girl who killed her sister.
that's why you ran away, that's why you don't do it anymore.
it nearly killed her, that's why she doesn't do it any more!
when we visited mom ..., last year in the cemetery, we did something different.
after you put flowers on her gravesite, you found three rocks and put them on too.
that hasn't been decided, but if i have to sacrifice him, i will.
armel is now the de facto leader of a terrorist network.
love dies in the short run, leaving only hate and contempt.
but every time a husband is chopped to pieces we say, "must be the wife." marie hanson is a rich woman.
273 million... add to that the hospital fees for a total of 300,028,000 woolongs.
yes, if you pay up that much, you will be free.
he told us to hand you all of his assets if something happened to him...
if you give us a thumbprint here, everything he owns will be yours.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru ...cannot heal all the tears in it.
kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure someone, cry for me with parched eyes.
you were put in a cold-sleep, in other words cryogenically preserved, until now.
medical technology has finally advanced to a point where you could be fully cured and reawaken.
"there are so many queuing up and i won't let them in"
"look at them, they are cheeky they are never worthy to be saved "
in the event of an unforeseen accident his instructions were to transfer all his assets to you.
if you give us a thumbprint here, everything he owns will be yours.
i mean, when you think about it, he risked his life to save me...
and his debt, well, it was a drop in the bucket compared to mine.
maybe i should have just let them come and arrest me.
i couldn't ask for more than to have you hand me over to the police.
so i claim first rights to him, and the bounty on his head!
is it just me, or did that not make any sense?
however, puberty is the only time to worry about things like that.
only people who are bored think such thoughts after a certain age.

kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure someone, cry for me with parched eyes.
of course it was sad, but there was one thing i really looked forward to... and that was, i got to live alone again.
and i bought myself this little bungalow in hollywood... and i made it my symbol of independence.
well, i set about decorating it... and i wanted to make sure that it was really girly and strongly feminine.
and i wanted it to say to anyone who walked in...
now, for the first year that i had this house, i was still living in new york city.
so i would scrimp and save and send my money back home so that i could decorate it.
- i believed that i'd spend a lot of time alone there... and probably give a lot of little petite soirees... and fabulous gourmet dinner parties.
maybe someone would drink a little bit too much... and i would insist that they spend the night in the guest room... which is just big enough for someone to spend the night in... after a rousing evening of conversation... about, oh, the latest coen brothers movie... or the problems in bosnia with that horrible slobodan milosevic... and a fun game we could all play... where we all name all the justices on the supreme court.
and i immediately moved him into my home and took over taking care of him.
and our brotherjim, who had also moved to los angeles... was over all the time and helping out.
and after a few weeks, our parents, who were naturally distraught... packed up all their bags, drove down from spokane, and moved in.
and for the next nine months... there we all were in my perfect little house made for one.
"julie, i had to get the ingredients for that potato salad...
"so i went to the store, and i had a hard time pulling out of the driveway...
and i'll say, "mom, there was a man lying in my driveway?"
and then she always acts as if i've interrupted the cadence of her story.
and my parents were always coming back there and interrupting me... and i finally had to explain to them... that when they did that, it was like not only having my parents living with me in my home... it was like having my parents with me at my job too.
and so they agreed they would only come back there if it was very, very important.
now, my father was a u.s. attorney... and after his retirement five years ago... he's chosen to spend all of his new free time... listening to national public radio.
he has a little walkman that he keeps on a belt and these headphones.
and like a stereotypical teenager in a movie... he's always off in his own little world.
and recently, he told me that he hasn't missed morning edition once in seven years.
and because of this... it seems as though bob edwards and mara liasson and cokie roberts... are his very best friends.
and i think he has a special fondness for cokie... because he's always saying things like...
and she has a japanese boyfriend there whose name is yamamoto.
and he's a sweet potato farmer, and she calls him "yam" for short.
and while it always sounded really cool and politically correct... when i was growing up...
i would tell my friends that my dad was an expert in indian land law... what i didn't explain to them... was that my dad wasn't exactly on the side of the indians.
and my dad was the guy to swoop in and take it back.
well, there was one big case that got away from my father in his career... and it was against this indian family called the sohapis.
and i always loved that name, 'cause i thought, " what a responsibility to live up to."
and the sohapis had this sacred burial ground... that my father was trying to condemn... because they were putting up this dam nearby, and it was going to flood that area.
well, the sohapis fought valiantly against this, and in the end, they won.
well, this was the big case that got away from my father in his career.
or if i had fresh chunky salsa from traderjoe's in the refrigerator... that would be eaten and replaced with a can of del monte tomato paste... that my mother was sure could double as salsa.
once, i was out in my office and my mother came back there... and she said, "julie, i'm sorry to bother you, but i've been through your kitchen.
now, please keep in mind... that i had spent years in therapy talking about my parents... and learning how to do things like, oh, set boundaries.
but here i suddenly was in this enormous situation... with mike sick and the medical bills mounting and my parents there... and there was nothing i could do... but accept the surreal nightmare that life had become.
uh, one chemo, we called the big chemo... and he got that every three weeks.
and that went into his veins and required him to sit with an i.v. for about four hours.
so almost every day... someone was escorting mike from hollywood out to the ucla cancer center.
plus there were a lot of other things for us to do... like stand in line at social security... to see if we can get the right forms to try to get mike under medi-cal.
mike was actually a master at boundary-setting from a very young age.
in fact, as a teenager, mike had a doorbell installed outside of his bedroom door.
mike was apt to respond, "yes, i could do that on tuesday...
"between the hours of 6:30 and 9:00... but after 9:00, i have other plans."
so for someone like mike, to be sick like that and in my house... with our parents there, it was a particular invasion... and we all just pretended that our parents were down on this extended visit.
mike had this habit of asking each doctor or nurse... the first time he encountered them for their cards... so that he could verify their qualifications... and then he would quiz them on their educational background.
but all i knew is that whenever a new medical professional would enter the room... my stomach would tense up... because i knew at some point, mike would be demanding their card... and then going over their history of work experience.
the doctors prescribed marinol for mike... which is basically marijuana in pill form.
and that's an accepted drug for cancer patients... to help keep their pain down and their appetite up.
but marijuana in pill form doesn't work nearly as effectively... as it does in leaf form.
my parents slept in the guest room, mike slept in my room... and i like to sleep on the pullout sofa out back in the office.
and after a few months, the lines started to cross... between whose house it really was.
and so, like my coffee table and my end tables and my lamps... are all the same things i grew up around.
and to suddenly have my parents living there... and my brothers around all the time... it started to feel more like i was living at home again.
and i hadn't seen him at all for a couple of days.
and it was raining outside... and i was really worried about him.
and he had arranged for me to be honored as mayor for the day... on halloween as pat.
and i had agreed to do this months before mike got sick... and months before the movie came out and it was a bomb... and months before i never wanted to be pat again... as long as i lived... and months before the public had the exact same feeling about me.
so there i was in the pat outfit for the very last time... traipsing down santa monica boulevard... with my brotherjim and mike who was feeling pretty good then... and wearing his traditional halloween ensemble: : a priest outfit.
and i had to get up on the stage, and i was so not into it.
and i think my sad display was even too much for mike... because he left halfway through.
also because he had a date with his radiation therapist... who was meeting him on the corner of robertson and santa monica.
and so, while mike's brain was being radiated... he usually listened to either the crash test dummies... or bach's unaccompanied cello suites.
mike, being the one of us sweeney kids most concerned about his appearance... was naturally distraught when, after the first chemo, he lost all of his hair.
but he was eventually able to develop this look for himself.
and he took to wearing black jeans and a black t-shirt and a black baseball cap.
i mean, you wanna get up and take your vitamins and exercise... and eat your green leafy vegetables and meditate.
but on the other hand, you have this equal urge to be really unhealthy.
i mean, you wanna eat fried foods, drive in fast cars... and take up dangerous sports.
and this one day, i was feeling really stressed out and really down... and i just needed a release of some sort.
and i decided to do something a little unhealthy and dangerous.
and for me, that meant i was gonna smoke myself a cigarette... and buy the new book by the pope.
i'm not really a big fan of this pope, as you could imagine.
but i kind of enjoy disagreeing with him on so many topics.
but it means that i have to really keep up on what he's saying and writing all the time.
and this was the day that the pope's new book had come out.
i suddenly felt that i should get something for on top of it and underneath it... so that it would say to the clerk...
"you know, i'm interested in what the pope has to say, among other things."
and i thought, "well, that's interesting... that someone would take the time to write that book."
and then i thought, "i guess the book i'm looking for is...
and i hesitate to report this to you because... well, because it's embarrassing... and also because i'm really not into scatological humor in any way.
but at just this moment, i suddenly let out the loudest fart.
and it was like a foghorn had gone off at book soup.
and everyone's heads whipped up... and i didn't know what i should do.
i didn't know if i should, you know, flee the scene... or if i should look around like it wasn't me.
but, of course, i just ended up standing there... like a deer caught frozen in the headlights, you know, with the pope's book.
then i tried to make my escape, and he came up behind me and said, "hey, how's mike?"
"is he still running the box office at the groundling theater?
and i took my book up and i paid for it.
you can imagine at this point how much i really, really wanted a cigarette.
so i got out of book soup and i went to this corner market... and i bought this pack of cigarettes.
and i thought, okay, there can be no smell of smoke in the car... because i know the next morning, we're all gonna be loading into it... to take mike to chemo.
so i got into the car, and i started heading east on sunset... and i rolled down all the windows, and i lit up my cigarette.
and, oh, i was enjoying the cigarette like nobody's ever enjoyed a cigarette.
and i opened the back door, and i got the cigarette out of the car and the fire out.
and i walked in the front door, and my mother said, "oh, thank god, you're back.
and my mother said, "i have had it with your father.
"he is driving me crazy, and i am breaking up with him.
"my policy is that when couples come to stay with me at my house...
"they must remain a couple for the duration of their visit.
i do not have enough beds for couples to break up while they visit me."
but sure enough, for the next few nights... my mother insisted on sleeping on the pullout sofa in the living room.
in fact, it has a great exchange just about to come up."
well, in n a lonely place, humphrey bogart plays this hollywood writer... who's suspected of killing a young coat check girl.
and gloria grahame plays this neighbor of his... who ends up providing him with an alibi.
well, when gloria grahame is in the police station... the officer says to her, "why were you keeping an eye out for this bogart character?"
so we watched this scene, and we both really enjoyed it.
and my mother said, "if i were her, i'd stay away from him... because he obviously has a terrible drinking problem."
and he sat down with us and we all continued to watch it.
and a few minutes later, mike came out and joined us on the sofa.
and the l.a. times was tripping across the front porch and into the door.
and we all decided that it was really too late to try to go back to sleep... that we'd just stay up and make oatmeal and toast... and wait for it to be time to take mike to radiation.
well, in the middle of all of this... all of these sleepless nights... doctors' appointments and the noodles with red topping... the most wonderful thing happened.
my good friend david came down from aspen to visit me... and he brought along his brother carl, and he introduced us.
and then i would hang up the phone and go to sleep... and dream that he was running after me in the woods naked with nothing but a bow and arrow.
plus, i figure that if you have as dim a view of the future of civilization as i have... and believe it's all gonna come crashing down in some sort of post-apocalyptic nightmare...
i'm gonna have all the candles lit in the living room... and finger food on the coffee table... and carl and i are gonna be snuggled up on the sofa.
and my mother's gonna walk in and say, "hey, what's on tv tonight?"
or how am i gonna get my father to clear off the dining room table... his 5,000-piece puzzle of a map of sarajevo... that he got for his $50 contribution to n.p. r...
[audience laughing] so that i can pour some wine and look into carl's eyes... deeper, deeper than ever before.
but by the same token... they're not gonna condone me starting up a sexual relationship with someone... right under their noses.
on the other hand, i'm an adult, and it is my house.
then i would come in and sleep on the sofa in the living room... and get up at 6:30 in the morning and have coffee with my dad... and go out to, uh, wake up carl.
carl and i found ourselves playing footsie underneath the dining room table.
well, one day carl and i spent time at will rogers state park.
and we got back to the house, and there was nobody there.
and that was really unusual, because there was always someone at the house.
and we walked in, and i said, "oh, my god, carl, we're all alone.
"but i just noticed that your garbage cans are empty down on the curb.
do you want me to move them up to the side of the house first?"
and afterwards, we came back out to the living room... and carl looked out the front window, and he said...
"julia, your... your garbage cans, they've been moved up to the side of the house."
and look, all of their garbage cans are still empty down on the curb."
and he said, "you don't think that your parents came back here and heard us...
and he was doing really well... with the exception of the spinal tap chemos.
mike had received so many different spinal taps... that scar tissue had built up along his spinal column... and they couldn't access it anymore.
so one day we were at ucla and mike was on the examination table.
and my brotherjim was there and myself and my mother... and my father, who was reading a 50,000-word essay in the new yorker... all about the plague in india, you know, as a diversion.
"i think that we should put a shunt into your forehead...
"which is a plastic opening... so that we can put the chemo directly into the cranial fluid."
"listen, doc, if you think you're gonna put a faucet into my forehead...
you might as well give me a lobotomy at the same time."
and there was this awkward pause, and then my mother chimed in.
and she said, "oh, mike, i don't think it's like a faucet.
and whenever the doctor would come into the examination room... he'd say, "how you doing, mike?"
and mike would say, "i'm not doing too well, doc, but i'll tell you one thing.
and we were always scoping the hallways for the cutest doctors.
and if a doctor treated mike, and he wasn't handsome enough or single... we always asked for a second opinion.
and i could see my mother in the kitchen, cooking... and my father hovered over the dining room table... and mike in my bedroom.
and as i crossed the backyard, i actually considered not telling them... but i didn't know how i was gonna hide having a hysterectomy.
i guess i always thought of my reproductive organs... like this really great, shiny bike that i had in the garage... that i totally was gonna ride someday.
but i'd just never taken the opportunity to ride it yet.
you actually have an advantage of having cancer of a reproductive organ... because you can simply take it out.
it's not like having cancer of the liver or the lungs... which are organs you need for daily existence.
and i mentioned that to my doctor... and he told me that actually some people do get cancer of the fat.
well, my doctor told me to call the cedars-sinai comprehensive cancer center... to make an appointment.
and when i did, the receptionist was a little less than accommodating.
she said, "oh, yes, i have your name down here, miss weeney."
"now, i'm very sorry, but i cannot make an appointment for you right now...
"because it turns out that your cancer is this very, very, rare type of cervical cancer...
and she said, "well, our courier service is taking a very, very long time."
and, well, she really couldn't predict when the slides could be back.
i suppose i could hop over to the pathology building and pick up my slides."
and without seeming to blink an eye or note the irony in that statement, she agreed.
and the next day i left mike in the chemo lounge... and i set about to get my slides.
well, the pathology building at ucla... is this big eight-story building.
and, in fact, everyone was wearing green lab wear and masks.
and the hallways were lined... with what looked to me like big tupperwares filled with lungs.
"yes, um, my name is julia sweeney... and i'm looking for my slides."
and he said, "oh, what research project are you working on?"
- and i said, "oh, dr. fu, here i am." - [audience laughing]
and he said, "gosh, um, well, very rare type of cervical cancer.
do you mind if i take you out for a cup of coffee?"
and i said, "no." so we did go get a cup of coffee.
and he's always so funny, and i was gonna see him the next week.
so i wanted to be able to be sure to say something really nice... about his latest film.
and so i went, and afterwards, i was in a really sour mood... because, well, i had not exactly accomplished my task.
and maybe also because i had cancer and my brother had cancer... and my parents were living with me... maybe that also contributed a little bit to my bad mood.
"the channels are out of sync with the channels of the cable box.
"and i don't know how to fix it, and i want to, because i have a video i want to watch.
"and i'm making soup in the kitchen, and the soup is boiling over on the stove.
and really your father could handle it, but he can't, because he's been drinking."
"but i don't know what kind they like... and you always get mad when i get the wrong thing."
and i realized at this point that rita and frank are underfoot... and they're going, "meow!
and while i was gone, my father had put dry food into the cat food bowls... but it's the dry food that my cats hate.
so i picked it up to throw it out... and my father grabbed the other side of the bowl, and he said, "don't throw it out.
and i said, "even if i was gonna save it, i wouldn't save it in the tupperware."
of course the cat food bowl goes flying into the air, and all the cat food goes everywhere... including into the soup that is boiling over on the stove.
and at this very moment, the phone rings, and i grab it.
and it's my sister meg calling from japan, and she's upset.
and i just love that i not only get to be one of the recipients... of the gift of the national geographic subscription...
i get to also know about all of the trauma and subterfuge around the paying for it.
and if anything wasn't working in the house... or even if a tree was a little droopy out front... we'd say, "gosh, maybe the tree has cancer."
and my black cat, rita... started to inexplicably lose all of the hair on her back and on her sides.
but we took rita to the vet, and the vet couldn't explain why that was happening.
a couple of weeks before this, mike had had a port put into his abdomen... so that we could pump nourishment directly into his stomach... because he was having such a hard time digesting food.
and this was working pretty well... but during this time that we were alone together... one night he suddenly started having a reaction to it.
and he started throwing up and throwing up... and it didn't look like there was any end in sight.
but eventually, at 3:00 in the morning... we both agreed that he just had to go to emergency.
so we got into the car to make that long, long drive... down beverly boulevard to santa monica boulevard... to wilshire boulevard to westwood.
and when you're driving at that time... there is nobody else on the road... and l.a. really becomes the desert that it was always meant to be.
well, mike was sitting in the passenger seat... trying not to throw up in the car... and he was wearing his reservoir dogs t-shirt... which was worn thin and stained by then.
and i was driving and thinking, "now i have cancer too."
and at one point, mike said, "what did i do to deserve this?"
and mike said, "yeah, even christ only suffered for a day."
well, we got to emergency... and they could see that mike was really dehydrated.
but all of the veins in his arms were exhausted... so they were trying to get this needle in up over his ear to get a saline solution in.
and he was continuing to throw up, so it was making it very difficult... and i was looking in the doorway at this.
and it was around this time that the family made this nonverbal shift in our hopes.
and we stopped praying for mike to get better... and we started to pray for an end to his suffering.
"heaven is just that light at the end of the tunnel...
"with that great moment of awareness, and then it's just like that.
and i could hardly wait to share it with someone, and i wanted to tell my mother.
well, i got back to the house, and i couldn't find my mother anywhere... and finally i found her in the back bathroom comet-ing out the tub.
and i said, "yeah, father fitterer said that, you know, if there's no time after death...
"maybe heaven is just that light at the end of the tunnel and then it's just like that.
and i could never understand why she would have that reaction.
but maybe you don't walk into the bathroom of a catholic mother of five... who's comet-ing out the tub and tell her that heaven is an instant.
i was actually opposed to this because i didn't want to send mike a signal... that we didn't think he was going to make it.
but my parents' wishes prevailed, and one afternoon... when i was spending time with mike alone in the hospital... and he was actually having a pretty good day... and we were playing this game of scrabble... in came father sullivan in his roman collar... clearly there to give mike the last rites.
but he just kept on ticking, and the doctor said he would for a while.
he had the heart and lungs of a 31-year-old male... and he was just going to keep on going a bit.
but eventually, even the doctors couldn't explain... why mike was still alive.
and eventually, one doctor suggested that... perhaps it was just psychological at this point.
and i sincerely wanted my parents to just go back home.
i just figured that we were all so sick... of being around people who were sick.
"is that if you are interested in having a biological child one day, you still can.
"we can go in and extract some eggs, and you can mix them with sperm... and then have a surrogate mother have the child for you."
so i said, "how many different sperm donor people could i have?"
and he said, "well, i'm not gonna allow 12 start-up costs."
- so i got out my address book, - [audience laughing] and i thought, "okay, what are the criteria?
"the criteria are, uh... somebody who i know whose number i have,"
"and not only fall in love with them, i would want to spend many, many years with them.
"and not only spend many years with them, i would want to raise a child with them.
"and not only raise a child with them, it would have to be our biological child.
"and then we would hire some woman to have this child... and now, who fits that description?"
i just figured if i could endure the pain on my own... and if i could do the thing where you visualize the pain... and then encompass it and transcend it...
i would really enjoy those percodan a lot more later with a margarita.
i mean, you have to drink all this liquid, and go to the bathroom all the time... and keep these charts about it, and it's just awful.
and one day, i was in the bathroom, and my mother was... on the other side of the closed door, and she leaned in and said...
well, i was finally able to persuade my parents... to just go back home.
i was able to do this partially because... my good friend david, the one who'd introduced me to his brother carl... had decided to come down from aspen to help see me through the radiation process.
and so my parents packed up their bags and loaded up the car, and...
you know, my parents, for me, have always been... either a source of comedy or a reason to be in therapy.
and i've always thought of them as kind of wacky and provincial... and i always jumped on the dysfunctional-family bandwagon... but it wasn't until that year... when the shit really hit the fan... that i saw how ultimately functional they really were.
and when i think of the hundreds of images that i now have in my head... of my father filling out social security forms late into the night... or of my mother whipping up jell-o for mike in the kitchen... or each of them taking one of mike's arms when he was too weak... to walk to the car by himself.
i realized that my feelings for them had deepened so much.
well, david moved into the guest room... for the big radiation extravaganza.
and every morning at 8:45, we'd go to cedars-sinai... so i could get my radiation.
and, you know, david would wait for me in the waiting room... just like i had done for mike.
one morning i woke up... and when you have someone pass away... who's as close to you as mike was to me... it's almost as if the synapses in your brain... don't all get the message all at once.
and especially in that moment of waking... it's like you forget, and then something has to remind you... that they've died.
and one morning i woke up and i walked down the hallway... and my eye caught this glimpse of a picture of mike... and his best friend, andy, in hawaii.
and it was as if i had just heard that mike had died.
i just burst into tears, and i started crying... and david got up, and he didn't know what to do to try to help me.
eventually, he decided to try to help me based on his applied theory... of the fire-stop to me.
and so whenever i'd go in for radiation, we would reminisce about her.
and we remembered when sister antionella taught us emerson... and she made us memorize the quote...
"give me health and a day... and i will make the pomp of emperors ridiculous."
well, i asked her if she knew what had ever happened to sister antionella.
and so every day, as i would lie on the radiation bed...
i would think about sister antionella... and i would wonder how the children were taking her.
well, my radiation finally came to an end... and my energy was restored, and david moved back to aspen... and by ovary came floating by a couple of months later.
and, you know, i talk to my parents much more frequently... than i did before this whole ordeal.
and my mother says she finds herself driving out to holy cross cemetery... all the time to visit mike's grave.
she'll just be running an errand downtown in spokane... and find herself absent-mindedly driving towards the cemetery.
- and i call him my sports connection jesus." - [audience laughing]
well, as you can imagine, things have slowed down considerably... back at my house.
after my radiation ended, my black cat, rita... miraculously grew back all of her hair.
and one day, i opened the door, and there was gus.
- one that said, "hey, mike, where'd you go?" - [audience laughing]
and the next one said, "mike sweeney, where have you been?"
i did a little computer tracking of the hayley circus tour for the last six months.
each town the circus played in was visited by a series of robberies.
because i'll be back in the morning to make out a police report.
and by that time, toots, you better have something more to say than "i don't know."
"the time has come," the walrus said "to talk of many things"

whoever it is, he knew i was checking out that hooker almost before i did.
so i took my time with that son of a bitch.
it wasn't till i showed him all those pieces of himself that he said it.
and i'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls, did they?
but as soon as they had me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing.
i thought i might be able to talk some sense into you.
and i probably would have had to paste you one, and i don't hurt girls.
but she fires up two cigarettes and hands me one. and i taste her lipstick on it.
and suddenly. my heart's pounding so loud i can 't hear anything else.
but why are you willing to go up against roark for someone you barely knew?
she was nice to me, gave me something i didn't even know existed.
i try to slow my heart down and breathe the fire out of my lungs.
my muscles make me a thousand promises of pain to come.
they just keep knocking the carp out of me and waving a confession in my face.
and i keep spitting blood all over it and laughing at how many fresh copies they come up with.
and i forgive you for that without you even asking me to.
there's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's generally not so bad, and finding out that you've been sweet-talked by a total jerk loser who skips out on a wife that he doesn't even tell you about
and he's got four friends out there in the hall, breathing hard and just as drunk as he is.
hey, i could swear i heard somebody in there with you just now.
(shellie) if you're gonna slug me, just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard.
(jackie boy) there you go, lying about me again, right in front of my friends.
i don 't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop. and even if i did.
there's always the outside chance he's one of the honest ones.
unless there's something else you want me to do, you think maybe i could go home?
all this blood and stuff's got me kind of feeling like maybe i'm gonna hurl.
what were they thinking. sticking me with a beat-up bucket of bolts like this?
we were barely able to get the trunk to stay closed as it was.
it and the 35 years of protecting and serving and tears and... blood and terror, triumph that represents
i'm thinking of aileen's slow smile about the thick fat steak she picked up at the butcher's today
i'm thinking about the one loose end i haven't tied up
a young girl who's out there somewhere helpless in the hands of a drooling lunatic
you would risk engendering an ill will on the part of our employers
burt shlubb and douglass klump 2 any-job-there-is thugs with dellusions of eloquance
well i'm going to find that son of a bitch that killed you and i'm going to give him the hard good-bye
walk down the right back alley in sin city and you can find anything
nancy's just getting started with her gig, but already the crowd's breathing hard
plenty of nights i've drooled over nancy shoulder to shoulder with all the other losers like me
he just had the rotten luck of being born in the wrong century
he'd be right at home on some ancient battlefield, swinging an axe into somebody's face
so i guess when i shot you in the belly, i aimed a little too high
you keep holding out on me like this, and i'm going to have to get really nasty
i don't want to keep you up all night, so i'll just fill you in on the latest batch
these here hands of mine, they got blood all over them
when you got a condition, it's bad to forget your medicine
the cold thing, it creeps into my gut and tells me one more time it won't let go
so i took my time with that son of a bitch
it wasn't until i showed him all those pieces of himself that he said... just a name
and i'll bet those cops didn't do a damn thing about those other girls tonight
but as soon as they hit me for a fall guy, they showed up, guns blazing
i'm too dumb to put the whole picture together yet, but... she fires up 2 cigarettes and hands me one and i taste her lipstick on it and suddenly my heart's pounding so loud i can't hear anything else
i wanna reach over and touch her and taste goldie's sweat 1 more time but she isn't goldie
everybody knows what's coming but they go through the motions anyway, what a waste of time
month's fall off the calandar while i breath and eat through tubes
night after night i wait for someone to come and finish me off
after awhile i realize it's not going to be so easy as that
i break his arm in 3 places and i sign it
from then on, it's the circus everybody wants it to be
yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death
would you get a move on, i haven't got all night
and i forgive you for that without you even asking me to
there's a difference between getting honked off at a guy who's generally not so bad and... finding out that you've been sweet talked by a total jerk loser who skips out on a wife he doesn't even tell you about every time
and he's got 4 friends out there in the hall, breathing had and just as drunk as he is
i could swear i heard somebody in there with you just now
some of my best friends... but you are really pushing my buttons and the whole time you've been doing me like this
i've been too polite to point out that at any time i want to
if you're going to slug me, just go ahead and get it over with, you sick bastard
there you go, lying about me again, right in front of my friends
hi, i'm shellie's new boyfriend and i'm out of my mind
you ever so much as talk to shellie again, you even think her name, and i'll cut you in ways that'll make you useless to a woman
but i can't just go home and forget about it and let jackie boy and his pals have their fun
they're a pack of predators, and they're out for blood tonight
that's a good way to get yourself noticed and if you're a murderer with a new face whose 1 fingerprint check away to the fast track to the gas chamber, like i am... the last thing you want is to get noticed
i don't have nearly enough cash on me to bribe this cop and even if i did, there's always the outside chance he's 1 of the honest ones
an explosion that blasts away the dull gray years between the now and that 1 firey night when she was mine
a hard top, with a decent engine, and make sure it's got a big trunk
we were barely able to get the trunk to stay closed as it was, we packed it so tight
there wasn't anything we could do but pile jackie boy in right next to me
and soon, you and all your retched kind will serve him as well
now get dressed and shed a tear for dwight mccarthy if you must because by now, he is surely dead
we got to find out who it is and rescue gail
but first we got to get our hands on jackie boy's head before it gets to wherever it's going and then this whole situation blows wide open
not because they deserve it. not because it'll make the world a better place
we need a heap of bloody bodies so when mob boss, wallenquist, looks over his charts of profits and losses, he'll see what it cost him to mess with the girls of old town
lying big and getting the whole damn world to play along with you
once you got everybody agreeing with what they know in their hearts ain't true, you get them by the balls
i told them that you saved me from that rourk creep
but they won't even check me out to see if i'm still a virgin
don't visit me, don't write me, don't even say my name
if you won't let me visit, but i'll still write to you, hartigan
this is nothing but a price i promised myself i'd pay, and i'm paying it
you don't save a little girl's life, and turn around and throw her to the dogs
bob and i get along with our fond farewells to eachother
and i go looking for the only human being on the planet that means a damn to me
has rourk gone through all this trouble to torture an old man?
like a kid poking at fly when he's already torn its wings off?
closest thing to a clue is a pack of matches from a louzy salloon
it's a long shot, but maybe she's got some friends there
he spent a fortune hiring every expert on the planet to grow back that equipment you blew off from between my legs
just so the old fart can hold out some kind of hope of having a grandkid
irrelevent to said mission, is the following queary which i now put forth to you
where in this most streamlined and trunkless of transports, boner inspiring though it may be, where in, are we to reposit our recently deceased cargo?
i found that has a factory alien ammunition in the region and it seems that the plant enters operating in 31 hours.
and if it does, the creatures go stay in great advantage here.
perhaps, is what is missing to manage to drive us out.
we are the only unit you can get there in time, folks.
and when the earth could finally be at peace, the beasts came and put everything all this at risk.
so, when you feel tired and hungry and even with a little of fear, think about it and never forget!
it's all right... it is better to err on the side ...
well, it will be increasingly difficult, there may be many pitfalls ahead.
from what i can tell, sir, the valve internal exhaust is blocked.
each time it was triggered, the internal pressure increased, until the passage closed.
i know it has many people on earth who believes not if you need more war ...
but it takes more than a few decades peace to change human nature.
but if you lose your confidence, you become a drag on this group and to herself.
you're second in command because i trust you to protect me.
i think that's one thing about this record, is this... evryone got individual efforts on this record.
evrybody got to be part of this one in a new kind of way
we kinda stopped doing all the things that we felt, we were obliged to do.
in terms of press, and in terms of feeling like we had to go tour
usually i just kinda come here with the riffs and ideas that i like.
i still think that, the same riff that i would have liked eight years ago i would still like now
i get excited, if he gets really intense or something like that or afraid, if he gets...
i've gotten kinda afraid of him few times on stage as he' gotten so intense, and i was like
but then there was probably a middle period where we didin't write some much.
the middle records and so maybe the third record, i think it was just writing a bunch of songs on the guitar myself and...
the most inspirational time of song might be the inception of the song, you know.
when actually, it was like the song was given so to speak.
- i remember on our second record we sold almost a milion records a week, or something like that.
that really freaked me out cause i had no... perception what that was.
the christmas tree, i wish i was the star that went on top
i wish i was the evidence, i wish i was the sound
i wish i was the full moon shining off your camaro's hood
i wish i was an alien been at home behind the sun
i wish i was the souvenir you kept your house key on
i wish i was the pedal brake that you depended on
i wish i was the verb 'to trust' and never let you down
i wish i was a radio song, the one that you turned up
i turned and locked the front door no way in or out
i turned and walked the hallway and pulled the curtains down
this is randy peone on krez radio... the voice of the coeur d'a lene indian reservation... and it's time for the morning traffic report on this rainy bicentennial fourth of july.
let's go out to lester fallsapart in the krez traffic van... broken down at the crossroads.
and victor joseph was just a baby too... when his father saved me from that fire.
you know, there are some children who aren't really children at all.
it's 45 degrees in the sun... it's 8:00 a.m., indian time, in 1998... and it's time for the morning traffic report.
for that let's go to lester fallsapart at the krez traffic van... broken down at the crossroads since 1972.
you know, thomas said he'll give me the money... but he wants to go with me.
you know, people always told me i make the best fry bread in the world.
back during' the vietnam war, he was demonstrating' against it... and there was this photographer there.
he took a picture of arnold that day, and it made it onto the wire services... and was reprinted in newspapers throughout the country.
he holds a rifle above his head, captured in that moment... just before he proceeded to beat the shit out of... the national guard private lying' on the ground beneath him.
another demonstrator holds a sign, just barely visible over his left shoulder.
at first they charged him with attempted murder... but then they plea-bargained that down to assault with a deadly weapon.
and then they plea-bargained that down to bein' an indian in the twentieth century.
old lady harrison, she used to tie that dog up, but-- lmagine if they had a baby.
it wouldn't know whether it was a cog or a dat. [ chuckles ]
these are our seats now, and there ain't a damn thing you can do about it.
so why don't you and super lnjun there... find yourself someplace else to have a powwow.
then old harry truman drops the bomb... and we gotta keep on walkin' somewhere.
'cept it's all bright now, and we can see exactly where we're goin'.
but old neil armstrong shows up and boots us off into space.
then your mom gets that phone call about your dad bein' dead... and geez, your dad's gotta be livin' in mars, arizona.
i work for indian health service... but i don't know if i have a job anymore.
i haven't been back to work since... i found your dad.
we didn't have a whole lot of food... just a little bit of deer meat, a huge vat of mashed potatoes... some coke and fry bread.
but the fry bread made all the difference in the world.
you see, a good piece of fry bread... turned any meal into a feast.
everybody sat at the tables... waitin' for the cooks to come with the fry bread.
these jesuits had on their white collars and their black robes... and they were pretty damn good.
by the way they were playing... i could've swore they had seven out of twelve apostles on their side.
they were beatin' up on him and chanting' at him... like he was possessed or somethin'.
maybe victor was possessed by the spirit of jim thorpe... because he had this look in his eye, and he was mean.
twelve years old, and he was like some kind of indigenous angel or somethin'.
'cept maybe his wings were made out of tv dinner trays!
well, your dad and i... we went to check it out last year.
all sorts of indians there, thousands of 'em... more indians than i've ever seen in one place.
i kept thinkin' "l wish we'd been this organized when columbus landed."
your dad and i were sittin' way up high in the stands.
he never liked to get too close to anything, you know?
and then, the powwow emcee, he called for a ladies' choice dance.
i got to pick my partner, and i picked your dad.
there were mothers and fathers dancing... and brothers and sisters... there were some sweethearts, then there was your dad and me.
i thought we were leavin' in a bad way... but victor didn't seem to care a bit.
he just drove all day and didn't say a word to me... even though i told him a thousand stories... about suzy and drought... about his mother and hunger... about his father and magic.
we do have another statement here by a mrs. penny cicero.
it says here that her husband is-- and i quote-- "a complete asshole."
yeah, we've been gone 6 days, 12 hours and 32 minutes.
you know, thomas, i, uh-- l wanna thank you for everything.
this is randy peone on krez radio... the voice of the coeur d'alène indian reservation... and it's time for the morning traffic report on this rainy bicentennial fourth of july.
let's go out to lester fallsapart in the krez traffic van... broken down at the crossroads.
and victor joseph was just a baby too... when his father saved me from that fire.
you know, there are some children who aren't really children at all.
it's 45 degrees in the sun... it's 8:00 a. m., indian time, in 1998... and it's time for the morning traffic report.
for that let's go to lester fallsapart at the krez traffic van... broken down at the crossroads since 1972.
i want to congratulate frenchy... and all those used car dealers in spokane are eagerly awaiting your arrival.
it's 7:35 a. m., indian time, and time for the weather report.
durin' the '60s, arnold joseph was the perfect hippie... because all the hippies were tryin' to be indians anyway.
but because of that, he was always wondering' how anybody would know... when an indian was tryin' to make a social statement.
in that photograph, arnold is wearin' bell-bottoms and a flowered shirt... his hair in braids, with red peace symbols... splashed across his face like war paint.
he holds a rifle above his head, captured in that moment... just before he proceeded to beat the shit out of... the national guard private lying' on the ground beneath him.
i don't mean to brag... but i was every bit as good as mary lou.
in 1984 i tried out again... and mary lou beat me that time... but i had grown, you know?
it was afternoon, you know... but i still had the grand slam breakfast.
two eggs, two sausages... two slices of bacon... and two pancakes.
then old harry truman drops the bomb... and we gotta keep on walkin' somewhere.
'cept it's all bright now, and we can see exactly where we're goin'.
but old neil armstrong shows up and boots us off into space.
then your mom gets that phone call about your dad bein' dead... and geez, your dad's gotta be livin' in mars, arizona.
we didn't have a whole lot of food... just a little bit of deer meat, a huge vat of mashed potatoes... some coke and fry bread.
but the fry bread made all the difference in the world.
you see, a good piece of fry bread... turned any meal into a feast.
everybody sat at the tables... waitin' for the cooks to come with the fry bread.
me and my boy victor... we were playin' two-on-two basketball against these jesuits.
these jesuits had on their white collars and their black robes... and they were pretty damn good.
those jesuits didn't have a prayer of stopping' him fair and square.
victor was only 12 years old and kind of small... so those jesuits were beatin' up on him real good.
they were beatin' up on him and chanting' at him... like he was possessed or somethin'.
maybe victor was possessed by the spirit of jim thorpe... because he had this look in his eye, and he was mean.
12 years old, and he was like some kind of indigenous angel or somethin'.
'cept maybe his wings were made out of tv dinner trays!
all sorts of indians there, thousands of 'em... more indians than i've ever seen in one place.
i kept thinkin' "i wish we'd been this organized when columbus landed. "
your dad and i were sittin' way up high in the stands.
he never liked to get too close to anything, you know?
and then, the powwow emcee, he called for a ladies' choice dance.
i got to pick my partner, and i picked your dad.
after victor butchered his hair... he thought the ceremony was over... so he tore me from sleep at sunrise... and we left phoenix without tellin' suzy good-bye.
i thought we were leavin' in a bad way... but victor didn't seem to care a bit.
well, geez, we probably should get out of town then, ain't it, victor?
well, it looks like you boys got yourself into some serious trouble here.
well, i have this complaint... signed by a mr. burt cicero.
and mr. cicero alleges... that mr. joseph assaulted him soon after the accident... and that you were drunk.
it says here that her husband is- and i quote- "a complete asshole".
i'd say mr. cicero doesn't have much of a case here against you.
well, i was thinkin' about doin' the same thing myself... but i never thought of my father as a salmon.
i mean, i thought it would be just like cleaning out the attic, you know?
this is randy peone on krez radio... the voice of the coeur d'a lene indian reservation... and it's time for the morning traffic report on this rainy bicentennial fourth of july.

it was afternoon, you know... but i still had the grand slam breakfast.
two eggs, two sausages... two slices of bacon... and two pancakes.
[ thomas ] hey, victor, what do you remember about your dad?
i remember one time we had this fry bread eating' contest... and he ate 15 pieces of fry bread.
you're always tryin' to sound like some damn medicine man or something.
i mean, how many times have you seen dances with wolves?
man, he was about the toughest cowboy of them all, ain't it?
you know, in all those movies... you never saw john wayne's teeth.
i mean, columbus shows up... and we start walkin' away from that beach, tryin' to get away.
and then custer moves into the neighborhood... drivin' down all the property values and--
you know, the only thing more pathetic than indians on tv... is indians watching' indians on tv.
[ victor ] so, suzy, what are you doin' out here?
but the fry bread made all the difference in the world.
you see, a good piece of fry bread... turned any meal into a feast.
everybody sat at the tables... waitin' for the cooks to come with the fry bread.
they waited... and waited... but you see, there was a hundred indians at that feast... and only 50 pieces of fry bread.
me and my boy victor... we were playin' two-on-two basketball against these jesuits.
these jesuits had on their white collars and their black robes... and they were pretty damn good.
by the way they were playing... i could've swore they had seven out of twelve apostles on their side.
because every time i tried to shoot the ball... there was a storm of locusts come flyin' in and blind me.
victor was only 12 years old and kind of small... so those jesuits were beatin' up on him real good.
they were beatin' up on him and chanting' at him... like he was possessed or somethin'.
all sorts of indians there, thousands of 'em... more indians than i've ever seen in one place.
i kept thinkin' "l wish we'd been this organized when columbus landed."
your dad and i were sittin' way up high in the stands.
he never liked to get too close to anything, you know?
and then, the powwow emcee, he called for a ladies' choice dance.
i got to pick my partner, and i picked your dad.
[ thomas narrating ] after victor butchered his hair... he thought the ceremony was over... so he tore me from sleep at sunrise... and we left phoenix without tellin' suzy good-bye.
i thought we were leavin' in a bad way... but victor didn't seem to care a bit.
he just drove all day and didn't say a word to me... even though i told him a thousand stories... about suzy and drought... about his mother and hunger... about his father and magic.
and then i told victor... i thought we were all travelin' heavy with illusions.
but he also said basketball was the only thing you were ever gonna be good at.
you know, thomas, i'm really sick and tired of you tellin' me... all these stories about my dad like you knew him.
i mean, your dad left her, sure, but you left her too.
and you're worse 'cause you still live in the same house with her!
hey, a wreck's a wreck. i got cousins who've been in a dozen car wrecks.
old lester fallsapart has been in a car wreck every year of his life.
well, i have this complaint... signed by a mr. burt cicero.
and mr. cicero alleges... that mr. joseph assaulted him soon after the accident... and that you were drunk.
it says here that her husband is-- and i quote-- "a complete asshole."
i'd say mr. cicero doesn't have much of a case here against you.
well, i was thinkin' about doin' the same thing myself... but i never thought of my father as a salmon.
i mean, i thought it would be just like cleaning out the attic, you know?
¶ outta my way, outta my day outta your mind and into mine
¶ into no one, into not one into your step but outta time
i mean, he has discipline, he's working jump shots, 15- to 18-footers, the kind of shots that work within our system.
this all you can tell us about mccarron, his jump shot?
but if that's the worst thing your child does is practise basketball all day,
i think you have to consider yourself lucky as a parent.
then stivers has a guy that dies two nights ago, and it turns out that he is an enforcer for georgia rae.
so, that makes it a grand total of five unsolved drug murders, all on the eastside, all with a mahoney connect.
the lieutenant's like a sphinx when it comes to his personal life.
mccarron's dead one night his father's talkin' about what a tragedy it is he didn't sign an nba contract.
anyone's got a kid blessed with a talent, they're gonna be serious about it.
a bunch of fat, balding geezers in $50 seats is what ruined sports today.
a child's good at math or violin, nobody makes a stink over him being talented.
you give him a ball and he goes pro, that's the world coming to an end?
now, we could snatch him up right now, but i'd like to where he lays his head.
that way, if we get an address, we stand a better chance of recovering the murder weapon.
you don't call back, so i decided to personally make the acquaintance.
i'll say this much, you got some stones to tape conversations with city judges.
you roll up on me with two hundred kilograms and it's mistake?
well... you haven't by chance killed anybody in baltimore lately, have you?
then him and his friends carry me and they throw me into the girls' locker room, where all these girls from my homeroom are showering from gym class.
it ain't so much that he does that with the athletic tape, but then all the girls gotta laugh at me, too...
and i don't want to shoot him, but when he sees me, and i'm holding the gun and i've had the gun before in my hands.
cos some nights i'm thinking i could stop it all myself.
'so i just want him to know that i'm serious about all this crap ending.'
i point the gun at him, but he knows what's going on.
and that's why it rains, because the earth and the sky are always trying to get back together.
mrs. ferriter told me that after my mother died, a long time ago, before i met nora and jim.
it could be souped up and driven again in the afterlife.
these people had the notion you can't drive into the afterlife.
it was the iron age... and you had to do a lot of nasty things just to get by.
the ritual sacrifice of animals and humans was all the rage.
they really look like they're, like they're having a good time, you know?
bouncing a ball around and chewing on stuff and panting and happy, you know?
rangers, dark specter's holding zordon on the planet hercuron, sector 446.78.
when you get this message, come quickly, there's very little time before-- huh?
now i can transform all the other people back to their original state.
andros, i found away to convert the people back to their human form.
hmm, let's see now, all i need, is something to test it with.
oh, you'll find me, red ranger, and it will be the last thing you'll ever find.
once darkonda discovered he was a ranger in disguise, a ferocious battle ensued for possession of the keycards.
during the fight, the ranger got the keycards back from darkonda.
we're gonna have such a good time, just wait till you see.
millions of my eggs have been buried beneath the streets of angel grove.
the fruit juices would be the healthiest but you young folks probably don't want that.
they have sodas and milkshakes, and you know those fizzies that tickle your nose, they're just so tasty, i love 'em.
an asteroid of this size travelling at this speed hit earth with devestating effect.
the impact formed a cloud of dust and water that covered the entire planet, shutting out all of the sunlight necessary to sustain life.
wait, you don't actually think i'm going to get inside that thing and take off, do ya?
unless you want to be blasted into smithereens by the asteroid.
you are supposed to be fighting the rangers, not each other.
that's what i was doing, but he couldn't stand to see.
but astronema expects me to bring you home, and i have one more use for you.
go ahead, my green friend, tell her i attacked you, and she'll throw me out.
i'll be happy to tell you where she is, but first i'll need to have those keycards!
looks like you're going to have to come and get them!
you may have escaped, yellow ranger, but you haven't gotten away.
maybe, but now you have to deal with all of us.
yeah, but where are we going to find one right now?
wait, what if we use their energy and turn it back agains them?
- [ nervous laughing ] - [ grunting ] [ screams ]
both the rangers and dark specter will soon bow down at my feet.
- they may be able to disguise their colors but not their voices.
right, we'll find them and destroy them once and for all.
it was probably the best and the worst thing about her.
with gia, it was always about the sex... every look, every move, every minute.
it was the right moment... and being of the moment is everything in fashion.
but of course, the more you were of the moment... the faster you become of the past.
because if you let it be about you, you're screwed, you know.

i want you to look more beautiful... than you have ever looked.
and i want you to tell the world... that you once had a drug problem and now you don't.
but what do you do with a woman who has no love for you?
she is my lost captive... and no longer lies along my legs."
i'm some kid from ohio... reading fashion magazines, looking at your picture and thinking...
"i'm supposed to look like that"... and going fucking crazy because i don't.
well, we're really just finding things out... and you're the first woman i've known about.
although, intravenous drug users seem too be in a specially high-risk group.
i didn't want people to remember her like that... because i didn't want people to see her like that.
i wanted them to remember her as beautiful... because that's what she really was.
she always followed her instincts... no matter where they took her.
it was probably the best and the worst thing about her.
you know, all of a sudden, her face was just everywhere.
every model has a moment-- l mean, the ones who make it at all.
it was the right moment... and being of the moment is everything in fashion.
but of course, the more you were of the moment... the faster you become of the past.
in fact, talking at all is not really required in this profession... or even encouraged.
anything you might have to say you say through the camera... the image, huh... and hopefully the product.
oh, darling... if i could answer that for you or for me... well, life on this planet would be a very different proposition.
so i tell her, "look... i know calvin... and i asked him about you... and he didn't know who you were."
even if you were looking for it, which not too many people were.
even if you found it... which not too many people did... even if it was right there in front of you... how could you see it with all this sex in the way?
oh, yeah, she told me all the gossip about all the models.
you know, who had bad skin and who had bad hair.
because if you let it be about you, you're screwed, you know.
so, you have to stay separate from what's happening... and you have to be somewhere else.

she always followed her instincts no matter where they took her.
it was probably the best and the worst thing about her.
if you ask me, she never really had sex with anybody.
but she did love to be photographed, and people loved to take pictures of her and do little things for her.
in fact, talking at all is not really required in this profession or even encouraged.
anything you might have to say you say through the camera, the image, and hopefully the product.

the only thing you have to remember is that it's not about you.
it's not about you. lt's not you that they're looking at.
so, you have to stay separate from what's happening and you have to be somewhere else.
but i don't know where that somewhere else is, you know?
you could go to ford and there's always that asshole over at ellte.
but i think you should put some serious thought into coming with me.
i want you to look more beautiful than you have ever looked.
and i want you to tell the world that you once had a drug problem and now you don't.
"when she kisses me, i feel all four winds blow at my face.
"but what do you do with a woman who has no love for you?
but just remember this, everything i did, i did because i loved her.
and i belive that it was my love and my prayers that got her through that.
well, we're really just finding things out and you're the first woman i've known about.
although, intravenous drug users seem to be an especially high- risk group.
we found an undertaker, and it was hard, believe me, you know, because of the aids.
i didn't want people to remember her like that because i didn't want people to see her like that.
it was probably the best and the worst thing about her.
with gia, it was always about the sex... every look, every move, every minute.

nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want dye packs. i don't want bait money.
start with the second drawer, and then the one over there, under the money counter.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?
so you figure, mira, we wait till super bowl sunday, they have that fence built... then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?
so why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?
- listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
- well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars,
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve, and that violates his civil rights.
- you can step in, work full-time as one of my investigators.
why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?
- the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt. lf they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
you must really see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow, huh?
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
there's nothin' l can do about it, so it's up to you.
- um, we're in civilization now, so you can ease up a little bit.
i'm sorry. i'd like you to wait in the car, please.
- l don't know why you got glenn involved in this.
- how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
foley's not gonna make it, and if he goes down, you go with him.
- now, look. i can understand if you guys are close, but-
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.
ref don't call it soon, snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
that's nice of you to offer, karen, but... i got all the help i can use right now.
instead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
- when i got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud, i didn't really get no props for that.
but ever since i shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it's like my dun and broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.
you can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.
i could leave it with the swat guy that answers the door.
that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
how do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man. lt's like i've, uh, vertically integrated myself, you know, diversified and shit, and now i'm into the occasional grand larceny,
oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
oh, i'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother i'm gonna need, uh,
- glenn, i know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay, but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
you don't like what i'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, or what you think you're going to get out of this- here's the deal:
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
so it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?
i don't know. i never used a gun before in my life.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?
look, jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
married some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go, and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
- okay, so now you're gonna... bust me for pickin' up a car, what the-
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
ah, you need love now just the same as i do
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
if you don't do exactly what i tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all...
i'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
he's gonna wait until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
he got this guy who says you know him, from lompoc...
you'd meet doctors, lawyers... nothing wrong with them, if they're divorced.
karen, why waste your time on some cowboy cop... who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?
why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?
- the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt.
if they do... they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
he must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.
so, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.
"i'm mad as hell, and i'm not gonna take any more of your shit!"
in that part where they get shot, i can remember thinkin' to myself... thinkin', "hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to."
i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.
ref don't call it soon, snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.
any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million... he says anything, i'm all fuckin' ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm... five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
he said, quote... that i can get my hands on it at any time.
if he falls on anything, snoop... then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight... and you're still gonna get nothin'.
you know, last time i checked, man... this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.
you can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.
i could leave it with the swat guy that answers the door.
that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.i. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
how do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn... and we find a window to throw him out of.
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills... not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that.
oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
oh, i'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother i'm gonna need, uh...
i know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay... but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
you don't like what i'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not... guess what else you gonna do?
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.
you'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.
well, you're the reason, my friend, that i don't keep all my money in the bank.
so listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together... you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the f.b.i.?
i go to the f.b.i., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?

and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go... and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
all right, so then i would have said yes, but for all you know...
i could have had a swat team waiting for you... why would you trust me?
i know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.
i doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.
if you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer... you wouldn't even know who i am.
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
we gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?
you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
they're putting up another fence 1 5 feet back the fence that's already there.
so if on super bowl sunday, they have that fence built then we have to dig, what, another nine, ten days?
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.

guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
that's nice of you to offer, but i got all the help i can use right now.
let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.
next thing i knew, paramedics were pulling me out of the car.
there's a couple of points i wonder about concerning the two guys who grabbed you.
getting put in here for credit fraud i didn't really get no props for that.
but ever since i shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it's like my dun and broadstreet shot way the fuck up.
ray's working with the f. b. l. task force on the prison break.
tell me, ray, do you ever wear one that says "undercover"?
you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
i'll tell you once we get one other brother i need.
you wanna go pop some crack dealer pissed you off that is your problem, not mine.
i know you supposed to be cool but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without you.
if i say you do this motherfucker to show me you got balls, guess what else you gonna do?
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, but here's the deal.
buddy and i get half of anything we get off of ripley.
it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun.
i don't know. i never used a gun before in my life.
glenn deals with the snoop, while we off livin' the good life.
you know anybody who's done one last big score and then gone on to live the good life?
all right, take one of those big envelopes and put as many 100s, 50s and 20s as you can into it.
nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want dye packs. i don't want bait money.
he's gonna wait until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
he got this guy who says you know him, from lompoc--
you'd meet doctors, lawyers-- nothing wrong with them, if they're divorced.
karen, why waste your time on some cowboy cop... who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt. lf they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
he must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.
so, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.
"l'm mad as hell, and i'm not gonna take any more of your shit!"
in that part where they get shot, i can remember thinkin' to myself, thinkin', "hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to."
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
there's nothin' l can do about it, so it's up to you.
- um, we're in civilization now, so you can ease up a little bit.
i'm sorry. i'd like you to wait in the car, please.
- l don't know why you got glenn involved in this.
- how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
foley's not gonna make it, and if he goes down, you go with him.
- now, look. i can understand if you guys are close, but--
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.
ref don't call it soon, snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
that's 'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waitin' to make her move.
you're just jealous 'cause it was me in the trunk with her...
if he falls on anything, snoop, then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight... and you're still gonna get nothin'.
you know, last time i checked, man, this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.
you can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.
i could leave it with the swat guy that answers the door.
that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
how do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man. lt's like i've, uh, vertically integrated myself, you know, diversified and shit, and now i'm into the occasional grand larceny,
oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
oh, i'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother i'm gonna need, uh,
- glenn, i know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay, but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
you don't like what i'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, or what you think you're going to get out of this-- here's the deal:
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
so it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?
i don't know. i never used a gun before in my life.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?
look, jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
married some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go, and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
i know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.
i doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.
- yeah, the plan was... to pick him up at his office tomorrow... and drive him out to his house in bloomfield hills.
and now i don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?
if you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who i am.
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
we gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?
you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
if you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.
that is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was.
ah, you need love now just the same as i do
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
how can you lose with the stuff you use lt's your thing do what you wanna do
i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing, yeah do what you wanna do
if you don't do exactly what i tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all...
i'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
he's gonna wait until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
he got this guy who says you know him, from lompoc...
you'd meet doctors, lawyers... nothing wrong with them, if they're divorced.
karen, why waste your time on some cowboy cop... who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?
why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?
- the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt.
if they do... they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
he must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.

in that part where they get shot, i can remember thinkin' to myself... thinkin', "hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to."
i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.
ref don't call it soon, snoop's gonna send this cat out in a body bag.
any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million... he says anything, i'm all fuckin' ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm... five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
he said, quote... that i can get my hands on it at any time.
if he falls on anything, snoop... then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight... and you're still gonna get nothin'.
you know, last time i checked, man... this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.

that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.i. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
how do they twinkle their toes, then, if it's fake, mira?
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn... and we find a window to throw him out of.
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills... not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that.
oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
oh, i'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother i'm gonna need, uh...
i know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay... but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
you don't like what i'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not... guess what else you gonna do?
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.
you'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.
well, you're the reason, my friend, that i don't keep all my money in the bank.
so listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together... you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the f.b.i.?
i go to the f.b.i., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.

and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go... and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
all right, so then i would have said yes, but for all you know...
i could have had a swat team waiting for you... why would you trust me?
i know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.
i doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.
if you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer... you wouldn't even know who i am.
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
we gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?
you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence thas already there, you know?
so you figure, mira, we wait till super bowl sunday, they have that fence built... then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?
so why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?
- listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
- well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars,
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve, and that violates his civil rights.
- you can step in, work full-time as one of my investigators.
thas if they get set up in time, which i doubt.
if they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
if it turns out i get shot like a dog, is gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
you must really see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow, huh?
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
there's nothin' i can do about it, so is up to you.
- i don't know why you got glenn involved in this.

- okay, so now you're gonna... bust me for pickin' up a car, what the...
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
- yeah, the plan was... to pick him up at his office tomorrow... and drive him out to his house in bloomfield hills.
and now i don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?
if you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.
that is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was.
nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want dye packs. i don't want bait money.
start with the second drawer, and then the one over there, under the money counter.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?
so you figure, mira, we wait till super bowl sunday, they have that fence built... then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?

i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.
- every time he opens his mouth, i wanna punch him out.
any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million, he says anything, i'm all fuckin' ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
he said, quote, that i can get my hands on it at any time.
that's nice of you to offer, karen, but... i got all the help i can use right now.
instead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
- when i got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud, i didn't really get no props for that.
but ever since i shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it's like my dun and broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.l. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinkin', if i was glenn, and i was up there... to take down the ripper, where would i go?
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. lt's nice, man.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not, guess what else you gonna do?
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.
you'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.
well, you're the reason, my friend, that i don't keep all my money in the bank.
so listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together, you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the f.b.l.?
i go to the f.b.l., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
that's why she stopped praying for all the lost souls, since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore.
but every day, she asks her boss to pray that buddy don't fuck up.
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that?
hey, buddy, i gotta get a better pair of shoes and some things for tomorrow.
drop me off by the ren center and we'll hook up later?
it's like seeing someone for the first time-- like you could be passing on the street, and you look at each other and for a few seconds... there's this kind of a recognition-- like you both know something.
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
- okay, so now you're gonna... bust me for pickin' up a car, what the--
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do
i can't tell ya who to sock it to lf you want me to love you maybe i will
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
ah, it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do now i can't tell ya who to sock it to
if you don't do exactly what i tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all,
i'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.

that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.

you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there.
so if on super bowl sunday, they have that fence built then we have to dig, what, another nine, ten days?
he wants to get out of here, and i don't blame him.
if the ref don't call it soon, they'll take this cat out in a body bag.
any guy who can write a check for $50 million, he says anything, i'm all fucking ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
first thing we do in detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinkin', if i was glenn taking down the ripper, where would i go?
we can roll around in ripley's neighborhood not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that.
i know you supposed to be cool but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
if you don't like what i'm sayin', bounce off this whip anytime.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without you.
if i say you do this motherfucker to show me you got balls, guess what else you gonna do?
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, but here's the deal.
buddy and i get half of anything we get off of ripley.
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me, and they're fucking animals.
if you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who i am.
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
if you'd called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.
that is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was.
can't believe you're still angry with me after all this time.
can't believe you're still angry with me after all this time.
all right, take one of those big envelopes and put as many 100s, 00s and 20s as you can into it.
nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want dye packs. i don't want bait money.
he's gonna wait until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
so why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?
- listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
- well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars,
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
you'd meet doctors, lawyers-- nothing wrong with them, if they're divorced.
karen, why waste your time on some cowboy cop... who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt. lf they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
he must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.
so, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.
if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
you must really see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow, huh?
i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
- l don't know why you got glenn involved in this.
- how 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.
- every time he opens his mouth, i wanna punch him out.
any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $00 million, he says anything, i'm all fuckin' ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
he said, quote, that i can get my hands on it at any time.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
if he falls on anything, snoop, then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight... and you're still gonna get nothin'.
you know, last time i checked, man, this shit over here ain't got nothin' to do with you.
ray's working with the f.b.l. task force on the prison break.
i see that. tell me, ray, do you ever wear one that says ""undercover""?
you can come by my dad's place and drop 'em off.
i could leave it with the swat guy that answers the door.
that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay... as long as her husband doesn't find out.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.l. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinkin', if i was glenn, and i was up there... to take down the ripper, where would i go?
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. lt's nice, man.
- glenn, i know you supposed to be cool and everything, okay, but you ain't got to give me no tone of voice.
you don't like what i'm sayin', you just bounce the fuck out this whip anywhere up in here.
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, or what you think you're going to get out of this-- here's the deal:
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
so it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?
i don't know. i never used a gun before in my life.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?
look, jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
married some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?
what's this knute rockne ""pull yourself up by the bootstraps"" bullshit?
we got that out of the way. tell me, celeste, what do you do for a living?
i'm a sales rep, and i came here to call on a customer, but they gave me a hard time 'cause i'm a girl.
it's like seeing someone for the first time-- like you could be passing on the street, and you look at each other and for a few seconds... there's this kind of a recognition-- like you both know something.
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
i know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.
i doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
listen to me. these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me, and they're fucking animals, man.
if you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.
that is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was.
it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do
i can't tell ya who to sock it to lf you want me to love you maybe i will
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
ah, it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do now i can't tell ya who to sock it to
if you don't do exactly what i tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all,
i'm going to look at my partner and he's going to shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
he's gonna wait 30 seconds until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?
so you figure, mira, we wait till super bowl sunday, they have that fence built... then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?
so why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?
listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve, and that violates his civil rights.
you can step in, work full-time as one of my investigators.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt.
if they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
he must be quite a pal, to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.
so, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.

wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.
every time he opens his mouth, i wanna punch him out.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
that's 'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waitin' to make her move.
you're just jealous 'cause it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that.
oh, hey, so you still haven't said how you want to do this thing.
oh, i'm gonna tell you that as soon as we get one other brother i'm gonna need, uh,
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.
you'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.
well, you're the reason, my friend, that i don't keep all my money in the bank.
so listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together, you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the f.b.i.?
i go to the f.b.i., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?
look, jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that?
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go, and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
all right, so then i would have said yes, but for all you know,
i could have had a swat team waiting for you... why would you trust me?
okay, so now you're gonna bust me for pickin' up a car, what the...
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
yeah, the plan was... to pick him up at his office tomorrow... and drive him out to his house in bloomfield hills.
and now i don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?
we gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?
you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?

if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not, guess what else you gonna do?

you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
i'm not angry with you, richard. ln fact, i'm completely relaxed.

ah, you need love now just the same as i do

i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.

that's nice of you to offer, karen, but... i got all the help i can use right now.
instead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
- when i got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud, i didn't really get no props for that.
but ever since i shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it's like my dun and broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.l. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinkin', if i was glenn, and i was up there... to take down the ripper, where would i go?
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. lt's nice, man.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not, guess what else you gonna do?
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
anything else, you guys are allowed to cut up any way you want.
you'd be surprised what all you can get if you ask for it the right way.
well, you're the reason, my friend, that i don't keep all my money in the bank.
so listen, other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together, you want to tell me why you're coming to me instead of the f.b.l.?
i go to the f.b.l., the first thing they're gonna do is send me to get some coffee.
that's why she stopped praying for all the lost souls, since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore.
but every day, she asks her boss to pray that buddy don't fuck up.
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
back in prison, a guy like you in a place like that?
hey, buddy, i gotta get a better pair of shoes and some things for tomorrow.
drop me off by the ren center and we'll hook up later?
it's like seeing someone for the first time-- like you could be passing on the street, and you look at each other and for a few seconds... there's this kind of a recognition-- like you both know something.
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
- okay, so now you're gonna... bust me for pickin' up a car, what the--
for the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and for conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do
i can't tell ya who to sock it to lf you want me to love you maybe i will
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
ah, it's your thing do what you wanna do i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing do what you wanna do now i can't tell ya who to sock it to
nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want dye packs. i don't want bait money.
start with the second drawer, and then the one over there, under the money counter.
they're putting up another fence 15 feet back the fence that's already there, you know?
so you figure, mira, we wait till super bowl sunday, they have that fence built... then, cono, we gotta dig what, another nine, ten days, baby?
so why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talkin' about?
- listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
- well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars,
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve, and that violates his civil rights.
- you can step in, work full-time as one of my investigators.
why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?
- the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt. lf they do, they'll be lookin' for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving' a ford.
if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
you must really see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow, huh?
i'm gonna open the trunk enough for you to drop your pistol out.
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
wouldn't even fuckin' know about it if it wasn't for me.
- every time he opens his mouth, i wanna punch him out.
any guy who can write a fuckin' check for $50 million, he says anything, i'm all fuckin' ears.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm, five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
he said, quote, that i can get my hands on it at any time.
that's nice of you to offer, karen, but... i got all the help i can use right now.
instead, let's talk about how you got that bump on your head.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
- when i got put in here a year ago on credit card fraud, i didn't really get no props for that.
but ever since i shanked that loudmouth pussy in the yard, it's like my dun and broadstreet around this bitch done shot way the fuck up.
buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to the job... before they'd done it instead of after.
well, she called the f.b.l. they both went down, and they ended up at lompoc.
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinkin', if i was glenn, and i was up there... to take down the ripper, where would i go?
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that. lt's nice, man.
if i say we in on this ripley shit, we in on it, with or without your punk ass.
and if i say you gonna walk up in this house and do this motherfucker... so i can see if you got any balls or not, guess what else you gonna do?
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, or what you think you're going to get out of this-- here's the deal:
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
so it must take a lot of balls to walk into a bank and stick it up with a gun, huh?
i don't know. i never used a gun before in my life.
doesn't say what she's doing here, but i don't think it has anything to do with us.
she came up here on her vacation because she likes shitty weather.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score... and then gone on to live the good life?
look, jack, there's a chance we'll walk out of here with nothin'.
married some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time then divorcing her?
what's this knute rockne "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" bullshit?
the next moment, the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it.
and you always remember it, because it was there, and you let it go, and you think to yourself, "what if i had stopped?
i know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing.
i doubt one in ten could tell you where the dye pack is.
- yeah, the plan was... to pick him up at his office tomorrow... and drive him out to his house in bloomfield hills.
and now i don't give a shit what the guys do, you know?
if you didn't drive me to the federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who i am.
if i didn't know you, glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.
we gonna take a look upstairs in the man's bedroom, all right?
you and mr. buddy look at all the rooms down here.
if you called, we could have checked the walls down there before we left.
that is, if you'd bothered to find out where he was.
ah, you need love now just the same as i do
makes me no difference now who you give your thing to
how can you lose with the stuff you use lt's your thing do what you wanna do
i can't tell ya who to sock it to lt's your thing, yeah do what you wanna do
and if you don't do exactly what i tell you or if you give me any kind of problem at all,
i'm gonna look at my partner and he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
now, he's gonna wait 30 seconds until i'm out of the building, make sure you haven't set off the alarm.
if you have, he's gonna shoot your mr. gwendon between the eyes.
so, why don't you just come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
listen to miss smarty mouth, out there in the free world.
buddy thought it might be better to bring two, you know?
he got this guy who says you know him from lompoc.
says he doesn't have any choice in what they serve, and that violates his civil rights.
well, you know, you can step in, work full-time for me as one of my investigators.
why in the world would someone like you become a federal marshal?
the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
we come to a roadblock, they run the car and find out in about 5 seconds who it belongs to.
that's if they get set up in time, which i doubt.
if they do, they'll be looking for a bunch of little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a ford.
he must be quite a pal to risk his own ass like this.
started when i was 18 years old, driving for my uncle cully, and his partner, gus.
so, basically you're saying you spent half your life in prison.
if it turns out i get shot like a dog, it's gonna be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
you must really see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow, huh?
in that part where they get shot, i can remember thinking to myself,
"hey, that wouldn't be such a bad way to go, if you had to."
now, if you shoot, buddy's got your shotgun, he's gonna shoot back.
there's nothing i can do about it, so it's up to you.
wouldn't even fucking know about it, if it wasn't for me.
every time he opens his mouth, i wanna punch him out.
guy tells me he's got all this money in foreign banks.
plus, around, mmm... five million in uncut diamonds at his house.
that's 'cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time waiting to make her move.
you're just jealous, 'cause it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
you know, foley made me think of that fella carl tillman.
the one that you were seeing, it turns out, the same time he was robbing banks.
if he falls on anything, snoop, then they're gonna transfer his ass outta here faster than you can throw a fight, and you're still gonna get nothing.
you know, last time i checked, man, this shit over here ain't got nothing to do with you, foley.
you can come by my dad's place and drop them off.
i could leave it with the swat guy that answers the door.
you know, there's a guy here on the task force right now.
maybe i should put him on the phone and let the two of you work it out.
well, that makes it sound like what she was doing was okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it.
like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't bother her.
first thing we do, we get to detroit, we find glenn, and we find a window to throw him out of.
i was thinking, if i was glenn, and i was up there to take down the ripper, where would i go?
a ram on a metal door makes a lot of noise for what good it does.
i got a shock lock round for my shotgun that oughta do the trick.
you know, i don't just deal product and manage fighters no more.
a lot's changed since the last time you seen me, man.
you can roll around in ripley's neighborhood up there in bloomfield hills, not get sweated by the private security.
ain't gonna have no police on our ass, nothing like that.
look, snoop, i don't know what glenn promised you, or what you think you're gonna get out of this, here's the deal,
buddy and i, we're going to take half of anything we get off of ripley.
buddy, you know anybody who's done one last big score and then gone on to live the good life?

rest assured that we will make every effort to keep the gas flowing right until the end.
# i lay awake and watched until the morning light #
# washed away the darkness of the lonely night # # lonely night #
# should call you up and just forget my foolish pride #
# i heard your number ringing i went cold inside #
# the sleeping pill i took was just a waste of time #
# i couldn't close my eyes 'cause you were on my mind #
uh, well, mom, there are two really good excuses i can think of... that maybe you should keep in mind.
for one thing, it's not really christmas today, is it, mom?
[man on radio] i have just one question for my listeners.
do you think jimmy is loving maryann on their last night together?
i'm calling from the gas company, and we just wanted to thank you for being our customer over the years.
i hope you are doing well and spending these final hours of peace with your loved ones.
but aunt margo is taking the whole family, [ringing continues] including the simpson clan, up north to muskoka.
and she says the whole congregation is going to meet around the lake.
mom, i made a decision about where i want to be when it happens.
and i'm sorry, but you're going to have to accept that.
she wanted us to relive our happiest moments as a family.
so she took all this stuff from our childhood... and wrapped it up and gave it to us as gifts.
and she has met another man and married him as you may know.
and she made me promise that if i ran into you,
but what i do find sad and what i do find pathetic... is people who don't know themselves or people who don't like themselves.
and as soon as they hear that the world is ending, they rush out and try and hook up with someone, like it was closing time at studio 54.
for one brief moment, i thought you had actually forgotten your, uh, tragedy... look, i'm not complaining.
you don't have to... and realized that what is one death compared to the fact... that in under two hours every living soul on earth is gonna evaporate.
i mean, there were certain acts that could only be done with other men.
that-that necessarily wouldn't include anal sex, 'cause i already did that, but...
closer to home, over 600 would-be rock stars joined with randy bachmann... in north york for the world's largest guitar jam.
here they are, learning the chords to "taking care of business."
my husband and i made a promise, and i'm not backing down.
no matter where he is, i know it's what he's doing.
i mean, it's the biggest thing that ever happened, and we're gonna be there.
i mean, no one was there to witness the beginning, but we're gonna be there at the end.
i'm calling from the gas company, and wejust wanted to thankyou for being our customer over the years.
i hope you are doing well and spending these final hours of peace with your loved ones.
butaunt margo is taking the whole family, [ringing continues] including the simpson clan, up north to muskoka.
and she says the whole congregation is going to meet around the lake.
she wanted us to relive our happiest moments as a family.
so she took all this stuff from our childhood... and wrapped it up and gave it to us as gifts.
and she has met another man and married him as you may know.
and she made me promise that if i ran into you,
i mean, i know in my heart that i'm not in a meaningful relationship right now.
i'm not with a woman that i love, and i can deal with that.
[man on radio] we're coming up on about 9.:30, and we've reachednumber34 on the top 500songs ofalltime.
we can'tstop the clock, but we can make ltgo a little smoother.
a 1 970 lime green, super ""b"", overhead cams, duel exhaust.
it was one ofthe first-- not that you'll need to look under the hood.
for one brief moment, i thought you had actually forgotten your, uh, tragedy... look, i'm not complaining.
you don't have to-- and realized that what is one death compared to the fact... that in under two hours every living soul on earth is gonna evaporate.
i mean, there were certain acts that could only be done with other men.
that-that necessarily wouldn't include anal sex, 'cause i already did that, but--
today, i just don't want to risk... having bad sex today.
i just don't want that to be the last thing on my mind.
closer to home, over 600 would-be rock stars joined with randy bachmann... in north york for the world's largest guitarjam.
here they are, learning the chords to ""taking care of business.""
even if he was there, your husband, you wouldn't make it home in time.
it's past 1 1 :00, and anyway i want you to stay.
rest assured that we will make every effort to keep the gas flowing right until the end.
coming up on the last night on the planet, you're listening to ckrt, the top-500 songs of all time.
uh, well, mom, there are two really good excuses i can think of that maybe you should keep in mind.
for one thing, it's not really christmas today, is it, mom?
do you think jimmy is loving mary ann on their last night together?
take a look in the looking glass and you'll find your answer.
good evening, mrs. nora wheeler, i'm calling from the gas company and we just wanted to thank you for being our customer over the years.
i hope you are doing well and spending these final hours at peace with your loved ones.
and aunt margot is taking the whole family, including the simpson clan, up north to muskoka.
and she says the whole congregation is going to meet around the lake.
what i was trying to say out there is that you're very beautiful and i knew that before.
i just wanted you to know that i'm not doing this because you're black.
and she has met another man and married him, as you may know.
and she made me promise that if i ran into you,
i'm not with a woman that i love and i can deal with that.
i just feel that now is not the time to compromise.
but if i were you, i would get on the blower, get on the internet.
i mean, that's what it's there for, that's why they invented it.
what were those experiences that i had hoped for which were now just passing me by?
and i made a list, i made a comprehensive list, and then i went out and i actively tried to meet those goals.
and to be perfectly honest, i never thought of you that way.
i mean...but that idea of, uh... sex with other men, you know, it crossed my mind.
i hope you're doing well and spending these final hours in peace with your loved ones.
rest assured that we will make every effort to keep the gas flowing right until the end.
as i understand, they have become a little more rowdy, although there are no major incidents to report.
well, pop that champagne, it's now officially... 10 minutes until the end of the world.
i'm calling from the gas company, and wejust wanted to thankyou for being our customer over the years.
i hope you are doing well and spending these final hours of peace with your loved ones.

i mean, there were certain acts that could only be done with other men.

i just wanted you to know that i'm not doing this... because you're black.

but what i do find sad and what i do find pathetic... is people who don't know themselves or people who don't like themselves.
and as soon as they hear that the world is ending, they rush out and try and hook up with someone, like it was closing time at studio 54.

my husband and i made a promise, and i'm not backing down.
no matter where he is, i know it's what he's doing.
i say again, ladies and gentlemen not since man put two slices of bread on either side of a hunk of meat has there been anything as exciting as what you are going to see here today.
you've been saying that for an hour but we saw nothing but your daughter and a tarp.
you want a turkey drumstick big enough for the whole family this thanksgiving?
you gotta have your special growth hormones invented by me, farmer brown.
enoch brown, i'm handing down an injunction ordering you to cease and desist these monstrous experiments.
you are to remove any living specimens to safe captivity outside gotham city.
when i was looking for a tracer in the van i saw him hanging over the side, wetter than a bag of drowned cats.
well, now, city fella, i don't reckon it's all that polite to show up at a fella's abode without an invitation.
just what you'd expect from the king of the demon realm of darkness.
he really is on a different level from puipui or yakon.
that's the whole reason i went to all the trouble of going to that ridiculous tournament!
if it doesn't look like he's going to make any more progress, i'll end this in an instant!
there is one among them that has a very strong wickedness within his heart.
with that degree of evil in his heart, we can sufficiently draw him over to our side.
that chair is the only thing i have of my mother's.
then it would be doubly generous for you to give it to me.
i believe your men ain't good enough to face us and you're just a coward that threatens old women.
so soon as you give us what we came for we'll get the hell off your property.
because the next time we do, i'm gonna rip his eye out.
can't a man play a quiet game with his knife without being distracted?
now, don't you know a helping hand when you see it?
now, what i'm suggesting is that you let j.d. in on your talents.
i can rope, ride and spit faster and farther than any man.
well, those are mighty admirable qualities, ma'am but j.d. might not be man enough to handle them.
... who was charming and not so nice to me and he died, okay?
so why should i let this guy go when everything in my body says that this one is the one.
he's probably the most original and imaginative date on the planet.
if that's how you feel, how come you're not going out now?
he says the victims are all young girls around your age, joey.
the killer apparently stalks his victims with letters and phone calls before he takes a knife and cuts out their heart.
in halloween, he would fill the frame so that you were always on guard.
he'd frame the actors so there was something in the frame with them.
joey, is it just me, or is this too weird for words?
i mean, i'm on a date, and i end up here?
he disconnected her electricity, cut off her phone walked through the front door, up her stairs, into her bedroom while she was sleeping and cut out her heart in one clean sweep.
he uses a long, lacerating scalpel, so they think he might be a doctor.
she leaves the baby in the back in his car seat with the door open so she can hear him if he cries.
she goes out in the blueberry patch, and after about a half an hour she realizes she hasn't heard a peep from the baby.
he takes her to his friend's house, where they're having fun and games.
and what none of them know is that this woman is a little ill.
and that, in her purse, she carries this great, big knife.
because sometimes, just for fun she likes to slice open throats and see how far the blood will spurt.
he told me you like to be scared and if i got you all worked up, that you'd be impressed.
wait a minute, you're the one that called me this afternoon.
to be honest with you, i'm not in the market for a boyfriend now.
my love life has kind of crashed and burned and i'm just picking up the pieces.
but friday the 1 3th's over so no more brushes with death, okay?
can we just go to sleep and pretend the world's a happy place to live?
i don't like watching horror movies that are loaded with cheez whiz.
forgive me, roger ebert, but i figured in honor of friday the 1 3th tomorrow a horror marathon was mandatory.
there's enough evil in the world without having to re-create it on film.
i mean, i don't need to watch some stupid man in a mask slice up girls.
why do we need to have these horror movies to remind us of how sick and demented the world really is?
you talk big, joey and your argument is solid, but it's deflecting the real issue.
a woman with a newborn goes out to the country to pick blueberries.
she leaves the baby in the back in his car seat with the door open so she can hear him if he cries.
a huge snake has crawled down the throat of the baby its tail wagging out.
so in major shock, she reaches in, yanks the snake out and along with it, comes all the baby's insides.
you'll go to your grave pining away for your best friend.
a guy who's so oblivious, he doesn't have a clue that you lust after him.
officers found evidence in his car linking him with the murders that have terrorized the eastern seaboard for the past few months.
we'll bring you more information on the arrest in our full report.

she lived life her way, and if people didn't like it, well that was their problem.
i really admired her, and i could never figure out why she liked me.
she was pretty cool, but never really seemed to associate with any particular group, which made her sort of invisible.
she was the kind of girl who was always on the edge of the frame when a picture was taken, even when we were kids.
and i wanted to thank her right then and there for the snake, the apple, and the free will to mess up the entire world.
because if she didn't, my body wouldn't ache the way it did for the deepest soul
i really wasn't interested in the content of what he said.
i just liked his voice and the excitement with which he spoke, so i encouraged him to keep talking.
so i told her i felt like i had been totally fucked.
i told her it was so weird because with kevin i had sex, but now i'd been fucked.
and then it all made sense, and i imagine their parents dying in a tragic accident when they were young and carla bringing up her little brother in this dangerous world all by herself.
there was a sadness about her, and i wanted to fix her hair, but she was already so beautiful.
that i was not a woman to be taken for granted.
i would choose my words carefully, so they might cut him to the bone.
hey, i said that he liked you, not that he wanted to be your boyfriend, andrea.
i mean, guys like todd sparrow, they're not the boyfriend type, you know?
it was like some kind of plague, a plague that was searching for teenage victims only because we were searching for it.
i needed a connection, something or someone to reassure me that i was still me and that things would be okay.
well, when you've had as much disappointment and humiliation as i've had, you...
you learn to accept it with a certain amount of grace.
well it looks like you're gonna have a long trip back.
why don't you just tell todd sparrow that andrea marr's outside?
it must have been drug induced because i didn't have a clue what the dream meant.
this is how the author wants the journey of the readers to parallel the journey of john marcher, the protagonist.
and for one afternoon, we could be just like they were in the sixties.
everyone was there, even the mtvers as cybil was by now our most famous dropout.
but of all the shooting stars that took the stage that day, there was still only one that burned the brightest.
i finally felt like a somebody and i had all the respect i so richly deserved.
it just meant that you wanted or admired something you saw in someone else.
i just never thought that someone else might see something in me.
that's ridiculous for me, unreachable stars to cross, pseudo-religious madmen, who are willing to for a single glance, a single word or a touch by a stranger totally surrender.
this stranger seems to be the key to a different world.
at that moment i realized that god must be a woman.
for a being as he could not have been created randomly.
because if they had not approved it, would not hurt my body now because of the soul, which revealed itself to me here.
and my head would not go crazy because of a boy named todd sparrow.
this insolence sprayed at the school building says more about you than about your goal.
as long as the hack does not answer, you will all the consequences this disrespectful behavior have to bear.
why hang around here any longer, take 'ne with him on board!
if you hear your music means so much, you should do everything all to hear it.
i had to think long if i go to a farewell party.
but then i thought that each of us now needs the other.
and how hard it was to deal with the fame of his age.
he said that deep inside him he would to hate themselves.
[andrea] the whole notion of groupies was always intriguing to me.
pathetic no life wanna-be star-trailing pseudo-religious wackos ready to sacrifice themselves for just one glance.
she was pretty cool, but never really seemed to associate with any particular group, which made her sort of invisible.
she was the kind of girl who was always on the edge of the frame when a picture was taken, even when we were kids.
♪ i don't bleed no more, so rest a little while ♪
♪ do you feel okay is there anything i can do ♪
this morning's spray painted message reflects more on you people than the target which happens to be me.
as a result, i am holding all of you responsible unless someone claims responsibility for this disrespectful act.
[andrea] and then rebecca looked at me as if i had answers to many questions.
i recognize that look because that's how i looked at cybil.
if it was in your soul to do it, then fate would just take you there.
and everything else was just a test to see if you were the real thing.
so i told her i felt like i had been totally fucked.
i told her it was so weird because with kevin i had sex, but now i'd been fucked.
[andrea] and then it all made sense, and i imagine their parents dying in a tragic accident when they were young and carla bringing up her little brother in this dangerous world all by herself.

hey, i said that he liked you, not that he wanted to be your boyfriend, andrea.
i mean, guys like todd sparrow, they're not the boyfriend type, you know?
cause she missed rehearsal last night, you know, and i'm pissed off, you know?
cause bands of the reality are not supposed to miss rehearsals!
it was like some kind of plague, a plague that was searching for teenage victims only because we were searching for it.
i needed a connection, something or someone to reassure me that i was still me and that things would be okay.

i had a hard time justifying going to the graduation party, but i figured that everyone would just want some kind of human connection.
someone to talk to and together we would come to terms with what had happened to our friend.
and i thought about cybil and how hard she was on the outside, but she was just like all of us.
and then i thought about our kiss and how this night could not have been any stranger.
[andrea] that night, todd sparrow poured his soul into the air and it condensed and dripped into my hands.
he told me how sorry he was that he had treated me so badly and it was hard to be an icon at such a young age.
the people who became groupies, or the people who attracted them?
i got lost once on a road very similar to this one, and when i found my way again,

kelly, when you saw mr. lombardo intended to have sex with you ...
you know, i'd want a clear head now, if i were you, so i could keep a real close eye on my new friends.
i'd hate to see you come to a bad end ...
listen, sam, it was really good seeing you the other day.
sandra, i'm real busy right now, so-- l haven't found anyone who can handle my boat the way you can.
that son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me.
we understand your feelings, miss van ryan but please, we need some time with kelly.
a year ago when her old man blew his brains out kelly lost it, ran away.
they found her in a fleabag motel some place, coked out of her gourd.
meanwhile you, sam, are voted educator of the year or some crap.
they put the two of you in front of a jury they're gonna look stupid.
the lombardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town of blue bay with its tabloid appeal.
now just arriving, sandra van ryan jet-set real estate heiress and part of the powerful blue bay elite.
i know that this is hard, kelly but i have one more question.
and even though it's something we've been over i want us all to be very clear about it.
yesterday, kelly van ryan delivered an emotional account of events and was not swayed by defense counsel's cross-examination.
we'll come back live later with an update of these proceedings.
so one month after you say this man raped you, you go to him for help?
sounds as if you still considered mr. lombardo a good friend.
i mean, you can't eat sushi every day of the week.
bowden, why don't you cut the crap and tell me what your client really wants.
both of you, you're not on a case, because there is no fucking case!
i've had it with sandra van ryan, and you keep mucking around and she's gonna sue us for invasion of privacy.
no, but i mean, just the idea that mr. lombardo would--
well, the way i heard it, he was pretty tight with the kids.
told me i could work my way through college, like he did.
sam lombardo went to the university of miami on an athletic scholarship.
he knows it won't be found, but he made a mistake.
she'd been threatening to run away and i found the car at the bus terminal.
i just looked away for a second, just a split second.
and just like that, bingo she put a knee in my groin.
chief goodsall detective duquette found susan marie toller's teeth and blood near the area known as stoner beach.
miss toller's blood was also found in the van ryan range rover.
i would give 50,000 to snaffle that imperious, half-baked aristocrat's mistress away from him.
oh, what a joke... if i got in while he was snoozing.
you know, if i had to choose between you and the baron...
i mean, monsieur hulot is a clever, handsome man, but... you, you're...
i imagine she must be the most beautiful young woman in paris.
to get out of your predicament, you must spend... more time on your work and less time imagining my cousin.
if you lock me in a cupboard, what good art i'll make then.
if fine works could be manufactured like nails, blacksmiths would make them.
well, sarcasm won't buy the groceries, let alone pay what you owe me.
mademoiselle, i hardly need be reminded of the debt i owe you.
this mountain of marble is to be my first major work.
it is to my future works... what raphael's "'marriage of the virgin"' was to his.
what can a man do to make a woman love him?
i suppose it's ridiculous for men like us to want to be loved.
on the other side of heaven i'll be waiting for you where the clouds are so soft and the sky's baby blue stop, stop, stop, please, mademoiselle cadine.
my kitten, you're singing about lust and corruption, sex and seduction.
if you like, i could arrange... i would give 50,000 to snaffle that imperious, half-baked aristocrat's mistress away from him.
oh, what a joke... if i got in while he was snoozing.
you know, if i had to choose between you and the baron... i mean, monsieur hulot is a clever, handsome man, but... you, you're... solid.
meet me at the theatre des varietes, saturday evening at 10:00.
i imagine she must be the most beautiful young woman in paris.
to get out of your predicament, you must spend... more time on your work and less time imagining my cousin.
if fine works could be manufactured like nails, blacksmiths would make them.
well, sarcasm won't buy the groceries, let alone pay what you owe me.
why is there darkness in the morning while an inferno burns at night?
nothing you do, nothing you say nothing, no, nothing can take it away nothing can cure, nothing can save, love is the master, you are the slave
this mountain of marble is to be my first major work.
it is to my future works... what raphael's "marriage of the virgin" was to his.
a day that represents a double honor for the hulot family.
firstly, the courage of my uncle, general pierre hulot de forzheim... his lifetime of service to the emperor napoleon... and to our country as a soldier in the grand army of france.
if anyone thinks i'll take responsibility for his debts, they are mistaken.
i'm already up to my nostrils in debt because of father.
delilah is on her knees, looking adoringly at the man she has destroyed.
it is her power that i would depict... her passion that brings everything to destruction.
farewell, my friends who tread the paths of glory who, day and night, are greeted by success
my artist friends, i tell a simple story and i abide at a humble address but then, i need so little from existence i've got my life, a crust of bread to eat my eyes are dry, i gaze into the distance
oh, what a joke... if i got in while he was snoozing.
you know, if i had to choose between you and the baron...
she's asked me to obtain a commission for you, and perhaps i can.
the imperial guard have subscribed a large sum... for a statue of my uncle de forzheim.
if fine works could be manufactured like nails, blacksmiths would make them.
well, sarcasm won't buy the groceries, let alone pay what you owe me.
general pierre hulot de forzheim... his lifetime of service to the emperor napoleon... and to our country as a soldier in the grand army of france.
and this historic occasion also marks the debut... of my brilliant and talented son-in-law...
if anyone thinks i'll take responsibility for his debts, they are mistaken.
i'm already up to my nostrils in debt because of father.
how can he show his face in a place like this?
there isn't a patron here... to whom he doesn't owe 10,000 francs.
i see him waiting behind the window of my room just as i open my eyes
he doesn't understand that the sad fates of those stupid plants...
i mean i am an author, a philosopher and a poet
and he doesn't understand that i'm concerned and focused on other things
a work which used to be my love, my career and the reason...
for being or not being and even the cause of my reputation and the capital of my life...
i wish i'd turn twenty, thirty or fourty years old quickly
i wish i'd be as old as mature, wise and reputable men
i have a fever and the damavand garden and " m " and everything else seem to be like a dream
and as usual and as a sign of a friendship and as a symbol of my love...
oh tree, you know i love you more than i love any other tree in this garden
you know well i love you like i love my very own son
this is the result of my so much hard work, nothing?
that i no longer have anything to say nor am i eager to do it anymore?
about eternal love and originality of feelings and of arts and imagination
in your next books you talked about economical foundation and justification of the history
and we realized you had turned to religious ideas and spiritual matters
there is a kind of a confusion in your words now
do you still believe in the enonomical foundation and the world labor unio/
do you still believe in the spiritual matters and the presence science?
fieldfares are industriously ferrying meals of worms to their ravenous chicks.
they nest in colonies, up to thirty or forty in a group, and that helps a lot with defence, which is important, for there are plenty of raiders around.
the colony is saved, thanks to its members'highly effective system of communication, between themselves and with their enemy.
the messages proclaimed by those scandinavian fieldfares could scarcely be misunderstood, even by us.
half hidden among the leaves, he continues sending furtive signals to his family, but all the birds around get the message.
an enemy would find it very hard to detect where that sound is coming from.
his calls are almost continuous and much lower pitched, because he wants to be located, so that he can distract me away from her, and even unsettle me.
sound is not the only way to spread the alarm or intimidate an intruder.
even less conspicuous than the jacanas and the cayman that also haunt the river's edge here in venezuela.
the river is continually bringing edible bits and pieces within range, and the sunbittern lives on them.
instead of saying "i am here and extremely formidable", you could say "i'm not here at all".
that, of course, is a straightforward lie, but there's a bird in these brazilian forests that tells the most convincing of lies.
the only thing that could give it away are its beak and its eyes.
now i am getting quite close, so it decides to improve its disguise even further.
and it does that by changing its posture and closing those give-away eyes.
now it's no more than the stump of a broken branch.
you might think it would be dangerous to shut your eyes just when danger approaches.
but, in fact, although its eyes are shut, it can still see me.
there are two little hitches in its upper eyelid, and its night-vision eyes are so sensitive that it can still see what's going on.
as it watches me going away, it relaxes and returns to its doze.
and then you can see that they use their plumage to send very different messages.
one finch meeting another needs to know whether or not it's the same species.
so finches with such similar body shapes wear uniforms that make plain who they are.
and what works for other birds will also work with us, provided we know the code.
with its beak, it squeezes a yellow oil from a giant preen gland on its rump.
and it uses that oil to paint on those yellow blotches.
whether these cosmetics are used just for appearance's sake, or whether they have an additional purpose, we don't know.
but one thing is quite certain, birds take a lot of care over their appearance.
all birds have good eyesight, as they have to have if they are to navigate at speed through the air.
in particular, they have excellent colour vision, and that enables some species to have the most gorgeous uniforms.
their colour is not pigment but an optical effect created by refraction, like the colours on a film of oil on water.
they are particularly attracted by red, which is why i have got red artificial flowers on this bottle.
they can also see in ultraviolet, and that's a colour that lies beyond the range of the human eye.
it's recently been discovered that many of their feathers reflect ultraviolet, so the likelihood is that these brilliant costumes are even more vivid in their eyes than they are in ours.
many birds that we might think are plain are almost gaudy in ultraviolet light.
if we look closely at starlings, for example, we can see a sheen to their plumage, but that has an ultraviolet component that makes them appear much more vivid to one another.
their crests are particularly vivid and much brighter in males than females.
so to them, the sexes look very different, whereas to us blue tits all look the same.
rivals assess one another's strength by the size and brilliance of those head shields.
if they feel their ranks are equal, then they may not want to contest the position of the boundary, and they display the white tail patches to indicate that the confrontation is being broken off.
but here, the male on the right is standing boldly upright.
he reckons he is the senior, and he wants to enlarge his territory.
there are, of course, many different ways of making a noise, and knocking on a resonant tree trunk is one of them.
in this part of the world, in patagonia on the southernmost tip of south america, two knocks on a tree trunk has a very particular meaning, at least among birds.
it makes its call in the same way as children do when they blow across a blade of grass.
but instead of grass, the broadbill has specially strengthened and shaped wing feathers.
but, of course, most of the sounds made by birds come from their throats.
the calls and songs that you hear in a tropical rainforest, however, are very different from those you might hear in a european or north american woodland, and there's a reason for that.
the leaves in a tropical rainforest have smooth and shiny surfaces that reflect sound.
so a complex call up here would have its notes slurred and confused.
the calls of the kagu can be heard half a mile away.
but some birds need to communicate over even greater distances, and the best way to do that is with very low-pitched notes.
this call carries for over two miles, even through the thickets of reeds.
and when the performance is over, the air sac slowly deflates.
if you can get out of the reeds, then your calls are less impeded.
the australian musk duck does just that in order to broadcast his messages.
and the smooth surface of the water also helps to reflect the sound far across the lake.
the flap on his chin is a visual signal for any birds that come over for a closer look.
however, if calls are directed to neighbours nearby, then they can become very elaborate.
this red bishop makes an almost constant stream of high-pitched notes as he hops around his territory.
slowing the singer down, which also lowers the pitch of the notes, allows us to understand what's happening.
between the notes it takes mini- breaths to replenish its air supply, and in full song it may do so 30 times a second.
a bird's voice box can also produce two different notes simultaneously.
it's not high in the throat like ours, but deep in its chest.
it may take a cowbird two years to learn his song properly.
and it's important that birds should get their calls exactly right, for they can be just as significant in proclaiming identity as their uniforms.
there's no mistaking who's who, as long as you can hear their calls.
but a bird's call can tell another bird more than just what kind of bird it is that's singing.
this patch of bush on a small offshore new zealand island belongs to a male saddleback.
he has held it throughout the year, and he knows who his neighbours are because their calls vary slightly.
throughout the day he keeps in regular contact with his neighbours.
they each answer his call, and he can distinguish between them in the same way that we can distinguish between regional dialects.
but if the call is from a saddleback, one that he doesn't recognise, and if, as well as that, it comes from a completely new place, then he will react in a very different way.
and, of course, it's quite easy for me to make that happen.
now, since his rival seems to be somewhere close by, he's making a visual threat, displaying the brown patch on his back.
he is ready to fight, if only he could find who it is who needs fighting.
to many of us, however, this is the most delectable of natural sounds.
it's an hour before dawn, it's spring, this is an english woodland.
it's usually quite calm at dawn, and with no wind these messages will travel far and still be recognisable.
the chorus is the equivalent of our early morning news, except that it is broadcast in fifty different languages simultaneously.
"this is my patch", they also say to passing females "why don't you come and join me?"
robins have now extended their usual songs to carry this additional message.
his mate, like many, will be impressed by the originality and complexity of his song.
the male sedge warbler can produce fifty different notes and never sings the same song twice.
he's like a jazz singer, continually improvising, and different males develop different singing styles.
and this is perhaps the most lyrical of all european songsters.
and he will sing for a mate all through the night.
what bird has the most elaborate, the most complex, the most beautiful song in the world?
i guess there are lots of contenders, but this bird must be one of them, the superb lyrebird of southern australia.
he clears a space in the forest to serve as his concert platform.
to persuade females to come close and admire his plumes, he sings the most complex song he can manage.
and he does that by copying the songs of all the other birds he hears around him, such as the kookaburra.
he can imitate the calls of at least twenty different species.
he also, in his attempt to out-sing his rivals, incorporates others sounds that he hears in the forest.
and now the sounds of foresters and their chain-saws working nearby.
that wonderful performance is only one example of the extent to which male birds will go in order to attract a female.
the range and sheer extravagance of their courtship displays can be quite astonishing.
the range of relationships between male and female that these displays lead to is also much more varied than you might suppose.
yeah, and behind them is someone in this lovely chanel evening gown who's either an unattractive man or a really unattractive woman.
the only seat i could find was next to some guy who claims he's moses.
and then there's this horrible, deafening, pounding noise, and you scream and you scream, but nobody can hear you.
and then you wonder, what if there's a power failure and i get stuck in here?
well, it can happen that way, mr. marino, when you're severely diabetic.
now, i want to see if your arteries are blocked, so i'm gonna schedule you for a treadmill test and maybe an angiogram.
you know, i was just being honest with him, you know?
i mean, i can't change medical facts for every person that walks in this place, am i right?
( giggles ) so, mrs. cooper, what seems to be your problem today?
well, i was watching the news last night, and there was a story about how power lines are giving people headaches.
you gotta stop coming in here with symptoms you don't have.
for god's sake, leave some room for people who really are sick.
the first thing i see is some woman breast-feeding her son, her adult son.
yeah, and behind them is someone in this lovely chanel evening gown who's either an unattractive man or a really unattractive woman.
yeah, john, we do have lives that go on even when you're not here.
oh, gee, you know, i always just assumed this place was like my refrigerator.
you know, i was just being honest with him, you know?
i mean, i can't change medical facts for every person that walks in this place, am i right?
less than a year since the war had ended, the flags were up to welcome winston churchill.
but he came to fulton bringing a somber message for the world.
"from stettin in the baltic to trieste in the adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent.
behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe
people seemed to o have a little cushion of money now which, you know, back in -- back in the depression years, no one had any money.
you just had about enough money to put food on the table put a roof over your head and keep your insurance policy in effect, you know."
and the war war production -- production of munitions, production of armaments put enormous sums of money into the economy, put millions of people to work not only men, but women
rosie the riveter and we emerged from the war with virtual full employment."
war and the postwar rush to spend put american capitalism back on its wheels.
in the first summer of peace, the soviet soldiers rode home.
some 27 million soviet civilians and soldiers did not live to see this day.
"we met the soldiers with flowers, bread, anything we could get hold of
stalin's prewar achievements, the factories and apartment blocks of the five-year plans, had been wrecked by the invaders.
"things which before the war hadn't seemed too bad were completely destroyed.
you can only understand it if you've lived through it and seen it with your own eyes."
for russians the end of the fighting brought an instant of pure joy.
but the soldiers looted homes, and all over the city they hunted down women.
"more and more russians came by, they looked through the window then one of them suddenly came in.
germany was divided into four occupation zones and each of the allies took a sector of the german capital.
the allies had decided that germany should compensate them for war damage.
now it was the turn of the germans to be the victims.
from the mediterranean to the baltic, the victors were shaping europe in their own image.
poles, whose own homelands had been seized by the soviet union, now took over german farms and houses.
"in the fall of 1945, a young polish woman, 19 years old, and an older man from the militia entered our house.
from six years of war, britain emerged happy, but inwardly exhausted.
for the moment, people cheered for king and empire as if nothing had changed, or ever would.
in foreign policy, the new labour government held tightly to the american alliance.
ernest bevin, the new foreign secretary, was a trade union veteran who mistrusted communists.
but stalin kept his word, and left the greek communists to their fate.
the soviet union now dominated the nations along its western border.
in berlin, where the allies jointly supervised city life, the communists were careful.
"the idea was at the beginning to cooperate, and gradually, gradually, to build up the party, making the best organized party, the most militant party, the most active party and gradually increase the influence on the other parties
so we were flabbergasted, we -- only three or four comrades and everybody else the social democrats and bourgeois democrats and so on.
so one of us asked and said but it must look democratic,
after all, the methods in some ways were the same, or at any rate very similar, of forcing people to do things against their will."
"for me, my only comparison was always the soviet union under stalin.
"we had a maid whose husband was a prisoner of war.
when he finally was repatriated and came back, it was a great reunion, life was wonderful again, and the family was reunited.
the poles agreed to a close alliance with the soviet union.
stalin promised to defend the new polish frontiers against any german attempt to win back the lost territories.
then, in cloudy words, he warned that capitalism and imperialism made future wars inevitable.
did this mean war between the soviet union and the west?
there wasn't any doubt about it, if you read the text carefully, what he was talking about."
"the speech was interpreted in the west as no less than a prediction of world war iii
"one of the strengths of kennan was his awareness that the russia in which we were living,
stalin's soviet russia, communism, people called it, actually drew in very many ways upon the russian past."
"i had to go right back to page one and to try to tell them things that i felt they'd forgotten during the war.
this all hangs together with this whole question that this was the same group of people who had dealt with hitler, had tried to deal with hitler at our expense and never had changed their views about us."
george comes walking in with this six-part cable which he wants to send out, and i took a look at it and i said it was nice, 'but let's not send it out.
let's wait till tomorrow,' and i tried to talk him into not sending it.
'now we'll be on this trip quite a while and i would be glad if you would call me harry.'
'well,' mr. churchill said, 'i'll be glad to if you will call me winston.'
so it was winston and harry from that time on, and they got on very well."
churchill was due to speak to a college audience at fulton in truman's home state.
behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern europe.
except in the british commonwealth and in the united states, where communism is in its infancy, the communist parties or fifth columns constitute a growing challenge and peril to christian civilization.
whatever conclusions may be drawn from these facts, and facts they are, this is certainly not the liberated europe we fought to build up.
nor is it one which contains the essentials of permanent peace."
and in fact the soviet union had no legal right to stay there."
iran presented the security council of the newly founded united nations with its first crisis.
but truman, shaken by his behavior, suspected that stalin was aiming at world domination.
"he said, 'i want to be in a position to document our concern.
go back over the recent agreements and list one by one the violations in which the soviets have engaged.'"
"i was then mr. clifford's assistant and he turned the task over to me.
we talked about it a bit, and i said, 'well, it seems to me that that's only scratching the surface, a list of agreements broken.
this is a much more - there are much more fundamental problems in our relations with the u.s.s.r. than that.
"there was absolute unanimity, in all of the agencies concerned, as to the nature of the problems we had, and the kind of response we were going to have to make."
"we ended up the report by saying the policy of our country should be set and clearly set.
he would come back and resolve matters with a friendly smile."
it was at paris that the wartime alliance began finally to break up.
scene of an event that marks a new phase in europe's destiny.
secretary of state james f. byrnes is here to set forth the policy of the united states on germany.
"it is not in the interests of the german people, or in the interests of world peace, that germany should become a pawn or a partner in the military struggle for power between the east and the west."
"i listened to the byrnes stuttgart speech with marked approval, because in fact i had written most of it, and i -- those of us who worked on it, and byrnes, were not thinking in anti-soviet terms."
"the american people want to return the government of germany to the people of germany.
and the american people want to help the german people to win their way back to an honorable place among the free and peace-loving nations of the world."
it made us think that our western border was being questioned by the germans and by other western countries.
it was one of the most important things that strengthened our ties with the soviet union."
on the collective farms, war damage and the death of so many workers at the front were deepening a grave food shortage.
"i took a trip down through the ukraine and it was the time of the '47 famine that was going on down there about which nothing was heard in the outside world.
"there is no choice between being a communist on 1,500 calories a day and a believer in democracy on a thousand."
aid to germany cost britain over a million dollars a day.
we never had bread rationing during the war, we had bread rationing after it.
and that was because we were pouring wheat into germany to prevent mass starvation there."
from now on, he announced, the united states would contain the advance of communism anywhere on the globe.
this, at last, was the official declaration of the cold war.

back in the day our street was lined with persian lilac.
i saw you were the lucky one who caught bev's garter.
yes, i'm going for a full battery of tests first thing in the morning.
i didn't know we were in the market for a second home.
actually, darling, when you see the kona coast, you may be thinking of first homes.
legally, we can always say that denny was not of sound mind.
that cannot become public knowledge, despite the repeated shootings, the television appearances, people still believe denny runs this firm.
i did the patch, and i did that little nicotine sucky thing, you know?
but the more i imagined losing my job, the more i panicked, and the more i panicked, the more i smoked.
he just made me pee in a cup, and then he fired me.
well, unless that's some type of sex game with your lover,
mrs. crane gave up her career, a lucrative office furniture business, to be a stay-at-home wife.
she made irrevocable sacrifices, and still, as a generous offer, considering her pain, she is willing to take only 50% of mr. crane's assets.
so i had sex with another woman or a navy burberry.
i'm not quite sure which, but the point is, she granted me the right to tomcat, and i exercised that right.
well, and this may be in the bible somewhere, you do have the right to forbid your employees from smoking at work, but why do you think you're justified in telling anyone what they may or may not do on their own time?
because it's good for them, and my lawyer told me i could, guy just like you.
you see, everyone here is what you call an at-will employee.
and like most workers in this country, they can be fired for anything, anytime, any place, any way.
joan did things the wrong way, so i cut her from the squad.
i have a similar bit of wisdom i like to share.
one moment i'm enjoying my own wedding reception, and the next, my gut's telling me something's wrong.
and somehow having sex with that waitress or the coat made everything feel right.
denny, your once charming and eccentric behavior has turned into a series of self-destructive impulses.
i love you, but it's time to take a step back and look at what you're turning into.
we didn't give her the $100 gift certificate to the hungry whistler for nothing.
mr. loomis, your desire to cut costs makes absolute sense, but we heard your office manager testify that when you weigh ms. zeder's productivity against any increased insurance premiums, you still come out ahead.
he must offer a unique, terrific product or service, and he must keep costs down.
now kurt loomis runs a first-rate escrow company, and he wants to do right by his employees by offering them health insurance, but if he doesn't keep his biggest expense in check, health care, he loses everything.
the great irish playwright george bernard shaw had a rather jaundiced view of our country.
shaw said that while our constitution was set up to prevent political dictatorship, in doing so, we established a society where every ward boss is a dictator, every financier a dictator, every private employer a dictator,
mr. loomis also declared himself emperor over ms. zeder in her home.
there he found her smoking something which is not against the law, which is, in fact, none of his business, but he fired her anyway.
shouldn't we be able to have private lives that aren't governed by the people we work for?
my god, i cannot believe i just asked that question in an american courtroom.
and at what point will we say, will you say, that provided we do not violate the law, other people cannot dictate what we do in the privacy of our own homes?
your honor, when you consider this case in the privacy of your chambers where no police or lawyers or loomis may enter, please think about the dying gasps of our precious right to privacy and what our lives might be like if it actually passes away.
you marketed to old people in retirement homes in and around boca raton.
you sold built-ins for television sets and built-ins for dishwashers, built-ins for microwaves, but you never built them in.
i always meant to finish the jobs that people had contracted me for, but i...
i had a cash flow problem, and it made more sense financially to just...
which that makes you, uh, a large fish in a very small pond.
mr. shore, i believe in the right to privacy that you so passionately defended, and i believe that when mr. loomis fired ms. zeder for actions that in no way affected her performance at work, he acted unreasonably,
"why you haven't you answered my e-mail that i sent you seven seconds ago?"
and in all that chaos, all that frenzy, smoking was more than a habit.
and what, may i ask, are you gonna tell your fiancee?
i will tell her what i want to tell her when i choose to tell her or i will tell her or i won't.
you know, i don't know why we thought we had to sneak out.
i mean, look, this is just a harmless, college-town gathering place.
you know, it really put you over the hump with the guys.
yeah, shawnie, this may come as a bomb shell, but that guy dan is a jerk.
well, he'll definitely go again 'cause it was a great movie (laughs)
and he loved it and what's funnier than those mouses, and we all know how i feel about...
the only thing that's important to me is that we are always honest with each other, okay?
you're not just being understanding now, but actually harboring bitterness and resentment that'll fester over the years until one day you hack me apart in my sleep, right?
well, i bet shawn's back there right now with all the other pervs.
well, i guess as long as some women choose to wiggle around half naked, there'll be men who go to see them.
no, no, actually i decided to come back for my ring, which somehow came off during the festive evening that we spent together.
uh-huh, well, maybe it's in here with all the other rings which just happened to come off.
i didn't go back to that place tonight to do the tushy dance.
i only went back because i left my ring on the table and i had to go back and get it.
listen, there are some places where a guy goes where he feels uncomfortable wearing a ring.
and most guys don't even wear a ring before they get married.
there's a cornea bank in hong kong... but it's always empty.
when a donation does come in, someone else gets it fiirst.
academy of sciences research director at the institute of mathematics doctor of mathematics, professor kassymov
here's my first question, mr kassymov ls it difficult being a scientist these days
berik karakoulovitch let's tackle a more concrete subject science, a domain in which you excel
we know that many scientific centers today are closing or are in danger of closing
so my question may seem abrupt but it has to be asked
what use is science in a country where almost all adults as you said, live off commerce?
the whole history of mathematics show that the miracle of miracles is impossible
take the key moment in the rise of mathematics when it made its first steps the most important for mankind when its very basis emerged logical demonstration
we observe that this very basis excludes any possibility of practical applications
thale's theorems established clear truths for all men of reason such as the diameter which divides the circle in 2 equal parts lt was not to check the truth of these theses that required a good dose of genius but to understand that
we can no longer see the light at the entrance and the light at the other end is so weak that we look for it all the time and keep losing sight of it
we're not even sure that there is an entrance and an exit
on the one hand it must be nice to live in a warm country
no winter, so no need to spend money on heating warm clothes, and so on
it's much prettier and of course, it requires a lot of work.
hours of work go into a dress before it can be put on show.
so my question may seem abrupt but it has to be asked:
what use is science in a country where almost all adults, as you said, live off commerce?
"if the flesh is born of the spirit it is a miracle.
if the spirit is born of the body it is the miracle of miracles".
the whole history of mathematics show that the miracle of miracles is impossible.
take the key moment in the rise of mathematics, when it made its first steps, the most important for mankind when its very basis emerged:
thale's theorems established clear truths for all men of reason, such as the diameter which divides the circle in 2 equal parts.
it was not to check the truth of these theses that required a good dose of genius, but to understand that they required a demonstration.
if we look at our lives in simple terms, we're like passengers lost in a long tunnel.
we can no longer see the light at the entrance and the light at the other end is so weak that we look for it all the time and keep losing sight of it.
we're not even sure that there is an entrance and an exit.
all around us, due to confusion or the exacerbation of our feelings, all we see are monster depending on our moods and our wounds, like in an exciting, exhausting game of kaleidoscopes.
before the man became legend, before the legend became myth, came the greatest adventure of all.
we are missing the entire harvest festival 'cause we're stuck lookin' for a cook.
i don't even talk to my father, never mind ask him for favors.
it's gonna take a week to walk to athens and back.
from then on, our ancestors knew that our women needed to be strong.
so, as for men, we just learned to live without them.
look, i used to think that the gods of olympus were fair and just.
now, i know that they do things out of hatred and spite.
hey, you don't suppose one of the amazons might like the job.
somehow, lolaus, i don't think they're the cooking kind, you know?
i'm not sending you spiraling into a depression here, all i'm saying is it's just lacking a little uumph, you know?
the anger and the edge and just the raw, dark pain that comes with being young.
last night i had a hard time sleeping which is really strange for me because usually i'm out like a light, but anyways,
i was laying there and all of a sudden i had this epiphany.
i know this is going to sound really strange, but it involved you.
- it's kind of early in the day for epiphanies, andie, but thanks for sharing.
i checked your gpa and you are in the top 3% of the class.
you have a responsibility to let the academically less fortunate benefit from your wisdom.
- maybe you haven't heard, andie, but i'm not exactly miss congeniality of capeside, okay?
and adding my name to your ticket would only assure you a loss.
and your average teenager has an attention span of just under 2 seconds.
you've got a clean slate, joey, so will you at least think about it?
- everytime i ask you something a little personal you somehow manage to change the subject and not answer.
- are you saying i purposely tanked the coffee creamer tower?
i mean we talk all the time but whenever it starts to get a little deep you get all weird and vague.
you know i have asked you 6 questions tonight and you haven't answered one.
well, if you want to embarress yourself and your entire family even further than nature intended than by all means, throw your amazing girl-next-door quality into the ring.
hey, what's one more disappointment in an already meager depressing existance?
i want them all over capeside... not just the high school.
- you know, on this book that i picked up on the clinton campaign, they said this things going to get ugly.
i still believe that a candidate's virtue and integrity is normal and to be expected and not just some character perk or bonus.
i mean, my goal is to make government good and safe again.
- and let chris and abby and the whole school know that we respond in an emotional knee-jerk fashion?
it's not a good signalto be sending out to our voting constituants?
- somebody who can walk back into the steps of regressing your teen years.
- jen, i'm very humored by your own insight into how i am as a personal being but i am a teenager, okay?
i like my perspective on life regardless of how middle-aged it might be.
- okay, but how are you going to reach your audience with that perspective?
- students that have a 3.5 gpa or higher should have only half a day of classes on friday.
- i believe my record of support and involvement of school activities fully qualifies me for student office.
- you would say that since no one here knows your background.
just to bring everyone up to speed on an issue that is relevant,
andie mcphee, your perspective president, has a mother who's about... one shock treatment away from a permanent residence in the looney bin!
- you know, for once abby let's stick to the issues.
we have hard evidence that andie's mother was responsible for the death of her older brother in a car crash less than a year ago.
the fact of the matter is monie mcphee is a wacked out nut and we all know that mental illness is hereditary so you do the math.
- alright, i'm coming in there and just so there's no confusion,
i am a man so if there are any objections please speak now.
look, andie, it hasn't been an easy year for any of us, but we all do what we have to to hold it together... to cope.
- your highs and lows have been becoming really intense lately.
- i'll let you in on a little secret there, sport.
i'm just using that walking penis for his popularity and ultimately, i'll destroy him.
i'm so stupid that i didn't know that when i pressed this button on this little thing that your annoying nasal whine was broadcast over this entire school.
oh no, wait a minute, that's exactly what i meant to do, sorry!
i know that's no excuse for me acting like an ass.
- i wanted to be there for you, jack... but you kind of shoved me off.
- joey, um, i can't allow myself the luxury of opening up.
i mean, with my brother gone and my father missing in action.
it did because being in the same place i knew that everything was going to be okay.
and towards the end when things got really bad, he would just reach out and hold my hand.

and unlike an md, my patient cannot tell me where it hurts.
i felt like i was doing something, like i was making a difference.
and i started thinking that here i'm not giving my patients the right amount of attention.

apollo creed played "eye of the tiger", he went back and beat the snot out of mr t because of that song.

i felt like i was doin' somethin', like i was makin' a difference.
if you do, i'm pretty sure you can get out of here.

i decided to stop avoiding the situation and take the grown-up approach, complete and utter denial.
so i saw the met is opening a new goya exhibit.
there are 1 .3 million single men in new york and 1 .8 million single women.
of these more than 3 million people, about 12 think they're having enough sex.
normal is the halfway point between what you want and what you get.
even in the plough position, i could count on samantha for sexual clarity.
- the only thing hotter than sex... is not having sex.
amazingly, talking dirty about not having sex was the most sexually deviant act samantha had participated in for months.
when charlotte discovered that kevin had tucked his libido away for her comfort level, she was even more moved by his restraint.
i want you to know how much i appreciate your patience.
samantha began to feel things she hadn't felt in a very long time, frustrated and horny.
she decided it was time to put an end to her suffering.
but just as she reached the place krishna once called the gateway to life, she turned back and decided not to enter.
after all, she'd come this far, she could continue not to come at all.
after the second show, each of us went on with our saturdays.
miranda went to get a movie and another pound of gummy bears.
saturday night's dinner came and went with no call from big.
my life was suddenly shit, but my cabinets were looking fabulous.
i mean... say it's not the-- then what else is going on?
is it normal to be in the same bed and not do it?
there are 1.3 million single men in new york... 1.8 million single women.
and of these more than 3 million people... about 12 think they're having enough sex.
- one time a day... but two time on very special day.
normal is the halfway point between what you want and what you can get.
no, honey, you're a woman, and men don't like women to be human.
we aren't supposed to fart, douche... use tampons or have hair in places we shouldn't.
terrified of going to mr. big's... for what could become another platonic sleepover...
i paced my apartment and tried not to think about our lack of sex when--
samantha began to feel things she hadn't felt in a very long time-- frustrated and horny.
she decided it was time to put an end to her suffering.
- hey, snapping over gummy bears... might be a sign that celibacy's not for you.
all i can say is that my big payoff better be worth it.
after the second show, each of us went on with our saturdays.
miranda went to get a movie and another pound of gummy bears.
saturday night's dinner came and went with no call from big.
my life was suddenly shit... but my cabinets were looking fabulous.
that was the first night we slept together and didn't make love.
by the next week it was three times in a row, i was beginning to worry.

saturday night's dinner came and went with no call from big.
that was the first night we slept together and didn't make love.
by the middle of the next week, it was three times in a row... and i was beginning to worry.
normal is the halfway point between what you want and what you can get.
even in the plow position, i could count on samantha... for amazing sexual clarity.
with him, i could do it every hour on the hour.
do you think it means something if big and i are sleeping together... but we're not sleeping together?
we aren't supposed to fart, douche... use tampons or have hair in places we shouldn't.
i mean, hell, a guy once broke up with me because i missed a bikini wax.
we've been going out for weeks, and we still haven't done it.
i mean, we touch and cuddle... but he's sweet, and he respects my boundaries.

it says here that 92% of honeys at u.c.l.a. are sexually active.
92% of the women there are walking around saying: "class or sex?"
i know you're leaving tomorrow and i'm going to miss you, man.
i remember in the 7th grade when we mashed our food on our trays and you paid me $ 1 to eat it.
i'm not just telling her how she's more than just mike's girlfriend.
there's this really amazing person inside that no one bothers to see.
you always bought me a card for valentine's day and a bag of those little hearts with words on them.
you got too cool to hang out with me because i was in the smart classes.
try having 40 drunk men grabbing your ass, one groom-to-be throwing up on you, and your car breaking down.
then you can talk to me about having a bad night.
but why would amanda beckett pay any attention to a unique spirit like preston, or even like me?
maybe she's too busy ordering around her little flock of sheep.
do you want to talk about this while you're doing that?
if it's been on your mind for six years, you might have mentioned it.
all i know is tonight i'll be at some bar with chicks all over me.
and you are going to be at home with your lame-ass girlfriends.
if i had arrived on time, i never would have seen her.
but as it was, i was the first person at huntington hills high to set eyes on amanda beckett.
now, up until now, one could write this off to coincidence.
but then she reached into her bag and pulled out a strawberry pop-tart.
you then jump down on them rendering them unconscious with the chloroform we mixed in chem lab.
then we strip off said jock's clothes and take polaroids of them in a lurid, naked embrace.
it say here 92 percent of honeys at ucla are sexually active.
ninety-two percent of women in l.a. at ucla are walking around going, "class or sex?
i gots to give them all an equal opportunity to special k.
it took me all day but i narrowed it down to a list of 10 very lucky finalists.
preston meyers, not one step further until you sign my yearbook.
i'm gonna be the first huntington hills student to get all 522 seniors to sign.
it is finally time for kenny fisher to become the man.
i've done my laps, and all 10 finalists are present and accounted for.
then vice principal billard took it to all the classes to see whose it was.
and i was like, "wasn't that your bag?" and you were like, "no."
i mean, at my old junior high school i was always just this little, well, nobody.
and then i came to huntington freshman year and mike dexter wanted to date me.
it was the first time i'd ever felt cool in my whole life.
please, it was the first time i'd ever had a boyfriend.
maybe we could find out if there's a reason for all of this.
why she's not with mike tonight and after four years, i'm still here with this letter.
you used to sleep at my house, you had to leave the hall light on.
you're kenny fisher who used to buy me a card every valentine's day.
and a bag of those little hearts with the words on them.
you're kenny fisher who got too cool to hang out with me when we hit junior high because i was in all the smart classes.
and as a special treat for you, we'll have the manilow himself to answer your questions live on the phone from his sold-out concert in tokyo.
so if you've got a question for the man who writes the songs get to the phone and call in now.
so, look, don't you make the same mistake i did, okay?
because if you really wanna be with him then you get back on that phone and you call barry manilow and you tell him how you feel.
so, what, were you just, like, saving up all that stuff to tell me?
do you really wanna talk about this while you're doing that?
hey, amanda, remember that time you danced with me at the soph hop?
i never told you, but i had the hugest boner and i thought...
ever since the first time i saw you when you were holding my favorite pop-tart.
and the truth is, i'm leaving tomorrow and if we could go someplace--
- already you think that i am just gonna strip off my clothes and do you right here because-- i don't know.
i don't know, you imagine that we shared some intimate moment that you have probably been drooling over for the past four years.
if i had arrived on time, i never would have seen her.
but as it was, i was the first person at huntingfon hills high... to set eyes on amanda becketf.
now, i will lead mike and one of his random jock friends... behind the pool house to here... and here... where you two will be waiting.
you jump down on them, rendering them unconscious... with the chloroform that we mixed in chem lab.
they say in here... 92% of honeys at ucla are sexually active.
92% of women in los angeles at ucla walking around goin'...
but i figure all the bitches in the class gonna be at this party.
you know, i gots to give 'em all an equal opportunity to special k.
because you tried to leave the bag on the bus so no one would see it.
but then vice principal billard took it around to all the classes... to see who it was, and i was, like, "wasn't that your bag?"
see, that's the problem because mike is the same guy now he was then.
you know, mooning the guy at the drive-through window... giving the underclassmen wedgies.
it's not just to tell her how i think she's more than the homecoming queen... or mike's girlfriend or... how there's this really amazing person inside of her... that no one even bothers to see.
it's in there, too, but... what it's really about... is how she should just give me a chance.
hey, isn't this the weekend... that you're supposed to meet your girlfriend from the internet?
yeah, but she has some photo shoot in fiji... for a catalog or something.
like if i wanted it bad enough, i could make it happen.
and it did... right after his first season of "charles ln charge."
but anyway, the point is, i totally realized... you know, fate.
there is fate, but it only takes you so far... because once you're there, it's up to you to make it happen.
you really want to talk about this while you're doing that?
geez, it could've been on your mind the last six years.
it might be a good idea to lay off that alcohol.
your life's gonna go down the crapper, unless that's what you're goin' for.
i'm gonna be at some bar with chicks all over me.
and you guys... are gonna be at home with your lame-ass girlfriends.
you jump down on them, rendering them unconscious... with the chloroform that we mixed in chem lab.
then we strip off said jocks' clothes... and take polaroids of them in a lurid, naked embrace.
you know, i gots to give 'em all an equal opportunity to special k.
it took me all day, but i narrowed it down... to a list of ten very lucky finalists.
he is not even brad in "twelve monkeys"... when he had that weird eye, and he was all dirty.
girlfriend, mike dexter doesn't even deserve to breathe the same air as brad.
if is finally time for kenny fisher fo become the man.
now i done my laps... and all ten finalisfs are presenf and accounted for.
well, you and me, we never did get that kiss, right?
but i had this mad flashback that you were starin' at me all night.
but then vice principal billard took it around to all the classes... to see who it was, and i was, like, "wasn't that your bag?"
and you were, like, "no." and i was, like, "l think it is, dude."
and then i came to huntington freshman year... and mike dexter wanted to date me.
and all of the sudden, i was, like, "little miss popular."
why would amanda beckett pay attention to a unique spirit like preston... or even a unique spirit like me, for instance?
maybe it's because she's just a little too busy... ordering around her little conformist flock of sheep.
and it did... right after his first season of "charles ln charge."
he was doing this mall tour, and he came here to our mall.
so were you saving up all that stuff to tell me?
you really want to talk about this while you're doing that?
you're not gonna believe what they're doin', not 'cause i made it up... but because it is so... unbelievable, man.
come on out to the pool house with me 'cause they told me... that they want you to watch 'em.
if i had arrived on time, i never would have seen her.
but as it was, i was the first person at huntingfon hills high... to set eyes on amanda becketf.
now, i will lead mike and one of his random jock friends... behind the pool house to here... and here... where you two will be waiting.

and all of the sudden, i was, like, "little miss popular."
why would amanda beckett pay attention to a unique spirit like preston... or even a unique spirit like me, for instance?
maybe it's because she's just a little too busy... ordering around her little conformist flock of sheep.
and it did... right after his first season of "charles ln charge."
he was doing this mall tour, and he came here to our mall.
so were you saving up all that stuff to tell me?
you really want to talk about this while you're doing that?

come on out to the pool house with me 'cause they told me... that they want you to watch 'em.
you jump down on them, rendering them unconscious... with the chloroform that we mixed in chem lab.
then we strip off said jocks' clothes... and take polaroids of them in a lurid, naked embrace.
you know, i gots to give 'em all an equal opportunity to special k.
it took me all day, but i narrowed it down... to a list of ten very lucky finalists.

ronald reagan had the ability to convey whatever he was thinking of in terms that everybody understood.
he just seemed to have a warmness about him that the people felt.
i had no doubt that the soviet goal was world domination.
their military posture, their actions, their foreign policy actions, their aggressive behavior- all of this contributed to that single conclusion.
i had a meeting in moscow with marshal ogarkov, the chief of staff of the soviet armed forces.
and he said, "you know, all modem military capability is based on the computer.
you have little kids in america three years old who know how to deal with computers!
it takes years here to train soviet recruits in the military to use them because they've never used them before.
the president viewed the concept of deterrence between us and the soviet union as no different than holding a cocked gun at each other's heads.
it was very clear to me from the beginning that he was, to say the least, extremely uncomfortable and, as i began to understand later on, he was fundamentally, morally, ethically opposed to the concept
what if free people could live secure in the knowledge that their security did not rest upon the threat of instant us retaliation to deter a soviet attack?
that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil or that of our allies?
i know this is a formidable technical task, one that may not be accomplished before the end of this century.
i call upon the scientific community in our country, those who gave us nuclear weapons, to turn their great talents now to the cause of mankind and world peace - to give us the means of rendering these nuclear weapons impotent and obsolete.
a system domestic critics today called 'too high-cost, too high tech, too pie-in-the-sky'.
suppose we had been talking in terms of 1940 and somebody had said, "we can take a little atom, an atom is something you can't see.
reagan's strategic defense initiative 'sdl' - nicknamed "star wars" after the movie- envisaged satellite and ground-based weapons that could destroy soviet missiles with darts and laser beams.
it was a shock - it's like all our hopes for beginning of the understanding now dangerous is militarization of space, just suddenly evaporated.
reagan's critics said that sdi was hugely expensive and would never work.
they were appalled by the deep cuts in welfare programs that would be needed to pay for it.
and he called me into the oval office the next morning and he said, "bud, margaret and we are just not getting along on this sdi issue.
i wish you'd go to london and see if you can't at least lower the level of criticism publicly.
we're going to have a tough time getting appropriations if this keeps up...
she gave me the same lecture she had given two weeks before and, seeing i was getting nowhere, i interjected during a pause,
the banking system was to be closely watched, as were the hospitals and road building programs.
were the banks attempting to convert their system to a war footing?
the americans stepped up spy flights in sensitive areas along the soviet union's long borders.
aircraft packed with electronic surveillance gear looked like civilian airliners and often flew close to passenger routes.
i received a phone call informing me that an unidentified plane had been spotted over kamchatka, and that our attempts to contact it had been unsuccessful.
i ensured that all the forces at our disposal were immediately put on alert.
i could see two rows of windows which were lit up.
i wondered if it was a civilian aircraft- military cargo planes don't have such windows.
there was a pilot error, bad weather, one thing led to another.
it was not a pre-planned action - no one wanted this.
i think only a tiny handful of people knew the full details of how fearful they were.
and we knew them, as is now public knowledge, through some extremely well-placed agents who were able to pass on the information that the russians actually feared that the west was preparing for aggressive nuclear war against the soviet union.
i had been told by these fellows at the white house that, of course, if i were ever writing anything for the
president, it had to be single... double-spaced, one and a half pages.
i said, "mr. president, if you are re-elected, will this policy of small steps toward better relations be a continuing policy of your administration?"
and ronald reagan had a pretty eagle eye when he wanted to and he looked down at me and he said, very definitely, he said, "yes!
we needed to try to search out the people who would guide the soviet union after brezhnev, after andropov.
and looking around, there were about two or three possible people in terms of age and seniority.
we dispatched invitations to all three and it was pure chance that gorbachev was the one who accepted first.
when gorbachev came to the united kingdom, he indeed brought his wife, and that was one of the first signs that we were dealing with someone quite different.
which the people will no longer tolerate - or we can try to defuse international tension and overcome the disagreement between east and west.
and so free up the gigantic sums that are spent on armaments in the soviet union."
the stage was set for the first super-power summit in six years.
reagan too was keen to find out whether he could do business with gorbachev.
i felt always that president reagan was exactly the kind of man that russians under normal circumstances would have really liked, the kind of american that they would really like.
first of all, he's kind of an icon, you know, he's a cowboy, and they loved that!
"tired old man", president of the united states, could keep up with this "wily, energetic, young, vigorous communist".
and to the amazement of the world, the old man goes down the steps - lickety split- meets and greets the soviet leader who comes out all bundled up in an overcoat, hat, muffler, looking as though he were in iceland rather than geneva.
"but you must believe that this is so important for the safety of the world that i will give you the technology as we, as we develop it."
and gorbachev laughed and said, "mr. president, surely you understand i can't believe that- since you won't even give us the technology for milking machines!"
and the more submarines we sent out to sea, the more you sent out.
this dangerous concentration and proximity of nuclear submarines could lead to unpredictable consequences.
a nuclear disaster did occur- but not between the two superpowers.
in april 1986, an explosion ripped apart number 4 reactor at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in ukraine north of kiev.
the firemen who got burnt while helping to extinguish the blaze were brought to a hospital near where i lived.
at the time, people knew nothing about radiation and there was a lot of confusion about how it was transmitted.
gorbachev now decided to re-examine reagan's first ever arms control proposal- known as the "zero option".
reagan had offered not to deploy cruise and pershing missiles in
either he could free up resources from the arms race or he'd be forced to look for them elsewhere.
i was with him when he decided to confront reagan with the question:
he had come, as he said to me, raising his fingers,
"don, we were that close to an agreement and he wouldn't give in!"
we were frankly caught quite badly by surprise when we learned that discussions were encompassing the concept of abolishing nuclear weapons altogether.
that would, of course, laid waste the doctrine of nuclear deterrence and we we would have been left without the very centre of our strategy.
gorbachev set rust free, but used the incursion as an excuse to dismiss several members of the soviet high command.
media, the fax machine, the computer, were opening up the ussr.
so don't you think that the concept of nuclear deterrence, in fact, invites the side that believes in it to use the nuclear weapons in the end, just to prove this threat from time to time?
isn't a policy of conventional weapons, with the terrible bombs raining down, with the missiles, with the aircraft, with the submarines, with the torpedoes, with the tanks, with chemical weapons- isn't that based on the
gorbachev, in the united states for the first time, had come to sign an historic treaty.
his visit, seen live on soviet tv, enhanced his standing at home- and abroad.
united states in those days who would have moved forward as reagan did, to engage gorbachev, to engage the western alliance, to truly lead the western alliance, and to take us through what became, of course,
a very constructive introductory period to the end of the cold war.
in another milestone in reducing cold war tension, inspection teams from both sides supervised the destruction.
in his last year as president, ronald reagan paid his first ever visit to the kremlin.
he found a good place to announce it - right in the middle of the kremlin.
but, nevertheless, he said that he was doing it, not because he was wrong when he initially said it, but because by 1988 the soviet union had come a long way under the leadership of mikhail gorbachev.
grouchy as ever, but we made a new friend today named trevis.
i'll introduce him to you tomorrow as soon as you get home.
yes... but i'm bringing you back some beautiful sillinite crystals and lots of holopictures for your data album.
now be a good girl and get ready for bed while i talk to neelix.
just keep us away from the volcanoes and we'll be okay.
i've got a big meteor crater, 500 kilometers across, 3.7 deep.
i was just about to take her to the holodeck for some more storytelling.
call me an optimist, neelix, but i'm still counting on a happy ending.
they struggled along without them, making do with whatever energy sources they could find.
then, one day, a mitochondrial ancestor arrived, broke though the cell wall and made himself at home.
neelix, did you have a favorite holodeck program when you were growing up?
well, we didn't have any holodecks on rinax, but it didn't matter because we had a great big forest right behind my house.
guess i shouldn't barge into your kitchen and tell you how to cook.
flotter-- now there's a name i haven't heard in a while.

first thing in the morning, i want you to explain the situation.
when you were her age, you were safe and sound on earth with two healthy parents to take care of you.
you never had to worry about the possibility of being alone!
you have been an exemplary mother to naomi and she is in the hands of people you trust.
she will survive and prosper, no matter what becomes of us.

i'm not moving for a restraining order because i belong here.
and as much as i hate to admit it, i broke the rules.
mr. warner, do you realize that by pleading guilty... you waive your constitutional rights... and i may impose upon you any sentence up to and including the maximum?
then, when the abu grab torture thing sum aced... and it was revealed that our government participated in rendition... a practice where we kidnap people... and turn them over to regimes who specialize in torture...
i was sure then the american people would be heard from.
and now it's been discovered the executive branch... has been conducting massive, illegal domestic surveillance... on its own citizens- you and me.
and i at least consoled myself that finally- nod/_- the american people will have had enough.
at a presidential rally, parade or appearance... if you have on a supportive t-shirt, you can be there.
if you're wearing roaring something in protest, you can be removed.
i would ask you now to go back to that room and speak for her.
before i hand down my sentence, does the defendant wish to say anything?
your honor, i'm just one guy out there... asking people to be more courteous.
but what if this were utopia... and we all did it?
it's strange, isn't it... how love supersedes everything that goes wrong.
i still remember the first time bev let me go "parceling. "
i'm being profiled, if you can imagine, and somehow the issue of the death penalty comes up, and i said that i've always been categorically opposed.
and the prosecutor from the capital case must have read it, and he had me arrested for committing perjury against the federal court.
well, i'm certainly having nothing to do with you, mr. dirty mouth.
i came to talk to shirley because she is a name partner in crane, poole schmidt.
- yes, and i am sorry, because i sense you and i could be friends.
but i have been wronged by your firm, shirley, specifically by mr. dirty mouth, here.
# he also had apartments to rent up on top # # but he didn't include on the sign that he painted "no pets" #
# and the tenant who rented had six hungry dogs he regrets # # but he said!
i've got a caterer coming in 20 minutes, so i want the conference room clean and i mean...
mr. jones, would you please explain what a death-qualified jury is?
during voir dire, jurors are asked the so-called witherspoon questions, named for the supreme court decision that determined the process for jury selection in a capital case.
according to witherspoon, jurors who simply have a general objection to the death penalty cannot be kept off, but anyone who would always voted against the death penalty under any circumstances can be.
you'll meet my mother, denny, you'll be nice to her and dignified.
did your wife ever say to you that i was a pedophile?
did you ever say anything to these despicable lawyer people that could lead them to think i killed your wife, god rest her soul?
there's nothing i told them in support of their theory that you were the killer.
this goes to trial, one of us is a pretty terrible lawyer.
our only defense is civil disobedience, jerry, and it's not a particularly legal one at that.
if you admit you oppose capital punishment, they keep you off the jury, having only pro-death penalty people on the jury is completely unfair to the defendant, which is why i committed an act of civil disobedience,
to call attention to the gross unfairness of my sexual surrogate.
what i'm not sure you appreciate... this case you were a juror on... it was of enormous importance to the government.
it was an opportunity to bring the death penalty to a state that doesn't have it.
well... he implied i was a pedophile, a freak who should be registered as a sex offender when i have committed no such offense.
and even if i had, which i most certainly have not, to suggest that i'm a killer, a murderer?
say a small town is having a community meeting to vote on whether or not to build a big incinerator.
but before the selectmen let you into the meeting, they ask you how you feel about incinerators, and if you're opposed to them, you don't get to go to the meeting.
well, here we are in massachusetts, a state with no death penalty.
one would assume therefore that the majority of the community is opposed to capital punishment.
we all know intuitively, if you start talking about punishment before a trial even begins, you're putting the idea of guilt in the forefront of everyone's mind.
yet, presumption of innocence... is the foundation of our whole justice system.
president bush is back in the white house today after a 2 1/2-week vacation at his ranch in crawford, texas.
the president travelled via air force one arriving in washington early this morning.
it's one reason, i think, she ended up going to law school.
she had no idea that i used to sleep with you.
and, mr. meyer, before you decide to go sue anybody else, you might consider that truth is also a defense to defamation.
for my money, you appear to be a seriously disturbed man.
# yes, i know it's a drag it's a doggone shame #
# i've danced the same dance, # # felt the same pain i had the same passion # # and done the same things as you # # yeah, you better believe me, it's true i've worn the same shoe, #
i guess i'll£­£­ l guess i'm gonna have to£­£­ l don't know, write a poem on it.
no, but really, the reason why i came by was to say thank you.
you see, this coffee machine has the coffee already made when you come down in the morning.
the toaster has your son's name, and the names of his family, your grandchildren and their love on it.
my son brought us this coffee£­maker, and he means well, but we would like to change it for something we can really use.
you know, like a£­£­ l don't know, a toaster or something?
but there is a limit to how much you can bleed your victims.
too much greed can destroy us as surely as a battle.
touch me again and i'll put the dagger in your heart.
at the same time i put a knife in your throat.
i said i would open for her if she doesn't get back.
did taja say anything about her talking with the other local merchants?
well, i'd kick the hell out of 'em myself, but then i'm a god, i can do that sort of thing.
just like that you're telling me to be no better than them?
oh, no, you have to be better, much better to win.
i spent my whole life believing that aggression was not the way.
i learned to fight to defend myself and to defend my realm, not to attack.
but you were also taught to fight for what you believe in, for what you know is right.
the assassin stole the ancient medallion... the symbol of our leadership.
but with it, or without it, i am the new leader of the black dragon.
on a beach, bones in the sand tell a story of early christian life, ancestral memories and tribal conflict.
those bones came from a site in a remote part of ireland.
i came here to see an early christian site dating back maybe 1,200 or 1,400 years.
but so much more has emerged that it looks as though those burials may belong to a family using an ancestral burial ground, dating back into prehistoric times.
the next day, a team of geophysical surveyors arrived to investigate the structure of the ground.
we have solid rock which drops, over a distance of about two metres, to a depth of 50 centimetres.
betty was convinced that the cairn was built on a natural rock outcrop.
martina, leading the geophysicists, is processing the first results of the survey.
so you're saying we're looking at a monument which is built on sand - it's not a rock outcrop that's been augmented?
from the results, it looks like it is built on sand, and it appears to be wind-blown sand.
yes, minus modern things like fences, and so on - they're not here.
while jane got on with painting, i went to have a look at that lake.
in ireland we are lucky in that we do have early historic records.
if we get radiocarbon dates on these, which will indicate which century they belong to, there's a possibility we might be able to link them in with a particular group of people.
it looks a bit dried out since i last saw it.
yes, i deliberately dried it out because when i got it, it was still damp.
with inflammation of the lachrymal gland, there would be pain - in here, above the left eye.
and the white part of her eye might have had little red veins - as you'd see in someone with conjunctivitis.
i suspect that the eyelid would have been swollen as well.
from the wear on her molars, moira thought she died in her late 40s.
the only definite thing i will say is that it wasn't a very abrasive substance.
despite her poor state, the woman from donegal can provide us with clues.
we also want to know the date of that cremation pit.
that's being dated as well, and we hope it will be in the prehistoric period.
then, i went to belfast university with the bones from donegal.
they have one of the most accurate carbon dating labs in the world.
i wondered if the groove in the tooth could be proven scientifically to be a wear mark.
i went to see forensic orthodontist david whittaker at cardiff dental hospital.
that has gone through my mouth and it's much...smoother, if you like.
the dampness from the spittle helps the fibres of the flax to lie flat.
while i was here, i saw a reconstructed ring fort where early christians would have lived.
if this was home, it's certainly cosy, but where are the pots and pans?
probably a metal container, perhaps a cauldron, which would have lasted indefinitely.
but you'd eat out of wooden bowls and serve your food out of wooden troughs?
in a roundhouse nearby, betty laid on a demonstration of how early irish christians prepared their dead for burial.
we know from 7th century literary sources that clerics, at any rate, were wrapped in white linen winding sheets.
with the skeleton we excavated, the feet were wrapped extremely close together.
but in this period we didn't have shroud pins, so we're using a piece of flax to hold the shroud in place at this point.
the surface of the skull is scanned by a laser and the information is fed into a computer.
dr robin richards is in charge of the maxillofacial unit at ucl.
'we know she was middle-aged and had an eye infection, 'but what colour were her hair and eyes and complexion?
'while jane got on with her work, 'it was back to belfast for the final jigsaw piece.
six months ago, i helped to excavate her remains in donegal.
since then, with the help of experts, she's gone from a collection of bones to a person you can come face to face with.
we know about her eye condition, how painful it must have been, and we can suggest how she dressed.
as a christian, she would have had a headdress, and this woollen cloak would have been held with a brooch.
so we can really build up a picture of how she looked.
now we know when she died, betty has discovered from ancient irish documents that she belonged to one of two clans - the cenel coirpre or the cenel conail.
worshipers of apollo, you have come to this temple... on this day of cleansing to be purified for past misdeeds.
this blessing is of no worth if you leave here... and once again soil your souls with willful and selfish acts.
well, not all of us are strong enough to face the jaws of our conscience alone.
people come to me who are close to being driven mad by remorse and guilt.
hey, look, i never said i was a goody two-shoes, but i'm here to turn it around!
i wanna be a hero and fight for good, protect wimps and kick the crap out of jerks!
xena, i have learned a lot in these last few years.
and one of the things i've learned is that you can't save everyone.
i'm gonna ride down and knock the silesians around a little bit first.
that'll either turn 'em around or slow 'em down... long enough for us to make our move on the gang.
i had so much anger for that poor, little kid, i never gave her a chance, and you helped me deal with that.
you did everything just right-- including a little bit of, uh, tough love.
but we do need the money we'll get from selling it.
you know, if you and i head to athens, we could get some action going there.
you have come to this temple on this day of cleansing to be purified for past misdeeds.

i'm gonna get closer and try to isolate one of 'em.
and put your squeeze on him, or whatever you call it.
xena, i have learned a lot in these last few years.
and one of the things i've learned is that you can't save everyone.
-i'm gonna ride down and knock the silesians around a little bit first.
that'll either turn 'em around, or at least slow 'em down long enough for us to make our move on the gang.
whether that power comes from the mind or the urn i don't know.
but it could just be an old piece of pottery with really pretty gems on it, right?
but we do need the money we'll get from selling it.
you know, if you and i head to athens, we could get some action going there.
"for now though my friend and i must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us,"

how was it that this guy is still alive and i didn't know about it?
she never hung up the phone so i was able to triangulate the signal.
and called the dover police, they told me about the robbery.
like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a suicide?
but if you really believe that why are you so hell bent on finding out what mr fenigor has to say?
you are the only person who can help me find out who my parents are.
look you are being held against your will, you feel trapped and you feel terrified.
- and i suppose my loyalty should go out to you.
- and what would you do if fenigor confess that it was your father who killed your mother?
there is something here a lot more important to her than cash.
and i feel real sorry for you if you're too blind to see what that is.
you should have known better than to come here without a directive.
you should know better than to defy tower policy by having jarod assassinated.

then i called mr. parker's office, but, uh, nobody's gotten back to me.
like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a... suicide?
but if you really believe that, why are you so hell-bent... on finding out what mr. fenigor has to say?
it is one thing to defend yourself against an armed guard.
it's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back.
- how does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator?
you wouldn't be the prey if you'd get back to the centre where you belong.
there is something here a lot more important to her than cash... and i
- i feel real sorry for you if you're too blind to see what that is.
you should've known better than to come here without a directive.
you should know better than to defy tower policy... by having jarod assassinated.
get me out of here, and i'll tell you everything- both of you.
[miss parker] what are you going to do with that dye pack?
"how excited i am at the prospect of showing you the world."
"for now though my friend and i must amend some of the ugliness that exists around us,"
the sooner they get their money and leave the sooner we get the answers from fenigor.
listen to me people, nobody speaks, nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.
we do know gunshots have been fired and hostages have been taken.
she never hung up the phone so i was able to triangulate the signal.
and called the dover police, they told me about the robbery.
then i called mr parker's office, but nobody's got back to me.
my father had his reasons for keeping those letters from me.
like he had his reasons for saying that your mother's death was a suicide?
it's one thing to defend yourself against an armed bank guard.
it's another thing to shoot an innocent man in the back.
details at this time are sketchy, however another shot was just heard from inside the bank.
i'm going to make my way to the swat commander now for confirmation.
- how does it feel to be the prey instead of the predator?
- well you wouldn't be the prey if you get back to the centre where you belong.
you think that little girl came down here today for money?
there is something here a lot more important to her than cash.

it's you who are the one that has come to this lost place.
if you believe that a beautiful place where it's normal that it is said good day it's a lost place.
i prepare myself for pecking in the stomach and all the rest.
yes, but you know that the real men also wash themselves eh?
in any case if it is true that they are concubines... do well to prevent.
freddy, do not exaggerate, we are not going to put a banner to them anyway.
dan and i loved each other so much that we wanted a baby.
it's true that we could have adopted, but for a couple like us is not easy...
you could say an accident ... but by force we could not any more that to admire that it had the courage of existing.
and that this land did not spit their roots and welcome.
i also had to welcome you, and be worthy of you, as what you are.
and that is because you showed me that i could be proud of you.
and zoé, the most beautiful, and the most wished do not doubt your love.
a son that they say what they should say is mine and he will be mine at the bottom of my heart."
it is you who are the one that has come to this lost place.
if you believe that a beautiful place where it is normal that it is said good day it is a lost place.
am not so fucked by me as to give you two followed drubbing.
very well, well, the king has died and the king lives.
i do not understand why so suddenly this has so much importance.
is not the first time that they treat to us of tortilleras.
that is for your fault that i have no dad and that they detest me!
i go with him, has need for someone... and i do not believe that it is you who are.
mine went away when he found out that my mother was pregnant of me.
i would change with taste to my father and to my brothers for dan.
the child asked him if the quería to be his dad.
can be. . it can be that it is normal after everything.
if you had listened to me 10 years ago, we would not have these problems.
but you knew it better than the whole world and you wanted to do it with a type.
that means that otherwise i had existed, and he had not had a father.
you know that if in belgium they accept the insemination in women's couples, it is not for anything.
a boy without father is already not evident, but with parents like you...
and also we all have need to know who we are.
you know simon... there is something about what i never spoke to you.
a thing... minor for me, but i believe that it is very, very important for you.
give and i we were loving each other so much that we wanted a baby.
is true that we might have adopted, but for a couple as we it is...
and also i was wanting to have you in my belly.
so we decide that i would do it with a man.
and that this ground was not spitting his roots and was receiving it.
i also have had to receive you, and to be worth of you, of your difference.
in any case, it is possible that it is known, if it is not going to be difficult to find it.
but, there is something that i know and it is... that give really loves you very much and...
she has done many things for you... is not just for her.
do you find just everything what it spends to me through the fault of her?
but it is not possible to turn back, and if really i love you so much, and i cannot be what you wish.
so after the shame, the rejection, and the desire of disappearing, only i have left a thing for doing,
and zoé, the most beautiful, and the most wished do not doubt your love.
a son that they say what they should say is mine and it will be mine at the bottom of my being."
whatever you charge, it would be worth it to save my son from a life of crime.
well, i... you wouldn't take on my case, would you, frank?
if this nurse brings charges, he'll be ruined, his career, his life, and we can't have that.
you have to be my eyes and ears and legs, geoffrey.

then i didn't see the sun or the stars again for nearly ten years.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
he protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive.
and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself
and if you had lived my life, you would understand my responsibility to the federation.
i cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship... in time... when that trust has been earned.
captain, we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up, but he's got it, captain.

i don't know if all this has made any sense, but i wanted you to know what kind of man he was.
in his quest to be more like us he helped us to see what it means to be human.
at last the destinies of the planets romulus and remus will be united.

almost nothing is known of the reman homeworld although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
the remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the empire.
captain picard agrees that the b-4 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
maybe the provisional memory storage is in case his neural pathways overload.
do you mind if i keep him here for a while run a few diagnostics?
we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation, i suggest you do it now.
then i didn't see the sun or the stars again for nearly ten years.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
he protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive.
and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself
and if you had lived my life, you would understand my responsibility to the federation.
i cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
what better example than a starfleet captain standing in the romulan senate.
nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship... in time... when that trust has been earned.
it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.
the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its biogenic properties.
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.
although you share the same genetic structure, the events of your life have created a unique individual.
if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would've rejected my humanity?
your heart, your hands... your eyes are the same as mine.
the blood pumping within you-- the raw material is the same.
well, i can't think of a better man for the job.
if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
i don't know if all this has made any sense, but i wanted you to know what kind of man he was.
in his quest to be more like us he helped us to see what it means to be human.
at last the destinies of the planets romulus and remus will be united.
shinzon of remus offers us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever.
but none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man.
now, on an occasion such as this, it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union.
due to the extreme temperatures on that half, the remans live on the dark side.
little is known of the reman homeworid, although scans have revealed diiithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
he agrees that the b-4 probably has the same seif-actuaiisation parameters as myself.
if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix,
we came to romuius on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
if you have anything to say to us as federation representatives, do it now.
the romuians had gained possession of your dna and created me.
and when i was ready, they were going to replace you with me.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
but one man took pity on me, the man that became my viceroy and protected me from the guards' cruelty.
if you'd lived mine, you'd understand my responsibility to the federation.
i cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing so that his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly and skip 30 years of his life.
but the sequencing wasn't activated, so his cellular structure is decaying.
the crew has responded with the dedication i've come to expect.
like a thousand other commanders on other battlefields, i wait for the dawn.
although you share the same genetic structure, your life has created an individual.
if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would have rejected my humanity?
captain picard, i welcome you in the tradition of my people.
we are so honoured to be accepted within the great federation family.
i'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
i'm going to ask worf to delay his return to ds9.
i should never have let you talk me into that duck blind.
federation procedures have made this more difficult than it needed to be.
i know what data means to starfleet, but our crew are in danger.
if our attempt to capture data fails, i will terminate him.
all right, you have 12 hours, then i want you out of the briar patch.
we'll head out to the perimeter to call for son'a reinforcements.
- his heart should stamp - and his throat should growl
- his hair should curl - and his face should scowl
creating a machine to do man's work takes something away from man.
at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
if it wasn't for data, it's probable that you would be relocated by now.
the moment we pick up a weapon we become one of them.
but some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of one people to satisfy another.
i had hoped that we had learned from our mistakes, but it seems that some of us haven't.
our best scientific minds can't find any other way to do this.
the son'a can establish a separate colony on the planet until we do.
how can i look at a sunrise, knowing what my sight cost these people?
exposure could stimulate rebellious instincts common to youth which would affect everyone's judgement ... except mine.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time.
i'd accept that in exchange for knowing what childhood is like.
a court martial will let the people know what is happening here.
the enterprise has destroyed one ship, the other is on fire.
i can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything i've spent a lifetime defending. i have to go back ... lf only to slow things down at the federation council.
i have 318 days of shore leave coming, and i intend to use them.
and the federation council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly.
in view of our losses to the borg and the dominion, the council feels we need all the allies we can get these days.
captain picard, may i welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people.
we are so honored to be accepted within the great federation family.
i'm going to ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so that he can join us.
we're gonna stop by sector 441 on our way to the goren system.
i never should have let you talk me into that duck blind in the first place.
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be.
i've already had commander la forge modify this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
its operational range is only 4 meters, but it will shut him down.
look at this. "the son'a are known to have produced mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white."
"their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the second khitomer accord."
i know what data means to starfleet, jean-luc, but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet.
if our first attempt to capture data fails i will terminate him.
there was a phase variance in his positronic matrix, which we were unable to repair.
i think the captain finds it hard to believe that we'd have any skills repairing a positronic device.
our technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives.
we believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.
- his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions.
but you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
i was in an isolation suit gathering physiometric data on the ba'ku.
my last memory is going into the hills, following some children.
i won't need any more genetic manipulation if our federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.
tricorder functions are limited due to heavy deposits of kelbonite in these hills.
the question is, why would anyone want to create one of our village?
data, if you were following the children and discovered this ship...
it is conceivable i was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
why would they duplicate this village, except to deceive the ba'ku?
you go to sleep one night in the village, wake up the next morning on this flying holodeck, transported en masse.
within a few days, they're relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
the metaphasic radiation won't begin to affect him until he reaches maturity.
to most offlanders, what you have here is more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.
but some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a large one.
i'd hoped that we'd learn from our mistakes, but it seems that some of us haven't.
we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.
the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles from the planet's rings.
it will help prevent spaceships from beaming anyone off the surface.
these veins of kelbonite running through the hills will interfere with their transporters.
i will never know the experience of growing up or tripping over my own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don't like.
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
not that we care about such things in this day and age.
captain, they're trying to drive us out so their drones can tag us.
with all the hydrothermal vents in the substrata, the structural integrity of this cavern is not going to hold for long.
order them to surrender, and i promise you won't be court-martialed.
if a court martial is the only way to let the people of the federation know what is happening here, i welcome it.
i can't believe he would have given that order without your consent, admiral.
i wonder which of us will be facing that court martial.
the children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled.
except that ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated into parricide.
sir, the federation ship is creating a disruption in our shields.
if they go out of phase, it will increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction.
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
isolate one and reroute its command sequence through the auxiliary processor.
you think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation, it'll change the way we feel?
your feelings about her have not changed since the day i met you, commander.
this place just let them out for a little fresh air.
i wish there were a way to bring them back home.
i can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything that i've spent a lifetime defending.
i have to go back, if only to slow things down at the federation council.
does the chef have a dressing that goes well with chrysanthemums?
captain picard, command wants to know our eta at the goren system?
i'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
i'm going to ask worf to delay his return to ds9.
la forge has modified this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
its range is only four metres, but it will shut him down.
a brltish tar is a soaring soul as free as a mountain bird
his energetic fist should be ready to resist a dictatorial word
creating a machine to do man's work takes something away from man.
at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
the system prevents anyone from taking advantage of his memory loss.
yet he attacked us and told the ba'ku we were a threat.
a small group of us set off to find a new home.
a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.
how can i look at a sunrise, knowing what my sight cost these people?
exposure could stimulate rebellious instincts common to youth which would affect everyone's judgement... except mine.
i will never experience growing up or tripping over my own feet.

transported en masse, and in a few days relocated on a similar planet without ever realising it.
a small group of us set off to find a new home.
a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.
we've always known that to survive we had to remain apart.

your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be.
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk.
you continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer.
i prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the federation.
mr worf, our job is to come up with a plan to safely capture data.
i've already had commander la forge modify this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
half century ago, they conquered two primitive races, the tariac and the eiiora, and then integrated them into their culture as a labour class.
look at this. "the son'a are known to have produced mass quantities of the narcotic ketracei-white."
i know what data means to starfleet, jean-luc, but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the planet.

a century ago, a group of our young people wanted to follow the ways of the offianders.
they tried to take over the colony, and when they faiied--
you brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud, admiral.
the children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled.
it must have been strange for you when you were a hostage.
surrounded by all the friends and family you knew all those years ago.
yes, but without the codes, it wouid have to be activated at the upper control matrix on the collector.
mr worf, try and find some way to beam through those shields.
you think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation, it'ii change the way we feel?
your feelings about her have not changed since the day i met you, commander.

why would the federation or the son'a wish to move the ba'ku?
the metaphasic radiation won't begin to affect him until he reaches maturity.
to most off-landers, what you have here is more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.
you don't live up to your reputation as an offlander, picard.
well, in defense of offlanders, there are many more people like me.
we'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.
the son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles from the planet's rings.
then the son'a can establish a separate colony on the planet until we do.
it would take 10 years of normal exposure to begin to reverse their condition.
the borg, the cardassians, the dominion, they all smell the scent of death on the federation.
that's why you've embraced our offer, because it will give your dear federation new life.
a child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next.
it is a wonder you do not trip over your own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don't like.
i would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
order them to surrender and i promise you won't be court-martialed.
if a court-martial is the only way to let the people of the federation know what is happening here, i welcome it.
yes, but without the codes, it would have to be activated at the upper control matrix on the collector.
mr. worf, try and find some way to beam through those shields.
your feelings about her have not changed since the day i met you, commander.
this place just let them out for a little fresh air.
i can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything that i've spent a lifetime defending.
i have to go back, if only to slow things down at the federation council.
i beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance.
by joining shinzon's forces with ours not even the federation will be able to stand in our way.
then i call for a vote on the motion to open trade negotiations with zeles ii.
as you know the remus mines have not been filling their quotes for months now.
i have represented the federation in first contact with 27 alien species.
but none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man!
now, i know on an occasion such as this, it is expected that i'll be gracious and fulsome in my preys on the wanders of this blessed union.
but have the two of you considered what you are doing to me?
captain, i do not think it is appropriate for a starfleet officer to appear naked.
oh, come on, a big handsome fellow like you ... what can you be afraid of?
dr's sung interest for strange names seems to have no end.
can you tell us how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
you are the closest ship, so i want you to go and hear what he has to say.
if the empire becomes unstable it could mean trouble for the entire quadrant.
although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithian mining and heavy weapons construction.
the remans themselves are considered an undesirable cast in the hierarchy of the empire.
we can inform that he is relatively young and a capable commander.
he fought 12 major engagements in the war - all successful.
captain picard agrees that the b4 was probably designed with the same safe actualization parameters as myself.
if my memory is successfully integrated into his positronic matrix he should have all my abilities.
remember, he is a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
we just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
maybe the provisional memory storage it's the case of his neuropath ways overload
do you mind if i keep him for a while, for a few diagnostics?
right now you're thinking this all sounds to good to be true.
but you're also thinking that the chance for peace is too promising to ignore.
then i didn't see the sun or the stars again for nearly 10 years.
the only thing that romulan guards hated more than the remans, was me.
geordi supplied me with a protoytpe for the emergency transport unit.
i recommend you use this sir to return to the enterprise.
the unique properties of thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limit.
depending on its radiant intensity, it could face a ship or a planet.
the crew has responded at the dedication i come to expect of them.
like a thousand other commanders on a thousand other battlefields i wait for the dawn.
although you share the same genetic structure the events of your life have created a unique individual.
if i had lived his life is it possible that i would have rejected my humanity?
he thinks he knows exactly what am i going to do.
... geordi divert all power to the engines take it from life support if you have to give me everything you got.
well, i can't think of a better man for the job.
if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
i have represented the federation in first contact with 27 alien species.
but none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man.
now, on an occasion such as this, it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union.

due to the extreme temperatures on that half, the remans live on the dark side.
little is known of the reman home world, although scans have revealed dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
he agrees that the b-4 probably has the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix,
we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
if you have anything to say to us as federation representatives, do it now.
the romulans had gained possession of your dna and created me.
and when i was ready, they were going to replace you with me.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
but one man took pity on me, the man that became my viceroy and protected me from the guards' cruelty.
if you'd lived mine, you'd understand my responsibility to the federation.
i cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing so that his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly and skip 30 years of his life.
but the sequencing wasn't activated, so his cellular structure is decaying.
the crew has responded with the dedication i've come to expect.
like a thousand other commanders on other battlefields, i wait for the dawn.
although you share the same genetic structure, your life has created an individual.
if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would have rejected my humanity?
and as earth dies, remember i will always be shinzon of remus!
my voice shall echo through time long after yours has faded to a dim memory!
at last the destinies of the planets romulus and remus will be united.
shinzon of remus offers us a chance to make ourselves stronger than ever.
but none of this compares with my solemn duty today as best man.
now, on an occasion such as this, it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union.
as you can see, one side of remus always faces the sun.
due to the extreme temperatures on that half, the remans live on the dark side.

i still can't believe the captain went along with a memory download.
he agrees that the b-4 probably has the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
- as happens frequently on romulus, a new government came to power and abandoned the plan.
they were afraid i'd be discovered and that it would lead to war.
i didn't see the sun or the stars for ten years.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
if you had lived my life, and experienced the suffering of my people, you'd be standing where i am.
if you'd lived mine, you'd understand my responsibility to the federation.
it caused quite a stir in the family, but i'd spent my youth...
looking at the stars, dreaming about what was up there, about...
if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would have rejected my humanity?
b-4 is identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.
report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course.
i'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
la forge has modified this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
its range is only four metres, but it will shut him down.
i know what data means to starfleet, but our crew are in danger.
if our attempt to capture data fails, i will terminate him.
all right, you have 12 hours, then i want you out of the briar patch.
we'll head out to the perimeter to call for son'a reinforcements.

- "his hea"rt "should stamp" - "and his throat should growl"
and this should be his customary attitude his foot should stamp and his voice should drop his hair should curl and his face ...
if we do not release him, he may destroy both vessels.
creating a machine to do man's work takes something away from man.
at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
i won't need any more genetic manipulation if our federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.
tricorder functions are limited due to kelbonite deposits in the area.
if you were following the children and discovered this ship ...
i may have been shot to protect the secret of its existence.
if it wasn't for data, it's probable that you would be relocated by now.
the moment we pick up a weapon we become one of them.
but some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of one people to satisfy another.
i had hoped that we had learned from our mistakes, but it seems that some of us haven't.
i will never experience growing up or tripping over my own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time.
does the chef have a dressing that goes well with chrysanthemums?
captain picard, command wants to know our eta at the goren system?
report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course.
i'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
la forge has modified this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
its range is only four mitres, but it will shut him down.
i know what data means to starfleet, but our crew are in danger.
if our attempt to capture data fails, i will terminate him.
all right, you have 12 hours, then i want you out of the briar patch.
we'll head out to the perimeter to call for son'a reinforcements.
- his nose should pant - and his lips should curl
- his cheeks should flame - and his brow should furl
- his heart should stamp - and his throat should growl

if we do not release him, he may destroy both vessels.
we were unable to repair the phase variance in his positronic matrix.
the captain finds it hard to believe we possess such technical skills.
the system prevents anyone from taking advantage of his memory loss.
yet he attacked us and told the ba'ku we were a threat.
i won't need any more genetic manipulation if our federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.
tricorder functions are limited due to kelbonite deposits in the area.
if you were following the children and discovered this ship ... i may have been shot to protect the secret of its existence.
why would they duplicate this village except to deceive the ba'ku?
you'd fall asleep in your village and wake up on this flying holodeck.
transported en masse, and in a few days relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
a small group of us set off to find a new home.
a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.
we've always known that to survive we had to remain apart.
many of the young people want to know more about the offland.
i will never experience growing up or tripping over my own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time.
and the federation council decided to make them a protectorate so quickly.
in view of our losses to the borg and the dominion, the council feels we need all the allies we can get these days.
captain picard, may i welcome you in the time-honored tradition of my people?
we are so honored to be accepted within the great federation family.
i would like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
i'm going to ask worf to delay his return to ds9 so that he can join us.
your federation procedures have made this mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be.
our procedures were in place to protect the planet's population from unnecessary risk.
mr. worf, our job is to come up with a plan to safely capture data.
i've already had commander la forge modify this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
the son'a are known to have produced mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white.
their ships are rumored to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the second khitomer accord.
ru'afo and i have decided to send in an assault team.
commander worf and i are working on several tactical plans to see...
we were under the impression they were being held against their will.
it's not our custom to have guests here at all, let alone hold anyone against their will.
i think the captain finds it hard to believe that we'd have any skills repairing a positronic device.
our technological abilities are not apparent because we have chosen not to employ them in our daily lives.
we believe that when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something away from the man.
but at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
his ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions.
but you're saying that he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
i was in an isolation suit gathering physiometric data on the ba'ku.
my last memory is going into the hills following some children.
data, if you were following the children and discovered this ship...
it is conceivable, i was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
we came here from a solar system on the verge of self-annihilation, where technology had created weapons that threatened to destroy all life.
a small group of us set off to find a new home, a home that would be isolated from the threats of other worlds.
to most off-landers, what you have here is more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.
i'm afraid that's the reason that someone may be trying to take your world away from you.
but some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of a small group of people to satisfy the demands of a large one.
i'd hoped that we had learned from our mistakes but it seems that some of us haven't.
captain, how could i look at another sunrise knowing what my sight cost these people?
i feel obliged to point out that the environmental anomalies may have stimulated certain rebellious instincts common to youth, which could affect everyone's judgment.
they won't begin the procedure while the planet is still inhabited, so our job is to keep the planet inhabited.
will, geordi, go back and put a face on what's happening here.
it will help prevent spaceships from beaming anyone off the surface.
these veins of kelbonite running through the hills will interfere with their transporters, and when the terrain forces us away from the deposits, then we'll use transport inhibitors as a compensation.
in the past 24 months, they've been challenged by every major power in the quadrant.
the borg, the cardassians, the dominion, they all smell the scent of death on the federation.
i will never know the experience of growing up or tripping over my own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time or bedtimes or having to eat food you don't like.
and have you noticed how your boobs have started to firm up?
not that we care about such things in this day and age.
captain, they're trying to drive us out so their drones can tag us.
with all the hydrothermal vents in the substrata, the structural integrity of this cavern is not going to hold for long.
a century ago, a group of our young people wanted to follow the ways of the offlanders.
they tried to take over the colony, and when they failed...
you've brought the federation into the middle of a blood feud, admiral.
the children have returned to expel their elders, just as they were once expelled, except that ru'afo's need for revenge has now escalated into parricide.
and here you are, closing those eyes, trying not to see what bitterness has done to the son'a, how it's turned ru'afo into a madman.
and you, turned you into a coward, a man who denies his own conscience.
sir, the federation ship is creating a disruption in our shield.
if they go out of phase, it'll increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction.
they must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
isolate one and re-route its command sequence through the auxiliary processor.
you think when we get away from this metaphasic radiation, it'll change the way we feel?
your feelings about her have not changed since the day i met you, commander.
this place just let them out for a little fresh air.
i wish there were a way to bring them back home.
i wish i could stay, but these are perilous times for the federation.
i can't abandon it to people who would threaten everything that i've spent a lifetime defending.

exposure could stimulate rebellious instincts common to youth which would affect everyone's judgement ... except mine.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time.
i'd accept that in exchange for knowing what childhood is like.
a court martial will let the people know what is happening here.

we're sending you all the intelligence we have, but it's not much.
i don't need to tell you to watch your back, jean-luc.
as you can see, one side of remus always faces the sun.
due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the remans live on the dark side of the planet.
almost nothing is known of the reman homeworld although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
the remans themselves are considered an undesirable caste in the hierarchy of the empire.

i'm talking of the thing that makes us the same-- peace.
and, commander... if you ever touch me again... i'll kill you.
the romulans had somehow gained possession of your dna and i had been created.
then i didn't see the sun or the stars again for nearly ten years.
the only thing the romulan guards hated more than the remans was me.
he protected me from the cruelty of the guards and taught me how to survive.
and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself i found my reman brothers.
if you had lived my life and experienced the suffering of my people you would be standing where l am.
and if you had lived my life, you would understand my responsibility to the federation.
nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship... in time... when that trust has been earned.
captain, we have had an unauthorized access into the main computer.
which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up, but he's got it, captain.
thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its biogenic properties.

if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would`ve rejected my humanity?
the b-4 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.
well, i can`t think of a better man for the job.
if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
i beg you not to let prejudice or politics interfere with this alliance.
by joining shinzon's forces with ours, not even the federation will be able to stand in our way.
as you know, the reman mines have not been filling their quotas for months now.
i hope you will all bear in mind the trade committee's findings.
but none of this compares with my solemn duty today... as best man.
now, i know on an occasion such as this, it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome in my praise on the wonders of this blessed union.
we're sending you all the intelligence we have, but it's not much.
i don't need to tell you to watch your back, jean-luc.
due to the extreme temperatures on that half of their world, the remans live on the dark side of the planet.
almost nothing is known of the reman homeworld although intelligence scans have proven the existence of dilithium mining and heavy weapons construction.
starfleet intelligence was only able to provide a partial account of his military record.
we can infer he is relatively young and a capable commander.
i still can't believe the captain went along with the memory download.
captain picard agrees that the b-4 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself.
if my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
yeah, but he would also have all of your memories as well.
remember, he's a prototype, a lot less sophisticated than you are.
we just don't know if his matrix will be able to adapt.
we came to romulus on a matter we were assured was of great importance.
if you have anything to say to us as representatives of the federation, i suggest you do it now.
in fact, i feel exactly what you feel... don't i, jean-luc?
come to dinner-- tomorrow on romulus, just the two of us.
the romulans had somehow gained possession of your dna and i had been created.
and when i was ready, they were going to replace you with me... put a romulan agent at the heart of starfleet.
and in that dark place where there was nothing of myself i found my reman brothers.
they showed me the only true kindness i have ever known.
and if you had lived my life, you would understand my responsibility to the federation.
i cannot allow my personal feelings to unduly influence my decisions.
what better example than a starfleet captain standing in the romulan senate.
nothing would make me more proud than to take your hand in friendship... in time... when that trust has been earned.
it's going to take some time to figure that out, captain.
the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
thalaron research was banned in the federation because of its biogenic properties.
it has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level.
if i had lived his life, is it possible that i would've rejected my humanity?
the b-4 is physically identical to me, although his neural pathways are not as advanced.
well, i can't think of a better man for the job.
if i may, just a word of advice about your first command?
report to the galley and tell the chef to skip the fish course.
i'd like our guests to depart as soon as etiquette allows.
la forge has modified this tricorder with one of data's actuation servos.
its range is only four metres, but it will shut him down.
i know what data means to starfleet, but our crew are in danger.
if our attempt to capture data fails, i will terminate him.
all right, you have 12 hours, then i want you out of the briar patch.
we'll head out to the perimeter to call for son'a reinforcements.
- "his nose should pant" - "and his lips should curl"
- "his cheeks should flame" - "and his brow should furl"
- "his bosom should heave" - "and his hea"rt "should glow"
and his fist be ever ready for a knockdown blow his nose should pant and his lips should curl his cheeks should flame and his brow should furl his bosom should heave "and his hea"rt "should glow"
his eyes should flash with an inborn fire his brow with scorn be wrung he never should bow down to a domineering frown or the tang of a tyrant tongue
- "his hea"rt "should stamp" - "and his throat should growl"
and this should be his customary attitude his foot should stamp and his voice should drop his hair should curl and his face ...
if we do not release him, he may destroy both vessels.
creating a machine to do man's work takes something away from man.
at one time, we explored the galaxy, just as you do.
i won't need any more genetic manipulation if our federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.
tricorder functions are limited due to kelbonite deposits in the area.
if you were following the children and discovered this ship ...
i may have been shot to protect the secret of its existence.
if it wasn't for data, it's probable that you would be relocated by now.
the moment we pick up a weapon we become one of them.
but some of the darkest chapters in the history of my world involve the forced relocation of one people to satisfy another.
i had hoped that we had learned from our mistakes, but it seems that some of us haven't.
i will never experience growing up or tripping over my own feet.
but you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time.
at that time, my grandpa's restaurant made a lot of money for the family
but my own shop in taiwan does not have the same fortune
he also came from guilin and he is now teaching in taipei
he is quite well-off and he is a really nice man
i just took this photo of him with miss luo which was taken in guilin
in the future, i will show this photo to my customers
i guess if they can put a man on the moon,
they can fix a few silly little bumps on my leg,
bringing up my dad's new wife drains me of my christmas spirit.
all i'm saying is, don't you think it's time you went home?
if you were 1 8, where would you rather be for christmas?
at home with your family or in cabo on the beach with a beautiful girl?
if you say anything nasty about jake, i'll have to slug you.
if you try to feel me up, i'll have to slug you.
if you make me listen to any sexist, racist or homophobic jokes, i'm gonna have to slug you.
and finally, i might have to slug you from time to time simply because i find the prospect of this incredibly stressful.
the whole family chipped in and got him a triple bypass for christmas.
i sent home every last dollar i earned as a shopping mall santa.
daddy always said, it's better to go out in a blaze of glory than to rot in a state correctional facility.
you're about to tell me the stuff in the back is stolen?
a kitchenaid classic plus toaster with exclusive acutoast sensor for consistent toasting time after time.
sweetie, this toaster is extra wide so you can get four bagels in there instead of the usual two.
grandmothers and grandfathers, and my dog, and have a christmas tree, and lights, and angels, and christmas cookies.
with little red and green sprinkles on top, and plum pudding, and christmas carols...
well, the first one's good for really little kids, like my sister, who's three.
the second one's good for big kids like my friends and me.
sorry, santa, i'm not allowed to give out information on guests.
listen, i have a full plate of activities tonight, not to mention a pesky grinch who was kidnapped mrs claus.
i agreed to let you go off to school in california.
but you haven't been home for the holidays since mom died.
the same one we rebuilt by hand together with the kid-glove interiors and the original paint?
i tell you what, if you're home when we sit down to dinner, 6:00, christmas eve, the car's yours.
1 academy kids are driving back east this winter and i get a ride with you.
just the two of us, riding the crest of destiny's rainbow.
if you say to me things like that, i'll have to slug you.
if you say anything nasty about jake, i'll have to slug you.
if you try to feel me up, i'll have to slug you.
if you make me listen to any sexist, racist or homophobic jokes, i'm gonna have to slug you.
that's all great stuff but santa will give you something better.
a kitchenaid classic plus toaster with exclusive acutoast sensor for consistent toasting time after time.
if i get marjorie to come home, you buy me a bus ticket to new york.
if you can get marjorie to come home for christmas, i'll buy you a bus ticket to the moon.
~ l'm sorry i was just an insensitive jerk that night
~ l hope that singing this song will make everything all right
then he asks for money and you want to walk away.
then you think to yourself, what if he is the messiah and i'm just blowing the dude off?
the second one's good for big kids like my friends and me.
the third one's good if you want to scare people and watch them run away screaming.

i've got four years of birthday money upstairs in my ballerina bag.
if i went to a ticket agent now and bought you a ticket home, you'd make it in time for christmas?
bringing up my dad's new wife drains me of my christmas spirit.

and there on his stoop stood the beautiful princess from the valley below.
and the wind whipped about her hair and the snow swirled about her.
- oh, no, sir, i'm sure she doesn't mean anything like that.
it's just that your remark has the air of cultural stereotyping.
i mean, did you show her your disgusting tattoo or how far you can spit or...
you know, that charming thing where you kick holes through the ceiling tiles?
- randy said this was as close as he could come.
mind you, your eyewitness hasn't slept in six months, so he wasn't sharp.
- and i suppose that cassette tape you found in the living room
of her reading sword of desire, uh, she used that to fool mrs. tucci into thinking that she was sitting in a comfy chair, reading to her from across the room.
- thereby providing her with an alibi so she could slip out to the park and shoot mr. tucci.
but as i say, ray, this is just the purest of speculation.
- and it all goes to a guy nobody's seen for 20 years, a guy who could be, uh, dead for all anybody knows.
the courts will direct at least half of it to us... to mrs. tucci... for upkeep of the house and everything.
i didn't pay any taxes or anything, but i don't have any education or training, so i couldn't say no.
- you didn't think to ask him where he got it?
are you suggesting that she left the book sitting around here in some sort of subconscious desire to be caught?
- well, it sounds dumb, but you got a better idea?
- i'm sorry, i noticed your box hadn't been emptied in about a month.
to your credit, it seems to have been stuffed largely with fast-food menus, so i don't think any vital police work has suffered.
- yeah, beefs, loins, chops, rib eye, it really doesn't matter.
the point is, they sealed the records and they think he also goes by the name sammy frank.
- all right, a few years back, i was at the one-nine, right?
couple of marshals from tucson, wearing big cowboy hats, fly in to take one of our collars, nervous nellie martin, who's up on a murder-one chop.
so the victim is sammy franks, an up-and-coming mob guy, attracting heat at the time.
but nellie beats the rap 'cause they can't find enough pieces of frank's body to identify him...
if we want to know the lyrics to oklahoma, you better know them.
'cause if you don't, we're going to kick you out of here and broadcast your movements on the all-news traffic reports.
mr. tucci feared that when he died, there would be no one to provide for his beloved wife.
so he hired this man fahey to help him find his long-lost son.
- he didn't know the old man probably would die in a few months.
- and he didn't know the real franco had a price on his head.
i mean, if i trusted her, i would be sitting with her tonight, instead of sitting out here in the wilderness.
- we aren't actually in the wilderness, ray... we're in a park in the middle of downtown chicago.
and for a brief second, lo-o-o-u-u-u scagnetti could hear his own inner bell ring as though it were rung by a thousand angels.
and he took his hand and he placed it over his heart.
and l-o-o-o-u-u-u scagnetti vowed that never again would he kill and eat another princess as long as he lived.
unless, of course, she were covered in chokecherries and brown lichen with a sprinkling of dust...
for the first time in his life, he didn't know what to do.
he didn't know whether to kill her and eat her, or whether to bake her some of those tarts he was so fond of, the ones that featured chokecherries with brown lichen and little bits of dust...
- oh, no, sir, i'm sure she doesn't mean anything like that.
it's just that your remark has the air of cultural stereotyping.
i mean, did you show her your disgusting tattoo or how far you can spit or...
you know, that charming thing where you kick holes through the ceiling tiles?

i didn't pay any taxes or anything, but i don't have any education or training, so i couldn't say no.
- you didn't think to ask him where he got it?
she's after the old man's money, just like in the book.
are you suggesting that she left the book sitting around here in some sort of subconscious desire to be caught?
to your credit, it seems to have been stuffed largely with fast-food menus, so i don't think any vital police work has suffered.
there is also a fax that came in from the national crime database.
he would murder mr. tucci, then impersonate the son and lay claim to the money and the property that mr. tucci had told him awaited franco jr.
- he didn't know the old man probably would die in a few months.
- and he didn't know the real franco had a price on his head.
the axiom would seem to hold that proper preparation prevents poor performance.
i mean, if i trusted her, i would be sitting with her tonight, instead of sitting out here in the wilderness.
- we aren't actually in the wilderness, ray... we're in a park in the middle of downtown chicago.
and he took his hand and he placed it over his heart.

and it was france that gave you your frontiers it was we who taught you peace
and it was we who created your civilization and your constitution and it was we who created your civilization and your constitution
let it be understood that education, french education specifically is your sole way out of your primitive habits...
so open your books... we are going to do a composition...
i think the israelis retaliated against the palestinians, after what happened in tel aviv we've got nothing to do with it
how can we have nothing to do with it, when it is happening on our soil?
your heart is beating she looks at you and she asks you... can i sit next to you?
layla, sits close to you... she holds your hand... and caresses your skinny legs... and then...
hala, knock on wood... the country is solid like rock, and i'm going to prove it to you
this is the first pick from the farm the farmers told me the first crop will hit the market a month ahead of its time you can not ask for more
the same thing happened to my mother her after my father died
she had a nervous breakdown, we took her to the hospital... and when she came home she stopped giving piano lessons
sir, lighten up, leave him to me, because i swear i'm going to teach him a few things after school!
i'll teach you a lesson, i swear we'll never step into the olive tree district...
fool... taxis only get to the border... then she'll have to cross on foot under sniper fire!
you idiot... you know what happens if anyone gets hold of that film?
tarek, tarek, listen to me, please please... hear me a bit
tarek, listen to me, there is something i want to tell you, it's important
thee alone do we worship and unto thee alone we turn for aid
thee alone do we worship and unto thee alone we turn for aid
may, damn you omar, how many times do i have to tell you not to call her virgin mary?
what am i supposed to tell her family, your daughter's dead?
i think i have a solution to the middle east problem
i say we make gemayel and arafat meet right here, in the olive tree district
stop this nonsense, enough of this we're staying here just like everyone else... things aren't that bad, you'll see
when i was your age, we went through war after war my parents never thought of leaving
if this is the protector of the neighborhood, and this is the son of the neighborhood
i'll be damned if i sell you one grain of wheat
i am power unlike any you have known absolute, infinite and unrelenting.
you have no choice but to prepare for a long, dark future as my subjects and my slaves.
i've observed your boldness and ferocity for some time not without undue pride.
though you're misguided in your loyalty i won't quibble over this insignificant speck in the universe.
he used to tune my piano we got on quite splendidly
and he said... he wanted his grand daughter to study with me
i looked out from the window and saw him come back from roller-skating
he picked up a bottle of mineral water and doused himself
those ruins have to this day scared... exactly 100 people to madness
but no wonder because invaluable treasures... are known to be buried inside
my boy has been crying all night and i didn't sleep a wink
this really isn't a good time for me... to read stupid stories
it looks like all these years she was waiting for someone
when i started making music myself she was already quite old
how gentle is the rain that falls softly on the meadow birds high up on the trees serenade the clouds with their melody
oh, see there beyond the hills the bright colors ofthe rainbow
some magic from above made this day for us just to fall in love
you hold me in your arms and say once again you love me and ifyour love is true everything will be just as wonderful
now, i belong to you from this day until forever just love me tenderly and i'll give to you every part of me
oh, don't ever make me cry through long lonely night without love?
be always true to me keep this day in your heart eternally
you hold me in your arms and say once again you love me and ifyour love is true everything will be just as wonderful
but there have been some very strange stories told of this night.
i had a few days' leave coming and babylon 5 is easier to visit than brakir so i came to learn.
now, with all the trauma that we have endured lately it gives me enormous pleasure to confer upon them the freedom of babylon 5.
i have written a speech, which i will recite in english and which zooty has translated by himself with his machine into his own universal language.
in this case, i can understand that an exception might need to be made.
just my own personal curiosity it's the day of the dead, but it takes place at night?
you see, minbari humor is based not on physical danger or embarrassment or rejection, like human humor but rather on the failure to obtain emotional or spiritual enlightenment.
you see, ailecococ means both a small fish and the pleasure you get meeting someone for the first time.
the other side of that corridor is over 200 million light-years away.
and the air is spread a little thinly in the middle.
i am anla'shok and shall remain so until i pass beyond.
i could no more betray the anla'shok than my fingers could betray my hand.
mr. garibaldi, i need to be put through to c c.
you'll need to route the call via proxima using a tachyon relay.
but not one of them will ever know you the way i know you.
now, if this works i'll be able to convince the local information stream that it's actually originating on minbar streaming into proxima and from there...
they do one idiotic thing after another but people listen because they say it seriously.
i don't know whether we're leaving comedy to go into clown school but all i do know is that comedians don't matter.
well, the high-iq boys back home think it might have been a device smuggled onto the station that somehow activates the parts of the brain responsible for memory.
and zack is checking the air ducts to see if it was a gas used to create a similar effect.
but frankly, sir, as long as no one got hurt and the effect seems temporary i don't have a problem with that.
i think we need a little mystery once in a while.

i wonder what i would have seen if i had slept in my own quarters last night.
so, i understand you had a full dance card this weekend.
i met a lovely young artist at the gallery opening on saturday.
i wouldn't stay in a relationship if there was no future in it.
so if you had nothing in common beyond the physical, you'd break it off?
and then you'll get caught naked with her in the back seat of your squad car.
but, anyway, the point is the longer you put this off, the harder it'll be to end it.
there i was wearing nothing but a smile when the sun started to shift.
so i moved behind the water tower, and who was lying there but derrick, the good-looking fireman from across the hall who was also getting an all-over tan, i might add.
i wanted to ask you, where do you see this going?
right now i'm heading to your earlobe but if you care to reroute me, i'm open to suggestions.
is that what's been on your mind because you've been tense.
i even got some hot oil to give you a massage.
he shoots a client in the knee, he then shoots a homeless man with a paintball gun.
could you kindly point in any direction other than my head.
well, i think that you are a silverspoon-fed, rich, empty sack who has nothing to do now but count his money, or spend it on hookers and therapists who offer up some form of affirmation, and frankly, i'm sick of it!
i would no longer even treat you, but for the 600 dollars an hour i charge, which sum,
i would sooner leap from the window than see your lips move, the sight of which is the visual cue that feculent blather is about to spew forth.
this is no way for a therapist to talk to a patient.
it even caused me to buy a handgun to end it.
i even carry it around with me, never knowing when i might decide to join the ranks of the unliving.
you see, something actual, as opposed to the manufactured heroics of your publicist, the mad cow, and then it suddenly might matter, really matter that you were born.
and how would you handle that after seventy plus years of unmitigated insignificance?
"how do i get a man?", "how do i look?", "how do i please a man in bed?"
and i discover that they're willing to measure the substance of a relationship with a kiss.
it was simply a shoulder wound, which was where my client was hoping the bullet would land, once the gun accidentally went off, when the victim threatened to shoot my client, putting him in reasonable fear for his life.
you honor, if he wants a probable cause hearing, let him call the arresting officer.
dr. fields, denny informed me that your intense desire to die played a significant part in what happened.
you know, often when people contemplate dying, they take measure of their legacy.
i shall count on you to be honest in that witness chair tomorrow, sir.
well now, i wouldn't count on anything if i were you.
he said he found the houses on this street quite beautiful, and he enjoyed looking at them.
and is that lawful in this neighborhood, to look at houses that you find beautiful?
if you mean with denny, i've got a probable cause hearing scheduled.
i'm trying to make this go away, though i can't possibly see how.
and if i would have been doing anything suspect, i would have given it to him.
if it would have been a random thing, i would have complied.
one of the reasons i wanted you on this case, among other reasons,
i think you have a capacity to tap into what is fundamentally decent about people.
so you really didn't feel threatened when he produced the firearm this time?
i felt threatened to the extent that this time, it might just go off.
i was sick of his antics and i told him so.
and, in fact, you called him an empty sack, you told him he led a meaningless life, provoked him to pull his gun, didn't you?
and in fact, you gave him to the count of three, didn't you?
shoot you by the count of three or you'd kill him?
listening to other people who had lives far more grander than mine, while i just sat tucked away in my office leading no life at all.
vicariously coaching other people, watching them get rich, like this nutcase here, and i couldn't stand it anymore.
i did crack, i wasn't gonna just stand around being some sort of impotent little spectator to my own life.
and i'm sick of any society that, that glamorizes the eccentrics and the psychopaths and the belligerants, when there's the meek and the wise.
and he wasn't targeted simply because he was black by the way.
he was questioned because he was a stranger to a particular neighborhood.
"hey, that person might be more likely to be engaging in certain criminal activity".
now here, the defendant was a stranger to this neighborhood, he was oddly staring at houses.
your honor, i saved this man's life, probably yours, and he's in here waving around his poopycock with his mumbo jumbo, jibber jabber.
at a minimum, the charges of carrying a concealed weapon should be considered.
but here, you did use the gun to save lives, quite possibly my own.
i'm going to let you off this time with just a stern warning.
in the matter of the commonwealth versus dennis prior, on the charge of disorderly conduct, we find the defendant not guilty.
on the charge of unlawfully resisting arrest, we find the defendant not guilty.
only until you finish the work, and then it's the kitchen again.
so if i don't finish the work, then i'll always have a workspace.
if it's not fixed by tomorrow, i'm coming down there, and i'm gonna kick every one of your flabby asses up to and including mayor giuliani.
and if you got a problem with that, come and get me.
but the fact that you left work there for me means you already think of it as my workspace.
only until you finish the work, and then it's the kitchen again.
so if i don't finish the work, then i'll always have a workspace.
if you don't finish the work, you won't work here anymore.
if i ever invite you to do anything with me again, shoot me.
linda, do you remember that discussion we had yesterday about you leaving your dog at home?
see, yesterday when you said i could bring in one personal item and did not rule out dogs, i fired my dog walker.
now the soonest i can get him back is next week.
mr. williams, i haven't slept in two days, so forgive me if i'm not my usual cheery self.
but how the hell'd you think i was gonna examine your prostate?
um, ah, it's just that you've never called me like this on this day, i mean.
well, when you get to where i am in life regrets start to eat you up.
i have visited my mother's grave every year on the anniversary of her death but my father would never talk about it.
why is it people wait until the end of their lives before... they...face regrets?
um, ah, it's just that you've never called me like this on this day, i mean.

[inhales] why is it people wait until the end of their lives before... they... face regrets?
we all agree he's ready for this climb, both mentally and physically.
[conti] i wanna believe... that hiking and mountain climbing are gonna help... but ever since chris's car accident last year... we've tried therapists, retreats, vacations, everything.
well, when you get to where i am in life, regrets start to eat you up.
listen, there are a lot of things i've been... meaning to say to you and to her... for a long time.
moments after she died, your father told me never to speak about it- not to you, jarod, anyone.
he ordered me back to work as if nothing had happened.
i left him a voice mail after i called you two.
his orders are to find me in the sim lab... if he hasn't heard from me within the hour.
well, when you get to where i am in life regrets start to eat you up.
there are lots of things that i've been meaning to say to you and to her for a long time.
- and if i open it, a warning's going to be sent...
- then whoever is behind this will know that we're here.
i had one of those... parental wakeup calls at breakfast, you know, time sure flies.
my little debbie tells me she knows what she wants to do in life.
if we lie low, we should be all right till then.
that's a long time to play hide and seek with a kromagg.
or it could be a camp where they train the maggs to hunt humans.
kind of like that pleasant resort we stumbled across a couple of worlds back.
they took the weapons off unit four, accessed the computer, and then with their primitive sliding device escaped to another dimension.
we received a dynasty directive about these humans earlier this year.
we were ordered not to detain them, but now things have changed.
they are now considered to be extremely dangerous, and are to be taken down by whatever means necessary.
no kromagg is permitted to return to that world under pain of death.
i know that, sir, but, under the circumstances, i thought we might find a solution to the bigger problem, as well.
but you were not forced to keep it, to bring it here.
when you were able to escape, why didn't you do it alone?
if only you could see him the way that i do.
listen, i'm going to go rustle us up some soup, okay?
well, i went shopping, and i came out and i got in the car and i bumped into him.
he couldn't really decide about me, which is typical of men.
love, i don't think we're going to forget to take her home, eh?
right, to end... just for fun, i thought we'd have a quiz.
and in the third quarter the gross profit margin rose to 24%... on an annual turnover of £7,500,000.
the sale of the warehousing division netted £1 36,000... leading to an overall debt on the current account of £250,000.
do you want to go round to a friend of rachel's?
david's a bit of a prat but karen's nice, and she can tell jen about babies.
we're doing all we can to hothouse our young talents, mrs marsden.
we also depend on parents playing their part, by instilling fundamental values, such as punctuality, for example.
and then this life comes out, and there it is, and that's there.
and that was inside her, and she did all that herself...

it's a world locked in cold at the height of the last great ice age.

humpbacks fast for eight months in the relatively sparse waters of the tropics where they breed and give birth.
for survival, they depend almost entirely upon the krill and small fish that concentrate here in summer.
to capture the immense quantities of food they need some humpbacks have devised an extraordinary technique of cooperative feeding.
diving in unison they surround a school of herring while one or more sings a ritual feeding song.
simultaneously, a whale blows a circular net of bubbles around the fish.

i know this won't make me popular, but the supervisor's coming tomorrow, and i don't want to see any wanking in the office.

last week you took the coffee machine away, now we've got to go to the kitchen for a cup of coffee.
- l have said. i find it really... (boss) lf you did a poll in the building, i think you'd find... i find it really embarrassing.
sometimes i just look up and i just see james wanking away, and i just think it's disgusting.
so i've got to get in touch with alexander's, say, "can you fax your figures through again?"
because i can't see the total assets for december, because of james's semen.
the first mexican to take the gold at last year's olympics, which really put mexico on the staring map.
and he seems very much in control of this match against the latvian, ludek mintz.
(david) of course, there are no stare breaks allowed in the professional game.
the stare break very much a safety aspect of the amateur game, as is staring indoors.
you may remember the controversy last year when three amateur starers went blind whilst staring outdoors on a sunny day.
(john) yes, i always say to the young kids out there, david, please do enjoy your staring, but it's important to be aware of the risks involved.
no, no, well, the actual train wouldn't be quite as fast as that.
i think london to edinburgh is about three and a half hours.
that's what makes this college as great an institution as it is today.
so now all that remains is for me to hand over the cheque for ?
i've been going to dating agencies for about a year now, and i think the problem, really, is with my choice of person.
i'm not having any luck with my usual choice, which is beautiful, tall, intelligent women.
i think what i have to do, really, is go for the complete, absolute opposite.
maybe then i'll have more luck in finding my perfect partner, whatever.
(woman) my dear brother, what is one to say in a situation like this?
you are to be executed tomorrow and i shall never see you again.
the purpose behind this bloodshed, however, goes beyond simple explanations of religion, or notions of justice.
the truth is buried deep within those who wage the wars.
you're looking at the unknown life form, that was caught by the fishing boat in the inga island two weeks ago.
the locals believe it to be a dinosaur, became quite excited.
it was stolen before our inspection team was able to secure it.
despite that setback, our team's able to collect cells from the fishing net, and begin to test them in the laboratory.
the gene combination described in the report could not exist in nature.
an unexpected alian invation last month, those cells must have been man made.

may be, we guys just have a weakness for pretty women.
if you have to be there, please, just don't get in my way.
i'm the one, who made mishima conglomerate powerful that it's today!
that little vernal of trouble needs to be eliminated before it grows, and dad changes his mind.
as long as my brother is alive, then i'm the adopted son with second grade class.
you see, you and i have a lot more in common than you originally thought.
this is the island where the the event will take place.
it's supposed to be the the resort island for the officers of the mishima conglomerate.
just one room is destroyed, and so far no one reported any casualties.
according to the hotel manager, the room was vacant last night.
it looks like you're not the only woman who thinks she can live through this.
she looks like a little skinny-dippy, a world champion fighter, doesn't she?
your hatred for your father is been consuming you, since that day.
i fill nothing, but a cold spirit in of you, just like a devil.
i found an entrance to the underground plant between the central tower and the west side of the beach.
i'm going to head west, as soon as the events start.
now it's time to determine, which entrance in the field are the strongest.
each one of you will go to a different point in the jungle,and will begin trial in there.
you will proceed to meet and defeat your opponent, in the battlefield along the way.
you'll fight your way across the main field, until you reach the island central tower.
if you do the darkness in your heart, it's something you'll never escape.
believe me, if you stand in my way, you'll die right here.
this is a strange place to walk in to, isn't it?
these must be the biological weapons, that 3wc had been talking about.
that's funny to here that come from you for all people.
i was forgot, i want to tell you something, before i finished you off.
when i met with this group, it released a conscience, that conscience became my highest priority.
i chose to escape the military, and searched for the kidnapped professor.
jack2's a1 board has a circuit, dedicated simulated feeling for right and wrong.
the jack series is originally created to suppress uprisings in the rebellious outer territories.
however, i could not bring myself to create a indiscriminate killing machine.
therefore, i designed a program that would activate a conscience like response, in situations, that would be considered imotionally hard.
you don't value your ken-edet training, and you'll never defeat me.
your body is wrecked with injury, and you could barely remain standing.
why would is someone as powerful as you throw your own son into the canyon?
and now, why are you now, flooding the world with weapon and planning it's destruction?
through the ages, those who have blindly believed in those absolute truths, have fought and died over empty platitude.
today, you'll find people mistaking, for your own greed and truth, and eating the planet for them, and condemning thenselves into total annihilation!
you threw your son into the canyon, specifically to place dark hatred in his heart.
you've grown a perfect successor for your plans of carnage and genocide.
if we continue to seek our revenge and kill each other, we will certainly kill ourselves as well.
and allowing bad feelings, like greed and hatred, to grow and fester inside us, just breeds more of the same.
my mom gives me **** sometimes, and i tell her to shut her hole before i-
pookums, it's time for mommy to tuck you in for night-night.
mr.hat is gone, and he isn't coming back, and i don't wanna hear it!
anyway children, let's turn our history text books to page 105.
i still gotta shingle the roof, test the foundation, run all kind of extentions,
i got way to much to do, and all you have to do is go find chics.
you can't just leave family, you have to stick with family no matter what.
but you and mom are family, how you can just split up?
my mom always gives me shit for smoking, but it's my body,
i should be able to do whatever i want with it.
stanley, you know you're the most important thing to me right?
if that's true, then get back together with dad for me!
maybe later you can suck my nigga dick bitch hoe shit.
well fat abbot and the gang sure did learn something today.

the year between wars and the beginning of a new age.
the shadow war was over, but there was still a darkness waiting for us at home.
president santiago had been assassinated, and his successor president clark... was turning earth into a prison camp.
we'd broken away from earth, and in retaliation, they quarantined us... trying to strangle our supply lines.
we were desperate... and we couldn't afford to lose even a single supply ship.
in the midst of all of this, we made contact with thirdspace... and we almost didn't survive it.
we haven't spoken to each other in two decades, not that it's a bad thing.
he denied the whole thing, so it made me look like a fool... so sheila left me, the whole family sided with him.
we'll determine what it is... and see if it's safe to call in a rescue operation.
we'll form a relay from the homing beacon to avoid getting lost.
hold here so we can link to your signal... and extend toward the target like a string of pearls.
don't stray or you'll lose contact and get lost in the gravitational eddies.
what it is and what it does, your guess is as good as mine.
in that case, can they take part in examining the artifact?
but if everyone starts pulling at it at once, nothing will get done.
delenn and i discussed this earlier, and we both agreed... that anything we find will be shared with everyone... in the league of non-aligned worlds.
john, whenever something comes into our proximity... that has to do with the unknown, your eyes light up like two tiny suns.
and you know what words these two tiny lights spell out?
place could be rigged with booby traps, bombs, other defense systems, anything.
until we know what this is and where it came from... we have to definitely consider it a potential threat to station security.
you were able to fire grapples from a safe distance... the bot and its power source were within just a few feet.
i'll let you know when we finish the rest of our test.
the power drain seems to be short-range, so if we're lucky... it won't constitute a hazard to navigation.
we'll have to make sure to keep a distance or come up with some kind of shielding.
no ship from earth is allowed to dock at babylon 5.
we're aware of the embargo, but ipx is a special case.
if you're going to work here, you may as well bring lunch.
i'm just trying to make sure you bring enough for everybody.
they finished going over the sample we took from the alien artifact.
the carbon dating indicates that whatever that thing is... it's over a million years old.
they sweep across the forest in a 5-inch carpet, millions of them.
they're no more than an inch long, but they can devastate a forest... in less than an hour.
i wonder if they know they've got cousins this far out in space.
you think anybody would notice if i just killed a few of them?
according to our records... two years before the war between the vorlons and shadows heated up...
lyta was on mars, on the run from the psi corps.
while there, she arranged to meet a starship captain, david slayner.
according to information we received from slayner... she told him she felt drawn to the vorlon homeworld... the result of a previous encounter with the vorlon ambassador, kosh.
she was 10 days away from the nearest jumpgate... with only three days of air, food, and water.
there is no way she could have survived if the vorlons hadn't come for her.
captain, in the past the vorlons have done everything in their power... to keep humans from getting their hands on advanced technology.
if she is under their influence, she may have tried... to destroy the artifact to keep us from figuring out what it is.
we have to probe further, and we have to do it soon... before anyone else starts poking around.
if i'm right, what we're looking at here... could make jumpgates look like nothing in comparison.
it's not like you can push a button on it... and a manual pops out and tells you what it is and how it works.
i could study that thing for five years, let alone five days... and still not crack it.
those of us who hear the call... we belong to them.
the others, who do not hear the call... will not survive it.
a couple of minutes less, it might have been worth it.
imagine the nerve of this guy blaming us for his problems enforcing discipline.
well, in all fairness, things have been getting strange since we got here.
just this morning, while i was having breakfast... there were all these people who...
for 200 years, after we first went into space... ships from earth would take months to travel from one planet to another.
and travel between the stars, hundreds of light years apart... just was impossible.
they found them when they got out to space, took them apart... and put them back together again.
no one even knows who built the first gates... but what does any of that have to do with the artifact?
maybe it was an experiment that got away from them, i don't know.
but i do know that it doesn't open into normal space or hyperspace.
whoever has thirdspace capability... can come in wherever, whenever they want... make the hit and get out before anybody could react.
it is the ultimate form of commerce, it is the ultimate weapon... it's a twofer, bill, and it's just sitting right there... waiting for us to figure it out.
the only thing we can do is get in there, crack this thing... and get out before they do.
and the only way to do that is to turn it on.
maybe she knows what this thing is and what it does.
i have the nasty feeling that this is only a warm-up.
we believed we could transcend this dimension... that we belonged to another higher plane.
and in the end, in terms you can understand... we resolved to storm the gates of heaven itself.
we applied all our wisdom, all our knowledge... to opening a door to another dimension... a place we believed was the well of souls... the foundation for all life.
we would touch the face of god... and in so doing, become gods ourselves.
they believe only they have the right to exist in the universe... that all other life forms are inferior, and must be exterminated.
in their own universe, they have destroyed thousands of races... and continue to destroy thousands more.
this is the first wave to soften us up for the main fleet.
if we can't take these guys, we can't take the rest.
and if a little lie got her out the door, that was fine with her.
fine with both of us, really... because, as mr. garibaldi has been known to say from time to time:
we said that the device was a weapon, a mousetrap, which was true.
we told them that it used a telepathic trigger... and caused an outbreak of fighting.

i only hope we never come across it again... because next time, no one's going to survive it.
have a nice lie-down, a cup of tea, you'll feel better.
i want to thank you for your time... you are a lovely young woman, and if i was 30 years younger... and you were a little blind in one eye... what a wonderful life we could have together.
we'll determine what it is... and see if it's safe to call in a rescue operation.

but that'll make it nearly impossible to do a proper analysis.
in case you hadn't heard, we're on president clark's quarantined list.
no ship from earth is allowed to dock at babylon 5.
we have agreements with over half a dozen alien governments... allowing us movement across borders without restrictions.
we can explore any world... provided we guarantee access to whatever we find.
and you want us to break the blockade and bring you whatever supplies you need.
if you're going to work here, you may as well bring lunch.
you know, back home on earth... along the amazon in south america, they've got these army ants.
they sweep across the forest in a 5-inch carpet, millions of them.
they're no more than an inch long, but they can devastate a forest... in less than an hour.
i wonder if they know they've got cousins this far out in space.
which means it may have needed a trigger event... for your subconscious to get things moving.
can you think of any reason why you would want to destroy the artifact?
lyta was on mars, on the run from the psi corps.

according to information we received from slayner... she told him she felt drawn to the vorlon homeworld... the result of a previous encounter with the vorlon ambassador, kosh.
until this time, anyone who entered vorlon space never came back.
after several days, when the vorlons didn't show... the captain decided to head back.
at that point, lyta commandeered a life pod... and ejected into vorlon space.
there is no way she could have survived if the vorlons hadn't come for her.
our records also indicate that while she was there... the vorlons altered her, increased her ability.
i think i have an idea of what it may be designed for... but as long as it's sitting dead in space, i can't be sure.
we have to probe further, and we have to do it soon... before anyone else starts poking around.
same in the zocalo, green sector, the casino... we've given the worst cases to medlab to see what they can do.
the rest we've got in lockup, but we're gonna run out of room soon... unless this stops.

i hope you understand that this is a bit awkward for me... but with londo back home, things kind of fall onto me.
with financial matters, the league expects the centauri... to speak on their behalf.
delenn and i discussed this earlier, and we both agreed... that anything we find will be shared with everyone... in the league of non-aligned worlds.
that's all well and good, because you trust her and she trusts you... and i trust both of you.
you know as well as i do... they'll be grabbing stuff as soon as they get there.
and if it looks like someone is going to get a new weapon... before they can, they'll sabotage it.
when have you ever known me to have a personal agenda?
john, whenever something comes into our proximity... that has to do with the unknown, your eyes light up like two tiny suns.

look, with all due respect, this is not your area of expertise.
it's not like you can push a button on it... and a manual pops out and tells you what it is and how it works.
imagine the nerve of this guy blaming us for his problems enforcing discipline.
well, in all fairness, things have been getting strange since we got here.
no one even knows who built the first gates... but what does any of that have to do with the artifact?
i think this is an original gate... left behind by whatever ancient race first came up with them.
but i do know that it doesn't open into normal space or hyperspace.
i think it leads to a totally different kind of space.
now, if i'm right, travel in thirdspace... is even faster than hyperspace.
where it took days or weeks to travel from one star to another... in thirdspace, travel would be almost instantaneous.
no more hyperspace probes giving you a two-day notice... of approaching battle groups.
whoever has thirdspace capability... can come in wherever, whenever they want... make the hit and get out before anybody could react.
it is the ultimate form of commerce, it is the ultimate weapon... it's a twofer, bill, and it's just sitting right there... waiting for us to figure it out.
and once we do figure it out... all we have to do is figure out where to put our nobel prizes.
what does matter is that somebody's gonna figure out... what we've got here, and they'll try and take it away from us.
the only thing we can do is get in there, crack this thing... and get out before they do.
i have the nasty feeling that this is only a warm-up.
it's shut us down, it's immobilized us, and now it's powering itself back up.
we believed that we were superior to the universe that gave us birth.
we believed we could transcend this dimension... that we belonged to another higher plane.
and in the end, in terms you can understand... we resolved to storm the gates of heaven itself.
we applied all our wisdom, all our knowledge... to opening a door to another dimension... a place we believed was the well of souls... the foundation for all life.
they modified the gate... so that it enhances their telepathic impulses... created an army of our own people willing to die for them.
we fought them back, disabled the device... but those of us controlled by their influence... dropped it into hyperspace before we could stop them.
he saw your starfuries coming after the artifact... and was going to interfere.
i think the device took control of him somehow... and i stopped him.
we estimate two hours until the energy drain leaves us dead in space.
prepare all fighters for launch and call in all the white stars in the area.
...it looks like i used up my last navigation pack... getting out of the artifact.
can you swing by and pick me up on your way in?
after everything that's happened i have to decide if i want this job anymore.
i didn't like the part of me that thing brought out.
when the dust settled and people wanted explanations... we gave them one.
we said that the device was a weapon, a mousetrap, which was true.
but, i've got me a little problem, ol' buddy... ( intercom buzzes ) yeah, jeremy?
bev, see if you can get harry and his drill over here.
in town, i think it's called the "paradise cafe"... is it any good?
after graduate school in seattle, and a few lost years contemplating the meaning of art, in a world that was consumed by commercialism...
i came to the realization that actually creating my pottery was more important than thinking about it.
and so, here i am back in paradise, bank teller by day, artist by night.
i keep imagining you in this canoe, with this handsome, mysterious stranger.
rushing down a raging river, waterfalls... boulders, white water...and he's the only one with a life preserver on.
look, my cousin louis and his wife are going to be in town friday.
i figured wouldn't it be cool, you and me have dinner with them?
bev, see if you can get harry and his drill over here.
dr. caine has lost the key to his safety deposit box.

did i mention the former miss maryland was attending parties without me in the afternoons thrown by younger male members of the foreign diplomatic corp.
yet, still he remains... until love returns the soft whisper of his voice.
granted, it's plain and simple, but the folks around here seem to like it just fine.
so, i'd be obliged, city boy, if you'd keep your opinions to yourself and your fingers out of my patients' mouths.
you see, a trip to the dentist should be pleasant, something to look forward to.
that is, of course, if the dentist in question is competent.
i know, i just can't get this image out of my head.
i keep imagining you in this canoe, with this handsome, mysterious stranger.
listen, i'm standing outside the office on the grounds here, and i've been thinking about you all day.
and i was hoping you'd do me the honor of joining me for dinner at the most exclusive restaurant in town.
the answer is, "out of date." this is an out of date magazine.
how many times did i tell you to get rid of all of these?
bev, see if you can get harry and his drill over here.
dr. caine has lost the key to his safety deposit box.
after graduate school in seattle, and a few lost years contemplating the meaning of art, in a world that was consumed by commercialism...
i came to the realization that actually creating my pottery was more important than thinking about it.
did i mention the former miss maryland was attending parties without me in the afternoons thrown by younger male members of the foreign diplomatic corp.
yet, still he remains... until love returns the soft whisper of his voice.

socrates roamed the streets... because at least he could say he was his own man.
when he left prison, he ran as though he had escaped.
he went farther away... so they couldn't recognize him as a bottles and cans man.
if you were finding and totting cans... they looked at you like you were a bum.
he wrote down his failures, when no good had been accomplished.
teresa was the woman who loved him before he went bad.
we are going to make a dish with green beans, rice and stewed chicken.
it's going to take a while, but it will be good.
so you are trying to tell me that we don't eat food from this store?
they got us out here waiting like dogs tied to a pole.
i run my ass to the beverly center mall... and steal a car.
i put a hat or bandanna on my head, then they cannot recognize a nigger.
i hold her by the thumb, just to cut her a little bit.
so she is too worried about bleeding before she calls the cop.
but the idea that darryl wanted to hear what he had to say, scared him.
socrates wanted to tell the child that everything was going to be all right.
but it was not all right and it might never become all right.
because trouble would crawl up into your mind and come inside with you.
i will tell him that he is a fool and that he must go home tonight.
because in a day or two i will be at his front door.
sure, socrates heard the boy gasping and snorting in that dumpster.
but it wasn't worth the mark against his soul to see that crack head bleed.
i could get some glue down in here... brace it, and hold it together with a belt... then these legs are stronger than they were before.
some of the things they teach you in prison are useful.
they said that they cannot give me a good pain killer... until they have tried chemo or radiation.
and now they are telling me... that they cannot treat me right, because i am not insured properly.
but i want you to take it and get me a piece.
after i am gone, you can give the rest to her.
did the woman behind the bar tell you to come up here?
because if she did, you had better take your ass and get out of here.
i want to know what you see when you look at me.
i always wanted to know... but that's not a question one man should ask another.
that bus was carrying him to places most men couldn't even imagine.
and socrates had been as low as a man could go.
just becoming comfortable being the kind of guy that wears a fanny pack.
i am not that guy yet but i hope to become that guy because it's so convenient.
i have great kids, i like my kids a lot, but they uh...
it's like a rodeo clown car pulled up, and 15 of 'em got out and they're running around and you can't catch 'em.
it's always when you're on the phone that they wanna talk to you.
you're on the phone talking to a distant relative, it's probably 17 million dollars a nanosecond, and that's when they walk up and... dad?
how many times do i have to explain this to you?
are you gonna be 35-years-old at the office running around going, boss, boss, boss?
so i find myself at age forty in my underwear creepy-crawling to get to the bathroom, hoping that i won't walk too loudly and set off james earl jones' voice in my kid's bedroom.
and when i raise the toilet seat, that little "click" as it hits the top...
and tell laura that you need to talk to me, that it's an emergency.
that is so easy, and it's a shame, but i'm not gonna participate.
and i said, 'cause that would be like... comp... forget it.
i like to go to the bowling alley and bring a little black marble with me and put it inside that machine that they use to polish the balls, then just call the manager over.
during the summer i like to go to the beach and make sandcastles out of cement...
then wait for kids to run by and kick 'em over.
nobody else raised their hand so i figured i'd take a shot at it.
it took me almost four hours just to get it off the runway.
you mean the number you've given me every day for the last two weeks?
yeah, and even if they're reluctant to say it's an emergency...
never in my family has anybody worn a bathing suit that size.
when we go to the beach, we go in... giant shirts, long overcoats and pants.
i'm sorry the thing with laura didn't work out as well.
it just goes to show you that none of those items you have really help you in any way.
but i don't always remember to bring my phone with me.
but if they all "live" in the fanny pack - click!
you try and do a nice thing that cost me a few hundred dollars worth of repair work.
why don't you give me the fanny pack and i'll hose it out, and i'll give it back to you.
you think i'm gonna walk to work carrying a plastic shopping bag?
how come nobody walks around with a stick with a bandana anymore?
i think if we can find the source of your anger and then approach it from that angle...
i think if you saw what it is that makes you so angry-
my job is to help you shed light on the black- what do you do when you get angry?
i think what's more important is why you're interested in what i do when i get angry.
don't mean to be indelicate, but i don't want your etiquette.
if you think i'm just too crass, then you can kiss my sassafras!
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
look, if she wants to waste her time with that handsome, wealthy..., ...honest prince..., ...well, that's just... fine.
you know..., ...if you really want her, you're gonna have to come clean about your past.
the only reason i went through all this was so that i could spend time with you..., ...to see if what we almost had before could...
well, that's perfect, see, 'cause, here's what i wanna talk to you about.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
and how much happier can you be than living the life of a princess, huh?
yes, that's my reward in all this, that and a certain sapphire.
well, you ought to give this prince a chance, you know.
he's young, heir to a throne and possibly better-looking than me.
d dd a royal crowd has come to town d dd the prince has brought them here dd dd the girls are in their finest gowns dd d dd a smile from ear to ear d dd but underneath these fancy clothes dd

look, if she wants to waste her time... with that handsome, wealthy, honest prince, well, that's just fine.
you know, if you really want her, you're gonna have to come clean about your past.
he ate out of a garbage can because his mother would forget to feed him.
i need to decide how hard to pursue this and in what direction.
no, and we have no reason to think that he did.
if you think he's innocent, then why are you covering for him?
i don't want this kid let loose in society without treatment.
yeah, but unless the parents or the kid fess up, that's it, case closed.
no matter how much they love him, they are not equipped to deal with him.
he's under suspicion for killing a baby, and i believe he's also killed a dog.
they told me the autopsy would be ready at the end of the week.
you should get to know the cutters in the m.e.'s office.
what i do is perfectly legal, so don't come in here and start threatening me, you understand?
you passed on a baby who'd been so severely neglected she had only days to live.
somebody has used her birth certificate to document and sell another baby.
they must've just gone to the county clerk and pulled the birth certificate.
this isn't a couple of teenagers who killed their newborn because they were scared.
these are two adults who went to a lot of trouble to dump a dying child and to cover their tracks.
lieutenant van buren made an offhand remark to a police officer.
all mrs. connery had to do was keep her mouth shut.
now, i've seen enough of these charades to know the likelihood is there.
i'm suppressing her statement they knew the child was in poor health.
your honor, these people callously and deliberately abandoned a sick little girl, who died because of their actions.
and i wish you luck in proving that, mr. mccoy, but until you have admissible evidence to that effect, the charges are dismissed.
the connerys have been to vologda, russia, twice in the last three months.
the second time they brought back a baby girl, mariana petrova.
well, the factors that stimulate the disorder, infection and improper diet, control these and the patient can live a normal life span.
did you give all this information to mr. and mrs. connery?
did it occur to you to call the broker and tell him after she was in her new home?
i assumed that whoever got the baby would take her to the doctor, and they would find out what was wrong with her.
in fact, as long as you could make her somebody else's problem, you just didn't give a damn, did you?
it's easy for you to sit in judgment, but what would you have done?
when i was your age, the closest thing to a mall was a walgreers with a fotomat in the parking lot.
man, between that and black-and-white tv, your life was a living hell!
that's a beautiful pattern for a shower curtain, a big plus for any bathroom.
once we get this fixed up, any renter's gonna love this house.
and this window up here seems to be a little bit stuck.
just get a washer for the faucet and put some silicone on there.
well, you want to go by the book, i'm going by the book.
and according to section 12, paragraph seven, uh, you "are responsible for all repairs or i have someone do it and take it out of the rent."
i believe it's to pay the rent and not eat gravy in the bedroom.
al, are you gonna eat that apple the entire time i'm fixing the doorknob?
you're the only one that quoted shakespeare on a rental application.
so, you're saying objectively that the person at fault is the lessee as opposed to the lessor.
on the other hand, the guy he hired is a mysterious flute-playing stranger.
have you noticed there are no children left in the village?
makes your heart stop, doesn't it, seeing them all helpless like that?
knowing all they need is a good man to go in and show 'em how it's done?
you know, that's where they pinch different parts of your body with those pinchers...
you're talking to someone you've just met in a bar, and you know the only reason you're there is that you're so lonely that almost any form of human companionship
and i haven't even gotten to the worst part about being single.
which is: realizing that something i believed in, trusted in, counted on my whole life, is probably a lie.
i'm afraid that if i see someone that could be that special person,
i'll be too afraid or too desperate to even speak to her.
that's because americans prioritize being in love above success, above personal growth, above health.
so let's take a look then, without the pressures and presumptions, what might we want?
i wanna find someone whose every move is magic to me.
that with everything she does, tells me to forget my fear and..
companionate love is a necessity, romantic love on the other hand is a luxury.
if you're gonna skip sex, you shouldn't plan on selling too many books there, doc.
-and then i can't complain about us being apart because i didn't speak up, right?
look, alex, you wanna protect your feelings by letting me decide, that's fine, but i have to protect my feelings just the same.
ooh, like that thing was gonna follow you to the grave.
yeah, and then i realized, excuse me, prince is gonna be looking at this application.
ten minutes into his self-help book, he'd rather do taxes than stewardesses.
well how do we justify chasing after something whose absence makes us... funny?
here is the good word, final thing, if you take her...
gabe, keeps getting better, people magazine just voted you to sexiest man alive.
love has been replaced by vibrators and chatrooms, people who make 5 figures, demanded prenups, even if they're destined to be together, doesn't matter, the be...
i can't tell you how long you'd have to shower before i let you back into my kitchen.
here i am.. calling, a little slow in the lurning curve i guess.
i'm calling because it's killing me not to tell you i've been thinking about us, about the whole.. well..
if this is gonna turn into one of those 'we were drunk, it was a mistake'-moments,
i just wish i had some recollection as to how good a mistake.
and if i let him do it, i'll never forgive myself.
i'll tell you what, it'd be nice if boy got girl here, but uh..
gabe thinks that cin is with the french guy, and that really gets him riled up.
because, a, that's his woman, and b, it's a french guy.
don't you wear a baret in my house, you little man.
and then they get married and have little olive children that goes plop.
we get them stuck in an elevator and cut the lights off.
-let me make this clear, i'm not doing anything that requires rewiring, or kidnapping, or night vision goggles.
no, but i believe in excitation transfers and positive arrousal misattributions.
no idea what you just said, but it just turned me on.
you do this great little turn with your mouth when you get angry, you go like this.
can we just stop there while i'm still perceiving that as a compliment?
no, he wanted some kind of magic, he wanted to see it.
what gabe was talking about in the group, what was that?
least i could do after disappointing you like that the last time.
i'm gonna make it up to you in a very big way.
i've never seen it with the lights on, i imagine it's not quite as moving.
when you get a good look at 'em, gabe, most things aren't.
doesn't matter if you stay in or go out, your life is predestined, and there's nothing you can do about it.
so you mean that bus is going to drive right through my house to get to me?
the paper was on morality and ethics, and i was just saying there are definite gray areas.
i know what the paper's about, because, you see, i assigned it.
because we live together, and i feel like i am part of your family.
except when i dream about you, and you're in that little pink robe, and you start doing that thing...
you used a position of power unethically, and cory protected me the only way he knew how.
and now it's my turn to do the same thing for him.
i was in the student union when cory asked me to step outside.
i thought it was to talk about a bad grade i gave him on a paper which i called "pedestrian."
i've tried to protect you for too long in the shelters of high school.
this is a major university, and this is life, and these things happen.
it's always better to marry someone who loves you more than you love them.
people are always telling me things i don't want to hear.
am i the only one who thinks this is a major bummer?
what if you spend five years with him, and have nothing to show for it?
i think that a relationship has to be based on honesty and communication if it has any chance of succeeding.
if you were 25, that would be adorable, but you're 32 now, so that's just stupid.
he obviously had seen something else he liked and gone after it.
then, just when she thought her evening couldn't get any worse...
but then again, i'm dating a man who will never get married, and miranda is having a relationship with something that comes in a box from japan.
in a city of great expectations, is it time to settle for what you can get?
just back from her honeymoon, she was pre-occupied with marriage business.
i'd like to return these. ls there any way you can melt them down into one decent gift?
brooke left with a better gift, and i left wondering if everyone in manhattan was settling.
my zen teacher once told me that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.
evidently stanford, tired of bars and blind dates, decided to place a personal ad.
he scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent on a cold, sunday afternoon.
the more he mocked me, the more convinced i became that the idea was genius.
that night, miranda and i planned to join charlotte for a gallery opening when...
he's a very sweet boy, but, you know, he is a fruit.
i realised then that the only inheritance stanford would get from his grandmother was her collection of chanel suits.
so, when she got married... we were all dying to see which one had made the cut.
was i the only one who remembered that brooke once described this man... as more boring than exposed brick?
what do i have to do to get to know her better?
do you think the pears in this tart are bosc or bartlett?
it's always better to marry someone who loves you more than you love them.
people are always telling me things i don't want to hear.
am i the only one who thinks this is a major bummer?
what if you spend five years with him and in the end you have nothing?
if you're gonna get a vibrator, at least get one called "the horse."
a vibrator does not call you on your birthday, send flowers the next day... and you cannot take a vibrator home to meet your mother.
with breath like that, you're gonna live a very long life alone.
i killed the last woman who talked to me like that.
samantha left with the turtle, brooke left with a better gift... and i left wondering if everyone in manhattan was settling.
my zen teacher told me that there was nothing like yoga to quiet a busy mind.
evidently stanford, tired of bars and blind dates... decided to place a personal ad.
he scheduled a rendezvous with the only respondent on a cold, sunday afternoon.
friday night with a man who shared my passion for hot men in tights.
saturday afternoon in bed with a man who shared my passion for passion.
you have a little bit of sauce on the lip... right there.
my zen teacher also said the only way to true happiness... is to live in the moment and not worry about the future.

20 minutes and three false alarms later, stanford was ready to call it quits.
friday night at the ballet with a man who shared my passion for men in tights.
saturday afternoon in bed with a man who shared my passion for passion.

jerry, who samantha met at brooke's wedding... took her to lava, new york's restaurant du jour.
from the moment i saw you at that wedding, i knew we'd have dinner.
he obviously had seen something else he liked and gone after it.
then, just when she thought her evening couldn't get any worse--

while samantha was doing everything in her power to remake the turtle... into a man she could f all in love with.
mikhail, who dreamed of lining up all the people in the world and making them happy.
he was prevented by a force which pulled him up to the ceiling.
he started to investigate it privately, supported by his unwavering faith in non-linear correlation between chronometry and expanding time and space.
was mikhail aware of the far-reaching results his activities might have had?
however, this didn't prevent him from having a solidarity with everything that flew.

it was his dream to receive a bout of inspiration force one hundred.
gradually but steadily, a sentence was taking shape in michael's hopelessly postmodern head.
you can love the fattest woman in the world, but at the same time, you shouldn't break.
for the umpteenth time, michael arrived at the truth that all the ingenious things in this world were also perfectly simple.
an observer might have had difficulty saying whether mikhail actually realized what he was doing.
the line separating the tangible world, measurable by chronometer, from the irrational one was vague, like the origin of the underground.
mikhail hardly thought that asking a question might also mean getting an answer.
so she told everyone to press her, knowing that one fine day...
miss nipple didn't know exactly what she would do on this fine day, but she could feel it coming.
helmuth, falling on his bottom, causes mikhail to be pulled up to the ceiling.
mikhail never learned that it was helmuth's falling in the recent past which had destroyed his life.
the present for mikhail contained only the knowledge that he didn't want to go back, and couldn't go forward, and his melancholy pieces for the piano.
there might have been one more possibility, but mikhail's minus charged head refused to contemplate it.
when your shoes are full of water, there's no sense in asking - up or down?
victor had enough water in his shoes to go very high indeed.
he was sure that a brilliant career was waiting for him upstairs.
the news about the rabbits' plan hit pgi like a bottle of chateau de terrefort-quancard, vintage '48, thrown into calm water.
yes, practically all the inhabitants of pgi were connected straight to the circuit and their freedom of movement was non-existent.
they were all utterly helpless in the face of rising water.

my daddy used to warn me, it was just as easy for little children to disappear as it was for gingerbread men.
i promise, if it wasn't an emergency, i wouldn't do it.
come on, you know clyde, the kids are comfortable with him.
you punched holes the size of cow chips in a 20-year career.
you got yourself in a whole bucket of shit here, magruder.
why doss would take my kids, then release them after an hour.
he wasn't after them, just wanted to use them as bait.
well, depending upon the density and the quality, between 10 and 15 million dollars.
counsellor, it's very difficult to believe that a man with these assets had no will.
miss doss, in the circumstances i'm compelled by the law to appoint you as administratrix of your daddy's estate.
only, before i do so i would like a full search and inventory of all his assets and papers filed with this court within 30 days.
randle, if i need to, i can force you to testify.
i'd like to see you try to force me to do anything
he did me a real big favor dropping off the kids.
he's gone now, so maybe we should try and let it go.

i wanna tell you, you did a superb job in jacksonville.
savannah lawyers haven't won a case down there in 10 years.
no offence, ma'am, but he's always appeared a few beers shy of a six-pack.
well, we should maybe ask some questions, just to help out.
judging from his behaviour i'd say mr doss suffers from rather acute schizophrenia.
i recommend that he be committed to hospital for an evaluation.
mr randle, answer the question, or i'll hold you in contempt.
punishable by a fine and up to 30 days in jail.
your honour, nothin' this asshole said is true, but help me with this, will you, your honour?
you arrest me, you arrest me based on her pack of lies.
you appoint me a lawyer who's incompetent, inexperienced, he probably cheated his way through law school.

when i was a kid he used to tell me stories, and they became stranger and scarier.
he'd come into my room and sit on my bed and he'd...
a lonely old man and woman who lived in the woods.
they had no children, so she decides to bake a gingerbread man.
and he grew very proud, because he thought no-one would ever catch him.

half the size, half the strength and, apparently, half the brain.
ever see what happens to a bug that gets caught in the fly zapper?
i've told you a thousand times, we have to keep a low profile.
we can't attract batman's attention until we have some kind of an edge.
you just released the most virulent allergenic pollen in the floral kingdom.
the reaction is quite deadly, as your playmate is finding out.
so j. peterman wants to hire some of our cartoonists to illustrate your catalog?
well, we're hoping that if, perhaps the catalog is a little funnier people won't be so quick to return the clothes.
well, miss benes cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer.
well, you don't have to dissect it if you could just tell me why this is supposed to be funny.
for instance, i remember when we first met we had a great conversation.
i remember you said i was the prettiest girl at the party.
well, i've asked everyone at work and no one gets this cartoon.
i don't understand why, but i am gonna get to the bottom of this.
i know i've been kind of shooting off at the mouth lately.
first, with that girl whose life you destroyed and then about george dating a lady jerry.
what, to blab to the neighbors about how george has a new fem-jerry friend?
or to tell everybody at the coffee shop how george is all mixed up in a perverse sexual amalgam of some girl and his best friend?
but why is it that the animals enjoy reading the e-mail?
well, miss benes cartoons are like gossamer and one doesn't dissect gossamer.
that i'd have everything i have with jerry but because it's a woman i could also have sex with her?
and that somehow, that would be exactly what i always wanted?
we leave you tonight with a scene from sally weaver's one-woman show.
okay, so, i go to meet jerry seinfeld at this horrible coffee shop, right?
i had to stay up all night but i finally came up with a great new yorker cartoon.
if i stayed up all night, i'd fix myself up a little before i go out.

now, we got a dog and a cat in an office.
it looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets working there.
i've asked everyone at work, and no one gets this cartoon.

i just wanted to leave you a message to let you know
i caught your little piece on tv, and i'm getting a little tired of hearing about how horrible i am, and i would appreciate it if you would leave me out of your act all together.
for instance i remember, when we first met we had a great conversation.
i remember you said i was the prettiest girl at the party.

* so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out *
* allow if you're still alive * * 6 to 8 years to arrive *

well, yes, but today i wanted to be alert for your visit, particularly as i saw so little of you at the hospital.
jimmy, look, i'm sorry, but with this picture and two difficult stars...
if you were a star nobody cared a tinker's cuss who you slept with, so long as you kept it out of the papers.
as for us directors, well, outside hollywood who even knows who george cukor is, much less what he gets up to with those boys from the malt shops?
great writers, artists, society folk, all rubbing elbows with hollywood royalty.
but how many of those oh-so-proper people... know about the sunday brunches that follow?
whatever was killed in your stroke... seems to have short-circuited this mechanism.
so you're saying there's an electrical storm going on inside my head.
- take the luminal to sleep... and whenever you feel an attack coming on.
what you're saying is that this isn't just a case of resting until i'm better, but that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
you did say that you just wanted to draw my face, right?
oh, well, if it's going to make you feel uncomfortable, perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
i've spent much of my life outrunning the past, and now it floods all over me.
there's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to tell the truth.
well, in dudley, in the north of england, there were more sides to the tracks than any american could imagine.
every englishman knows his place, and if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.
they were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe... and don't know what to do with the creature except to harness him to the plow.
hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive... in that soul-killing place.
well, this kisser wasn't so bad that you couldn't lay under it a couple of times.
i bet he's just some fruit pretending to be famous... so he can get into the big guy's pants.
in the sequel, james, two lady scientists should make a monster, and our monster would be gary cooper.
i'd have thought mr. leslie howard would be more your line.
it made me wonder what the hell i was doin' with my life.
i still have time to get things right, get married again.
- the master wants to know if you are free for lunch.
i tell him you'll be having other plans, but he insists i ask.
oh, there was a time when this house was full of young men.
some of them even posed for me, right where you're sitting now.
disgust, fear of the unknown... all part of the great gulf that stands between us two.
am i right in assuming that you have little experience with men of my persuasion?
this absolutely swims on me, so that should deal with your upper half.
and now we just need to deal with the rest, don't we?
the only thing i can think is, how the hell am i gonna tell my father?
and you know what happened when i finally did tell him?
and he hung there... well, at least until we were relieved.
we introduced him to the new unit before marching out, speaking highly of his companionship.

i tell him you'll be having other plans, but he insists i ask.
well, i do have a lawn this afternoon, but i'm free until then.
i do not think it's fair, but goïs laws is not for us to judge.
so, what you're telling me is, mr. whale is a homo.
i could no longer command the best projects, so i walked away.
why should i spend my time working in this dreadful business?
[whale] i remember one morning in particular, a morning when the sun came out.
it's odd how, even there, there were days when the weather was enough to make one happy.
and i was shoulder-to-shoulder with a tall, apple-cheeked schoolboy who loved me... and trusted me.
you will not do this to me again, mr... [gasps] mr. boone.
this absolutely swims on me, so that should deal with your upper half.
and now we just need to deal with the rest, don't we?

see, me and him, we found this gold nugget worth at least, oh, 50 dinars.
the only problem is, neither of us has the money to buy the other one out.

which is more than i can say for the men who did this to him.
[ man narrating ] in a time of ancient gods -- [ xena yells ] warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero.
she was xena, a mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.
- that sword belongs to a friend of mine... who was beaten nearly to death.
so, either you start filling' in some holes, or i start making 'em.
unless you'd rather that i hand you over to the authorities.
i hear that they cut out your tongue, brand your arm, and jail you for life.
i want to rattle titus's cage a little -- shake him up. [ tosses dice ]
seeing what he did to your friend, i do not blame you.
you got a problem with us, we'll take it up later.
right now, we gotta find joxer and get things back on track.
because you won't be playing xena-- at least not just xena.
you'll be up against the best in the business -- a guy named rafe.
that he stopped to watch the paint dry or the grass grow, and he completely forgot?
believe me, i know joxer almost as well as i know you.

well, it's the story of a young boy - an irish boy.
'his name is liam hanlon.' 'liam lives on a farm, near durrow in southern ireland.'
it must have been a feud that got out of control.
jennings bludgeoned hadleigh to death, then when he realised what he'd done he came here and ended it rather than face the music.
i want you to check every minicab in causton till you find the one that dropped off the blonde woman on the 31st.
do a background on gerald hadleigh, and do the same for max jennings.

we're behind schedule, but we get the choice part of this mission.
too bad for the atlantic fleet but we'll be the ones who finish off the enemy.
with this knife called stream base being held to its throat it's been all humanity could do just to survive.
but it looks as though our enemy has decided to make the final cut and wipe us all out.
zorndyke has triggered a sudden pole shift which is eliminating the earth's magnetic field.
freed of its influence, the crust will begin to move freely.
we in the pacific fleet will cross the tonga trench and approach antarctica from 170 degrees east longitude.
at the same time, the atlantic fleet will come around the continent from the east attack from 120 degrees east longitude and take control of stream base.
not because you always had to show off how goddamned brilliant you were.
because you have no sense of responsibility or concern for anyone!
although i would have liked to see you as well... but kept the swordfish and hammerhead mobile.
did you leave that message so that we'd come find you?
a pitiful soul that could not believe in the great spirit...
really, this just doesn't suit my style to just sit and wait like this.
man, they were really great when they won the pennant 14 years ago.
they just kept hittin' the ball one after another, and turned losing games around!
and if you change the navigation to full-auto then you can glide along without manual steering...
do you want to use a machine, or do you want the machine to use you?
isn't there a way for you to just swing on by?
if i plunge in at this angle, both the bebop and the swordfish will burn to nothing!
if you slow down within earth's atmosphere the gravitational pull will accelerate you instead which will give you enough speed to escape.
however, you have to maintain the ship at a certain angle.
the moment a new life is born... and becomes the guardian star.
this star we stand on is someone's guardian star as well.
the moment a new life is born a new star is born, and becomes the guardian star.
this star we stand on is someone's guardian star as well.
when you show fear, it will spring at you faster than light.
if you do not show fear, it will only gently look over you...
one day, the cat was a free cat, a stray cat.
he met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days happily together.
one of them is a fake, because i lost it in an accident.
since then, i have been seeing the past in one eye, and the present in the other.
there was apparently a coup two days ago concerning who was going to be the syndicate's successor.
and they're now out to annihilate anyone who was involved in the coup.

the bell tolls for the great ones who will someday fall.
money makes the world go round but debt piles up before you know it.
they used to be a good group working on environmental preservation and the protection of endangered species.
but since their leader changed two years ago, their focus drastically changed.
273 million... add to that the hospital fees for a total of 300,028,000 woolongs.
yes, if you pay up that much, you will be free.
he told us to hand you all of his assets if something happened to him...
if you give us a thumb print here, everything he owns will be yours.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart cannot heal all the tears in it.
like "hyperspace gates are the in thing among today's fashion-conscious kids!
that girl won't even look your way until you assault at least one gate!" or something?
the unit automatically sent the money data that it just stole.
it immediately launders all the funds in a bank on europa making it impossible to track where it went...
all the culprits that were caught in the act have nothing in common.
criminal record... nobody has any of the money that they supposedly stole.
the guy that i nabbed said that he was just following the instructions from a manual that he got through mail-order.
perhaps the other culprits are reading the same manual that he was?
the hacking unit that was placed on the gates was something that couldn't be made unless you knew about the gate system really well.
the mastermind's likely someone who has some connection to the gate corporation.
you guys at the gate corporation should know what this means.
to put a bounty on a mastermind that we aren't even sure exists... no?
i had heard once that there was a place where all the scrapped remains of obsolete gates were gathered along with scrap metal and abandoned spaceships and that there were people that started living there.
why the hell do they want to live here of all places?
here we merely have an old man that loves games... and planned this all out.
he made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later during the one moment that the gate program gets automatically updated.
and had completely forgotten about the traps that he himself had set... it works out better for you this way.
because now you don't have to worry about the fundamental defect in the gates leaking out.
you do want to know why i drag an empty coffin around like this, don't you?
it's because i'm going to go home after putting your corpse inside...
sitting in muddywater isn't such a bad life if it ends after the first time...
a videotape that was delivered to the bebop with no return address.
as long as there is a body, desires will be born.
as long as there is desire, human ego will not disappear.
they believe that doing this will make them exist as a soul without a body.
now professor they say that londes, the leader, was once a doctor.
today, i'm introducing power cdj, an item for dj's who don't exercise much!
you adjust the bpm using this lever and it allows you to be a dj while you exercise!
in just seconds, everything before my eyes went blank and i passed out.
if ein didn't realize it and bite me, i would have been a member of scratch.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart cannot heal all the tears in it.
you broke the bebop, but kept the swordfish and hammerhead mobile.
did you leave that message so that we'd come find you?
it's been a fast trip for bebop, with only two episodes left.
but make sure you pay close attention to how it ends.
how many bald people with glasses do you think there are in this universe?
so i said, bald, short, with glasses and driving a gaudy truck with sarasvati painted on it!
ten years ago, zebra and giraffe attempted to reclaim a certain facility.
but, a few days later, zebra ends up missing and giraffe finds himself blind folded in a weird place he'd never seen before.
it's been a fast trip for bebop, with only two episodes left.
but make sure you pay close attention to how it ends.
they say that pao is one of the three greatest feng shui masters here on mars...
but when i discovered his location, he was already gone from this world...
one is the chi of heaven, the energy that comes from the sun.
one is the chi of earth, the energy that comes from a planet's surface.
did he want me to find this stone and do something with it?
it feels like i created more mysteries instead of solving them.
for now, i decided to check out this stone, which was our only clue.
so this is a piece of the moon from that gate accident 50 years ago...
if i remember correctly, my father owned a sun stone as well.
i'm sure that the two stones are resonating to show me the whereabouts of my father.
i'm sure pao was afraid that more bad things would happen to his family.
well, i'm sure you can confirm it all when you see him.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart cannot heal all the tears in it.
you're totally wrong if you think your old woman still thinks about you.
you're totally wrong yourself if you think every other woman thinks like you.
this time, he snagged a test animal from a research facility, and is on the loose.
the good news is that he's worth a whopping 8 million!
how're all you 300,000 bounty hunters in the solsolar system doing?
it's time for bigshot, the show that brings you information about fugitives!
the bell tolls for the great ones who will someday fall.
money makes the world go round but debt piles up before you know it.
but in this recession, i hear she's got a lot of debts to pay...
i'm sure there are a lot of problems for a woman trying to live alone...
you're totally wrong if you think your old woman still thinks about you.
you're totally wrong yourself if you think every other woman thinks like you.
all i had to do was hang on to your arm like a child, with no cares in the world.
i wanted to decide how to live my life by myself...
what is the identity of the fearsome enemy that refuses to show itself?
a symphony of shivers that will send you into the deepest trenches of terror!
once the channel is set, you will no longer be able to escape...
for the edonkey 55m 50s raw dvd segment of cowboy bebop:
now we go live to ms. lai lee, who is at the scene.
yes, i'm on site here where... rescuers are searching for victims, an experts are analyzing the disaster area.
the police have told us that the chemicals ignited and caused the explosion.
there remains the possibilty that this was a biological attack, so the area has been quarantined, and no one can enter or leave.
this one is carabaru nut, to get back at your wife when she's unfaithful.
to see if it's a good or a bad seed, eat it fast.
it's you're fault for getting a 300 million bounty put on your head.
and so, the turtle took him to a palace called ryuuguujou as a reward.
for a woman who always claims other people's property as her own to run away without even touching it?
she seems to have picked up a lot ofgrudges from all over, though.
the real worth of treasures like this can't be determined from the outside.
you may be surprised at how much you can sell it for!
everything about this city is different from minnesota, where we were before.
hey, brother, are you sure we can get along well here?
beta had a small cassette for their day and the playback decks were compact and didn't take much space.
you didn't get that much noise when using the special replay features like still frame and slow motion.
i kinda see why the man turned into an old geezer after opening the tamatebako now...
even if we head back now, we're not gonna be any younger.
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
they already have a bounty of 8 million woolongs on the culprit...
since the gate accident 50 years ago the people of earth have migrated underground as a result of the change in climate, namely moon rocks falling onto the planet.
to them, the 'space network' created by computers is necessary for them to stay in contact with those living in space.
i'll look at all the antennae that can transmit light signals one by one.
i'll ask around for info on any prominent hackers in the area.
and back then on earth, there were many pictures like this, and i always looked at them.
i remembered those times and i tried to recreate at least the pictures.
break the antennae that it uses to communicate with the other satellites.
then make a direct connection to the satellite and download mpu.
last week, you let ajiz, a bounty on mars worth 1.5 million, get away...
and in pyortle before that, the police got to them first...
the captured criminal was the a.i. program for a spy satellite that was launched before the earth was ruined.
according to government sources from back then, it supposedly would continue activity on its own even without commands from earth.
well, it was the perfect excuse for the cops to go on a hacker hunt.
but anyway, why did it start doodling on the earth with a laser all of a sudden?
sitting in muddy water isn't such a bad life if it ends after the first time...
no regrets about the woman who ran away but a small thorn still pricks the heart.
letting one flow along with time itself living all alone from that day to this.
but to the sounds of waves that come and go the migrating birds find their hearts drawn.
it ended up this way because you went in on your own...
you know what happens to people who go against the syndicate, right?
even those lucky enough to escape'll be tracked down to the ends of the world and they always wind up dead.
they say he appears with a smile, and he leaves with a smile...
yeah, you know that cock-eye guy that was worth 8 million the other day?
believe it or not, i was the one who caught him!
what the hell am i supposed to do with that little bit of information?
how many bald people with glasses do you think there are in this universe?
and buildings that are needlessly tall to symbolize all of this!
i wanted to raise the question of how a true pioneer should be.

even if we head back now, we're not gonna be any younger.
when asimov left his syndicate, he snuck something out with him.
the top-end stuff of all the illegal eyedrops that the syndicate makes.
he took off with all of the drops, so the group is in a mess.
they wanna catch him, but all they get back are corpses.
man, they were really great when they won the pennant 14 years ago.
they just kept hittin' the ball one after another, and turned losing games around!

however, you have to maintain the ship at a certain angle.
i grew suspicious, and started to research pao's current where abouts.
they say that pao is one of the three greatest feng shui masters here on mars...
but when i found his whereabouts, he had already left this world...
are you sure you weren't the one that sent me this mail?
but your father sure was unlucky to be in a traffic accident...
on the way to jupiter, there was a sudden fluctuation in hyperspace...
i didn't have any particular favors to repay to pao or this girl but i decided to help them for now.
there were too many things that made me suspicious to leave it alone.
one is the chi of earth, the energy that comes from a planet's surface.
and lastly chi of magnetism, the chi that organisms like ourselves produce.
that magnetic field and the magnetic field of the earth react to one another to create energy.
universal feng shui is a method that reads the energies of nature such as this to use them in everyday life.
however, universal feng shui has the power to make the bad into the good.
for example, if you were a feng shui master as powerful as my father...
it feels like i created more mysteries instead of solving them.
fornow, i decided to check out this stone, which was our only clue.
it's absorbed the fluctuations in time and space and conceals a tremendous amount of energy.
i can only think of it as a plain old rock...
however, it's impossible for someone who knows important syndicate secrets to ever leave the group.
i'm sure pao was afraid that more bad things would happen to his family.
i sent you that mail because i wanted you to bring my daughter here...
so... you're trying to tell me that you used feng shui to bring us here?
hey, isn't it bad for you to drink it in one shot, annie?
you coming back to life is worse on me than this glass.
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
they already have a bounty of 8 million woolongs on the culprit...
since the gate accident 50 years ago... ... the people of earth have migrated underground as a result... namely moon rocks falling onto the planet.

it was the perfect excuse for the cops to go on a hacker hunt.
"this bounty is only for when humans or other life-forms are the targets."
"it is difficult to determine whether or not a computer program is a life-form."
with their culture... ... have escaped from the great system of nature... ... and are committing crimes that cannot be amended.
those that don't realize this... ... are what you could call "bugs" in the nature system.
sheesh, that was the first time we screwed up so badly.
we never had anything like that before when we were all alone.
the man got onto the airplane that finally arrived and there he sees a land of pure white below him.
the place glistening in the light was the summit of a snow-covered mountain.
there was apparently a coup two days ago concerning who was going tobe the syndicate's successor.
in the end the elders won, and they're now out to annihilate anyone who was involved in the coup.
but why are they trying to get rid of those that already left the syndicate?
anything against them will be annihilated, down to the very last seed.
from now on, i will dictate all authority and symbolism of this syndicate.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
sitting in muddy water isn't such a bad life if it ends after the first time...
a lot of things have happened, but the next episode is the last.
how many bald people with glasses do you think there are in this universe?
so i said, bald, short, with glasses and driving a gaudy truck with sarasvati painted on it!
but in this recession, i hear she's got a lot of debts to pay...
i'm sure there are a lot of problems for a woman trying to live alone...
you're totally wrong if you think your old woman still thinks about you.
you're totally wrong yourself if you think every other woman thinks like you.
when i was with you, i never had to do anything.
all i had to do was hang on to your arm like a child, with no cares in the world.
caught by the venomous fangs of the unseen enemy, another victim falls.

i should do an explosives test and a biochemical test just in case...
you may be surprised at how much you can sell it for!
i need to get enough to cover the c.o.d. charges at least.
back in the 20th century, they didn't use disks like we do to record movies.
they used things called videotapes, which are in cassettes like this.
but a disagreement between the companies who created this technology resulted in two standards, beta and vhs.
beta had a small cassette for their day and the playback decks were compact and didn't take much space.
you didn't get that much noise when using the special replay features like still frame and slow motion.
and, because beta had high quality images users who were into good graphics supported it really heavily.
apparently, they were all caught in the act, but none were the mastermind.
then you don't get the reward unless you find that mastermind?
i feel sorry for all the guys who caught the culprits!
why the hell do these thugs that normally just rob convenience stores attack at the gates?
you're the one that started all this, saying that we should research this case on our own.
you also said that the occasional rivalry between comrades would be good for us.
furthermore, the unit automatically sent the money data that it just stole.
it immediately launders all the funds in a bank on europa making it impossible to track where it went...
the hacking unit that was placed on the gates was something that couldn't be made unless you knew about the gate system really well.
the mastermind's likely someone who has some connection to the gate corporation.
a programmer that had been dubbed a genius from his teens.
i n the cosmo-net chess tournaments, he dominated the champion's seat for decades.
he made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later during the one moment that the gate program gets automatically updated.
even making those that physically commit the crime hold chess pieces to hint that it was his doing.
oh come on, it's all part of the dream i had.
the way things go, i say that even the hard-earned 5000 woolongs will disappear with your dream.
as charlie said, " if you want to receive, you must first give."
i guess what i see in dreams is worth something once in a while...
there was a decryption program called crypt-breaker that was developed by sit three years ago.
rumors say that right after its completion, the programmer was killed and the program went into the black market.
so, there was a need to find the key to open the program.
i heard rumors that both the cops and the issp were parting hairs to find the key...
i used to work in a shady place called the issp.
i'm sure the casino was to take attention away from the large sum of money and to fool the cops...
apparently, they were all caught in the act, but none were the mastermind.
then you don't get the reward unless you find that mastermind?
i feel sorry for all the guys who caught the culprits!
why the hell do these thugs that normally just rob convenience stores attack at the gates?
you're the one that started all this, saying that we should research this case on our own.
you also said that the occasional rivalry between comrades would be good for us.
in this case, all 20 cases were done the same way,
all of them infiltrated the tollbooth deftly attached the hacking unit and in the exact moment that passing ships access the tollbooth to pay the toll they steal the entire balance from the credit card.
furthermore, the unit automatically, sent the money data that it just stole.
it immediately launders all the funds in a bank on europa making it impossible to track where it went.
the hacking unit that was placed on the gates was something that couldn't be made unless you knew about the gate system really well.
the mastermind's likely someone who has some connection to the gate corporation.

in the cosmo-net chess tournaments, he dominated the champion's seat for decades.
back then, hex was riled up for revenge, and planned this all out.
he made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later during the one moment that the gate program gets automatically updated.
because now you don't have to worry about the fundamental defect in the gates leaking out.
although, the price you paid was that we learned about that defect.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart iyasenu mama kaze ga fuiteru ...cannot heal all the tears in it.
kawaita hitomi de dareka naite kure someone, cry for me with parched eyes.
today, we'll discuss the mysterious land paintings that suddenly appeared in what was south america.
as usual, we have commentaries by a researcher of supernatural phenomena...
however, the land paintings were drawn by lasers coming from satellites...
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
they already have a bounty of 8 million woolongs on the culprit...
listen carefully, the bounty of 8 million is a conspiracy of the government.

no regrets about the woman who ran away but a small thorn still pricks the heart.
letting one flow along with time itself living all alone from that day to this.
my hormonal balance went out of whack, and this is what happened.
you're the second person to know vicious since i arrived here.
we have informed you of our decision that you cannot be our successor.
the syndicate does not need corpses with no will to fight.
we never had anything like that before when we were all alone.
all told, they screwed up our plans right to the end.
in the middle of the savanna with no means to treat the wound, the leg rots, and death approaches.
the man got onto the airplane that finally arrived and there he sees a land of pure white below him.
from now on, i will dictate all authority and symbolism of this syndicate.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
sitting in muddy water isn't such a bad life if it ends after the first time...
a lot of things have happened, but the next episode is the last.
the moment a new life is born a new star is born, and becomes the guardian star.
this star we stand on is someone's guardian star as well.
when you show fear, it will spring at you faster than light.
if you do not show fear, it will only gently look over you...
one day, the cat was a free cat, a stray cat.
he met a white female cat, and the two cats spent their days happily together.
one of them is a fake, because i lost it in an accident.
since then, i have been seeing the past in one eye, and the present in the other.
the real worth of treasures like this can't be determined from the outside.
you may be surprised at how much you can sell it for!
you didn't get that much noise when using the special replay features like still frame and slow motion.
because beta had high quality images users who were into good graphics supported it really heavily.
we fire a shot, and the one that runs is the one we want.
this is the first time i agree with you on something...
however, you have to maintain the ship at a certain angle.
too fareither way, and you'll be thrown out to the other end of the universe.
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
the wind keeps blowing, while my heart cannot heal all the tears in it.
how're all you 300,000 bounty hunters in the solar system doing?
it's time for bigshot, the show that brings you information about fugitives!
it's time for bigshot, the show that brings you information about fugitives!
so, you remember abdul hakim who chose a rather flashy way of turning himself in last week?
money makes the world go round but debt piles up before you know it.
i wandered through all reaches of space and there i met a cowboy.
the e-mail server is going down from the sheer number of complaints.
there is a movement out there to sue our company for damages...
you also said that the occasional rivalry between comrades would be good for us.
come on, did the reward amount make you lose your memory?
all of them infiltrated the toll booth deftly attached the hacking unit and in the exact moment that passing ships access the toll booth to pay the toll they steal the entire balance from the credit card.
furthermore, the unit automatically sent the money data that it just stole.
it immediately launders all the funds in a bank on europa making it impossible to track where it went...
all the culprits that were caught in the act have nothing in common.
the guy that i nabbed said that he was just following the instructions from a manual that he got through mail-order.
perhaps the other culprits are reading the same manual that he was?
you guys at the gate corporation should know what this means.
i mean, to put a bounty on a mastermind that we aren't even sure exists suggests that its someone you don't want the police to know about, no?
if we don't catch him, the situation will just get worse.
but why is a ghost from 50 years ago coming back now...?
i wonder what they were going to do with such a thing...
if there is no meaning to the content, maybe the pieces are the message...
in the cosmo-net chess tournaments, he dominated the champion's seat for decades.
he began work on the hyperspace gate control program when he was 30 and created the central control system that all gates use to this day.
i mean, why is he seeking revenge 50 years after the fact?
if we figure out where he is, we'll know for sure.
hey, you, quit playing games so much and help out a little...
ed, we want to figure out where a guy named hex is...
i had heard once that there was a place where all the scrapped remains of obsolete gates were gathered along with scrap metal and abandoned spaceships and that there were people that started living there.
why the hell do they want to live here of all places?
back then, hex was riled up for revenge, and planned this all out.
he made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later during the one moment that the gate program gets automatically updated.
because now you don't have to worry about the fundamental defect in the gates leaking out.
although, the price you paid was that we learned about that defect.
this time, he snagged a test animal from a research facility, and is on the loose.
the good news is that he's worth a whopping 8 million!
it's time for bigshot, the show that brings you information about fugitives!
so, you remember abdul hakim who chose a rather flashy way of turning himself in last week?
money makes the world go round but debt piles up before you know it.
i wandered through all reaches of space and there i met a cowboy.
and buildings that are needlessly tall to symbolize all of this!
i wanted to raise the question of how a true pioneer should be.

apparently, they were all caught in the act, but none were the mastermind.
then you don't get the reward unless you find that mastermind?
i feel sorry for all the guys who caught the culprits!
why the hell do these thugs that normally just rob convenience stores attack at the gates?
you're the one that started all this, saying that we should research this case on our own.
you also said that the occasional rivalry between comrades would be good for us.
in this case, all 20 cases were done the same way...
all of them infiltrated the toll booth deftly attached the hacking unit and in the exact moment that passing ships access the toll booth to pay the toll they steal the entire balance from the credit card.
furthermore, the unit automatically sent the money data that it just stole.
it immediately launders all the funds in a bank on europa making it impossible to track where it went...
the hacking unit that was placed on the gates was something that couldn't be made unless you knew about the gate system really well.
the mastermind's likely someone who has some connection to the gate corporation.
a programmer that had been dubbed a genius from his teens.
in the cosmo-net chess tournaments, he dominated the champion's seat for decades.
he made it so that this incident would happen 50 years later during the one moment that the gate program gets automatically updated.
even making those that physically commit the crime hold chess pieces to hint that it was his doing.
but when i discovered his location, he was already gone from this world...
are you sure you weren't the one that sent me this mail?
but your father sure was unlucky to be in an aerospace accident...
on the way to jupiter, there was a sudden fluctuation in hyperspace...
i didn't have any particular favours to repay to pao or this girl but i decided to help them for now.
there were too many things that made me suspicious to leave it alone.
one is the chi of earth, the energy that comes from a planet's surface.
and lastly chi of magnetism, the chi that organisms like ourselves produce.
that magnetic field and the magnetic field of the earth react to one another to create energy.
universal feng shui is a method that reads the energies of nature such as this to use them in everyday life.
however, universal feng shui has the power to make the bad into the good.
for example, if you were a feng shui master as powerful as my father...
it feels like i created more mysteries instead of solving them.
for now, i decided to check out this stone, which was our only clue.
it's absorbed the fluctuations in time and space and conceals a tremendous amount of energy.
i can only think of it as a plain old rock...
however, it's impossible for someone who knows important syndicate secrets to ever leave the group.
i'm sure pao was afraid that more bad things would happen to his family.
i sent you that mail because i wanted you to bring my daughter here...
so... you're trying to tell me that you used feng shui to bring us here?
they say that nobody who has seen his face has made it out alive...
even those lucky enough to escape'll be tracked down to the ends of the world and they always wind up dead.
but since their leader changed twoyears ago, their focus drastically changed.
there are only a few members, but now they're even worse than a lot of syndicates out there.
humans, with their culture have escaped from the great system of nature and are committing crimes that cannot be amended.
those that don't realize this are what you could call "bugs" in the nature system.
if the missile falls, there'll be nobody here that can pay the bounty!
so there's nothing to bitch about if we get rid ofthe missile, right?

londes which is said to copy the spirit from brain waves as digital data and upload that spirit data into the universal network.
they believe that doing this will make them exist as a soul without a body.
one day he suddenly had a vision from god and immersed himself in research to store the human spirit... as digital data.
he's been missing... he suddenly reappeared to form the electronic transcendence group scratch.
is not our body an existence all too small and weak for our spirits which found a way to swim through the vast network and live in the infinity of space?
too much time has passed by to lament that we were deeply in love.
there was a decryption program called crypt-breaker that was developed by sit three years ago.

i used to work in a shady place called the issp.
i'm sure the casino was to take attention away from... ... the large sum of money and to fool the cops...

the way things go, i say that even the hard-earned 5000 woolongs will disappear with your dream.

as for everything else, all data was lost back in that gate accident.
so i don't know who you are, or why you were put in cold-sleep...
they used to be a good group working on environmental preservation and the protection of endangered species.

the top-end stuff o fall the illegal eyedrops that the syndicate makes.
he took off with all of the drops, so the group is in a mess.
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
they already have a bounty of 8 million woolongs on the culprit...
about this incident-- apparently, a pretty old artificial satellite has been hacked into.
the investigation is taking longer than expected because the access code to that satellite has been long lost...
since the gate accident 50 years ago the people of earth have migrated underground as a result of the change in climate, namely moonrocks falling onto the planet.
to them, the 'spacenetwork' created by computers is necessary for them to stay in contact with those living in space.
i'll look at all the antennae that can transmit light signals one by one.
i'll ask around for info on any prominent hackers in the area.
i remembered those times and i tried to recreate at least the pictures...
i see, doodles like this were on earth long ago, too...
then make a direct connection to the satellite, and download mpu.
and when you do, don't use computer support for firing or flying.
the captured criminal was the ai program for a spy satellite that was launched before the earth was ruined.
according to government sources from back then, it supposedly would continue activity on its own even without commands from earth.
well, it was the perfect excuse for the cops to go on a hacker hunt.
but anyway, why did it start doodling on the earth with a laser all of a sudden?
"this bounty is only for when humans or other life-forms are the targets".

i may look like this, but i've been alive since the days when humans crawled only on the face of the earth.
it started on the day of the accidental explosion of the hyperspace gate.
the guys that took interest in me, and experimented on me, all died before me.
the end for this guy started when he snuck into the lab.
ten years ago, zebra and giraffe attempted to reclaim a certain facility,
but, a few days later, zebra ends up missing and giraffe finds himself blindfolded in a weird place he'd never seen before.
today, we'll discuss the mysterious land paintings that suddenly appeared in what was south america.
as usual, we have commentaries by a researcher of supernatural phenomena...
however, the land paintings were drawn by lasers coming from satellites...
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
the bounty of 8 million is a conspiracy of the government.
even if it was drawn by a laser, there is the possibility that aliens put a message into the brain of that hacker.
and back then on earth, there were many pictures like this, and i always looked at them...
i remembered those times and i tried to recreate at least the pictures...

"and when one is on an adventure, he dreams of home."
this is not a good time for me to leave the planet.
you know, and there's other reasons why this is a great decision.
i've always liked to travel to celtic lands like ireland or scotland.
i'm not only attracted by the scenery, but also by the relaxed relationship the people have to their legends and centers of cult worship.
but following the nazis germanic obsession, this has become a dark terrain overloaded with taboos - a subject for specialized academics and culture nerds only.
perhaps it was no coincidence that, while in ireland, i came across a book by the english historian goodrick-clarke ...
the topic began to fascinate me, and i started to investigate.
on reading books and magazines from the first 40 years of this century,
paintings by fidus hung in many living rooms and gave a fitting expression to people's longings.
people came together in small groups and sought mystical experiences out beyond the large cities.
he is one of those bright figures formed by germanic culture whenever it is driven to physical, mental and emotional despair.
he has been predestined by the germanic karma to lead the battle against the east and to save the world's germanic culture.
one of the greatest figures of light has found in him its reincarnation.
while reading sentences like that i was reminded of the present, the increasing interest in esoterics, mysticism and magic, the growing number of sects and psycho-groups,
to avoid attracting attention, she wore men's clothing and smoked cigarillos.
her straightforwardness helped her come in contact with native populations and spiritual teachers.
the person in question is helena blavatsky, a russian occultist, known as a charlatan by her critics and as an initiate by her followers.
her claim to have gone to tibet still remains unproven today.
yet her legends about mysterious monasteries and occult writings created a myth about the roof of the world which extends to the present-day esoteric scene.
while darwinism described to the west how humans evolved from apes,
hyperborea and atlantis, two empires celebrated by greeks, were realities, she said, with a highly developed people who had stepped down from heaven at the north pole as the shadows of the gods.
blavatsky saw the gigantic structures at stonehenge and on the easter islands as memories of atlantis enormous beings who fell victim to natural disasters after abusing their supernatural powers.
after long migrations to other regions of the world, some of the survivors passed on their magical knowledge and founded the so-called aryan race, she claimed in her important book, "the secret doctrine".
she founded the theosophical society in 1875 to investigate those ideas which also attracted racist esoterics.
the swastika in their seal was seen as a symbol of inpending spiritual renewal.
blavatsky was no forerunner of the nazis, but the ambiguity of her secret teachings, taken from myths and visions, was the source of widespread abuse.
obscure theories about former races of demigods became the fuel for conflict at a time when the breakdown of society's old order and hierarchies was causing uncertainty and fear among many people.
blavatsky's comments about the feeble-minded africans or the spiritual degeneration of the jews rounded off the picture.
while blavatsky was lingering in asia in 1870, a young austrian began making extensive trips through the austrian countryside.
he was also looking for spiritual roots at a time when society's old order was breaking down and the new order was not yet within reach.
the writer, guido von list, studied the traces of germanic mysticism in the forests of austria.
on his long and lonely excursions he dreamed of being caught up in the magic of castles, forests and cult worship.
the picture of a dropout who no longer felt touched by big city life and christianity and who sought the divine in the elements of nature.
for him, monumental boulders were old germanic shrines, the last relicts of a wotan religion which christianity had wiped out.
we know little about our ancestors places of cult worship, but racist esoterics projected a great deal into those dark realms.
list thought that nordic giants from atlantis had arranged the massive boulders hundreds of thousands of years ago to make certain areas holy.
he spent entire nights at those places, and after several bottles of red wine he'd listen to the voices of gods in the trees.
he wrote books about it which impressed young hitler, who later suggested similar book guides for german places of cult worship.
list usually went on his excursions alone, but one time his friends accompanied him.
at the ruins of carnuntum, they wanted to celebrate the solstice by commemorating the battle in 400 a.d.
they consecrate the site to a place of resistance against the age-long domination of germania by roman legions and christian missionaries.
following an eye operation, list couldn't see for 11 months and lived in the semi-conscious state of a hallucinatory inner world.
at that time, he claimed to have grasped the mystical meaning of the runes and published his findings which were to have a great influence on racists.
for him, they symbolized insight into the invisible powers of nature.
in which the word runa is used for the greek mysterion - secret, so we have a change in meaning.
of course, we don't know which meaning is older, or if there were two similar sounding words with different meanings.
you can examine the inscriptions we've had in rune letters since the second century: "what do they say?"
we find the writer's personal data, the name of the owner, sometimes a link to death-related magic, something about their customs and about their way of life.
and they describe a way of life where gods play a role and natural phenomena like ice and hail or human worries and joys, necessity, happiness and bliss and the forces of nature like the sun, ice and hail ...
despite their arbitrariness, list's occult interpretations had a big influence at the beginning of this century.
stimulated by blavatsky, he saw it as ancient memories of the origin of the aryan race from the north.
he saw the battles between giants and dwarves described in those legends as real wars between higher and lower races.
numerous illustrious people in vienna were members, including the anti-semitic mayor karl lueger, later a model for young hitler.
world war i was welcomed as an act of spiritual purification from supposed decadence.
once more shall our armies march south- and westward to put things in order again.
parallel to list, there was another man who later became his companion, an austrian mystic who strongly influenced hitler's ideas.
he regarded their traditions as the continuation of the legendary templars.
in the quiet cloisters and gardens, he dreamed of medieval knights and noble heroes who fought for good and justice.
one day a memorial slab was found with a strange relief on the back side.
lanz later compared the sight of that picture with an inspiration.
he interpreted the man standing on a mythological animal as a temple knight who was fighting off the threat of an inferior race.
such races were created when nordic god-men had intercourse with animals.
they were the predecessors of the dark people in the south who couldn't wait to breed the white aryan downhill.
where do myths expand our thinking, and where do they bury it?
lanz reduced the ambiguity of pictures to one arbitrary meaning, a shallow interpretation of mythology as was common during the time before the 3rd reich.
he took on a title of nobility and left the monastery in order to found a religious order and the magazine ostara which was to inform people about his racial studies.
the holy grail as the mystery of the aryan-christian race cult religion.
his connections to rich industrialists in vienna enabled him to buy a castle on the danube which was converted into the new templar order place of worship.
a so-called grail room was reserved for special rituals of the inner circle.
in songs, they called upon god to annihilate the inferior races.
even the swedish writer august strindberg took part in such rituals.
he strove for similar goals, and, following an emotional crisis, he sought security in that religious sect.
you will experience his victory, which will be our victory, too, and it will unleash a movement that will shake the world.
beginning in 1909, hitler lived in a shelter in vienna where he began reading the ostara writings.
they confirmed his own ideas and showed him a mythological empire of nordic heroes who empassioned his youthful zeal.
as a child, he had devoured the heroic german legends, and in vienna, the 20-year-old rarely missed a wagnerian opera performance.
he fled from that reality into a dream world of the past.
in the hofburg, the treasures of the habsburg's reminded him of a magnificent tradition, thus kindling his imagination that longed for a rebirth of the german empire.
in 1916, sebottendorff came upon the ad of a so-called germanic order which adopted one of moses warnings to the jews as their own program:
the lord will send out a people against you, from faraway, from the end of the world, from midnight, a strong, large, powerful people that was the first people,
sebottendorff joined the germanic order and formed the munich lodge into the so-called thule society in 1918 which met in the four seasons hotel and included several influential members.
thule dates back to a report by the greek seafarer pytheas of marseille who claimed to have discovered a society of that name near iceland in 340 b.c.
sebottendorff, an eager reader of list's and lanz's writings, believed that the remnants of the megalithic peoples corresponded to thule and were evidence of the early existence of a superior nordic race.
6,000 years ago, when india, egypt and mesopotamia were still in darkness, our ancestors measured the stars with stone circles at stonehenge and udry and determined the years and the celebrations.
the wittelsbacher were overthrown without any bloodshed, and king ludwig iii was exiled together with his family.
so-called worker and soldier councils were established, and a temporary national council was formed with eisner as the governor.
in a vehement speech, sebottendorff appealed to the thule to fight.
yesterday we witnessed the collapse of everything we value and cherish.
the attempt to kidnap eisner failed, but a vigilante group, the thule force, was armed to overthrow the detested council government by fighting in the streets.
even young rudoif heß, who became hitler's deputy, enthusiastically joined in the fighting.
hitler was only a guest at thule and probably listened to a few lectures.
in 1920, he founded the nazi party from a branch of the thule society.
eckart belittled judaism as a religion only concerned with this world, a religion that didn't believe in life after death, one that devoted itself to all earthly and material goods, a conception that knew nothing of the jews age-old mystical tradition.
hitler's sketches from that time show how he derived the final emblem for his party from supposed runes.
he changed the rounded sign of the thule society to a square swastika by viewing an ancient germanic symbol as the sun's rise from night and darkness.
nordic legends and symbols triggered racist fantasies during that restless time.
long before 1933, spiritual preparations had been made for the coming of a messianic leader who would defend the aryan light against the jewish-bolshevist darkness.
it's still impossible to explain today how the nazis succeeded in stirring up such enthusiasm among the masses.
the rest of the world remained idle and, to an extent, even admired that strange country where suddenly symbols, cult celebrations and storms of enthusiasm sprang up and could not be explained with traditional political explanations.
the nazis used big mythological pictures and appealed to archaic levels of the subconscious.
a newspaper article about the 1937 reich party convention described a ritual of an almost religious nature.
as adolf hitler enters zeppelin field, 150 air force lights are turned on.
there must be 140,000 people who can't break away from that sight.
the song of oath rises in the endless beam of light.
if the humanists had created more impressive pictures, the nazis would never have come to power.
a society that doesn't take archetypes, myths and symbols seriously will possibly be jumped by jumped by them from behind.
on looking into the nighttime sky, he saw dozens of blinded birds which had been caught in the focal point of the huge floodlights and were unable to free themselves.
a touch of physical truth amidst all that suggestion of majesty.
that creation of light in nuremberg was later supposed to be formed in real stone.
the third reich's architectural concept was to erect monumental buildings which by right of their size alone could claim to be eternal.
the individual should be absorbed by the atmosphere of holy places, temples of death and halls of prayer which served to transfigure an exalted worship of ancestors.
hitler's architect albert speer was told to use granite for every building and to even make sketches of their future ruins.
a huge 220-meter-high dome was planned for berlin which would hold 180,000 people,
a sacred cult monument glorifying the nordic race which, to hitler, was the oldest and most majestic race in the world.
he saw the aryans origin in ancient and advanced cultures that had collapsed and now lived on only in myths and legends.
the gigantic buildings were to recall the huge god-men of atlantis or thule who hitler secretly believed in just like list, lanz or sebottendorff.
similar convictions were held by alfred rosenberg, the nazis chief ideologist who came from the thule society and wrote about atlantis as the ancient home of the germans.
also by heinrich himmler, who had been interested in mythology and esoterics since his adolescence.
the head of the ss founded his own research institute in 1935, ancestral heritage, to prove that the first spiritual impulses of mankind didn't come from the orient but from the north.
for the film germans versus pharoahs they reconstructed complicated models of stonehenge in order to show how far advanced the technology and astronomy of the nordic races was in ancient times.
the purpose of this construction for the culture of the ancient nordic people is of special value.
far beyond its design as the tomb of a nordic king, it is also a place of cult worship, a calendar and an astronomical observatory.
after the long winter nights, the sun, the origin of all earthly existence, rose behind the milestone far to the southeast.
then the scholarly astronomer-priest proclaimed to his nordic people the rebirth of the sun.
when the sun rose on its annual journey beyond the large milestone in the lane and cast its light on the altar stone, he proclaimed the time of midsummer, the climax of the year with ist profound meaning for all of life.
hermann wirth, one of the co-founders of ancestral heritage, regarded the builders of stonehenge to be descendants of legendary atlantis, thought to have existed in the north thousands of years ago.
to him, the swedish rock paintings at bohuslän stemmed from that epoch, and he investigated them.
he interpreted them as religious documents of the world's oldest race that carried the first cultural impulses throughout the world by ship.
instead of approaching these impressive remnants of the bronze age realistically
wirth abused them for the megalomaniac and patriotic goals of the third reich.
the same goes for karl maria wiligut, one of the most baffling figures within the ss.
as one of himmler's close advisors, he had his own department which dealt with mythological and esoteric questions.
wiligut believed he stemmed from an ancient gothic clan, the viligots, and that he possessed the so-called hereditary memory which enabled him to plunge into the long history of the nordic races like a clairvoyant.
his grandfather had given him special occult training in reviving hidden memory levels of his subconscious.
he actually went on trips for the ss to document the missing pieces of an age-old germanic religion
which he believed to recognize in stone sculptures, runic inscriptions and places of cult worship.
in southern german massifs, he believed he had found ancient fortifications from the days of atlantis, and saw it as proof of the superior stone masonry of our nordic ancestors.
certainly there were traces of a pre-christian faith in germany in churches, places of cult worship, fairy tales and legends, but the nazis arrogance has hindered people from dealing with those topics.
himmler thought that traces of atlantis could be found in tibet and peru, because the survivors of the great floods had fled to the high plateaus there.
an ss expedition in 1939 was supposed to substantiate those theories, but the earnest scientist in charge, ernst schäfer, denied that intention.
yet he took a race specialist along to check if there were any traces of ancient nordic immigrants.
size of feet, length of arm and hand, eye and skin color:
it's a big moment for everyone involved when the mask is finally removed.
piece by piece our collection of upper asian racial types developed.
himmler's ideas about the origin of the aryan race in atlantis were also influenced by guido von list and lanz von liebenfels.
wiligut's view of the world showed similarities to those of von list whom he knew personally,
while richard anders, another ss esoteric, was a member of lanz's new templar order.
at germanic places of cult worship anders photographed so-called stone sculptures in which he saw heads of animals or humans: relicts of an allegedly ancient religion from which every other culture was said to have stemmed.
those allegedly ancient monuments were supposed to remind germany that it was being summoned to take over the earth's spiritual leadership again.
the ss focused its main research on the extern steine in the teutoburger wood.
the ss carried out excavations in the thirties to prove the existence of a germanic shrine, but their efforts were in vain.
despite the missing archeological evidence, they claimed that in ancient times a nordic sun cult had existed there.
a gallows is more likely, because the extern rocks were used for executions during the middle ages.
a chamber at the top was thought to have been used for the summer solstice, because the sun appears there behind a round opening on june 21st.
but the masonry technique used for the altar was unknown to germanic tribes and indicates that it was made by early christian cults.
the same goes for the medieval relief of the descent from the cross.
neo-heathens see the bent world ash as a sign of the christian victory over wotan's religion.
the extern steine continue to draw a large spectrum of people who want to experience germanic mysticism despite the missing evidence.
every year on june 21st, neo-heathens, post-hippies, esoterics and right-wingers gather to celebrate summer solstice.
following heated disputes, the right-wingers have withdrawn and now celebrate in secret.
that's why i see it as a big problem to work with runes here or to deal with germanic myths and rituals in general because of the way the nazis abused them.
it's difficult to get through all that to use the runes differently.
who cares if there's no proof that this was a germanic place of worship.
young people who are not attracted to christianity dream their way back to a heathen world in primeval times and satisfy their longing for mysticism, ecstasy and community.
instead of looking for real knowledge about germanic religious practices, people have transformed this place into a legend itself by projecting all of their own wishes into it.
they prefer the appeal of a nebulous and dreamy state than to consciously examine the archaic picture world of the past.
himmler not only believed that places of cult worship harbored ancestral traces.
he also saw himself as the incarnation of king heinrich i, who protected the germanic people from the eastern threat 1,000 years ago.
quedlinburg cathedral, where he was buried in 936, was seen as one of the black order's main places of cult worship, as well.
the ss took over the church, removed the altar and the pews and proclaimed it to be a holy place of the nazis.
every year the date of the king's death was celebrated with lavish performances attended by prominent nazis.
the deceased was praised as a hero, a true germanic personality.
himmler claimed that the king appeared to him when he was asleep and gave him advice for his difficult mission.
after the official celebration, the ss reichsführer locked himself in the crypt at midnight to commune with his former incarnation.
such holy places were used to place the ss in a long line of ancestors who would give every individual member confidence and strength.
the saxony grove in verden on the aller served a similar purpose:
as a memorial to the 4,500 germanic chieftains who charlemagne had executed,
himmler had the same number of boulders grouped to a circular walk.
himmler consecrated the grounds at a nocturnal celebration in june 1935 and declared the place to be an ss training center.
accompanied by old germanic trumpets copied from the originals, a large bonfire was lit, and everyone sang rise up, flames.
the ancestral souls were sensed in the fire, eternal and indestructible, the spirit from which they had come and to which they would return.
the connection to ancient traditions was supported by archaic signs and symbols.
for that purpose, they fell back on old germanic runes and utilized their aura of strength and secrecy.
himmler saw them as the world's oldest form of letters and made them a part of the ss's ideological training.
a rune ring, oswald pohl sent his son on his 18th birthday shows how high-ranking ss generals were affected by this:
my son, in this magnificent german spring initiated by our führer adolf hitler, the buried source of a germanic spirit, a germanic view of life is opening its blossoms.
karl maria wiligut designed the skull ring to honor certain ss members.
the meaning of the four rune symbols stem from guido von list:
the skull itself symbolized the annihilation of the individual will for the cause of a higher mission.
after himmler discovered in 1939 that wiligut had been treated in a mental hospital for delusions, he had to dismiss him from the ss.
privately, however, he stayed in contact with him continuing to ask his advice regarding mythological questions.
during the war they corresponded about which rune was best suited for ss graves to express the homeward journey of the dead soldiers on their way to the germanic heaven.
besides atlantis, places of cult worship and runes, himmler also converted the legend of the holy grail to prove aryan superiority.
for that purpose in 1936, he got a man to join the ss who had done research on that topic for years.
young otto rahn had sought the castle of the grail in the pyrenees, the castle mentioned by wolfram von eschenbach in his parzival.
certain geographical hints led him to suspect it in montségur's ruins.
it was the final refuge of the cathars, a heretical sect that was wiped out by the inquisition.
rahn saw them as the round table of the holy grail, a counter-movement to the roman church which had formed from celtic traditions.
the cathars had hidden from their pursers in the caves of the pyrenees.
rahn examined the caves, looking for lost symbols and esoteric documents.
rahn was fascinated by their high-lying fortresses which, to him, were an expression of the cult's extreme belief in purity:
the idea of living as close to god as possible, high above the lowly spheres.
according to wolfram von eschenbach, this was a stone of light which once fell upon the earth from heavenly spheres.
around it a choice band of knights drew strength from its light to wage the battle against evil.
rahn was only devoted to one person in the ss, and that was himmler.
himmler had taken him into his own personal staff which partly consisted of nut-cases, weirdos and a few intelligent people.
but when his homosexuality became known in the ss, his life took a tragic turn:
denunciations and intrigues began to put a strain on him and his work.
in order to toughen him up, he was sent to be a guard at dachau and buchenwald which emotionally shattered him.
he requested to be dismissed from the ss, and himmler consented.
after that he began a journey to the south, seemingly on the run.
physically emaciated, emotionally exhausted and afraid of ss persecution, he fled to the mountainous landscape of tirol.
during a snowstorm in the mountains, ss obersturmführer otto rahn lost his life in a tragic accident.
we mourn the death of a respectable ss man and the author of excellent historical works.
a college of leadership was planned for ss officers with courses in history, mythology, archaeology and art.
the library contained about 16,000 books, magazines and old manuscripts dealing with those topics.
high-ranking ss generals had their own studies decorated with runes and with names like king arthur, widukind, or henry the lion.
occasionally conferences took place like the one in june 1941 when himmler announced the necessary decimation of the slavs by 30 million.
two cult rooms built by prisoners of the concentration camp were designed to foster the spirit of the order in a fitting atmosphere, for example, the obergruppenführer hall that was framed by 12 pillars.
a sun wheel in the middle of the floor with 12 spokes:
in those publications, the black sun symbolizes the pure light of the north and the superior knowledge of thule which europe should call to mind in times of decadence and materialism in order to draw strength from its origins.
directly under the obergruppenführer hall is the crypt, a vaulted, tomb-like room designed for cult celebrations.
the atmosphere is reminiscent of rituals to eliminate the individual personality in which a man becomes an empty vessel for ecstatic feelings of superiority.
this room also attracts occult right-wing groups who sometimes break in at night to perform mystical rituals.
on christmas day, 1992, we saw the room had been broken into,
and white cloths with printed runes were lying on the 12 rostrums.
we never found out who actually did that, but we know from our contact to visitors and groups that the tower is known as a place where people like to hold black masses or similar ceremonies, and they keep trying to persuade our doorkeeper to give them the key
or to let them into that room at unusual times for all kinds of reasons.
we really have to develop an attitude in order to prevent things like that.
one group actually wrote, yes, we celebrated a black baptism, an intiation ceremony into our order.
models show to what extent the building complex was to be expanded.
surrounding the cult rooms, the so-called center of the earth, huge building complexes were going to be erected which would extend the sun's rays in every direction.
the villages below the castle were to be evacuated, in order to flood the entire valley.
was it to create a clear view to the north, to the ancient home of atlantis where, according to himmler, aryan beings had stepped on the earth to overtake a special mission.
the director of the ancestral heritage wolfram sievers, was sentenced to death in nuremberg for his part in the experiments.
shortly before his execution, he cited once again the greater mission which the ss had to carry out,
i ve always wanted to die for the empire of the heavenly.
there is no guilt, no matter how great it is, that can go through the timeless time of fire without being completely atoned.
didn't the nazis abuse of mythology perhaps do more damage than we're aware of at first glance?
the third reich offered a substitute religion at a time of a spiritual void,
prosperity and technology, music and movies from other countries dream factories.
they banned their own myths and traditions to a realm of shades, and they thought they were free of them.
the nazis megalomania has placed a taboo on germany's great feelings, ideals and visions which still exists today, but people seem to need more than just filled refrigerators and cold logic.
a new search has begun for salvation, spiritual leaders and inspiration.

my father spent is life in a wheel chair because of a car accident.
i would have teach you to steal bikes you wouldn't have turned that bad!
life is like that, you dream about so many things when you are kid, finally nothing goes as planned.
if they cross any of these diagonals they are caught like rats.
they take the michelet boulevard, they going to end up on place mazard.
we are going to change the way we see the road.
we are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern.
because we don't give a damn about the sponsors on the car.
ok then, take out the champagne out of the freeze it's not good too cold.
and now to celebrate daniel's departure i announce the big parade!

they aren't all drunk at 6 in the morning, beating on innocent people.
some of them do their jobs, just like you... and like me.

you just quit, did you already find a new job during the night?
of course not, it's a meeting for my future job a meeting i had to arrange months in advance.
watch this: 2 cops at the red light up the avenue.
lights change and i'm away and gone before they even shifted gear!
i will not allow the tutons to conquer our territory again!
my grandpa died at their hands, so this is a personnal matter.
you're german... right, but you're also a cop so that's ok.
and they even got the chutzpah to inform the cities they'll hit in advance!
you're gonna move that car, asshole or do you need the keys?
we are the "grass snakes", meaning that we're small and cool.
you see i'm at 100 a good car with a good driver, there's no risk!
i'm less dangerous at 100 then that piece of shit at 20 km/h...
do you know anybody that would want to become a taxi driver?
those bastards, who only pick you up when they feel like it?
who scream at you when you're out of change and can't leave a tip?
spend all day boozing in the bars, bitching and moaning about everything they're in bed with the cops to screw other people and when they're married to a landlord, there's a disaster just waiting to happen!
hey hey slow down, i'm allowed to enjoy this a bit!
usually i'm the one who gets screamed at, so now that for once i'm lucky...
they look worn out, so they will need to change them soon.
on this picture, the muffler is a little bent but not on this one.
they must have bent it during an attack and got it repaired after wards.
krueger is the only guy in marseille that can repair those.
we begin the phase that takes up 90% of a cop's life observation.
we get acquainted with the area, we survey the entries and exits and analyse the situation.
i hope you plan is fool proof emilien 'cause this is your last bullet.
you're the one with that bullet so do me a favor... don't miss!
if they did repaint the car we would have found paint traces somewhere.
except if they put their car in a truck and repainted it in there.
but a tourist that doesn't get screwed is not really a tourist, no?
hey, if i'm already behind you again after the first lap, don't drive the second lap for nothing, honey!
now you walk over there, bend her back and give her the kiss she wants!
either you get slapped or she's hooked for the next 10 years.

how could i tell him i wanted to be a race pilot?
i could've taught you to steal bikes, you wouldn't have turned bad!
you dream about so many things when you're a kid but in the end nothing goes as planned.
ok, these are the seven raids... i'm more ferrari than mercedes.
this the mercedes gang, i'll let you know if they change.
now we're so close, we'll say that all this... the trash cans and so on, never happened.
if you let go of my hand, can i go home and rest?
he follows the reverse human evolution that starts on all fours, and finishes on its 2 wheels !
i want him to know he was the best of all of us, and most of all, a very good friend.
are you sure it's okay after all these years of friendship?
we prepared the ground well, it's time to build on it.
you just stopped working last night, you didn't find a job during the night, did you?
no, it's for my future job a kind of meeting i booked a long time ago.
i love driving, but you probably didn't have time to see it!
my son is taking his driving exam for the 8th time.
because if we're going to miss it maybe we should take our time.
it'll be ok, we're going slow now, but on the highway we'll speed up.
you're a good mechanic, you drive well and i need a driver.
3 good reasons to hire you as an assistant for 1 month.
also they have 8" so they had to do that in germany 'cause you can't find that in france.
the tires are quite worn, they'll need to order some soon.
in this picture, the muffler is a little bent but not on this one.
they must have bent it during an attack and repaired it afterwards.
it's not a matter of being a cop, it's just common sense, shit!
we're here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!
the mercedes gang will be nailed tonight, or my name isn't emilien barbadec.
i hope your plan is foolproof 'cause this is your last chance.
-my husband smoked a lot, but he died of liver cancer, we never knew why, he didn't drink.
the apartment is nothing, the worst is that i messed up again.
-there's nothing to explain mom i'm finished, i'm in the street.
it's over, but it started so well... but then came the garbage bin, the butcher, the mercedes...
and i don't want to waste an hour because the schedule is very tight.
i'm caught in a tight spot and when i say caught i mean seriously.
i said 55 because i had a good conscience not to take more.
but a tourist that doesn't get robbed is not really a tourist, right?
tell me, why didn't you race directly instead of doing it with a taxi?
my father spent his life in a wheelchair because of a car accident.
i would have taught you to steal bikes and you wouldn't have turned out so bad!
life's like that, you dream about so many things when you're a kid and in the end nothing goes as planned.
we are going to change the way we see the road.
we are going to implement a police force more efficient and modern.
i had two cops on my ass earlier, you should've seen how they bit the dust!
watch this: 2 cops at the red light up the avenue.
so guys, after hitting banks in the netherlands, italy and belgium the "mercedes gang" just arrived in france.
i will not allow the tutons to conquer our territory again!
well then, you work for ibm and they leave us alone.
but i get to fix all the toys from the neighborhood!
those bastards, who only pick you up when they feel like it?
who scream at you when you're out of change and can't leave a tip?
so please, just cut the crap and finish me off quickly, ok?
hey hey slow down, i'm allowed to enjoy this a bit!
their 8" tires were ordered from germany 'cause you can't find those here.
they look worn out, so they will need to change them soon.
on this picture, the muffler is a little bent but not on this one.
they must have bent it during an attack and got it repaired after wards.
we get acquainted with the area, we survey the entries and exits and analyse the situation.
and at closing time, we'll go ask mr. krueger a few questions.
but you don't have to be a cop for that, it's just common sense, damned!
we are here like 2 idiots waiting for an insomniac to go to sleep!
i hope you plan is fool proof emilien 'cause this is your last bullet.
you're the one with that bullet so do me a favor... don't miss!
there's nothing to explain, mom i'm done, i'm in the street...
it had started so well, though but then came the garbage cans, the butchers, the mercedes...
look at his face, it reminds me of "silence of the lambs".
you take care of mata hari and me of the smurf.
a small coffee to change the mood and to say i'm sorry.
i know you don't really want to talk to me anymore but listen up please.
except if they put their car in a truck and repainted it in there.
they need tons of paint if they do that every time!
i said 55 because i don't want to steal more from you.
but a tourist that doesn't get screwed is not really a tourist, no?
it's not that i'm bored but i gotta go to the garage.
i don't know what's wrong, but my car is a bit slow today...
tell me, why didn't you go to races instead of doing it with a taxi?
my father spent his life in a wheel chair because of a car crash.
and there's not supposed to be much water, but my dad keeps on watering the lawn anyway.
well, i guess that's the most exciting thing happening around here.
i mean, he says he lives there, but the place still looks empty.
anyway, when you get back from camp, maybe you can meet him and tell me what you think.
[ hannah ] dear kate, so this guy, the one who just moved in, there's definitely something weird about him.
what i really wanna do is go check out his house.
well, i just wanted to say that i'm sorry i thought you were a ghost.
it's just i got this story off the internet about our street, and about this big house fire.
the key to the front door also works here for the service entrance.
i'm going to take the key from emily's purse before i leave...
until we traced a phone call he made the night you were attacked.
the trace led us to an automated quote system at his office.
it lasted from five minutes before ten to nine minutes after.
that has to be one of the cleaner alibis i've come across.
when i saw the body, i was sure it was him.
no doors had been forced open, so i assumed that he had your key.
we felt maybe he shouldn 't resort to violence with his wife.
he's been able to talk himself out of everything all along.
the reason we decided to stay with the ending we have now is:
both endings tested highly but the ending we have now gave gwyneth a more moral base.
she did not demean herself by acting in a heinous way like the men who she had been a part of.
there was a greater feeling of warmth towards her at the end by her being justified and doing what she did because of her husband's attack.
instead of him throwing her around michael says, "the only way you'll leave me is dead. "
before he has a chance to blink she shoots him cold in the kitchen.
he looks up and says "you'll never get away with it. "
she looks up at the pots and pans above her tips her head back and whacks her head against the countertop.

there was always one piece left 1ike a screw that didn't fit.
he called me here two months ago bragged about how you'd fallen for him.
i've shelled out over $100,000 already but he wants a lot more.
i searched his pockets, i found what i thought was your key i grabbed a screwdriver, jimmied the door.
i put it in his pocket, took what i thought was your key and put it on your key chain.
and yet there was something about the smartness of this movie and the character of michael.
we felt maybe he shouldn't resort to violence with his wife.
he's been able to talk himself out of everything all along.
so we tried an ending where, basically gwyneth questions him about the key, leaves the apartment and michael goes to the back door to retrieve the key.
he picks up the phone, and the same scene that we have now is played in the kitchen, where she confronts him.
the reason we decided to stay with the ending we have now is:

i appreciate your curiosity, but my agenda doesn't really concern you.
i guess i'll just go straight to emily and tell her all of this.

why don't you come by the apartment around 1 2 o'clock tomorrow unless you have a previous luncheon engagement.

i hate to break it to you, but a fast car can be a real turn-on.
you can't stand the idea that if a girl is choosing between guys she might not choose the one who woos her with flowers and poems.
she might choose the guy with the faster car or the bigger bicep or the bigger joystick.

if you look closely, there's subtle differences between all of them.
well, this one's so perky and petite, it's got to be mine.
you will spend the afternoon arranging the cards in alphabetical order and putting them back into that drawer.
if even one card is out of order at 5:00 you will all spend next saturday with me here in detention.
i mean, this school's not exactly welcoming me with open arms.
it feels like everybody here hates me, and i don't know why.
and how i've met this great guy who's so romantic and so caring, and who i like and who i want so much.
dawson, it's because of you that i get through the bad days.
if i said that i never thought about having sex with you, i'd be lying.
because the thought crosses my mind about 1 000 times a day.
a girl has to decide between two guys, so they drag race?
she agrees to go out with whoever has the fastest car?
if someone has a terminal illness, if they're in terrible pain if it's just a matter of time....
don't you think there comes a point when life is no longer worth living?
you're all required to stay here in the library till 5:00.
you should ask yourself, "what have i done to get detention?
i have some important work to do in the audio-visual room.
if for any reason i have to come out here and discipline you you will spend the day shelving books and sorting library cards.
i mean, grant bodean is, like, the king of the school and a total fox.
why did they put me in here with all you violent offenders?
you and i can go down to the boys' locker room and--
if i had any, i wouldn't waste it on rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
so do you think you can stop throwing basketballs at my face, dawson?
it's glaringly obvious that i'm no don juan about to steal your girlfriend.
you know, sometimes it feels like my whole life here is just one great big detention that i can't escape but then i think about you.
and how i've met this great guy who's so romantic and so caring, and who i like and who i want so much.
dawson, it's because of you that i get through the bad days.
and if you think that i want you to be some varsity sex stud, you're crazy.
if you're worried that everyone's more experienced than you, rest easy.
you have one friend who will go to her grave a virgin.
she agrees to go out with whoever has the fastest car?
i hate to break it to you, but a fast car can be a real turn-on.
you can't stand the idea that if a girl is choosing between guys she might not choose the one who woos her with flowers and poems.
she might choose the guy with the faster car or the bigger bicep or the bigger joystick.
if someone has a terminal illness, if they're in terrible pain if it's just a matter of time...
don't you think there comes a point when life is no longer worth living?
the movie where the kids are stuck in detention all day.
at first they hate each other, and then they become good friends.
you and i can go down to the boys' locker room and...
if i had any, i wouldn't waste it on rudolph the red-nosed reindeer.
if you look closely, there's subtle differences between all of them.
well, this one's so perky and petite, it's got to be mine.
you will spend the afternoon arranging the cards in alphabetical order and putting them back into that drawer.
if even one card is out of order at 5:00 you will all spend next saturday with me here in detention.
i mean, this school's not exactly welcoming me with open arms.
it feels like everybody here hates me, and i don't know why.
and how i've met this great guy who's so romantic and so caring, and who i like and who i want so much.
dawson, it's because of you that i get through the bad days.
if i said that i never thought about having sex with you, i'd be lying.
because the thought crosses my mind about 1 000 times a day.
suppose you ask the time... to a girl standing at the bus-stop.
even if she's aishwarya rai... she'll have to tell the time, right?
karthik, instead of coming to see you... had he seen a plastic surgeon, he'd have turned a bit human.
now the doctor has hung his hand on to his neck.
- you just can't swallow the fact... that i'm dating a beauty, isn't it?
but don't worry, i'll ask my flame... to introduce you to some girls of your class.
that you've been carrying on with her since last six months... was a nice cock-and-bull.
look boy, at just one glance... we can tell a girl, whether she can be just a friend, or more.
just to teach them a lesson, i lied to them that she's my flame.
if they find out the truth, they're going to make me pay for it.
you said that, when it comes to girls we are cheap, didn't you?
we know how cheap we can get to break your friendship.
like you guys, i don't have a great personality and a shapely body.
though god gave us different bodies, he gave us the same sentiments.
from loving nature to befriending women... all that you desire for, even i desire.
i don't get along with girls, because people like you... instilled in me an inferiority complex.
i've been in this city for months, yet even today... if someone screams "gorilla", i tend to look at that person.
because, from my brother to my school teacher, everyone called me gorilla.
even during the speech therapy, i thought... of giving up the acting, but i was scared that i might gradually... lose her and her sympathies, which is why i'm still playing dumb to her.
no one can give me the happiness that i get while playing dumb to her.
if someone did, they couldn't bear with me for long and dumped me.
but this lady understood my problems, she gave me money to set up shop.
look, it'd have been different if you were just flirting, like us.
but if you're truly in love with her, you'll have to tell her the truth.
it feels great to bathe in the rains in a tropical country like india.
besides, i'm happy to know that you like the rains too.
the other day it was the beggar, now it's this rascal.
henceforth, know a person genuinely before you make friends with him.
"she's as luring as chilli-chicken, and her lips painted in alluring pink"
"she's married three times, and it's a secret that i'm one of them"
he can't talk, but on your birthday... he has made the entire town talk.
if you take a liking for someone, you get to know everything about her.
on a full moon night, the temple on the sea shore looks so magnificent
i knew you were a great artist... but i never imagined you to be such a fine poet.
when i sketched for the first time at the age of five... even my mother abused me for scratching the walls.
in school, my teacher snubbed me saying that it won't earn me a living
i'm not deterring you because you refused to marry my son.
but i think it isn't love, it is a feeling of empathy towards nataraj.
in that case, i'd have helped him in some way, and walked out of his life.
but, why do i feel like i need him by my side forever?
once he lied to me about having studied in the college of ads.
but he couldn't put up with the lie, he came and told me the truth.
for my desire to end up in america, i pretended to be very nice to you.
but nataraj isn't like me, he's as straight as an arrow.
i don't want to sacrifice my vocal chord to bring shweta into my life.
my sacrifice is to atone for betraying her trust in me.
for love's sake, these men endure agony only for such a shod span.
for the first time in my life, i see a man... who is prepared to live his entire life in agony, for love's sake.
you check a patient's body, how can you feel a person's heart?
you must've found love very easily, but you never understood my love.
your dad respects me as father and as head of the family.
"so, i locked all my desires " in a locker in syndicate bank.
"when he was on his way," l only took him with me.
"who is he, where are his parents," "when i think of his condition, .."
but how far it is justified to think of loving you?
if i'm the cause of your "imagination, please forgive me. "
- lt is not fair if you search for her now.
"lf she treats you as friend," she will come to your house.
"as far as i'm concerned, youth" is not meant only for love.
it the precious time to decide what we are going achieve in future.
with a fear that daddy "may scold if he knows, .. "
".. forgetting that he removed dress," he came out to search for soap box.
"what's after all education, balu?" every man has a special talent.
"lf we can identify it, we almost " achieve the goal of our life.
it is fearful even to think of "like that, isn't it? "
"l thought of it, brother. lf anu " "rejects you for some reason, .. "
"by the way, where are your friends?" no one is seen.
"today is saturday, isn't it?" everybody might have gone to disco.
"why because, every moment i live" is nothing but your boon.
i feel sad as you do not have any companion though you care for others.
he choicest way of life will make her happier then my love.
were you mad after her so far only to say this?
why do you guys always shoot in the middle of nowhere?
so we can blow things up and no one will care.
and that stuff about the feds moving' in, that's crap too, huh?
you got a lot of big ideas, man, but you're not taking care of business.
she's been sick as a dog all week, as a matter of fact.
we're on our way now to lewisville to see a doctor.
i mean, i don't even have the right to my own life.
didn't you ever think that she might have just been looking out for you?
in a car which might have been stolen in fredrikstad three days earlier.
until someone finds some bloody good proof and sticks it up my arse...
yeah, most of these guys come in just looking to learn... a few good moves and then take off.
we need fighters that will dedicate, that have the will to win.
i'm not sure if siro would have gone that route if... if things had been different between us.
i had no idea he was carrying all this around inside him.
okay, all right, look, i don't know what you've gotten yourself into, okay?
but let's just stay here and we'll talk... and you'll explain everything and then i'll decide.
neither one of us has to break their neck to get a quick glance, an approving nod.
no one is going to pit us against each other... to see which one is more like him.
"i'm starting a new act without him, so he needs a good home.
"please take care of him and give him lots of love.
if i don't, she says she'll hurt mom and dad and you.
and when she saw slappy at the show, she fell in love with him.
eric, say that your job was sent to a plant in guatela-who-the-hell-cares.
now, are you gonna vote for the guy that let that happen?
why don't you and your friend head up to your room?
now, the most important part of our presidential rally... is the townspeople "q" and "a" section.
this is where normal folks step up to the microphone... and ask the president questions.
now, the important thing is to choose the right person, you know.
don't get me wrong, i'm completely pro-nudity... but i think my dad might kill me, and i'm anti-being killed.
if there wasn't some huge downside to doing something this stupid... it wouldn't be worth doing, you know?
if my father finds out what we have planned, he will nail me to the wall.
why are you all sitting on one side of the table?
you know, donna, my grandmother came from sweden... and she had this thick accent and it embarrassed me to no end.
i asked her not to come to my high school graduation... 'cause i didn't want my friends to hear her talk... and she didn't come.
now, concerning the canned goods drive, motor oil is not a food.
i'm sorry it's not and all your booing isn't gonna make it one.
now, as you all know, president ford will be visiting our fair city.
and i know there's some of you near-to-wells out there that might be planning some sort of quote unquote social statement type protest.
why don't you and your friend head up to your room?
now, the most important part of our presidential rally is the town's people qa section.
streaking, don't get me wrong, i'm completely pro nudity, but i think my dad might kill me and i'm anti being killed.
hey, if there wasn't some huge downside to doing something this stupid, it wouldn't be worth doing, ya know?
look, we must keep this quiet, it can't go beyond this table.
if my father finds out what we plan, he will nail me to the wall.
i will not sit quietly by while every thing is taken away from me.
they took my job, my stability, now they wanna take away my right of free-speech.

the police is investigating the disappearance of 25 yr old kim so-jeong who has been missing since she left home after receiving a phone call from her fiancee the day before her wedding
police are singling out kim's fiancee, 29 yr old mr chung as the prime suspect which they believe murdered kim and buried her
their will to live was so great, they even cut off the finger that wore the cult's ring
as a person with so much respect in life why protect the murderer of these people
it would be fair for man to bear the burden of his doings,
...but does he have to see bloodshed for what he has not done and does not know of?
mmm, 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the humidity and the road surface.
broken left cheekbone, fractured skull, two cracked ribs, spiral fracture of the wrist, ruptured bladder...
it gets to be 2:00, a man knows he's got an angry woman waiting at home.
a bottle of perfume just might get him past the front door.
so, what do you guys want to talk to charlie about?
mrs. coffey, does your son still own a red pontiac firebird, license plate 187 jrl?
it was borrowed, off the books, by the neighborhood stabilization unit for patrol duty.
the car was being used as an undercover vehicle by some officers of the neighborhood stabilization unit to stake out potential robbery targets on the east side.
hey, try finding 20 clean-cut white guys in the mug books.
hey, lt, it was a long shot he was gonna pick 'em out anyway.
sawchuck said he saw the bloody back seat at carlson's farm later, around 3:00.
maybe carlson took the seat to the dump some other day.
their actions firmly put to rest the myth of the blue wall of silence.
the mayor has issued a directive to every officer with information about this case to follow their brave example.
if the 21 is any indication, he's got his work cut out.
it's bad enough profiling is rampant there, most of the profile stops were done by our star witness.
i don't want this blowing up in my face when he gets on the stand.
officer dietrich had eight complaints for excessive force, 15 for verbal abuse.
doesn't that mean he won't be a witness against carlson and fratelli?
i don't want him as a witness, i want him as a defendant.
i'll draw up the dismissal of the charges against carlson and fratelli.
by the time the feds get done with dietrich, they'll be naming bird sanctuaries after him.
what mr. gervits fails to grasp is that new york and federal bribery statutes differ.
under new york law, bribing a witness requires influencing that witness to testify falsely.
one for excessive force, one for passing racist literature to other officers...
fratelli has seven years on the force and a clean record.
i wonder if he'd do any better seeing them in person.
all right, mr. davis, take a good look at these men and tell us if you saw any of them on 95th street.
the cutlass kept proceeding at a regular but slow rate of speed.
did it occur to you that the driver might be lost?
we followed the car until it crossed second avenue, then we went around the block.
when we came back, we saw the cutlass parked, with the driver still behind the wheel.
it may be comforting to simply point at these two officers and say that mr. michaels' death was solely the issue of their sick, hateful minds.
or to lay some of the blame on the police department.
it's okay to use racial slurs, to use excessive force, to use racial profiling.
not only that, it's okay to do it in front of your fellow officers.
not that they really have anything to fear from us anyway.
and that's the least comforting reason why this horror took place.
that our failure to police them manifests our indifference, even our acceptance of their methods.
well, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, here's your chance to send a clear, unambiguous message to every police officer, good or bad, that we will not tolerate racism.
sure, but it's more entertaining to see her get sliced up in a school shower.
and would you hide a tomato like that in a wheelchair?
in this story, a band named kiss is playing at what resembles an orgy.
i can see where that would make a guy like hugo snap.
suppose marta was sleeping with neiderman, but then throws him over for the director.
neiderman gets jealous, finds them together in the hotel room, kills them both.
at that moment, i knew this case would pit me against horrors that no fbi agent should ever have to endure, and push me to the brink of insanity.
all we have is the possibility of a dental match on the bite marks.
she adopts the hockey-mask persona until she avenges the death of her son.
you have hockey, you have young men, you have her son.
even during the commission of a heinous crime, he was in character.
it was bianco's uncanny ability to completely immerse himself in a role.
either he was the greatest actor the world had ever known, or he was completely deranged.
if you want a good movie for halloween night, rent madman maniac,
so, what do we do to get this digital hearing aid?
so they do this thing with scallops and a white wine sauce...
and as soon as my foot touched the ball i heard a crack.
then i went to take a step and it just gave out and started hurting.
last time he got impacted, mineral oil enema did the trick.
we don't have the facilities to treat animals, but we can find you a vet.

if i had done that, chief o'brien would have assured me that rom would fix it right away.
then rom would have promised me that nog would fix it before the end of the day.
i was given command of this vessel by the late captain ramirez.
using that authority, i have promoted other red squad members as needed.
when i got to the bridge the captain was in bad shape, but he was lucid and he refused to go to sick bay.
we had lost main power and we were adrift but the cardassian cruiser was no better off.
tycho city's just a city, but outside where the gravity is still low and there's no air...
you know, the sun only comes up once a month on the moon.
every lunar morning my father and i would put on suits, hike out across the sea of clouds.
we'd stop at this collection of boulders on the western rim... just waiting for the sun to come up.
what's going on is that we are in the middle of a war.
we can't have cadets thinking of mummy and daddy instead of concentrating on their duties.
and whatever fates guide this universe, they've chosen us to achieve some purpose. i know that.
just as surely as i know your presence here is no coincidence.
we found the battleship and obtained a scan without being detected, and we're free to go home.
but that ship out there is a direct threat to every federation outpost and colony within 50 light years.
a single torpedo rigged with a radiogenic warhead could give the braces the consistency of wet pasta.
as a result, the entire antimatter storage system would tear itself apart.
no-one would think any less of us if we went home.
but that means that some other ship with some other crew would be asked to finish the job that we started.
you don't understand because you've never put on one of these uniforms.
you don't know anything about sacrifice or honour or duty or anything that makes up a soldier's life.
now i want you to step back from your duty and take a look around, and i don't mean at the walls.
i want you to look at this moment in your life.
that it was a good ship with a good crew that made a mistake.
we let ourselves blindly follow captain watters and he led us over a cliff.
then, of course, rom would have promised me that nog would fix it before the end of the day.
and since this is the end of the day and there is no nog in sight we can only draw one conclusion- that i don't have a problem.
i was given a battlefield commission and command of this vessel by the late captain ramirez.
using that authority, i have commissioned and promoted other members of red squad as needed.
we had seven regular officers and a crew of 35 cadets.
the plan was for the cadets to run the ship while the officers observed and critiqued our performance.
we had lost main power and we were adrift but the cardassian cruiser was no better off.
so it was a race against the clock- ship that got main power back on line first would have a decisive advantage.
of course, he still calls luna "the moon"- like it's the only one or something.
well, nobody who's ever lived on the moon calls it luna either.
i mean, tycho city's just a city but outside, where the gravity is still low and there's no air...
you know, the sun only comes up once a month on the moon.
every lunar morning, my father and i would put on suits and... hike out across the sea of clouds.
we'd stop at this collection of boulders on the western rim and... just wait for the sun to come up.
take a look at where you are- what's going on around you.
you're right in the middle of a great story- maybe one of the greatest stories in the entire dominion war.
just as surely as i know your presence on this ship is no coincidence.
you're here to write the story- to tell people of the valiant and her crew.
we're going to launch a sensor probe to scan the battleship.
that way, the valiant won't be picked up on their scanners.
we found the battleship and obtained a complete scan without being detected... and we're free to go home.
but that ship out there is a direct threat to every federation outpost and colony within 50 light-years.
a single torpedo, rigged with a radiogenic warhead could reduce those braces to the consistency of wet pasta.
as a result, the entire antimatter storage system would tear itself apart.
so you know i'm not exaggerating when i say that he's considered to be one of the best combat officers in the fleet and i'm telling you right now that even with the entire crew of the defiant with him
my father would never try to pull off something like this.
you don't understand because you've never put on one of these uniforms.
you don't know anything about sacrifice or honor or duty or any other things that make up a soldier's life.
but now i want you to step back from your duty and take a look around and i don't mean look at the walls.

chief o'brien would have assured me that rom would fix it right away.
then, of course, rom would have promised me that nog would fix it before the end of the day.
because one of them's turned around and now he's coming after us.
you do realize you're taking us deeper and deeper into dominion-held space.
when i got to the bridge the captain was in pretty bad shape but he was lucid and he refused to go to sick bay.
we had lost main power and we were adrift but the cardassian cruiser was no better off.

and just let me assure the public that we do have the situation under control.
i'll be seeing to it that the two lunch servers who caused this fracas will be expelled.
and what will erase my memory of having to do that?
mrs. quick, i'm gonna stick this swab in your ear, if you don't mind.
valerie, i learned that if you think you are confident, you are confident.
and i learned that childhood traumas don't go away by reading a book.

i will say something, boab to you, you you would have ducharte with wing of them..
it is only a party, i did not want to break the legs to him.

michael or neil go towards the left and the strip to jackson.
it lets it run and then it appears harper who moves away it of the arquero.
it waits for a momentito, boab, we are going to clarify something..
whenever under some it says to me what would have or would not have to do.
or some stupid student takes hold to me for a philosophical discussion..
on my nature, the reaches of my omnipotencia and all that excrement.
listening, love, just we were about to to take the tea.
i call to you in half an hour and we chatted, it seems to you well?
if you touch my brothers to me they will kill to you right here, son of puta!
they are going to see that i also i have friends!
she is my gold woman and she is not very old.
i do not want to be bold but i can take your hand.
she is not a witch and i like as she gestures.
she is not a witch and i like as she gestures.
she is faster than almost all and it lives in the coast.
i am its small prince and i give ardent love him.
i hope that you do not have sid to, because if i already am not infected.
to me i do not like the linings, never them use.
still you are falling in love and if they come tonight..
you will prepare yourself and accept what he touches to you, boy.
you already know me, to me does not interest to me that sweepings farmer..
it is for another place, where there is nothing no to do.
it comments out adapted, gives returns, irritate to me, but it does not do anything.
it would not concern so much to me if it did not think mainly.
i say what i think to you, déjame the head peacefully!
i must go to me, i said to him to davy that would see it, but..
it is a good one subject to treat today in the group.
- it does not matter to you that it goes, no?
very intelligent, tom, but you would not have to speak thus.
- i believe that you would have to be a model positive.
you have a crescent shaped birth mark on your inner thigh.
you were working for furniture removals, lived at home, had a girl you couldn't satisfy and played football for granton star, like you make love.
every time i come down here, some smart ass tells me what i should be doing.
or enter into a philosophical discourse with a twat about the nature of myself.
you've the power to get fit and make a contribution to the granton star cause.
you had the power to pay more attention to that girl of yours.
as soon as he found out i was pregnant he just fucked off.
listen johnny, d'you want to go out for a drink tonight?
what a pleasure it is to recall his words, his phrases... i can't see.
the commander could not decide whether he should keep a diary to record the course of his life.
there may be no one at hand to throw him a life-belt, and his miserable cry for help will be lost in the dark waves.
the waters of the northern seas are brutally cold... and a man's heart, even a young and warm one, will freeze within minutes.
"they must believe that freedom is beyond price", wrote down the commander.
"my subordinates examine the men once a week, as if they were babies.
"lf they only knew how one can hate to be free sometimes.
if they only knew how necessary it sometimes is, to lack freedom."
the ship was moored and tonight he wasn't needed any more.
but he felt unable to get up and go on shore, where his wife and his son were waiting for him.
during a storm the man at the wheel doesn't have the right to leave the controls.
seasick, the sailors had to throw up the contents of their stomachs
he was looking at the icy water, raging alongside the ship,
thinking how terrible it would be to be left behind in this world of ice, alone without help,
the commander saw that he could spend his whole life like this.
but in order to spend one's whole life like this, one would need to love life, and especially, to love the conscripts.
he made himself memorise word for word a story by chekhov, which he had recently read.
he tried to concentrate, but everything on the bridge distracted him.
each wave, as you watch it, tries to rise higher, pushing down the one before.
but a third wave overrides them all, just the same, just as fierce and ugly.
if i think over my aspirations, practically all have been realised.
there are things to be proud of, to be ashamed of.
and the bosun from his friend's ship, seizing the little steering wheel,
towed a raft of coal to the shore, where a deathly cold outpost could be seen.
and most likely something similar awaits us both in the future.
just recently he had had a dream, in which he was a very old man, nearing the end,
but that his ship did not become old, the sea was not old, the air around was young...
but he was old and he knew all too well the rest of the story.
then he saw his friend's ship moving along by a rocky shore.
it struggled against the squall that was driving the ship onto the rocks.
of course, one can live here and look... at the white and the grey without distress.
only that means reading thick books by writers of the past.
now the midshipman will come, he will call out names, five or so at a time.
the man whose name is called strips down to his underwear and boots, and goes into the corridor to be examined.
military service allows no privacy, wrote the commander in his diary,
and then he remembered how, quite recently, he had argued bitterly with a civilian friend of his.
the civilian had said that the army was no more than a big school.
nobody knew, he said, whether the army would ever have to go into combat.
the commander knew that in a certain way his civilian friend was right.
the only thing he could answer to this was that it was not the military
the military are only as cruel as the nation as a whole.
he was particularly displeased with these last lines in his diary.
he realised with disgust that he was grateful to them for their patience and their submission.
and the commander at last understood that it was this sentimental feeling that prevented him
how lucky that russia should have had such a man as chekhov.
what a pleasure it is to recall his words, his phrases... i can't see.
no, of course it's not good that i had no pity for the man.

towed a raft of coal to the shore, where a deathly cold outpost could be seen.
and it seemed to him that the bosun looked very much like dante's charon.
we rely on each other, we have lived very similar lives,
and most likely something similar awaits us both in the future.

it would all go on the same way as it started, taking care of their bodies and clothes.
still later, they would see that their commanders don't expect anything either.
trouble consultants were the top specialists assigned to realize those ideals.
at least that's how it was when i was in the field.
not only did it hire these two, but it teamed them up together!
i placed 'em based on the optimum calculation using the goclefski theorem.
the galactic federation, due to the disaster in 21 63 which destroyed the hyperwave network, several years ago established the
interstellar communication development organization to rebuild the system and to standardize the telecommunications network.
it's multiplying effect on aggregate demand would have provided an unending stimulus to the galactic economy.
however, the project was brought to a halt by insufficient capital.
it was at this point that my company, gcn, appeared on the scene as a messiah.
the siren project reconstruction plan that i submitted to the galactic federation included generous terms.
this is too much, not only for your finger, but also for your shoulders and arms.
this sensor is too sensitive for your body to keep up with.
the skill you exhibited in the assassination of ralmophon was impressive.
given the distance and difficult angle, an average sniper wouldn't even have scratched a target like that.
however, you seem to have picked up a nosy little pest.
i can't imagine how lady flair could have allowed that to happen.
in other words, the security system thought the guards were the enemy, and started attacking them.
and, in the confusion, the sniper slipped into the space port, right?
it has been reported that a peace treaty has been signed due to the intervention of a third party who has not yet been identified.
i've just been told we have video from the site including footage of the unidentified party.
as i said before, i can't allow you to see someone without an appointment.
how am i suppose to get an appointment when they just hang up the phone on me?
you lovely angels nearly got yourselves killed bringing that card in.
i wish remembering that would make you more enthusiastic about this assignment.
ever since the end of the war, when headquarters relocated here,
unit 9 has been investigating the connection between lucifer and gcn.
the chances of obtaining a search warrant for gcn rests on his testimony.
the only thing we can do now is have yuri intrude on him.
to support his habit, the professor used the card in an attempt to blackmail gcn.
that ended in failure and he found the 3wa wanted him,
before we knew it, he had become an overlord with such immense power that nobody could touch him anymore.
well, why didn't you stop him before it came to this?
this village was blessed with increasing good fortune as his power grew.
we were all happy and content with the way things were going.
this exercise will be the largest ever conducted by the united space force.
the whereabouts of the man at the center of the allegations, gcn's ceo waldess, has become a pressing issue, since he was named a pivotal information source.
please note that military landing craft are expected to be utilizing this spaceport at unspecified times.
the scheduled departure and arrival times of some international flights may be affected.
the 3wa is deploying everything it can muster in a dragnet.

once we get through this shopping center, we'll be on a larger street for sure.
wow, so this was what stores were like three hundred years ago.
starting with the already completed late 1 990s tokyo area, the new york area currently under construction, the london and shanghai areas currently in planning stages, and other future areas will be all controlled from this center.
maintainance, control, administration, construction, and all other aspects of the operation of this planet are centrally controlled by our computer, silica 2000.
actually, i was the person that put together this computer system.
three years ago, when they were rebuilding this computer system, people visited the university and i ended up working with them.
regarding the threat of binary source information breakdown, at this time the integrity of up to module level 67 has been confirmed.
now, we're using a vaccinated unit to reconstruct an operational machine and are attempting to run a recreation simulation.
the computer of a business that operates a theme park has been hit with an unknown virus.
for some reason, the 3wa has been called in to investigate and eliminate the virus.
i found a new infected area in the language field kernel, district 908.
well,we could help track down the jerk that tried to bump us off.
don't they run things like the afghanistan warlords experience, the australian kangaroo ranch, and the borneo rain forest tour?
yes, they launch theme parks similar to ours and we compete aggressively for each others' customer base.
of course you wouldn't, kei hardly went to school at all.
i wouldn't dream of ever going back to place like that ever again!
right now all accommodations, everything from five star hotels to inexpensive inns with shared baths, are all filled up.
we prepared the vip room for the three of you from the 3wa, but even if the room is now unusable, we are not in a position to be able to prepare another room so easily.
oh well, having yuri along would only slow me down anyhow.
there's a study room at the north end of the third floor.
a girl with long hair is sometimes seen sitting next to the window, softly crying.

of course we dictate our pay, but the pride and glory are the most important parts of our job.
i remember now, you were behind the exorbitant price hikes on satellites by balan corps.
you claimed that the second satellite was yours and put it up for sale!
how am i supposed to wait all that time all alone?
you might end up behind bars for the rest of your life.
it's a world that a person of such high standing as yourself might find hard to believe.
the days in the life of a tro-con are filled with hardships and thrills.
to let someone such as yourself go to all that trouble?
my manhood would be at stake if i left such menial labor to a lady.
to accidentally run across a person in this vast city that is tokyo, assuming that the population of tokyo is x and the number of people is y...
let's go to a cafe and have a drink while we talk.
it took the stupid programmer two days to realize what he had done.
anxiously, he started researching what the computer was accessing, and he found out that it was accessing a point clear across the galaxy.
but don't dare make the mistake of taking her to a sushi buffet.
what should i do if she doesn't agree to the date?
i'll model the itinerary on a flow chart with 3 to the 4th power of options.
i'll need to i leave enough leeway to handle any unforeseen accidents.
at noon the first flight will take off, ending the long closure of the airport.
i cannot permit the landing of star horse 60 at a time like this!
that one hour will cost the company about 1,000 times your annual pay!

after jaic spread the virus, it hid in the circuitry, waiting for an opportunity to escape.
it's only a matter of time before i can specify that.
as it stands now, it's a question of whether i can get him before he gets to me.

the day before yesterday, senator rip passed away at the fairway memorial hospital, and a conspiracy connected to the inheritance has been uncovered.
senator rip, head of the rip group, was the richest man in the galaxy.
she is suspected of hiring a hitman to kill ms. sally, senator rip's mistress.
mr. mrs. rip did not have any children, but ms. sally has a six-month old boy fathered by mr. rip.
if you touch the ball with anything except the gloves, the bomb will explode.
you know what will happen if you can't return them, don't you?
this doll, i mean, this figure is a perfect copy of me, isn't it?
yes, but it is only a physically perfect copy of you.
i can't imagine myself eating a bowl of rice like a pig, or sucking ramen noodles and splashing the soup around, or eating dumplings with lots of garlic, or drinking miso soup and making sucking noises,
or crunching on pickles, or using a toothpick or anything like that!
this is a really tough mission, but i'll do my best in order to continue to be your partner.
it's not good for you to stay in that dark room all the time.
dearest, 'tis after midnight... and i am at last free to speak to you.
mother, father and flossy have grown accustomed to my late night scribbling, and have bid me goodnight.
you know, with all the money going into your wedding, you and deborah could take a trip around the world.
- i don't want to take a trip around the world.
let's just say i bought into this madness for a few milliseconds, which, of course, i don't where would you suggest that i mail this painstakingly authentic letter?
manhasset postal substation on the north side... built:1857, it's the only pre-civil war post office in existence.
sadly, i know i have the duty to obey and must soon accept.
but i ache for a love that burns like fire and moonlight.
dear, lady, i've just read the letter from the secret compartment of your desk.
...which means, may be out there in the mist right now, just a heartbeat away.
he's given me to believe that the two of you have come to an understanding.
i have only agreed to what you might call a prelude to an understanding.
i try to imagine how all of this could have happened.
the only explanation i can come up with is, that, for some reason, the connection between us is so strong that we're able to talk to each other across the chasm of time.
a friend once said that when you're in love, you light up like a christmas tree when your lover enters the room.
i don't think i ever felt that way, at least not until last night, when i found your second letter.
i'm afraid this waltz is going to have to be mine and debra's, miss whitcomb.
the hard truth is, we are doomed to be chaste... to never touch each other, hear each other, see each other.
so, what harm can there be to write to each other?
if you are still there, write to me quickly and tell me what it means to "light up like a christmas tree".
i've had 50 years of her temper, and believe me, it's worse than mine.
i'd really love to talk to her, would that be possible?
to light up like a christmas tree means to glow with pleasure, and i am glowing...right now.
i went to your house on mill plain road...yes, it's still there.
it's crazy, but i felt as if i could touch you, too.
lizzie, to ignore what's happened would be to deny a miracle.
so, i take the letters that you send to me here from mr. corrigan... put them in that compartment, close it, and they...
and you must promise to send his letter to me care of cousin delia in boston.
scotty, the moment i saw him, i was powerfully drawn to him.
and he, it appears, seems to feel an attraction as well.
please do not fear, my darling, that i am in any way moving away from you.
for i feel, strange as it may seem, that being with caleb, brings me closer to you.
allow me to introduce the guest speaker who will tell you what your attendance and your generous contributions mean to the wounded soldiers of our great state.
this brave officer was grievously injured at chancellorsville, but he is returning to his regiment this very week.
dearest, caleb is dead, and so, my future love, are you.
it must be so, for you are one in the same.
i will never forget how the winds of time blew back and forth for me.
i will never forget how my heart lit up like a glowing christmas tree.
she found it in the attic when she was a little girl.
it's a batch of letters, diaries, papers, and poems, lots of poems.
"for 10 years the world has been dominated by the malignant power of stalin.
a new era begins, an era in which the guiding spirit is liberty, not enslavement, and when human relations will be those of fraternity, not one-man domination."
secretary of state dulles and vice president nixon pledged that they would roll back the frontiers of soviet power.
eisenhower and dulles had accused the truman administration of being soft on communism.
after stalin's death, ulbricht pressed on, rebuilding his part of germany along stalinist lines.
heavy industry was built up to meet the demands of the soviet economy.
but east germany was unable to stop people deserting to the west.
travel to the british, american and french sectors of berlin was open to east germans.
"when we passed construction sites, everybody - metalworkers, locksmiths, masons, carpenters - all joined us.
when we arrived at the city hospital, there were several thousand people with us.
so i got into my car and i went over and ran into the building workers, who by that time had left the building sites, were on strike and were marching through east berlin.
and where i caught up with them was near the friedrichstrassebahnhof station, the main station right in the middle of east berlin.
strikes and mass demonstrations erupted in east berlin and throughout east germany.
demonstrators tore down the symbol of soviet domination, the hammer and sickle.
the soviet authorities were astonished that ulbricht had allowed the crisis to get out of control.
"when ulbricht arrived at the soviet headquarters at karlshorst, he telephoned karl schirdewan and asked him what was going on.
it will take us no more than five minutes to sort them out."
"they were trying to elect a strike committee from the leaders of the workers when four russian tanks drove into the square, four abreast, and went straight for the crowd.
and i remember one man got caught and was run over by a tank."
"we couldn't do anything against the tanks with our bare hands and stones.
"the british, the americans and the french were all for a quiet life.
their concern was to have security of the access routes to west berlin but they wouldn't get into difficulties with the russians.
"we wanted a strong nato as a defensive barrier against the soviet union.
we also wanted to prevent any expansion of the soviet union into western europe
the pact formally bound the armies of the communist satellites to the soviet high command.
the new treaty legitimized the presence of soviet troops in eastern europe
but most of the soviet leaders disagreed with him and thought we have to make a goodwill gesture and start talks in europe."
in vienna, molotov joined john foster dulles and the british and french foreign ministers in signing a peace treaty.
and really there's only one country in the europe who won itself, not by the help of the soviet union, itself.
so he thought, i have to go there, not invite tito in soviet union, because we're big country and we have to show them that we were wrong."
khrushchev wanted to overcome the legacy of stalinist terror and hardship.
he put more resources into the production of consumer goods and housing.
for him it was the best life to the people, just like the heaven of the earth and he many times repeat that it is impossible to live in the heaven surrounded by the barbed wires."
khrushchev used the 20th soviet party congress to end the hero-worship of stalin and expose the cruelties of his dictatorship.
he had played an active part in stalin's repressions in ukraine and in other parts of the country.
he had no moral right to speak about stalin as if he himself was pure."
"he did not say anything new for me or for the majority of my friends.
he did not say everything that needed to be said but we were happy that at least it was said.
after the 20th congress it looked as if this fear would never return."
khrushchev's secret speech was perfect propaganda for the american-financed radio free europe.
the text of khrushchev's speech was broadcast after the cia received a copy from the israeli intelligence service.
"they were just repeating for 24 hours, one-hour speech over and over and over again.
young protesters faced a show trial to which foreign journalists were invited.
"what really shocked the government, the regime, was that it was the workers who rose.
"on the 17th of june 1953, mr. secretary, the people of east germany rose against the communist regime and the russians were able to come in and repress ... suppress the uprising by means of armed force.
we at that time sat back and allowed this to happen.
would we sit back again in a similar fashion if this ...if this this kind of uprising were to take place in poland?"
"well, i do not think that we would send our own armed forces into poland or into east germany under those circumstances.
i doubt if that would be a profitable or desirable thing to do.
it would be the last thing in the world that these people who are trying to win their independence would want.
that would precipitate a full-scale world war and probably the result of that would be all these people wiped out."
because he had the backing of the polish army and the polish people,
"gomulka told me a few years later that he had a conversation with soviet marshal zhukov, who had been drinking.
zhukov said, 'we were so well prepared that we could have been all over poland in three days;
rakosi and i went to meet him at the airport and took him back by car.
we were almost at the guesthouse when mikoyan turned to rakosi and said,
inspired by gomulka's success in poland, thousands poured into the streets of budapest.
students and workers demanded free speech, the disbanding of the secret police and the withdrawal of soviet troops.
in the center of budapest, an excited crowd toppled the monument to stalin.
nagy stayed silent when hungary's tottering communist leadership called on the kremlin to crush the growing unrest.
"i got a telephone call from my divisional commander in cegled.
he told me, 'you've got to go to budapest - it's urgent!
the hungarians had equipped themselves with molotov cocktails, rifles, machine guns and enthusiasm.
"i don't know how the guns work but one older man, his name was pista baczi, he says 'don't worry about it, i'm going to teach you!
"i'll tell you quite honestly - and this is not only my opinion, this is what every revolutionary thinks, at least the ones who dare express their opinions.
we only recognized imre nagy as our prime minister when he actually acknowledged the revolution.
he announced, 'this is not a counterrevolution, this is a fight for freedom.'"
during the fighting in budapest, many people had taken refuge in cellars.
for more than a week, the hungarian rebels have been attacking the signs of soviet tyranny.
it's become a platitude to say of the people that they've earned their freedom, but it's the only thing that can really be said of the hungarians today.
whether they will be free is still in the issue, but if sheer guts can win freedom, they'll win."
the west's attention was diverted by another crisis far from europe.
- you the british and, of course, the french, have wrecked our rising by starting a war in the middle east.
this will put the russians in a position where they can, in effect, act with impunity because every - the world's eyes will be on on the middle east and not on hungary.'
"with imre nagy in power, there was an orgy of bloodletting in the streets of budapest and other cities.
i saw people being strung up by their feet, people being publicly humiliated and trampled on."
with austria in mind, agy declared hungarian neutrality and divorce from the warsaw pact.
he hoped international pressure would stop the soviets crushing the revolution.
other communist states, especially china, were urging khrushchev to use force.
"it was a very complicated decision to my father as he thought for three or four days.
all of this suggests to me that we are in war with the soviet union.
i recommend that you, as prime minister, state for the nation, for the world, that hungary is in war with the soviet union, due to the soviet aggression.'

don't get caught, and make a lot of money is under way.
you start looking, and i'll start working on a shorter code name.
- and if you do happen to move more than five paces away, something terrible will happen.
something that will scare you to the depths of your soul.
these are all orders for our cleanser from the other realm, after the first minute.
but i wanted this formula to be used for the common good.
but to tell you the truth, i was taking a nap.
there's something really soothing about being under an engine, but i don't know what it is.
the fact that it's sunny and unseasonably warm outside takes nothing away from the fun.
you know, sabrina, i don't think i told you this, but in my opinion, your democracy daze float was the best.
a number of people have benefited from my advice, you know.
a number of people eat other people, doesn't mean it's right for everyone.
look if i had my bow and arrow none of this would matter.
if i'm gonna hook up 100 couples to get back to olympus without it,
i can't get the otter blood out of my coffee table..."
oh, where is an open man hole cover when you need one?
you know what, that's funny, because the thousands of people who read my books and my column think so.
the people who pay me to counsel them think so, and you know who else thinks so?
if you want to ignore the fact that you have been charged to my care.
if you want the courts to find out and re-institutionalize you.
doc, for what it's worth, i think that you've got a keeper here.
she in her wonderfully passion-free take on relationships reminds me of that saying.
just between you and me, we're way past just considering you.
i got all the releases from my patients and my group, so you're free to eavesdrop all you like.
it actually starts to shrink from all those weeks of not using it, remember.
all right, well, i know this sounds a little melodramatic, but that's what happened to my soul.
i got off the "l" this morning and i looked at the morning rush.
the traffic, the noise, the people on a mission, oh god, it was-- the city was so exciting, it was so alive.
look it, the guy was not afraid to put himself out there, all right.
he grabbed a little bit of what everyone in here should grab a lot more of and that's the big "a".
"did my hair dry right?" "does my tie go with my shirt?"
"should i have left grandma at home with the rottweiler, when i'm out of kibble?"
well, you're assuming that this person was dancing in the street in order to get someone to respond.
no, i'm saying that people did respond, and you as his doctor are more concerned with why he did it.
actually i'm more interested in chatting now, about why trevor hale wants people to pretend to be something they're not in order to get attention.
look, most of this bunch can't even go up to a girl in a bar.
male lions show off their mane, the moose with the biggest antlers gets all the babes, a peacock without any colour, just another turkey.
yes, but lucky for some of you, human nature has evolved a step or two past mother nature.
well for instance, unlike certain species, our mating dance doesn't require us to kill the male after a one night stand.
look we may have all, from time to time, wanted to sing, dance, emote grandly and spontaneously in public but what keeps most of us from doing so is common sense.
as i said when i called, i'm very well acquainted with your file.
i had a similar case once, many years ago, and i truly believe that dance lessons are the answer to solving you problem.
oh no, not to worry, she understands all of your qualifications.
master class at the dance academy, steppenwolf, theatre company and tony award winning actor.
all right, what if i told you he wished you could feel the same joy that he feels when he dances?
did he tell you this at your office or during a house call?
a container that's not designed to survive plane crashes, car crashes, or-- or falling pianos.
a container with a heart, a liver, kidneys and-- and they could all just stop functioning at any time, causing complete and irreversible... death.
the way you haunt my dreams no they can't take that away from me
we may never, never meet again on that bumpy road to love
the way you changed my life no they can't take that away from me
we may never, never meet again on that bumpy road to love
the way you changed my life no they can't take that away from me
no they can't take that away they won't take that away
couple tight pennant races, a further erosion in our faith in government.
if you need any more than that, you may want to grab a newsweek.
mr. bennett, um..... you may think that it takes a lot of courage to spot a problem and change your life to solve it and maybe it does.
but maybe it takes more courage to do right by a person who is clearly devoted to you, a person who loves you.
relationships demand a certain stability, a certain reliability and more than that, they demand trust.
now a person in a loving relationship made a promise that he'll be there, that he won't abandon them.
that he won't just up and leave her behind while he's off pursuing whatever selfish agenda he might want to pursue.
now any man who does not keep that promise should know that he is doing something that can forever change that woman he has left behind.
forever leave her with an anger and frustration that she may never get past and as far as i'm concerned, mr. bennett, any man who does not have the decency to honor his commitments the same way that she is honoring hers
is not a man who deserves any sympathy and is certainly not a man who deserves to be mourned when he is gone.
maybe part of your punishment here on earth is to find out about mortality.
you know that whole "act outrageous" bit you were running earlier?
little sammy, was cute little sammy before all the bad happened", right?
sam, i can measure the progress that you and i have made over the last few months.
ben, can i tell you an idea i had for a movie?
umm, if this is a pitch... pretend that you're a hollywood producer
[miss parker] i swear to god, i'm starting to lose my mind.
it's bad enough that we have missed jarod... with all the close calls that we've had... but we're not even showing up in the right cities anymore.
[sniffs] now, you know, you're definitely not making full use of all your talents.
[sniffs] in fact, tony says you're the best print man he's ever seen.
[man] undercover agent dean clark was arraigned today... in the killing of federal officer lester knight.
a reporter caught up with sean flanagan... the u.s. prosecutor who's trying the case.
[woman] is it the department's contention that dean clark killed undercover agent knight?
agent clark has been charged with homicide in connection with the death of a fellow agent... while both were working undercover for the melino crime family.
he said to watch my back and meet him in the morning.
the same morning agent knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner's bag?
how long did you have to stay in that fish bath?
let's just say the dry cleaners don't want my business anymore.
the friend of a friend who set it up- turns out he had a parole violation.
so he's playing both ends against the middle... so he wouldn't have to go back to stir.
[mr. parker] all the panels in all the blue boxes... contain sensitive information.
it could jeopardize the operations if they fall into the wrong hands.
that's why this time he has to be dealt with with finality.
the situation has to be cleaned, but has to be played close to the vest.
les knight found out about flanagan, and flanagan bumped him off.
[flanagan] yeah, and you dumped the body, and then you framed dean clark.
[miss parker] i swear to god, i'm starting to lose my mind.
it's bad enough that we have missed jarod... with all the close calls that we've had... but we're not even showing up in the right cities anymore.

it's bad enough that we've missed jarod with all the close calls that we had.
but we are not even showing up in the right citys any more.
undercover agent dean clark was ringed today in the killing of federal officer lester knight.
our reporter caught up with sean flanagan, the us prosecutor who's trying the case.
you said ... that agent dean clark killed federal undercover agent knight?
agent clark has been charged for the homicide connection with the death of a fellow agent.
he said "watch my back in the middle of the morning."
the same morning that agent knight was found suffocated in a dry cleaner's bag?
there is no way i could have driven over the bridge ...
knight's, kill him and make it back home without running my car into a pole.
the more bruises, the less questions they are going to ask.
jarod, we put a lot of pressure on people of chicago to ..for you.
we were going to meet some friends and we went to the wrong warehouse.
flanagan, we got a couple of wags who got their brains dead
isn't there any way of determining what sort of information was stored on?
it's impossible to know what's on it, more specifically what's not.
he was in the bar, he was drinking gin with bobbie.
he was so plastered they had to carry him out of here.
you can't catch jarod, what chance you to get with me?
you sound like you're catching a cold, it must be dark and wet where you are.
some friends of yours are over there now setting you up to take a big fall.
i hope you remember this call if i need help in the future.
you know, you definitely not make a full use of your talents.
in fact tony says, you are the best "print man" he has ever seen.
our reporter caught up with sean flanagan, the us prosecutor who's trying the case.
you said ... that agent dean clark killed federal undercover agent knight?
don't you guys in the public defenders office talk to each other?
so you were with this bobbie the night that agent knight was murdered.
jarod, we put a lot of pressure on people of chicago to ..for you.
now if you think joey .., we pull you out right now.
so this time he has to be dealt with full finality.
situation has to be cleaned, but has to play close to the best.
now that i want to keep the rest of my ..
if you excuse me, i've got a running with a very anxious buyer.
now each of you is responsible for the murder of lester knight.
so i thought it will be really need if you feel like he felt.
they get into the room and he said, "sit down there."
he steps back, runs to her and gives it a penis shot.
one after the other, one is arrested, we made a trip to the cops, it appears ...
the police... think that you away from the street ... it will be like a punishment that will change your life but that's not what we need.
they enrolled me in a lot of schools, i was sent back, and one day, we told them to someone in israel.
they sent me to israel in a woman known enough there.
a plastic factory, i understood nothing since i do not speak hebrew.
the next day they put me with the kids but they did not like me.
raymond dear... to raise children, all you need is love and common sense.
when i had trouble sleeping, mom used to do something for me.
every time you crawled into our bed, i'd say, "marie, take him back."
you bawied your little eyes out... but after a while, you got with the program.
are you sure this is going to be all right with debra?
listen, she's going to thank me for a good night's sleep... and it'll prove to her that it doesn't have to be one of us in here... and we have other options....

he hated formality -- he acted on impulse -- he loved a fight.
he wanted to make the soviet union happy as well as glorious.
some of the women complained sometimes it smelt like benzine, and men wanted to know if it would make them drunk.
but khrushchev knew that the soviet union was beating america in the space race.
khrushchev believed that the soviet people would work even harder if they were freed from fear and poverty.
but the cold war's pressure to rearm kept the old priority for heavy industry alive, especially in the expanding defense sector.
we knew that there was a threat that bombs and missiles could reach us -- so we had to defend ourselves.
there was no feeling that we were on equal terms with the west, or that we could come to any agreement.
production was a matter of fulfilling -- or outstripping -- targets set by the planners in moscow.
patriotic propaganda kept the workers straining to produce more and faster.
we had such a huge country, with vast resources, all the people worked.
so why were we dressed so badly in whatever we could lay our hands on, and ate whatever there was, and not what we wanted?
soviet people living as well as americans -- or even better.
he tried to shift the planned economy towards light industry and consumer needs.
he understood it as a man with a lot of common sense, peasan's common sense.
he had very strong instinctive gut feelings and he followed them.
khrushchev boasted that he would overtake america in meat, milk, and grain.
volunteers poured out to the virgin lands with the old communist zeal.
it was hard to get meat in our town so we had to go to moscow.
we took huge rucksacks and we went on a bus, 120 kilometers to moscow.
we used to go in very large groups, about 40 people.
we used to buy food, and cook in large pots on open fires.
there were special patrol guards with red bands on their arms.
and if they saw that someone was dressed english style, not soviet style, he was pulled out of the crowd and taken to the militia station where they out the trousers, then out their hair, and then let them off home.
new portable radios could sometimes pick up forbidden programs from abroad.
society was trying to crawl out from under the stones of totalitarianism.
so i skipped lunch at school for a week, for two weeks.
several of us would save up the money together and go and get a record, get back, put the record on and listen to rock and roll -- to elvis presley.
of course, there were some young people who did not stick to this.
they behaved freely... but they were called before the komsomol committee, where they had to explain themselves.
that was typical, you know, hypocritical quotation from poetry of that time.
and even poems about... not political poems, about loneliness, for instance -- like my poem, early poem -- it was accused like anti-soviet poem, because if i am soviet man, how i could be lonely
in 1962, hard-liners persuaded khrushchev to visit an exhibition of modern art.
they hoped he would be shocked, and restore even tighter censorship.
it was like a move in chess which had several targets at once.
it was a trap set for the intelligentsia, which included a trap for me, because i had won lots of competitions.
the ideologists told him he was very wise not to understand it because behind it, bourgeois ideology is penetrating our pure society, and it could all end up rather badly.
the censors stifled free speech in other parts of the soviet empire.
whatever went wrong, the communist system itself must never be blamed.
khrushchev had still hot solved the problem of food supply, but he was buoyant about his grand schemes.
he ordered everyone to grow corn, claiming -- wrongly -- that new soviet varieties could survive in cold climates.
the poor girls and boys had to warm up the fields, day and night, so that the corn would grow.
they burnt fires all through the night, especially if a frost was forecast.
sometimes they fell asleep too close to the fire and burnt their hands and faces.
so the corn, for us, was not the queen of the fields, but an evil stepmother.
when they couldn't save the crops, despite burning the fires, the boys would put on a brave face.
but at home, even though my father was a communist, he used to swear and curse khrushchev because he made life much more difficult for us.
the soviet people, officials and citizens alike, were losing patience with khrushchev.
it was more acceptable to the people because it was more stable.
before that, the situation had been uncertain and we didn't know what would happen from one day to the next.
stability was restored in the soviet union, but unrest stirred in the empire.
in czechoslovakia, the repressive regime of antonio novotny still stamped on demands for a more open society.
they tried to push back the progress of freedom, but they didn't succeed any more.
we made two steps forward and we were repressed by one step, but we gained one step always.
the reformers were confident that they could bring communism up to date.
the party would still lead -- but by consent, not force.
on the one hand they wanted to preserve communism and socialism as they called it.
but on the other hand they wanted to give it a human face... which meant that they wanted to lift the lid a little.
but they hoped that the lid would not fly off with the pressure inside the cooker, as it were, that they would still be able to contain the situation.
it was funny that, you know, before... you know, in the '50s and like that, you know, people were looking over their shoulders, you know, who could be following you, and if they had somebody brought from the west,
some newspaper, it was in the pockets, deep in the pockets.
in the '60s, in the euphoria of free press, everybody was talking freely and at the same time looking over their shoulders, because it was not...
threats from moscow and the warsaw pact failed to make dubcek climb down.
in july, brezhnev, kosygin, and the entire politburo arrived from moscow with renewed demands.
this involved some changes in personnel, the introduction of tighter control over the mass media, and stricter work among certain layers of society.
and the imposition of censorship, because openly anti-communist, anti-soviet publications and articles started to appear.
dubcek was waiting for a telephone message, but instead the door suddenly opened, and paratroopers came in carrying kalashnikovs.
they stood behind us and the commander said they were taking us under protection in the name of the forces of the warsaw pact.
we climbed on the tanks and we told them to go back home, that they had lost their way or been sent to the wrong place.
they were really surprised and didn't understand what we were trying to tell them.
and i must say that the soviet invasion in '68 was even crueller impact than the hitler one, hitlerite one.
because hitler was our declared enemy, we didn't expect anything from him but the worst.
this action was dictated first of all by the need... to preserve the balance of power in the relations between the east and west.
and of course we were interested in preserving there, the established system.
he hated formality -- he acted on impulse -- he loved a fight.
he wanted to make the soviet union happy as well as glorious.
but khrushchev knew that the soviet union was beating america in the space race.
for khrushchev, here was evidence that communism meant not just power but technical progress.
but sometimes we used to get irritated because we knew even without their orders that we had to hurry up.
we knew that there was a threat that bombs and missiles could reach us -- so we had to defend ourselves.
cities like sverdlovsk, 900 miles east of moscow, were dominated by giant armament plants.
production was a matter of fulfilling -- or outstripping -- targets set by the planners in moscow.
we had such a huge country, with vast resources, all the people worked.
so why were we dressed so badly in whatever we could lay our hands on, and ate whatever there was, and not what we wanted?
soviet people living as well as americans -- or even better.
he tried to shift the planned economy towards light industry and consumer needs.
he understood it as a man with a lot of common sense, peasan's common sense.
he had very strong instinctive gut feelings and he followed them.
in the 1960s, apartment blocks shot up around every soviet city.
for millions of russians it was an opportunity for a new life.
khrushchev boasted that he would overtake america in meat, milk, and grain.
volunteers poured out to the virgin lands with the old communist zeal.
we took huge rucksacks and we went on a bus, 120 kilometers to moscow.
we went to gum, the central department store on red square and spent a whole day shopping.
we used to go in very large groups, about 40 people.
we used to buy food, and cook in large pots on open fires.
in the late '50s and the beginning of the '60s, when we got trousers, we changed them to make them very narrow and flute-like.
you could only get them on and off by using soap on your legs.
society was trying to crawl out from under the stones of totalitarianism.
you couldn't get any discs here, and to record them off air was almost impossible because the radio was jammed.
they behaved freely... but they were called before the komsomol committee, where they had to explain themselves.
we tried to deal with their emotional conflicts and give them direction.
that was typical, you know, hypocritical quotation from poetry of that time.
and even poems about... not political poems, about loneliness, for instance -- like my poem, early poem -- it was accused like anti-soviet poem, because if i am soviet man, how i could be lonely
it was like a move in chess which had several targets at once.
it was a trap set for the intelligentsia, which included a trap for me, because i had won lots of competitions.
realistic art where one could see a forest and know it was a forest.
the ideologists told him he was very wise not to understand it because behind it, bourgeois ideology is penetrating our pure society, and it could all end up rather badly.
the censors stifled free speech in other parts of the soviet empire.
in czechoslovakia, where a rigid stalinist leadership blocked all reform, the struggle was the same -- the free-thinking artist trying to elude the party censor.
whatever went wrong, the communist system itself must never be blamed.
khrushchev had still hot solved the problem of food supply, but he was buoyant about his grand schemes.
the poor girls and boys had to warm up the fields, day and night, so that the corn would grow.

sometimes they fell asleep too close to the fire and burnt their hands and faces.
so the corn, for us, was not the queen of the fields, but an evil stepmother.
when they couldn't save the crops, despite burning the fires, the boys would put on a brave face.
but the girls cried bitter tears, because the crop had died.
stability was restored in the soviet union, but unrest stirred in the empire.
in czechoslovakia, the repressive regime of antonio novotny still stamped on demands for a more open society.
they tried to push back the progress of freedom, but they didn't succeed any more.
we made two steps forward and we were repressed by one step, but we gained one step always.
dubcek and the new president ludvik svoboda were in charge, but their reforms were already shocking the rest of the communist world.
the reformers were confident that they could bring communism up to date.
the party would still lead -- but by consent, not force.
there would be freedom to speak and write, to travel and organize.
but on the other hand they wanted to give it a human face... which meant that they wanted to lift the lid a little.
but they hoped that the lid would not fly off with the pressure inside the cooker, as it were, that they would still be able to contain the situation.

in the '60s, in the euphoria of free press, everybody was talking freely and at the same time looking over their shoulders, because it was not...
i think it was a freedom in spasm, a spasmodic freedom that people were really -- it was like a freedom, unleashed by fever, you know, it was not really a comfortable freedom.
we came to an agreement that the czechoslovaks would themselves carry out a certain number of crucial measures to restore order.
this involved some changes in personnel, the introduction of tighter control over the mass media, and stricter work among certain layers of society.
dubcek was waiting for a telephone message, but instead the door suddenly opened, and paratroopers came in carrying kalashnikovs.

none are connected to the murder of father juneaux or monsignor jaeger.
where are we in the hunt for luis carranza and pedro velez?
if we're dealing with a guy who's doing robbery murders, then he's gonna keep the cash and the non-descript jewellery.
but if he's dead broke, then he grabs whatever he can.
i am so damn tired of playin' defence against that bitch.
if she gonna come back at us, we gonna come back at her the same.
not that i think it matters in this case, you know.
if it's some wacko who gets off on killing priests, then maybe he'll come to the viewing, but these are just street robberies, plain and simple.
the young man told me the chalice was his own, and that he wished to part with it for $80.
the law requires that i obtain this young man's name and address, and i have done this for you.
i imagine we'll no longer contest any motions to have them held as material witnesses.
you have confidence they didn't kill father juneaux or monsignor jaeger, didn't burglarise the church, pawn the chalice, use the money to flee?
they maintain their innocence, and claim no knowledge of the second murder whatsoever.
they can't explain how they had more than $70 in their possession, nor can they give any reasonable explanation for fleeing, having given their word that they would remain in baltimore.
but the pawnbroker says the mook who sold the chalice was white.
'maybe you can mistake white for hispanic, 'but roc-roc isn't even light-skinned.
i still have some reports to transcribe on those two priests.
what are you doing here in the middle of a red ball?
i never sold nothin' to no hock store, and i ain't never killed no one.
'well, if you didn't, then the guys who put you in did.
what do you think god will do to those who cut down two of his crew?
what will god do to someone who knew about the deed and then lied?
that's cold work to ask a good man for a meal.
then while he's preparing the food, butcher him for a few dollars.
the end of the day, i ain't got no cash, no one, not you, not no priest, not no god's gonna step up for me.
i'd like to see his heavenly ass down on the west side takin' his chances with the rest o' us niggers.
death ain't gonna find roc-roc laying' there with white hair and wrinkles in his own bed.
he's gonna die young and hard, just like the guys in the freezer.
it's just a bunch of clothing the kids have grown out of.
i was just going to take it over to the yard sale.
any misgivings you had about spg should've been aired weeks ago.
if we reverse our position now we are going to look very foolish indeed.
if you were incorrect in that assessment and wish to admit that before the board that might carry some weight.
you want me to fall on my sword in front of the board of directors.
it seems silly for me to be paying rent especially when i'm spending every night at your place.
jerry, get mud mats down before somebody slips and kills themselves.
is this about getting even for things i did a long time ago?
this is about me needing some time and you being pissed that things aren't working out as planned.
you're the one that wants to turn this er into a cost-effective operation.
you couldn't anticipate what would be needed to make it profitable?
mary, sit down here and let dr. weaver examine you, okay?
if you go home it could be very bad for your baby.
you love your baby and you don't want anything bad to happen, right?
so let me look, and we can talk about what we should do.
they don't drive because they don't read well enough to pass the test.
they have a place, but i do their bills and remind them to do their laundry.

one of the accused, mary easty, ran for the church to profess her innocence.
suddenly, there was a clap of thunder, and she was struck by a bolt of lightning.
i've only just taken over the house from my father, so i'm very protective of it.
but, you know, i liked what you did at the museum, attracting a younger market.
i mean, it's totally consistent with what i wanna do here.
it's just that, you know, all these qualifications aside, it's very important to me that whoever i hire truly wants to be here.
rushing off to work, going out on bad dates, buying shoes.
then, suddenly, we wake up one day and everything is different.
this gift if it wasn't to do good things with it.
to protect the innocent, just like the book of shadows says.
but then i started asking her some questions, things only brittany would know.
she may be senile, but it was enough to convince me.
"javna feeds one week out of every year, stealing the life force from the young."
"by invoking a black-magic power of the evil eye to gain eternal youth."
it says that the prophet muhammad invoked it centuries ago to banish javna back to wherever the hell he came from.
yeah, well, the problem is, we don't know who javna really is, let alone where he is.
you can't intentionally use the powers for your own personal gain, remember?
it's a good thing i didn't take the tags off that dress.
yeah, you know it's just that i'm really late for this interview.
i didn't mean for what happened last night to happen, prue.
but, you know, i liked what you did at the museum, attracting a younger market.
i mean, it's totally consistent with what i wanna do here.
remind me, i wanted to do this for a living, right?
looks like you're the only one who'll be doing anything for a living.
to protect the innocent, just like the book of shadows says.
besides, if anyone should be concerned with being bad, it's me, right?
it's a good thing i didn't take the tags off that dress.
oh, well, at least the old couple didn't lose their house.

i'm not in charge of the whole er, i'm in charge of the pedes er.
doug. "all pediatric patients must be seen by dr. ross prior to discharge.
dr. ross will conduct a daily review on all pediatric patients. "
i should've supervised you and not let you get to that place.
from now on, we'll just take it one step at a time.
- she has a bruise that's often associated with small bowel injuries.
we'll do a cat scan of the belly, but she may need exploratory surgery.
we are not going to waste time training er docs on equipment they'll use once a year.
if we had the saw, we could give midline thoracotomies for all penetrating chest traumas.
long, long ago on a small island in a corner of asia, there was a warlord.
this warlord was very fond of women and used his status to procure whatever he pleased...
somebody is leaving tortured grooms by takebashi gate spreading bad rumors about the princess.
people are saying that princess sen is a vicious whore who sends men to hell.
i feel bad that people think princess sen is involved with all these nobodies...
he is a horse's ass, but the lord of aizu will make for better rumors.
i will give you my head in place of my lord in exchange for those of the remaining girls and hannya.
i want the heads of akinari and his two remaining men.
he is the son of the tokugawa sword master tajima yagyu.
tajima is not just a sword master he has the total confidence of the shogunate.
do you think that you could possibly mention my new night club on your show tomorrow?
uh, well, actually most of my viewers are aged two to seven, so...
i want to introduce you to a new friend of mine.
she works in the same office as miss panda, and her name is gina giraffe.
would you like to come over to my house and play?
now is that giraffe a bit slutty, or is it just me?
but for safety's sake you might want to take some of that money and throw it out of an airplane.
yeah, laugh all you want, but you know this club is gonna bring back the glory days of studio 54.
because i was late for my date last night with steven.
do you think this is his way of telling me that it really bothered him?
do you think that you could possibly mention my new night club on your show tomorrow?
uh, well, actually most of my viewers are aged two to seven, so...

years ago, i'm in chicago on business, and everybody's telling me about the ribs at this place called twin anchors.
well, i walk all over that damn city, and i can't find it, so...
i'm five minutes late-- his head's rolling down the street like a soccer ball.
well, we'll be meeting up around 7 if you wanna go.
did you know you can't take a monkey on the subway?
yeah, bet you can't take half of what's in your purse on an airplane.
years ago, i'm in chicago on business, and everybody's telling me about the ribs at this place called twin anchors.
well, i walk all over that damn city, and i can't find it, so...
i'm five minutes late- his head's rolling down the street like a soccer ball.
well, we'll be meeting up around 7 if you wanna go.
i'm sure those restrictive pants will be the envy of all the other monkeys.
well, the important thing is jack is going to love him.
the hero's name is maleekwa, a descendant from the black tribe... that established the first society on the planet, while you european motherfuckers were still hiding' in caves and shit, all terrified of the sun.
he's a strong role model that a young black reader can look up to, 'cause i'm here to tell ya:
how do you manage to get away with this all the time?
i mean, shouldn't the cops be busting your head open right about now?
these boys do bluntman chronic, which outsells both of our books put together.
hence, they're never on the panel with the likes of us.
'cause he wanted them both at the same time, you assholes!
he didn't choose one, because he was trying to get them into a three-way.
this, uh, this nun was teaching us about the blessed trinity, you know?
she was going on and on about the three persons in one god thing.
well, it all goes back to somethin' my grandmother told me when i was a kid.
"holden," she said, "the big bucks are in dick and fart jokes. "
the cry from the heart of a real artist trapped in commercial hell, pitying his good fortune.
i'm sure you can dry your eyes on all those fat checks you rake in.
so, she's here tonight, and i think if we all beg her... or maybe offer her some "x,"
she'll come up here and treat us to some of her vocal stylings.
my mother brought me up to believe... if i can't do something right, i shouldn't do it at all.
of course, my father told me she gave lousy head, but that's beside the point.
and, so, most of the time, they just lay there frozen like a deer in headlights.
i mean, not for nothin', but when a chick goes down on me,
junior year, i'm goin'down on cynthia slater in her dorm room.
i'm totally drunk, and in the middle of it, i fall asleep right in her lap.
it's just been some time since i've been exposed to a man that didn't... immediately live into a stereotype of some sort.
and i want you to feel comfortable with me, because i'd really like us to be friends.
you are the epitome of everything i have ever looked for in another human being.
and i know that you think of me as just a friend, and crossing that line is the furthest thing from an option... you would ever consider, but...
i can't talk to you without wanting to express my love for everything you are.
and i know this will probably queer our friendship... no pun intended...
and if there's a moment of hesitation, then that means you feel something too.
and all i ask, please, is that you just... you just not dismiss that and try to dwell in it for just ten seconds.
there isn't another soul on this fucking planet... who has ever made me half the person i am when i'm with you.
and i would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau, because it is there between you and me.
even if we never talk again after tonight, please know that i am forever changed... because of who you are and what you've meant to me, which, while i do appreciate it,
i'd never need a painting of birds bought at a diner to remind me of.
when you are walking in a mall and your heads turn at a nice-looking chick, it's gonna eat you up inside.
you'll spend most of your time wondering when the other shoe's gonna drop.
men and women should be together, it's the natural way, that kind of thing.
i'm not with you because of what family, society, life... tried to instill in me from day one.
and while i was falling for you i put a ceiling on that, because you were a guy.
until i remembered why i opened the door to women in the first place:
i'm telling you, she's never even been with a guy, much less these two fuckin' zeroes.
and the bitch could be a bigger germ farm than that monkey in outbreak!
and i swear to god, if i ever hear you so much as fucking mention...
alyssa looks a little peaked, i'll put your fucking teeth down your throat!
this latest episode between you and miss thing has tapped into that.
in his warped perception, he lost you to the "dark side," which is she.
then he's barkin' up the wrong tree if he wants to split you up, isn't he?
he's not gonna make you see the error of your ways... by pointing out how truly gay she's not.
i gotta deal with bein' a minority in the minority of the minority, and nobody's supportin' my ass.
while the whole of society's fawning over giris-on-giris, here i sit, a reviled gay man.
i took a 26-year-old guy to my senior prom... and left to have sex with him and gwen turner in the back of a limo.
how about in college when i let shannon hamilton videotape us having sex, only to find out he broadcast it on the campus cable station.
and how dare you lay a guilt trip on me about it, in public, no less?
who the fuck do you think you are, you judgmental prick?
feel whatever the fuck you want to about it, all right?
the only thing that matters is how you feel about me.
"what the fuck is your problem?" and she's just calmly trying to tell me,
"it was that time, that place," and she doesn't think she should apologize... because she doesn't feel that she's done anything wrong.
she wasn't lookin' for that guy anymore, she was lookin' for me, for the bob.
but by the time i figured this all out, it's too late, man.
you guys are probably wondering why i asked you here at the same time... knowing that we have shit to settle between us separately.
i just figured you wanted to kill two birds with one stone.
now, i've been going over and over and over this whole thing, and i've dissected it a thousand different ways.
banky, there's tension between you and i for the first time in our lives.
and that would explain your jealousy of alyssa, your homophobia, your sense of humor...
jesus, just 'cause a guy's got a predilection toward dick jokes...
alyssa, with you, i won't feel too inadequate or conservative anymore, because i'll have done something on a par with all your experience.
and it will be with you, which will make it that much more powerful.
we've been everything to each other but intimates, and now we'll have been through that together too.
and it won't be a total leap for you because a woman will be involved.
and when it's over we'll be the strongest we've ever been... 'cause we'll have been through this together.
then we'll be on the same level and there'll be nothing we can't accomplish.
you'll grow to blame and hate me for the deterioration of your friendship.
or what if... and god, i sincerely doubt it... but what if i saw something in banky that i've never seen before, you know, and i fell in love with him and left you?
and we got into a fight over who looked better in bare legs, electra or robin.
anyway, i disbanded the club and struck out on my own, kinda like nomad.
#she's a bit like a book i'm too farsighted to read #
#and i wish you the best but sometimes feel the need #
ah, i've pretended to change, but i've only been fooling myself.
look, everybody worries about fitting in, but it's no big deal.
i'm more of a doer... but farrell was a good guy.
i mean, his quizzes were hard, but they prepared us for the hardest test of all.
dennis, i see this magazine as my castle, and you are, for lack of a better word, my gargoyle.
what i'm trying to say is, you have to make the staff respect you the same way they respect me.
okay, so, uh... what do you want this suit to say?
it's for a memorial service, so i want it to say i'll be sad for an hour, but then, on my way back to town,
look, as you can see, we have no shortage of customers here.
if your friends are hurt, bring them in, and we'll eventually see them.
more controversy today from the independent folks who live in santa monica.
this morning, california president, charlton heston, stuck out his political neck, when he said that the citizens there do not have to carry firearms if they do not want to.
i'm afraid i have some good news and some bad news.
the good news is mr. brown suffered only a mild concussion, some bruises, but he should be okay.
i'll be pressing my new friends for the final piece of evidence, and then at long last, we can make our move.
i know we're supposed to bring the subject back for trial.
british prime minister, margaret thatcher, signed a non-aggression pact with the kromagg dynasty.
in return for rights to the north sea oil fields, the kromaggs agreed not to invade great britain.
i think it means that the same god is in all these worlds.
you know, i must say that it hasn't been easy for me of late.
dr. helen donovan was a notorious thatcher doctor at the magg evacuation center in belgium.
british special service has inserted teams into california to seek out and arrest fugitive thatchers.
she was known as the personal physician to the kromagg high commander in the european theater.
and she may perhaps have been more than that to him.
and on that particular world, that rembrandt brown was a big star.
although there are some of us who feel that this rembrandt brown is a big star.
you know, i hate doing the checkbook, but i do it anyway.
do you know why i do it even though i hate it?
it was like a big foot or a yeti or something.
he came at us, so rachel used a bug bomb on him.
you know, you always stick up for the people we fog.
you might not remember us, but we're the girls that fogged you.
so i got to keep my emotions right at the surface.
i got a lot of balls in the air, you know?
look, just because i know about you two, doesn't mean i like looking at it.
aren't you supposed to be at an audition for another hour?
he was like a, like a bigfoot or a yeti or something!
and he came at us with an axe, so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him!
to tell you the truth, i wish i didn't have to move.
uhh, are you saying that you're not entirely happy about this?
how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married!
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work!
if you just kept this to yourself none of this would've happened.
well, i'm keeping so many things to myself these days, something was bound to slip out!
come on, you got the shopping bags and the sack's catalog.
so from that you think you've got me all figured out?
and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement!
you can't even open up your mind for a second to see if you're wrong!
look, i'm-i'm moving for you, i'm cutting friends out of my life for you.
please, just get on the plane and come to new york.
okay, you'll see you're the only person i want to be with.
i'll feel better when i'm there, and i can know where you are all the time.

if i pretend to not know about you then you pretend there's nothing to know.
i have a fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.
just filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour.

plus, i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animals suffered to make.

he came at us with an ax, so rachel had to use the bug bomb on him.

it must feel a little uncomfortable around anniversary time 'cause it's like a symbol of failure for you.
one day a year when you really know... when it hits home that...
what i want you to know is that you are not responsible in any way for the failure of my marriage.
in fact, i think your mother would've left me earlier if it wasn't for you!
i just want to walk up, smack 'em, drag 'em in the back of my van and tell 'em "that is not possible".
i can't believe that many women really think they can overtake an attacker...
i mean, it's such a big news that you can't even do it...
if you go for a pizza, with your friends and you pass on it suddenly you're anorexic.
yes, because i think that the social aspect of the time that you and i spend together is not productive time.
are you trying to tell me to get off your lap?
i think, as a new year's r esolution, you should r e-dedicate yourself to the idea that this is a team.
you play f or a team -- a team with many players.
-- individuals who f orsake their own individual needs to pursue a common goal -- the team goal.
in our case, the goal is a nightly national television show.
we ar e talking with casey mccall, co-host of "sports night, "
which can be seen every night at 11:00 p.m. on csc.

- you gotta let us know when it's one of those days, and we'll fight him f or you.
you gotta stop thinking of me as the champion of all things black.
i think you hurt the f eelings of the woman i work f or.
her name is maur een, and she's been working her e since the day you started.
you'r e not expected to know what shirt goes with what suit or how a color in a necktie can pick up your eyes.
you'r e not expected to know what -- what's gonna clash with what dan's wearing or what pattern's gonna bleed when dave changes the lighting.
mr. mccall, you get so much attention and so much praise f or what you actually do, and all of it's deserved.
when you go on a talk show and get complimented on something you didn't, how hard would it be to say, "that's not me.
"that's a woman named maur een who's been working f or us since the first day.
"it's maur een who dr esses me every night, and without maur een, i wouldn't know gunmetal f rom a hole in the ground"?
do you have any idea what that would've meant to her?
[ sighs ] do you have any idea how many times she would've played that tape f or her husband and her kids?
her e's what we'r e gonna do -- we'r e gonna make a list of all the sports moments that ar e potential plays of the year.
then we'r e gonna list the pros, and then we'r e gonna list the "cons."
but i can't imagine that any of them would feel anything but shame and humiliation at the sight of me playing f ootball under that flag.
i wish no disrespect to my school, my fellow students, or my teammates.
luther can hire someone half my age to do my job.
i like my lif e right now, and i'm proud of this show.
you don't think if luther ever showed you the door ther e wouldn't be about a hundr ed people lined up right behind you?

this afternoon, an extraordinary young man named roland shepard made what had to have been an ex cruciating decision.
he said he wasn't playing f ootball under a conf ederate flag.
six of his teammates then chose not to let shepard stand alone.
you've got to call chancellor blake and tell him to take down that flag or he can stop looking f or your checks in the mail.
you've got to put these young men back in a classroom, and i mean pronto.
these boys ar e gonna make you proud one day, luther.
i challenge you to do the right thing -- not an unr easonable r equest to make of a man whose alma mater declar es,

a plasma conduit exploded before you got 15 metres down the corridor.
that's where mcconnell and i found you when we had to abandon ship.
- l saw a few escape pods leaving the ship just before it exploded, but i had my hands full just trying to keep us in one piece.
the engines were damaged from the shock waves and i set us down here, wherever "here" is.

how is everybody on what i'm sure you're once again calling deep space 9?
if you want me to tell you what you want to hear, just say so.
i hope they told you that my policies toward the bajorans were generous.
but without you the war will be lost and cardassia will lie in ruins.
don't let this one man stand in the way of your final triumph.
you know, when i was out there in the shuttle just now it occurred to me that the bajorans would be very confused if they could see us here, sharing the same food, the same hardships.
what would they say if they knew the emissary of the prophets and the evil gul dukat
i have been vilified... by ignorant, small-minded people throughout the quadrant for the past six years.
i just want to know if you're one of them, benjamin.
he really thinks you're a cold-blooded killer and so do i.
i don't care what you think, so i suggest you keep your opinions to yourself.

does the synod intend to live up to it's agreement to make quo'on available to meet with me?
is it not common for your most valued humans to have their associates screen their requests?
well, i deal directly with the president of the united states, not someone on his staff.
i just expect the same respect from the head of the taelon synod.
i will escort you to quo'on, to the taelon home ship.
the probe discerns the target's structure and applies appropriate force to destroy it within a nanosecond.
the taelons will determine what is acceptable, mr. doors, not you.

when i had gotten a hold of a real ganymede rock lobster i had hid it in the fridge in the stockroom so no one else would eat it.

this is the sound of a moving train in yun nan, china.
i had to cope with both my former assignment, and the new one which jumped in.
it's been so chaotic that i haven't had time to record my diary.
i've been busy as hell and don't remember what i've been doing these past few days.
i even had a wild wish that the airplane would fly slower.
anyway, i came to china for the first time and am now on a train.
if i keep riding this train, it would go to cheng du.
our so-called destination... for us foreigners it's in the restricted area, isn't it?

i lost my things in the mountains and there are no spare batteries in this god forsaken place.
i didn't stake my life to come here in search of the truth or anything!
but i was able to meet all those people here in the yun nan mountains and came across that song!
i returned to that village once again but was not able to settle there for the rest of my life.

since then, i haven't done it for such a iong time but can i still fly?
it's been so chaotic that i haven't had time to record my diary.
things have finally settled a bit now, that's why i am recording this.
i would be lying if i said i were confident about it.
i've been busy as hell and don't remember what i've been doing these past few days.
i even had a wild wish that the airplane would fly slower.
anyway, i came to china for the first time and am now on a train.
there i am supposed to meet the guide who knows about the vein of jade.
i hear his english is hopeless, but is fluent in japanese.
but finally gave us word that you'd pay back with this precious stone or something.
you brought us this story about a vein of precious stones.
our so-called destination... for us foreigners it's in the restricted area, isn't it?
in such a place would it be possible to do business?
i didn't stake my life to come here in search of the truth or anything!
but i was able to meet all those people here in the yun nan mountains and came across that song!
i returned to that village once again but was not able to settle there for the rest of my life.
and again i slept thousands of times but i have never seen a dream of myself flying.
since then, i haven't done it for such a long time but can i still fly?
i feel it is so strange that i cannot dream of what i actually did.
when we find a doctor what are we supposed to say?
we've got a pregnant guy in room 104 who's going to drop a pup?
but as you lie here squirming in agony i'm reminded with every anguished grunt and tortured scream that you've matured into a real man.
the kind of man i can have an honest relationship with.
two chairs, two sofas, two matching ashtrays on two matching coffee tables.
hoskins was just saying the guy lived here with his brother.
but inside you're a red hot biker guy just waiting to break out.
well, like bayliss says, my outer self is no longer representative of my inner self, i need a change.
david and adam lived together, they worked together, they ate together, watched television together, went to bed at the same time.
this past summer david took me away for the weekend, a beautiful bed and breakfast in vermont.
listen, the nurse told us that scotty bled to death before he got here.
so if you drove him here after he got shot and there wasn't much traffic, what is it that took so long?
i have a 17-year-old boy lying in the morgue, nothing else.
you walk away from me right now, i've got less than nothing.
yeah, so she's already got lewis and falsone panting after her.
if you want to impress rene, treat her like a detective first.
no, he was shot with exactly the same type of weapon as his own gun, the gun he had himself.
i didn't think nothing of it, but you said it yourself at the crime scene.
hey, you know, every day i try to be a better father to my son than my old man was to me.
but i gotta tell you, most of the time i'm not sure i'm doing the right thing.
after all these years we still matter in each other's lives.
i just wish we could find a way to say that without hurting each other.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
""the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners.""
- when i was just a little boy l stood up to my daddy's knee -
- my papa said, son don't let the man get ya -
why, that's the best news i heard in a dog's age.
now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.
there's a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.
the receiver goes all the way over there to the left.
0nce the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.
i am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
but you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.
i would've gotten my daddy some water, but i was just a little baby inside mama's stomach.
and now you wanna take away the only part of my robert i have left.
coach, my bobby's a sweet boy, but he ain't exactly what you'd call ""college material,""
so don't you go filling' his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently, i'm gonna have to say captain insano.
0kay, okay, i want you to do to casey... what captain insano does to the bad guy.
the medulla oblongata... is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.
now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from ?
all right, let's hear what mama has to say on the subject.
mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin' blue.
with the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.
- there's blood in the streets lt's up to my ankles -
- there's blood in the streets lt's up to my knee -
- blood on the streets in the town of chicago -
now, just do whatever you did to colonel sanders, and you'll be fine.
l-l will, thank you. l-l-l just-- l feel bad about lying' to my mama.
and to tell you the truth, i don't think much of you... and all your snotty questions, miss vallencourt.
i'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.
and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
what exactly are they putting in the water... down in jackson's bayou, louisiana ?
[ announcer ] we're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
- take me and break me off baby, let me play the clothes and i'll take me off 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand -
- and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan -
- you ask me why perfect practise makes perfect game - [ rap continues ]
- sit-ups and pull-ups 92 octane, premium, fill up l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing -
- who got the only sweetest thing in the world - -
- who got the hooch, baby - - [ snoring ]
- who got the only sweetest thing in the world -
- who got the love who got the freshy freshy -
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
yeah, but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game.
with yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars... in the first annual bourbon bowl.
but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in ?
well, i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas.
don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin' there all grouchy.
mama, i gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else i can't play foot--
and she showed me her boobies, and i liked them too !
the louisiana high school equivalency examination... consists of 300 multiple choice questions.
i told the coach that i'd drive to the game with him.
[ tyres screeching ] i was with you from two to four last night.
everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.
mama is the only one who really cares if i live or die.
bobby boucher, all these folks are here tonight... to tell you that they're sorry-- that they're sorry for not supporting' you... when it meant the most.
but you do have friends, and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.
the good lord chose not to bless me with-- with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and--
and the big story here, dan, is a game that's lost some of its lustre... without its star player, the waterboy bobby boucher.
you know, red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there.
and the mud dogs offence is still unable to move that ball.
but the way their defence is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.
it's brilliant, because red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
by kneeling down three times and punting, he's gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
- [ whistle blows ] - [ man ] mud dogs call a time-out.
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs !
right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, lynn swann.
well, brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like fridge used to do for the bears.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
- dan, i'm not sure that boucher is able to get back up.
he'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.
[ musburger ] and dan, bobby boucher is back on the field.
- l don't remember what day it was l didn't notice what time it was -
- all i know is that i fell in love with you -
- and if all my dreams come true l'll be spending time with you -
- every day's a new day ln love with you -
- and if all my dreams come true l'll be spending time with you 0h, i love you more today than yesterday -
- but not as much as tomorrow 0h, i love you more today than yesterday -
maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy to the old case downstairs.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
* when i was just a little boy * * l stood up to my daddy's knee *
* my papa said, son don't let the man get ya * * and do what he done to me *
why, that's the best news i heard in a dog's age.
now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
- he gives the ball-- no, he doesn't get the ball.
the receiver goes all the way over there to the left.
i am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
but you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.
you see, my husband robert, one day back in 1966, pick up sticks, and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.
he decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.
and now you wanna take away the only part of my robert i have left.
but don't you want the only part you've got left to get a college education ?
i want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you.
and then i want you to attack. i want you to visualize and then attack.
the medulla oblongata... is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.
now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from ?
all right, let's hear what mama has to say on the subject.

and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
what exactly are they putting in the water... down in jackson's bayou, louisiana ?
[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
there are 40 of you on this team, not just one.
* take me and break me off baby, let me play the clothes and i'll take me off *
* 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand * * and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan *
* sit-ups and pull-ups 92 octane, premium, fill up * * l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing * * l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing * * l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing *
* l'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing *
that's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.
so what i do is, l-l start tackling' the quarterback, unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else, in which case, l-l try to tackle that person.
but i suppose i ought to be movin' on before i get you in trouble with your mama.
well, mr coach klein said that what mama don't know won't hurt her.
* who got the only sweetest thing in the world *
- * who got the hooch, baby * - [ snoring ]
* who got the only sweetest thing in the world *
* who got the love who got the freshy freshy *
well, if that was your first kiss, then i bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.
yes, yes, that is a-another first for me, and l-l appreciate what-what-what you're showin' me right now.
[ announcer ] lt looks like the cinderella s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs, led by linebacker bobby boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid.
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
yeah, but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game.
let's take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes' last drive.
with yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars... in the first annual bourbon bowl.
but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
[ vicki ] yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.
this is not how ambassadors for the university of louisiana are supposed to act.
this is his transcript from south lafayette high school... in cherokee plains, louisiana.
now, the problem with that... is there ain't no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains, louisiana.
twenty years ago, we were assistants to coach cavanaugh... at the university of louisiana.
red ran the practices, and i used to come up with the plays.
well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in ?
well, i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas.
and i'm gonna keep doin' them both because they make me feel good !
and by the way, mama, alligators are ornery... because of their medulla oblongata !
i told the coach that i'd drive to the game with him.
[ tyres screeching ] i was with you from two to four last night.
everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.

- [ whistle blowing ] - [ fouts ] and what a dumb penalty.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
[ fouts ] yeah, this is a real gutsy call, brent.
he'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.
now, you go on and have some fun becoming a man.

so don't you go filling' his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
- [ mumbling ] - [ coach klein ] all right, we have an announcement to make.
our former waterboy, bobby boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.
well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently, i'm gonna have to say captain insano.
okay, okay, i want you to do to casey... what captain insano does to the bad guy.
now, last week, we talked about... the physiology of the animal brain... as it pertains to aggression.
now, is there anyone here that can tell me why... most alligators are abnormally aggressive ?
mama says that alligators are ornery... 'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.
[ chuckling ] yo mama said, alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth... and no toothbrush.
[ announcer ] well, mud dog fans, it's time to kick off... another year of mud dog football.
with the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.
* there's blood in the streets lt's up to my ankles *
* there's blood in the streets lt's up to my knee *
in the mud dog's latest loss this past saturday, the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new n.c.a.a. record... by sacking the quarterback 16 times, shattering the old record of seven.
and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
* they call the rising sun ** [ announcer ] we're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off, and that will lead to a lot more victories.
- yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game.
* 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand * * and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan *
* you ask me why perfect practise makes perfect game *
- * who got the hooch, baby * - [ snoring ]

iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
yeah, but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game.
- [ cheering ] - [ announcer ] and my friend, chris, the mud dogs are goin' to the bourbon bowl.
with yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars... in the first annual bourbon bowl.
but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
in fact, yesterday, michigan, devastated by injury, experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.
[ vicki ] yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.

with the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.
# there's blood in the streets it's up to my ankles #
# there's blood in the streets it's up to my knee #
in the mud dog's latest loss this past saturday, the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new n.c.a.a. record... by sacking the quarterback 16 times, shattering the old record of seven.
and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
# take me and break me off baby, let me play the clothes and i'll take me off #
# 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand #
# and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan #
# you ask me why perfect practice makes perfect game #
# i'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing #
# i'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing #
# i'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing #
# i'm doin' my thing for much more than the thing #
that's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.
so what i do is, i-i start tackling' the quarterback, unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else, in which case, i-i try to tackle that person.
but i suppose i ought to be movin' on before i get you in trouble with your mama.
well, mr. coach klein said that what mama don't know won't hurt her.
# who got the only sweetest thing in the world #
# who got the love who got the freshy freshy #
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
yeah, but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game.
let's take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes' last drive.
let's take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes' last drive.
with yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars... in the first annual bourbon bowl.
but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
twenty years ago, we were assistants to coach cavanaugh... at the university of louisiana.
red ran the practices, and i used to come up with the plays.
and i'm gonna keep doin' them both because they make me feel good!
and by the way, mama, alligators are ornery... because of their medulla oblongata!
when we get a little more time, i'll welcome you properly.
yes, once again, i'm not quite sure what that means, but...
bobby boucher, all these folks are here tonight... to tell you that they're sorry... that they're sorry for not supporting' you... when it meant the most.
but you do have friends, and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.
the good lord chose not to bless me with... with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and...
and the mud dogs offense is still unable to move that ball.
but the way their defense is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.
[musburger] well, the mud dog's most valuable player, the linebacker they call "the waterboy," is now powerless.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
- dan, i'm not sure that boucher is able to get back up.
- # every day's a new day # - # every day #
- # every time i love ya # - # every day #
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
"the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners."
the receiver goes all the way over there to the left.
0nce the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.
i am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
but you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.
i would've gotten my daddy some water, but i was just a little baby inside mama's stomach.
and now you wanna take away the only part of my robert i have left.
coach, my bobby's a sweet boy, but he ain't exactly what you'd call "college material,"
so don't you go filling' his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
- [mumbling] - [coach klein] all right, we have an announcement to make.
0ur former waterboy, bobby boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.
now, last week, we talked about... the physiology of the animal brain... as it pertains to aggression.
now, is there anyone here that can tell me why... most alligators are abnormally aggressive?
mama says that alligators are ornery... 'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.

well, if that was your first kiss, then i bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.
yes, yes, that is a-another first for me, and l-i appreciate what-what-what you're showin' me right now.
[announcer] it looks like the cinderella s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs, led by linebacker bobby boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid.
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

[vicki] yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.
this is not how ambassadors for the university of louisiana are supposed to act.
this is his transcript from south lafayette high school... in cherokee plains, louisiana.
now, the problem with that... is there ain't no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains, louisiana.
well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in?
well, i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas.
don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin' there all grouchy.
mama, i gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else i can't play foot... ball.
and she showed me her boobies, and i liked them too!
the louisiana high school equivalency examination... consists of 300 multiple choice questions.
when we get a little more time, i'll welcome you properly.

you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and...
it's brilliant, because red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
by kneeling down three times and punting, he's gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him.
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!
right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, lynn swann.
well, brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like fridge used to do for the bears.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
- dan, i'm not sure that boucher is able to get back up.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
"the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners."
any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, red ?
i may have a couple squirrelled away in there... for a rainy day.
listen, you-you could think what you want a-about my personal hygiene, but, please, don't-don't waste any water.
that-that's bad policy. lf you need to amuse yourself at my expense, just-just rough me up or something.
[ man ] get out of the way, you moron !
* when i was just a little boy * * l stood up to my daddy's knee *
it's just that... i lost my position as the team's water distribution engineer.
why, that's the best news i heard in a dog's age.
now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
yes, but-- l-l was-- l was thinkin', mama, maybe l-l could-- l could try to-to get another waterboy job for-for a different team.
* that your life is a gift * * and my mama said *
* this much weight you will lift * * and my mama said leave those bad boys alone *
two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.
there's a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.

our former waterboy, bobby boucher, is gonna play some linebacker for us.
well, even though he was slightly discourteous to me recently, i'm gonna have to say captain insano.
okay, okay, i want you to do to casey... what captain insano does to the bad guy.

* they call the rising sun ** [ announcer ] we're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off, and that will lead to a lot more victories.
- yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game.
* 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand * * and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan *
* you ask me why perfect practise makes perfect game *
- * who got the hooch, baby * - [ snoring ]

but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
in fact, yesterday, michigan, devastated by injury, experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.
[ vicki ] yeah, well, your team actin' like a bunch of shitheads.
this is not how ambassadors for the university of louisiana are supposed to act.

[ tyres screeching ] i was with you from two to four last night.
everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.
mama is the only one who really cares if i live or die.
bobby boucher, all these folks are here tonight... to tell you that they're sorry-- that they're sorry for not supporting' you... when it meant the most.

the good lord chose not to bless me with-- with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and--
and the big story here, dan, is a game that's lost some of its lustre... without its star player, the waterboy bobby boucher.
you know, red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there.
and the mud dogs offence is still unable to move that ball.
but the way their defence is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.
it's brilliant, because red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
by kneeling down three times and punting, he's gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
- [ whistle blows ] - [ man ] mud dogs call a time-out.
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs !
right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, lynn swann.
well, brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like fridge used to do for the bears.
- [ whistle blowing ] - [ fouts ] and what a dumb penalty.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
[ fouts ] yeah, this is a real gutsy call, brent.
he'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.
now, you go on and have some fun becoming a man.
* l don't remember what day it was * * l didn't notice what time it was *
* all i know is that i fell in love with you * * and if all my dreams come true * * l'll be spending time with you *

all right, let`s hear what mama has to say on the subject.
mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin` blue.
now, just do whatever you did to colonel sanders, and you`ll be fine.
l-l will, thank you. l-l-l just-- l feel bad about lyin` to my mama.
and to tell you the truth, i don`t think much of you... and all your snotty questions, miss vallencourt.

in the mud dog`s latest loss this past saturday, the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new n.c.a.a. record... by sacking the quarterback 16 times, shattering the old record of seven.

[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
there are 40 of you on this team, not just one.

but not only has the waterboy changed s.c.l.s.u.'s fortunes, he's got other teams looking around the sidelines for talent.
in fact, michigan, devastated by injury, experimented with their towel boy at wide receiver.
but the towel boy ran into a laundry list of problems.
you know, when i see so many of you here tonight, it reminds me just about how special this season really was.
this is his transcript from south lafayette high school in cherokee plains, louisiana.
now the problem with that is there ain't no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains, louisiana.
- well, you know that green notebook you use to write all them football plays in?
well, i need to show cavanaugh that i can come up with some good play ideas.
don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin' there all grouchy.
mama, i gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else i can't play foot...
and she showed me her boobies, and i liked them too!
the louisiana high school equivalency examination consists of 300 multiple choice questions.
when we get a little more time, i'll welcome you properly.
yes, once again, i'm not quite sure what that means, but...
everybody else in this town turn on me at the drop of a hat.
mama is the only one who really cares if i live or die.
how about the time he tackled the guy from louisville and threw him into the stands?
y'all remember when he intercepted the ball and his pants fell off?
the mud dogs offense is still unable to move that ball.
but the way their defense is fired up, they still have a shot at winning this game.
the mud dog's most valuable player, the linebacker they call "the waterboy," is now powerless.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
down by ten late in the fourth quarter, coach klein opts for the field goal.
they have to hope for the onside kick and a touchdown to tie the game.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
"the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners."
any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, red?
i may have a couple squirreled away in there... for a rainy day.
why, that's the best news i heard in a dog's age.
now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
two receivers lined up to the left, one to the right.
there's a flanker lined up to the left behind the quarterback.
i would've gotten my daddy some water, but i was just a little baby inside mama's stomach.
and now you wanna take away the only part of my robert i have left.
coach, my bobby's a sweet boy, but he ain't exactly what you'd call "college material,"
so don't you go filling' his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
the medulla oblongata... is where anger, jealousy and aggression come from.
now, is there anybody here can tell me where happiness comes from?
all right, let's hear what mama has to say on the subject.
mama say that happiness is from magic rays of sunshine that come down when you feelin' blue.
well, mud dog fans, it's time to kick off... another year of mud dog football.
with the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.
and by the way, i hope you like what i did to y'all lawn mower.
you know that old hag that does astrology on good morning america, she really ought to pack it in.
and to tell you the truth, i don't think much of you... and all your snotty questions, miss vallencourt.
i'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.
and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
what exactly are they putting in the water... down in jackson's bayou, louisiana?
that's when the c-center puts the ball in-into the hands of the quarterback.
so what i do is, i-i start tackling' the quarterback, unless he give the ball to-to s-somebody else, in which case, i-i try to tackle that person.
well, if that was your first kiss, then i bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.
yes, yes, that is a-another first for me, and i-i appreciate what-what-what you're showin' me right now.
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.
yeah, but the mud dogs have played a sensational football game.
let's take a look at the way boucher entered the hawkeyes' last drive.

with yesterday's come-from-behind victory, the s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs... earned a new year's day date with red beaulieu and the louisiana cougars... in the first annual bourbon bowl.

this is his transcript from south lafayette high school... in cherokee plains, louisiana.
now the problem with that... is there ain't no south lafayette high school in cherokee plains, louisiana.
twenty years ago, we were assistants to coach cavanaugh... at the university of louisiana.
red ran the practices, and i used to come up with the plays.
don't look like to me you enjoys it, sittin' there all grouchy.
mama, i gotta read this book and six other books tonight, or else i can't play foot... ball.
and i'm gonna keep doin' them both because they make me feel good!
and by the way, mama, alligators are ornery... because of their medulla oblongata!
bobby boucher, all these folks are here tonight... to tell you that they're sorry... that they're sorry for not supporting' you... when it meant the most.
but you do have friends, and one of 'em wants to say somethin'.
the good lord chose not to bless me with... with charm, athletic ability or a fully functional brain.
you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and...
and the big story here, dan, is a game that's lost some of its luster... without its star player, the waterboy bobby boucher.
you know, red's got a couple of solid early rounders out there.
well, the mud dog's most valuable player, the linebacker they call "the waterboy," is now powerless.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs!
right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, lynn swann.
well, brent, he's gotta find some way to neutralize the waterboy.
he probably thinks that meaney will just pound it in there like fridge used to do for the bears.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
- dan, i'm not sure that boucher is able to get back up.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
"the only thing better than a crawfish dinner is five crawfish dinners."
any unused magic in that legendary green playbook of yours, red ?
i may have a couple squirrelled away in there... for a rainy day.
listen, you-you could think what you want a-about my personal hygiene, but, please, don't-don't waste any water.
that-that's bad policy. lf you need to amuse yourself at my expense, just-just rough me up or something.
* when i was just a little boy * * l stood up to my daddy's knee *
* my papa said, son don't let the man get ya * * and do what he done to me *
why, that's the best news i heard in a dog's age.
now you be able to spend your days at home where you belong.
* that your life is a gift * * and my mama said *
* this much weight you will lift * * and my mama said leave those bad boys alone *
coach, my bobby's a sweet boy, but he ain't exactly what you'd call "college material,"
so don't you go filling' his simple head with all those crazy dreams... of school and college and things of that sort.
i want you to visualize all those people that have been mean to you.
and then i want you to attack. i want you to visualize and then attack.
[ announcer ] well, mud dog fans, it's time to kick off... another year of mud dog football.
with the weight of a 40-game losing streak on their back, everyone seems to be diggin' in for the long haul.
* there's blood in the streets lt's up to my ankles *
* there's blood in the streets lt's up to my knee *
and to tell you the truth, i don't think much of you... and all your snotty questions, miss vallencourt.
i'm quite disturbed to see that you're so interested in my boy.
- l want you to stay away from her, you hear me ?
now you come on inside before that little ol' witch casts a spell on us !
in the mud dog's latest loss this past saturday, the amazing 31-year-old freshman set a new n.c.a.a. record... by sacking the quarterback 16 times, shattering the old record of seven.
and, oh, by the way, bobby boucher is also the team's waterboy, which, of course, begs the question:
* they call the rising sun ** [ announcer ] we're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
[ coach klein ] we are one family with one dream.
* 'cause i've been checkin' out your style from across the stand * * and i'm much more than your waterboy and average fan *
* you ask me why perfect practise makes perfect game *
- * who got the hooch, baby * - [ snoring ]
* who got the only sweetest thing in the world *
well, if that was your first kiss, then i bet it's the first time you've seen a pair of these.
yes, yes, that is a-another first for me, and l-l appreciate what-what-what you're showin' me right now.
[ announcer ] lt looks like the cinderella s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs, led by linebacker bobby boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid.
iowa could win the game by nailing this 20-yard field goal.

you see, you're an inspiration... to all of us who, who weren't born handsome... and charming and cool and--
it's brilliant, because red is taking the waterboy out of the game.
by kneeling down three times and punting, he's gonna make the mud dog offence try to beat him.
that means coach klein will have to find another way to outfox red.
- [ whistle blows ] - [ man ] mud dogs call a time-out.
we go from a championship football team to a bunch of dogs !
right now, we're going to go down to the sidelines and our man, lynn swann.
- get in there and let's see if that waterboy can stop you.
red is sending his best defender in as a running back ?
- [ whistle blowing ] - [ fouts ] and what a dumb penalty.
that puts the mud dogs in field goal range for the tie.
he'll either be a hero or a goat because of this.
[ musburger ] and dan, bobby boucher is back on the field.
now, you go on and have some fun becoming a man.
* l don't remember what day it was * * l didn't notice what time it was *
* all i know is that i fell in love with you * * and if all my dreams come true * * l'll be spending time with you *
* every day's a new day * * ln love with you *
- * every time i love ya * - * every day *
- * every day's a new day * - * every day *
- * every time i love ya * - * every day *
- * every way's a new way * - * every day *
maybe good enough to add another national championship trophy to the old case downstairs.
that's kinda like my old man told me one time, lynn.
the receiver goes all the way over there to the left.
once the quarterback has the ball, he fakes to the left.
i am not telling you to go on a shooting rampage.
but you have to stand up for yourself, or they're gonna ride you all season long.
you see, my husband robert, one day back in 1966, pick up sticks, and me four months pregnant with this precious angel.
he decides he wants to go and help the foreign peoples.
and now you wanna take away the only part of my robert i have left.
but don't you want the only part you've got left to get a college education?
now, last week, we talked about... the physiology of the animal brain... as it pertains to aggression.
now is there anyone here that can tell me why... most alligators are abnormally aggressive?
mama says that alligators are ornery... 'cause they got all them teeth but no toothbrush.
yo mama said, alligators are ornery 'cause they got all them teeth... and no toothbrush.

what exactly are they putting in the water... down in jackson's bayou, louisiana?
we're deadlocked at three with less than a minute to go.
now that you finally won a game, right, you feel looser, the pressure is off, and that will lead to a lot more victories.
- yeah, that and a waterboy getting 20 sacks a game.
but i suppose i ought to be movin' on before i get you in trouble with your mama.
well, mr. coach klein said that what mama don't know won't hurt her.
it looks like the cinderella s.c.l.s.u. mud dogs, led by linebacker bobby boucher, are gonna fall one victory short of that bourbon bowl bid.

the relative human weight is less than the volume of water, which has to create buoyancy.
besides, the logic of fluid mechanics suggests stroking water will propel one forward...
your summer vacation starts tomorrow, so take care of yourselves and practice moderation.
the tadano festival's coming up after vacation, and i'm sure some of you will come to school to prepare.

- teacher, there are messages, that's for sure ...but i didn't get to them.
- gavranić did you, or did you not read the "myth about sysiphus"?
- teacher, i believe everything that this philosopher of ours says, he says for that sysiphus, that he is a stupid pragmatist.
- he's just rolling, yes and if he would think about it, only a little bit he would have once flatten the top of the hill so that, when he rolls up this stone up,it stands there

he declines the offer, sir, and says the letter is from the duke of belchite.
i assumed command of the schooner gave the order we should attempt to rake her.
now, of course, i knew our chances were slim but i took comfort from the fact they'd be forced to destroy their prize.
at the time, my mind was engaged in more important matters than arithmetic.
am i to presume, captain pellew that you would have surrendered?
should you do well you will already have two months' seniority.
do badly, and it's back with the midshipmen for six months at least.
and the jolly jacks aboard her wish that they could have their say
but they must keep their mouths tight shut atthough their thoughts be dark...
it is a clear and cloudless night and the wind blows steady and strong
and we have lain in gibrattar bay for many a day too long
given the choice between singing and weeping which would you fancy?
a good lieutenant gets to know the ways of his men.
that's why we're on half rations to keep them in their kingly ways.
if it weren't for the officers we'd be on two-thirds at least.
may i introduce the treasurer of his highness here to fetch the gold.
the gold, sir, is there, in the sternsheets of the longboat.
the fleet won't have us back not until we've served three weeks of quarantine.
now, that is three weeks after the last case has occurred.
like as not, they'll all be dead in a week and you'll lose the caroline.
true, but i must weigh that fact against the chance of supplies, mr. bracegirdle.
the cattle must be returned to my ship and these hands should accompany them!
now, surely you can give me these two scrawny beasts, mr. hornblower.
looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead and the life of the world to come through our lord, jesus christ who at his coming shall change our vile body that it may be like his glorious body
according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.
oh, no more than my fair share, and i've gained much in return.
a new acquaintance with the cuts of a bullock and the worth of full bellies for the men.
very well, we will continue this further when we reach shore.
we will, sir, when i shall expect an apology from you.
his excellency, the duke of belchite grandee of the first class
commander-in-chief of his catholic majesty's forces by land and by sea, knight of the most sacred order of the golden fleece,
indeed, but there are some who might consider his methods reckless.
well, i was merely a passenger on the schooner on my way to gibraltar to resume command of the dreadnought when this, this spanish frigate blocked our path.
am i to presume captain pellew that you would have surrendered?
this is neither the time or the place, sir, to discuss tactics.
and the jolly jacks aboard her wish that they could have their say.
but, they must keep their mouths tight shut although their thoughts be dark.
it is a clear and cloudless night and the wind was steady and strong.
and we have laid in gibraltar bay for many a day too long.
given the choice between singing and weeping, which would you fancy?
a good lieutenant gets to know the ways of his men.
they were mates on another ship when bunting was first pressed.
the way i heard it, finch helped him to settle down.
that's why we're on half rations to keep them in their kingly ways.
if it weren't for the officers, we'd be on two-thirds at least.
the gold, sir, is there, in the sternsheets of the longboat.
you will have a closer view of it when we have a closer view of the stores.
- the fleet won't have us back, not until we've served three weeks of quarantine.
now, that is three weeks after the last case has occurred.
if you have your heart set on dying, i will oblige.
then do it, and i will be forever in your debt.
i am aware of that, mr. hornblower, but your quarantine's almost over.
i am sure you can spare me a few head of cattle.
looking for the resurrection of the body when the sea shall give up her dead, and the life of the world to come through our lord, jesus christ;
who, at his coming, shall change our vile body that it may be like his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.
are we to receive the fountain of your wisdom, mr. hornblower.

well, i was merely a passenger on the schooner on my way to gibraltar to resume command of the dreadnought when this, this spanish frigate blocked our path.
we were out-manned and out-gunned, and should we have run, we should certainly have been outpaced.
i assumed command of the schooner, gave the order we should attempt to rake her.

you were supposed to be following us to pick us up, sir.
i thought at least i could rely on a brother captain.
in all my years at sea, i have witnessed many an act of courage,but that, sir, must rank amongst the most memorable.
my men owe you their lives, and i owe you my ship.
they've welded shut the air doors, disabled the tubes and the access wells.
they're dug in so deep it'll take forever to get them out again.
he let them stay here, he might be able to talk them out.
but he's up to his ears with ambassadors who are getting bushwhacked . by unknown parties turning their shipping lanes into killing zones and have started blaming each other.
they're not happy about the telepaths having found out most of their secrets.
for now they're more worried about the attacks, which represent a money problem.
that's only because they think all the teeps are holed up in brown sector.
and because they figure we'll kill the telepaths when we go in to dig them out.
what they don 't know, because i haven 't told them yet is that we think some of the telepaths got out before they closed off brown 12.
they could be anywhere on the station by now x-factors in this whole equation.
londo and g'kar are still on centauri prime preparing for londo 's rise to emperor . when their regent dies, so they're in no position to help.
i wonder if he could use a good starship captain right now.
then again, maybe i'm just cranky because i don't think anyone's gonna like my solution.
the god's honest truth is i don't think we're gonna get out of this without a lot of dead people on the deck.
i got another team doing the same thing in brown 9 as a distraction.
with any luck, before they know we're here we'll be inside.
i guess they're sensing where we are and they rush in steel plating and weld it to the other side.
but that takes time, more than it should take to burn through a door.
by the time we burn through they got 3-inch plating on the other side and we gotta start over or move on and hope we get through someplace else before they find us.
but a single telepath would have to be on a direct sightline to do that.
too thin for a lot of guys in flak jackets and fully armed.
captain like i was saying even if they could handle the weight only one person can crawl through at a time, especially at the end.
i saw it on a tray heading into the south end of the palace.
- i assumed no one would mind if i took it.
it's the last thing i remember before i awoke on the ship coming here.
they wanted us as trophies of their victory as slave labor and as entertainment.
finally, they searched through the old records and found the truth that 200 years before as winter came to an end the emperor's daughter saw the first flower growing up through the snow.
to keep anyone from walking on it she assigned a guard to stand watch over it every day.
after that she never gave it much thought, and thus never countermanded the order.
as a result every day for 200 years a guard would stand in that place long after the flower was gone.
there are probably two dozen dead drazi that would disagree with that assessment.
the drazi plan on introducing this at the next council meeting tomorrow.
of course, i could have been wrong, but it was worth the risk.
i don't know how much you've been following the news topside...
somebody's been attacking the shipping lines of the alliance worlds and they're looking for someone to lash out at.
when you threatened to reveal their secrets you got the full benefit of their paranoia.
if you care about your people you have to come out, and come out now.
if we have to come in after you, someone's gonna get hurt or killed.
they can have a ship standing by to intercept us midway to babylon 5 then take her home.
the hard part is still getting na'toth out of the palace and onto our ship first.
we have to do it without killing a guard without raising any alarms and without anyone noticing that she is gone.
for my next trick, i shall fly around the room under my own power.
this piece of debris was found at the site of one of the most recent attacks against our ships.
our scientists have analyzed and found it to be of brakiri origin.
we believe that the brakiri have been using the telepaths who spied on us to get information about our shipping lines and our defense systems.
we believe that they are working with us only so they can steal from us.
someone is hitting your people and leaving material they hope will implicate the rest of you.
someone is trying to divide the alliance sow distrust, make you lash out at each other.
we ask you to give us just a little more time.
we are gathering as much information as we can, as fast as we can.
the moment you joined the alliance you agreed that the alliance had jurisdiction over disputes between members.
one member race can't attack another without either leaving the alliance or suffering retaliation.
i will not condone any military action by any member world without clear and absolute proof.
if you're content to wait for proof, we will wait with you.
but he's up to his ears with ambassadors who are getting bushwhacked by unknown parties turning their shipping lanes into killing zones and have started blaming each other.
they're not happy about the telepaths having found out most of their secrets.
for now they're more worried about the attacks, which represent a money problem.
that's only because they think all the teeps are holed up in brown sector.
they could be anywhere on the station by now x-factors in this whole equation.
londo and g'kar are still on centauri prime preparing for londo's rise to emperor when their regent dies, so they're in no position to help.
i got another team doing the same thing in brown 9 as a distraction.
with any luck, before they know we're here we'll be inside.
i guess they're sensing where we are and they rush in steel plating and weld it to the other side.
but that takes time, more than it should take to burn through a door.
by the time we burn through they got 3-inch plating on the other side... and we gotta start the whole damn thing all over again or move on and hope we get through someplace else before they find us.
but a single telepath would have to be on a direct sightline to do that.
too thin for a lot of guys in flak jackets and fully armed.
captain like i was saying even if they could handle the weight only one person can crawl through at a time, especially at the end.
i saw it on a tray heading into the south end of the palace.
- i assumed no one would mind if i took it.
it's the last thing i remember before i awoke on the ship coming here.
they wanted us as trophies of their victory as slave labor and as entertainment.
finally, they searched through the old records and found the truth that 200 years before as winter came to an end the emperor's daughter saw the first flower growing up through the snow.

after that she never gave it much thought, and thus never countermanded the order.
as a result every day for 200 years a guard would stand in that place long after the flower was gone.
there are probably two dozen dead drazi... that would disagree with that assessment right about now.
the drazi plan on introducing this at the next council meeting tomorrow.

we may be his only hope and the only hope of our kind.
one member race can't attack another without either leaving the alliance or suffering retaliation.
we refuse to allow border disputes and skirmishes to tear us apart.
there's a lot of speculation, but there's no direct evidence that anyone in the alliance is responsible for these attacks.
i will not condone any military action by any member world without clear and absolute proof.
if you're content to wait for proof, we will wait with you.
and once the truth is known, we will support any action you choose to take as part of an overall response by the alliance.

well we've got maintenance ducts all through here, but they're pretty fragile.
too thin for a lot of guys in flak jackets and fully armed.
when i was still new to the royal palace, i looked out the window and saw a guard standing in the middle of a courtyard nothing to protect, nothing to guard, no doors.
i couldn't figure out what he was guarding so i asked around.
to keep anyone from walking on it she assigned a guard to stand watch over it every day.
after that she never gave it much thought, and thus never countermanded the order.
if i'm not back by then, seal up this side and keep trying to cut through someplace else.
i sent for help, but they won't be here for another day or two.
they're not the type to go around attacking other races without provocation.
there are probably two dozen dead drazi that would disagree with that assessment.
why is it that we always break up our history by the wars, not the years of peace?
the hundred years' war the war of 1812, the first three world wars the dilgar war, the war of the shining star the minbari war, the shadow war.
when you threatened to reveal their secrets, you got the full benefit of their paranoia.
any chance you might have had to get a homeworld for your people it's pretty much shot to hell.
the hard part is still getting na'toth out of the palace and onto our ship first.
we have to do it without killing a guard without raising any alarms and without anyone noticing that she is gone.
as you all know, there have been further attacks on ships from the member worlds.
we have called this closed session together because the drazi ambassador has asked to speak to you about this.
today we have dispatched warships to the border of brakiri space.
for every one of our ships that is intercepted and destroyed we will destroy one of their ships.
before you answer that, ambassador i believe the gaim ambassador also wanted to speak.
we too have found debris from an attacking ship in the ruins of one of our vessels.
you find pieces of their ships, they find pieces of your ships.
someone is hitting your people and leaving material they hope will implicate the rest of you.
someone is trying to divide the alliance sow distrust, make you lash out at each other.
i had mr. garibaldi do a complete examination of those two pieces.
but if we start fighting each other there won't be enough pieces left to work it out.
we ask you to give us just a little more time.
oh, great maker, i will be glad to be back on babylon 5, where at least it will be quiet.
yes, day will turn into night and night will turn into day and still our thirst for passion will not be quenched.

i'm not gonna do anything for anybody|until somebody lets me talk to my mom.
go tell that to the guy with the bullfrog|in his throat who thinks he's in charge.
before we can release you... you will need to sign several|non-disclosure statements.
then take a binding oath|in the presence of an international officer.
come on, come on, you're all coming to stay with grandma.
no, no, we have a hotel we're gonna stay at while they tent the house.
do you think she's gonna like growing up in somebody else's hand-me-down clothes?
playing with some kid's old toys because we can never afford to buy her anything new?
well, you know, i bet he'd show it to you if you just ask him that.
hell, he might even let you hold his gun, if you ask him real nice.
sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth with his hand when he speaks.
did you notice anything like that in the guy you shot today?
and they wrote down as many of the serial numbers as they could.
we managed to record just that's 1 out of 10 of the bills.
now it's simply a matter of waiting for the numbers to turn up.
can't go around passing $100 bills, without eventually sticking in someone's memory.
i hold onto it, we wait till they find the plane.
if nobody mentions it, we split it up, and we move away.
he was apparently trying to cross along this bank of snow.
when his snowmobile slipped over the edge throwing him into the icy waters of anders creek.
wright county deputies recovered the body shortly before 4:00 this afternoon.
a tragic beginning to this new year for one local family.
then you start joking around, kidding about confessing to the police.
each of you takes a turn pretending how you'd do it.
come on, it's not like i'm asking you to do that much.
here, just pick up the phone and give him a call and say:
it wasn't like i was trying to ignore you or something like that.
i was just, you know, i was talking about practical shit to you is all it was.
he always wanted to get everything set up, you know what i mean.
he always wanted to have enough to just take care of things and relax, you know.
he figured that, you know, all that insurance money, it'd be...
you know, it'd take care of the whole deal that he wanted to... you know...
i guess what i'm trying to say is, well, maybe i misjudged you, hank.
'cause, i mean, you're a bit more, well, i don't know, let's...
let's say... serious... ha ha ha... than a guy like me.
and, you know, maybe sometimes... you can come across like you sort of got a stick up your ass.
this old drunk was telling jokes to his 2 drunk friends and he was keeping up his wife, who, unlike him, had a job to go to in the morning.
so, see, she gets so fucking fed up, she comes downstairs and she says,
when we stepped in the doorway, he shot at me, but he missed.
so he aimed the shotgun at my chest, and just before he pulled the trigger... you killed him.
i can see how it might've seemed that way to him.
because... he did... he did go out to the truck alone.
i was, uh... driving out by lou chambers' place, and, uh...
i saw your brother's truck parked out in the middle of the road.
and then you and sarah will come over and bring amanda, and we'll all sit around and tell stories and stuff.
we'll drink on the porch like dad and uncle ted used to do.
nobody would ever believe that you'd be capable of doing what you've done.
well, it was snowin' pretty hard, so we're not really sure, but it sounded kinda like an engine cutting' on and off.
the same meals over and over again, whatever the week's coupons will allow.
only going out to restaurants for special occasions, birthdays or anniversaries.
i guess you're right, but i thought it was a little further down, just, you know...
and, you know, if it was off over on that side, that's farmland over there.
you can do this, and it's gonna be perfect for you.
you got something to go on for, hank, and you know it.
to someone who's been properly trained, there are many ways to detect a liar.
the shifty eyes of detective novels have a certain basis in fact.
his brother was in that crashed plane you found out there today.
bokovski and his brother were the guys who kidnapped that mcmartin girl last november.
i'll bet you $10,000, just one of these packets, that when they find this plane... there's no mention of this money.
hank, why... why turn it in until we know whether or not somebody's lookin' for it?
i mean, we wouldn't tell somebody if we were the ones that did it.
it's not like he said that you actually saw a plane going down.
what makes it a crime is that it's against the law.
it doesn't matter if somebody gets hurt or if they don't.
when his snowmobile slipped over the edge throwing him into the icy waters of anders creek.
wright county deputies recovered the body shortly before 4:00 this afternoon.
i want you to buy one of those little tape recorders.
you know, the little dictating kind, the kind you can hide in your pocket?
'cause, i mean, you're a bit more, well, i don't know, let's...
let's say... serious... ha ha ha... than a guy like me.
so, see, she gets so fucking fed up, she comes downstairs and she says,
"if he doesn't shut up, he's gonna have to find some other place to live rent-free."
and you're knocking on the door, and i'm like sitting here doing paperwork and dumb ass comes in, ok?
dumb ass comes in with his tail between his legs, ok?
because... he did... he did go out to the truck alone.
i followed him, but... then, when i heard the shot... and nancy got killed...
i hate like hell to have to do this to you, hank.
i was, uh... driving out by lou chambers' place, and, uh...
that's why he wants you to go, so he can get rid of the witnesses.
but if he's really from the fbi, and i don't show up, it's gonna look suspicious as hell.
like the one to take the money back to the plane, and we end up killing stephanson?
or maybe the one where we tape lou, and 2 more people end up dead.
do you think she's gonna like growing up in somebody else's hand-me-down clothes?
playing with some kid's old toys because we can never afford to buy her anything new?
the best bet's gotta be over here in the nature preserve.
so i think the best idea is each of us take a different section of the woods...
sometimes the suspect will cover his mouth with his hand when he speaks.
did you notice anything like that in the guy you shot today?
we were afraid they'd detect the markings and kill the girl, so, um...
we put together a task force of 20 agents, and they wrote down as many of the serial numbers as they could.
now it's simply a matter of waiting for the numbers to turn up.
can't go around passing $100 bills without eventually sticking in someone's memory.

you go first, jacob second, and lou last, and when lou goes, you tape him.
i'm saying, tell him i've agreed to split up the money.
i thought it'd be a good idea for us to... to go out and celebrate first.
if he... if he had the still like we got goin' on right now, you know?
he would... he would... he would have done the same thing.

hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
well, enjoy it while you can, because it won't last for long.
perhaps long enough for you to see the reality that you've refused far too long.
i don't tell people to ignore the law..., ...but i do tell them to speak up if they disagree with it.
it's that flippant attitude to the law that's brought us here today.
had icarus lived, he could have been an even greater inventor than his father.
but, we'll never know..., ...because hercules told him to go for it..., ...chase your dream..., lose your life.
-look, i know things look bad..., ...but, you know, it's not over till it's over.
there's no way i'm gonna let that fast-talking chariot chaser beat me in a court of law.
i think things might go better for hercules if i put you in the witness circle before closing arguments.
that is exactly what i want to talk to you about.
we can't bring back kazankis, icarus or any of the other victims.
but we can make sure that what happened to them can never happen again!
and i have bent the law when my heart tells me it's unjust.
because justice is not about the letter of the law..., ...but its spirit.
it's what separates us from the animals and from the gods who would like us to believe that we are less than we are.
and that is why we all need heroes..., ...to set a higher standard that others can aspire to.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
well, enjoy it while you can, because it won't last for long.
perhaps long enough for you to see the reality... that you've refused far too long.
and what if their hearts tell them to ignore a law or that it's wrong?
i don't tell people to ignore the law, but i do tell them to speak up if they disagree with it.
they thought it was what they wanted-- to be heroes like hercules-- but--
so, now, without a son, your family name dies with you.
so don't take away from this death-- his self-sacrifice-- by making it my responsibility.
he made that heroic choice himself, and he deserves our honor and respect for doing so.
early on, i had trouble convincing people... that my inventions were useful.
hercules persuaded me to follow my dreams... as long as i felt i was right.
hercules told him that anything was possible, as long as he wanted it badly enough.
so hercules-- immortal for all we know-- encourages an impressionable young man to be just like him... and to risk everything to follow his dream.
had icarus lived, he could have been... an even greater inventor than his father.
but we'll never know, because hercules told him to go for it.
- you know, -[ footsteps ] you're an uncommonly beautiful woman, queen melissa.
you know, i was just about to say the same thing.
i know things look bad, but, you know, it's not over till it's over.
there's no way i'm gonna let that fast-talking chariot chaser beat me in a court of law.
we can't bring back kazankis, icarus or any of the other victims.

because justice is not about the letter of the law, but its spirit.
and that is why we all need heroes-- to set a higher standard that others can aspire to.
if i'm guilty of this, well, then-- then i'm proud of it.
now my children have two heroes to look up to-- you and their father.
um, i'm sorry to rush you, but, uh, we got a war to stop in plathos.

most of your hostile activity will be in the corridor... which means we can't saturate.
whatever was done to her, we won't hold it against you personally.
in fact, the only way you can make things worse for yourself... is if you lie.
i thought if they put me through it one more time, i might.
the point is, we could've done a better job of helping you if we'd known.

harris johnson, 18th century, famous for navigational clocks, but just once in a while, he turned out one of these.

he could be having his little fling at any of these places.
so, are you suggesting, janet, that we enroll in these classes to spy on a man in order to blackmail him into silence?
ah, the doctor told her not to travel, but she wouldn't listen.
i think she wanted to die out there among her own sort.
i'd have come for the funeral, or did you just want to keep it family?
family--just sean and meself and a couple of neighbors, oh, and connie, of course.
it's quite trivial, but i have just heard delaney demanding money from the flintoffs with menaces, and i need to know why.
we think they collect videos from holland for him, illegal stuff.
you can give him my assurance that i've made it quite plain to all my staff that this agency never deals with matters of that nature.
as a matter of fact, mrs. wainthropp, the problem is gone.
i know it's a bit short notice, but monty knew someone on the airline.
and we didn't want to give you any time to object.
i peeked in on him, to make sure i hadn't dreamt it.
he was fully dressed, his eyes shut, talking in his sleep in a weird voice.
turning yourself in is a mitigating circumstance in a court of law.
i shall now bring in the prosecutor who has asked for your detention.

turning yourself in is a mitigating circumstance in a court of law.
i shall now bring in the prosecutor who has asked for your detention.
i have talked things over with senators, millionaires, sports champs, you name it.
i don't need to take any shit from some drink-pusher... working in a skid-row gin joint.
now, a good-looking girl, sitting in a skid-row bar alone... there's a good chance she's a hooker.
even though it's none of your business, i'm not for hire.
like maybe she could make me feel 25 years old again.
i thought, with her... maybe i could get it all back.
i mean, it's okay if we see each other some more.
i just didn't want you to think that it's going to go anywhere.
it never hurt my work, no matter what the bastards thought.
i was always top man on the crime beat, right to the end.
niko stavro... reported to be a greek immigrant, had hired a private detective... to follow his wife, vicki... when he became suspicious that she had a lover.
after he found out the details of her secret, sordid life... he flew into a rage and strangled her.
"mae" tempts us to believe that our whole life, from the moment we are born through to our deaths, is as if it were true and unbreakable.
but the reality must be that many messengers are being sent down.
yes, what else is it, when you hear it from a person's own mouth?
in my case, i don't have many of the worldly joys of the laity.
so, you weren't even thinking that you might one day leave aum?
even if i left aum, i didn't think that society with its values.
values it would continue to pursue, was a place i could ever return to.
so, rather than never leaving aum, it's more an idea of not returning to society.
but you have to apply them to make them your own.
so, although our human rights are being ignored and aum is being abused, treated as if we're not human, still, now we can see how far we've mastered aum's teachings.
that means, counter to media claims, his subconscious is in command and there's nothing like "mind control" going on.
the moment the master came to the bank of the pond.
i shouldn't have to repeat what is common sense, but in addition to this
permission, you also need the consent of the residents on the site.
so you're saying that i need to get your approval, the residents' consent, then, i submit this request to mr. abe and get permission.
then, i come back and arrange it to go in with you.
helping someone get beyond these feelings, that's giving them true happiness, i think.
i cut off the feelings of romance and love that i had.
when i got home, my parents were waiting for me with these long faces.
they told me to sit down, and i could already guess what it was about.
by that, we mean they are passed down naturally from generation to generation.
so if you deny the teachings, there will be nothing afterwards.
we should act before the police take advantage of the situation.
it's the same old pattern; hit, then knocked down, then arrested for obstruction while the cop grabs his leg.
if i conceal it now, an innocent person might go to jail on false charges.
can i ignore this under the pretense of making a film?
i've been told before that he never got a message from me.
so i want to be able to say who took the message.
so i want to be able to say who took the message.
i understand, but i've been told not to give out personal information.
even if we did, people would see it differently, because we made it.
i want ordinary people, people who can understand, to see what they can see,
these experiences, these things i underwent, even with inoue's and hayashis testimony,
those deeper darts in me, it's like they haven't been touched at all.
(masa'aki hukuda, professor of law, hitotsubashi university) this is a good chance for you all to review your own values.
we'll start the qa with mr. araki, with that in mind.
after the guilty verdict, don't you think that you should respond?
or can you continue to claim that you have nothing to do with it?
even gods in heaven have many levels, and human spirit is not so superior compared with the universe.
however, you can flee from human sin and weave your way up to higher stages, then.

just cut to the chase and tell us about the snake!
now the disk that we're making is aproximately 5000 times bigger than the average snake.
we'll have to fly it in with 3 comanchi helecopters, and lower it on to the ground at the lake.
then we'll need 57 flame throwers all set up around the perimeter of the disk, all triggered to fire at the same time.
well you see, fireworks at the lake will not only go on, but perhaps be the best ever.
wait a minute, we're gonna need an orchestra to play the starts and stripes.
our 4th of july celebration is going to have no fireworks and a bunch of tonedeaf little shits playing... wait a minute.. it's the snake!
let's move along people, if you see one giant snake thingy firework, you're seen 'em all.

well the south park snake, is over half a mile in diameter, and 20 stories high.
and it appears as if thought the mayor is going to explain matters now.

dear brother, in my heart i carry a flower, you give my life meaning and i honor you with all my heart.
this isn't just any old day of the week, you know.
you're gonna show me and your stepfather some respect for once in your life.
my mother was the kind of mother who always said... she was her daughter's best friend.
whenever she did, i thought, great, not only do i have a shitty mother... but my best friend's a loser bitch.
dedee, honey, put the dirt on like i told you how to.
she was all over me the day we buried my stepfather.
randy was a geek, but he was nicer than a lot of the guys... mostly because he was born with only one ball.
and he was pretty nice to anyone who'd sleep with him and not make fun of it.
i told him i was going to my grandma's in memphis.
but where i was really going was indiana to see my brother bill... who was really only my half-brother... and who i'd seen once before when i was a kid when my real dad died.
bill's like dozens of years older than me... and a actual real-life homo and a teacher... which is kind of gross, i mean, the combo.
but he had a lot of money from his last boyfriend who died of aids.
i laid it on kind of thick about mom drinking... and how tough it was on me watching my step dad die... which is, like, so opposite.
and how it would give mom and me a chance to grieve in our own ways... if there was a little distance between us, just for the summer.
cute, stupid people survive, have lots of cute, stupid babies who also survive.
it was like watching evolution at work... as long as you reproduced.
no, but bring another human life onto the planet, that's whim time.
am i the only one here who wants to kill someone?
i said he was really nice, and thanks for the hospitality... and don't tell my mom.
here's where he finds out we took the safe deposit money...ouch.
and one day, if the gods want you to see him again... he's gonna be sitting in the seat next to you on a plane.
or his socks will be in your dryer at some laundromat.
i'll tell you what this is about, this is about timing.
this is about trimesters, and you know what i'm talking about.
i have taught high school girls for 15 years... and pregnancy is one of my specialties.
and looking at you... you are at least five months pregnant, five and a half even.
so she gets carl to call a local buddy, run randy's license plate... and put out an official apb on us.
you gotta hand it to her, she always gets her way.
because frankly, i'm starting to think randy's missing more than a ball.
hotel phone calls are too expensive, and we can't afford it.
but why do you think there are no more real hawaiians?
and why would they even come up with the phrase "died in childbirth"... if it only happened one time?
what i think is fine... chase this bimbo from indiana to chippewa falls for all i care.
go ahead, throw away your reputation... your job and your students, whatever... because you want matt.
she turned out to be one of those talkers, you know what i mean?

so i don't just want your obedience right now, which i do want plenty of it.
but i want your fucking gratitude right fucking now... or you're gonna be looking down a long road with your nipple in the dirt.
you are going to march right into school with me, young man... and you're going to make a statement to the principal.
and then i'm going to take you to the police station.
number two is if they freak out about gays in the military.
you know, if they can't discuss it without giggling about showering with guys... and bending over for soap and stuff.
excuse me, but haven't we seen this scene like a million times before?
i pant and swear, and i'm like, you know, pissed off.
women delivering are always pissed off... and asking for that shot, that epidural or whatever.
and swearing at the man who got them into it and so on.
and put twenty crit in that line and open it up.
call surgery and tell them we've got a postpartum bleeder in the e. r.
carl got us to return to the states, so he's like super cop.
matt and i had to go out to palm springs and answer all these questions about randy.
i told you right off i don't grow a heart of gold.
and if i do, which is, like, so unlikely... give me a break and don't make me do it in front of you.
i'm not about to have you show up in that crap you wear to school.
this isn't just any old day of the week, you know.
you're gonna show me and your stepfather some respect for once in your life.
if you're one of those people who don't like movies... where some person you can't see talks the whole time... and covers up all the holes in the plot and... at the end says, "i was never the same after that summer"... or whatever, like it was so deep they can't stand it... then you're out of luck.
i'm sixteen, and this is creve coeur, louisiana... which is french, i think, for like, fucked heart.
my mother was the kind of mother who always said... she was her daughter's best friend.
whenever she did, i thought, great, not only do i have a shitty mother... but my best friend's a loser bitch.
dedee, honey, put the dirt on like i told you how to.
but where i was really going was indiana to see my brother bill... who was really only my half-brother... and who i'd seen once before when i was a kid when my real dad died.
bill's like dozens of years older than me... and a actual real-life homo and a teacher... which is kind of gross, i mean, the combo.
if you think i'm just plucky and scrappy and all i need is love... you're in over your head.
i don't have a heart of gold, and i don't grow one later, okay?
and how it would give mom and me a chance to grieve in our own ways... if there was a little distance between us, just for the summer.
plus, i'd clean for them, or tell the maid places she missed.
but it was easy to see why he'd screw around with bill.
and a blow job is a blow job if you're getting one.
and you really think this is a good way to make up for it?
matt struggled for a while, which i thought showed a lot of loyalty to bill.
here's where he finds out we took the safe deposit money...ouch.
but he's gonna cover for us and tell them he authorized it.
you see someone smell a pillow or an old t-shirt, you're a basket case.
i could've showed you the other stuff he did besides mooning around.
his boyfriend, or whatever, leaves, and he pays the cable bill?
his boyfriend, or whatever, leaves, and he pays the cable bill?
and that jason kid had been in her homeroom for two years... so she knew what he was like.
after high school, he went up to chicago... and became one of those "act up" people... who think aids is this big conspiracy against homos.
anyway, bill tried to convince her it was all a bluff.
you put yourself through this, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
he says when he was a student here four years ago, you molested him.
i never liked the looks of this kid, but i gotta do something.
you let me know as soon as you hear from either of them.
you haven't asked me if it's true, if i molested him.
i guess when your first boyfriend, tom, the dead guy, croaks in front of you... and his stupid sister takes over your life... and then your next boyfriend splits... you're kind of primed for shit.
it's hard to top that with suspensions and people hating you... and losing a job you're too rich for anyway.
i know in movies you kind of feel sorry for girls like this.
but in real life, you wouldn't be sitting next to her either.
it must be inherited from our father, you know, being romantic.
it's just...when it's a man being romantic about a woman... it's not as revolting.
you made a big mistake coming here today, you know that?
you really should've stayed at home and let matt come... and do your dirty work for you.
i wish it was god's will for me to wear a rubber, but...
we're gonna need that money for the baby, you see what i'm saying?
let's just go home... straighten jason out, and then we'll take it from there.
maybe jason'll put you up, boyfriend or not, 'cause bill won't have you back.
so things didn't work out between us, so it didn't last forever, fine.
let's go our separate ways... without a lot of bad feelings and bullshit.
she's pregnant, probably abused... with all sorts of repressed memories that haven't even occurred to her yet.
she comes to you for help and you let her go off with this like... really violent stalker guy who tracked her down.
so she gets carl to call a local buddy, run randy's license plate... and put out an official apb on us.
you gotta hand it to her, she always gets her way.
because frankly, i'm starting to think randy's missing more than a ball.

if you think i'm just plucky and scrappy and all i need is love... you're in over your head.
i don't have a heart of gold, and i don't grow one later, okay?
and how it would give mom and me a chance to grieve in our own ways... if there was a little distance between us, just for the summer.
plus, i'd clean for them, or tell the maid places she missed.
but it was easy to see why he'd screw around with bill.
and a blow job is a blow job if you're getting one.
and you really think this is a good way to make up for it?
matt struggled for a while, which i thought showed a lot of loyalty to bill.
here's where he finds out we took the safe deposit money...ouch.
but he's gonna cover for us and tell them he authorized it.
you see someone smell a pillow or an old t-shirt, you're a basket case.
i could've showed you the other stuff he did besides mooning around.
his boyfriend, or whatever, leaves, and he pays the cable bill?
his boyfriend, or whatever, leaves, and he pays the cable bill?
and that jason kid had been in her homeroom for two years... so she knew what he was like.
after high school, he went up to chicago... and became one of those "act up" people... who think aids is this big conspiracy against homos.
anyway, bill tried to convince her it was all a bluff.
you put yourself through this, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack.
he says when he was a student here four years ago, you molested him.
i never liked the looks of this kid, but i gotta do something.
you let me know as soon as you hear from either of them.
you haven't asked me if it's true, if i molested him.
i guess when your first boyfriend, tom, the dead guy, croaks in front of you... and his stupid sister takes over your life... and then your next boyfriend splits... you're kind of primed for shit.
it's hard to top that with suspensions and people hating you... and losing a job you're too rich for anyway.
i know in movies you kind of feel sorry for girls like this.
but in real life, you wouldn't be sitting next to her either.
it must be inherited from our father, you know, being romantic.
it's just...when it's a man being romantic about a woman... it's not as revolting.
you made a big mistake coming here today, you know that?
you really should've stayed at home and let matt come... and do your dirty work for you.
i wish it was god's will for me to wear a rubber, but...
we're gonna need that money for the baby, you see what i'm saying?
let's just go home... straighten jason out, and then we'll take it from there.
maybe jason'll put you up, boyfriend or not, 'cause bill won't have you back.
so things didn't work out between us, so it didn't last forever, fine.
let's go our separate ways... without a lot of bad feelings and bullshit.
she's pregnant, probably abused... with all sorts of repressed memories that haven't even occurred to her yet.
she comes to you for help and you let her go off with this like... really violent stalker guy who tracked her down.
but if the police get involved officially, it'll be a scandal... and bill will never get his job back.
so she gets carl to call a local buddy, run randy's license plate... and put out an official apb on us.
anyway, some cop somewhere spots randy's car... which is at least gonna liven things up as far as i'm concerned.
because frankly, i'm starting to think randy's missing more than a ball.
hotel phone calls are too expensive, and we can't afford it.
we can't afford it, 'cause you spent $4000 on a fucking bike yesterday.
i'm just asking you to stand by your man like i'm standing next to you.
a lot of guys would've said, "shucks, she took up with that homosexual."
so in order to get you to swallow it and not totally hate me...
i'm gonna show you something that happens in, like, five hours.
no, but some other faggot did, isn't that what you think?
what i think is fine... chase this bimbo from indiana to chippewa falls for all i care.
the school board scheduled a hearing, and the d.a. launched a probe.
and my mom hired a lawyer in to try and get some money from bill.
the realtor said the boarded up windows were the kind of challenge she liked.
so it would've ended differently if we'd waited one or two more days than we did.
anita bryant, the pope, the fucking christian coalition... not to mention a real son-of-a-bitch virus, in case you haven't noticed.
and in all that time since paul lynde and truman capote were the only fairies in america...
i've been busting my ass so that you'd be able to do what you want with yours.
so i don't just want your obedience right now, which i do want plenty of it.
it's not like i can expect any loyalty or consideration or whatever from you.
i told you, i didn't sleep with jason when we were together, okay?
but i'm sure that wherever he is, he doesn't care that we screwed around.
he doesn't feel better that you moved me in but told everybody that it was more than sex.
i pant and swear, and i'm like, you know, pissed off.
women delivering are always pissed off... and asking for that shot, that epidural or whatever.
i told matt and jason that i wanted to keep him, and they were pretty cool about it.
when you nearly hemorrhage to death, people cut you a break.
jason made a statement that he'd been paid to make his charges... by the christian right guys on the school board -- the ones against evolution and huck finn.
which was a total lie, but even so, they won't be back for another term.
even though it spooked me at first... him changing a boy baby and getting good peaks at his little thing.
but he says straight dads change girl babies all the time and nothing ever comes of that.
it was clever of god or evolution or whatever to hook the survival of the species to it... because we're gonna screw around no matter what.
it was a smarter thing to pick than say... the instinct to share your toys or return phone calls.
i'm not gonna go back to bill's house and be this big changed person for you.
i told you right off i don't grow a heart of gold.
i'm not about to have you show up in that crap you wear to school.
this isn't just any old day of the week, you know.
you're gonna show me and your stepfather some respect for once in your life.
if you're one of those people who don't like movies... where some person you can't see talks the whole time... and covers up all the holes in the plot and... at the end says, "i was never the same after that summer"... or whatever, like it was so deep they can't stand it... then you're out of luck.
i'm sixteen, and this is creve coeur, louisiana... which is french, i think, for like, fucked heart.
my mother was the kind of mother who always said... she was her daughter's best friend.
whenever she did, i thought, great, not only do i have a shitty mother... but my best friend's a loser bitch.
dedee, honey, put the dirt on like i told you how to.
but where i was really going was indiana to see my brother bill... who was really only my half-brother... and who i'd seen once before when i was a kid when my real dad died.

foxfire george wallace which earned her an emmy normination and her second golden globe award
playing god, gia for which she received the golden globe and screen actor's guild awards
our goal in this series is to retrace the significant step that have marked our guest journey to this moment on this stage
logical place to begin is at the beginning where were you born
it's probably the best advice she got on how to be a parent was from him because she always when i was growing up
she....she everytime i was emtional or i was upset about something anything was going on
she ...um she'd have me look at her, she would said what are you feeling what are you thinking what are you..
....really is funny i am to it.... the method as a 3 year old...uh ...
i was about 6 months where did you live after the separation
i live for awhile in l.a. then my mom move to new york for a few years did you have frequent contact with your father after the divorced
and umm... and my mom often got a call and i was umm..
i created something appearently i don't really remember appearently it was something like kissing the boy and given them cooties and a few of them stopped and we started to making out and we takes our cloth off and i got in trouble a lot in kindergarten
that is a first ... 11 years you are the first kindergarten...
i know... whatever, now here is the question i thought i will never ask you is just astonishes me didn't you have ambitious to be a funeral director umm ... you doing any studying
how old where you when you and your boy friend began cutting each other
umm ...while i was 14 when i was dating my first boy friend we live together for 2 years. and umm... we lived with my mon ....so the two lived ...moved...
right any kind of thing i had call my home my base i understand... private safe umm ...and it was really cause i always collected weapons since i was very little so it was just one night that umm...
i mean do you really want me going into this because i can... do you
like there always something you want to break out of or hit to feel more be more connected to another person something more honest and in kind of a moment of... wanting to find something honest i grasp a knife and...and a
cut him he cut me back and we have this exchange of something and then somehow covered in blood and feeling my heart was racing and something dangerous in life and... umm... suddenly felt more honest..than ... whatever the sex was suppose to be
this connection between two people suppose to be ...umm so i went through a period of when i'd feel trapped
i cut myself becuase it felt that like i was releasing something it was it was uh...it was honests
i went to the strasberg and see what i ...when i was 16
i have a desperate need ...which i think most artist do to communicate and to feel that whatever it is..
inside me ...whether is cutting ...whatever is going craz...y whatever is feeling but there is something inside we always wanna..
we want to reach out we want to talk to each other we want to hear .. we wanna to throw out emotion and our thoughts out shouldn't helped it urr...we make some sense and we get an answer and we can
i love doing it, they are not just for the a..
but there were sensual and fun but there were something and you know there is something very interesting about there's all of us we read we been working for very long time and we haven't been naked in front of each other and everyone
got their own issue.. and yeah you can be the first one to be bold to take your shirt off and and started everybody you know the other girl and then just looks around and this your friends and then she ....find another women
take hers off, there is something very umm... yes sensual but really you find each other looking at each other eyes saying is ok you know i am with you you are beautiful and stay with me and don't be shy
and so is lovely ...it's was very err...it was very swee....t it was very lovely time between women
angelina who knows how to stir a little bit of fuss during the promotional tour say that you have fallen in love with someone during the filming
i got very close with jenny were you just promoting the film or were you talking from the heart i would never do 'something' like that no i was... why
i thought she was beautiful magnificent women and ..and i didn't see, i just say that because this was ..what i felt not for the shock right no ....no
i always still find that strange to people get shock by something like that
angelina received an emmy nonimation for her performance in a televison mini series george wallace your cornelia was a very complex portrait she was fillish she was seductive she was loyal common blast..sie
well ..painfully nobel how much it were came from the script and how much that did you invent based on the real person it is based on the real person
i think she is still alive today did you, did you study the real person or just you ...
like maybe is becuase i need to when i am acting and i..
and i.. so i can't stop ..for 'once' i start what other things you bring to those screen is a.. palpabe energy you've said i believe in instinct umm.. something primmal
i think the accent of who she was just as.. very a... spirited women who love women who ah...needed love who is very open and who got a
very lost in ...in the world that embrace very superficious things and she became an addict and
heroine wasn't it.. and then umm.. and then died of aids were you all hesitatant to accept the product yeah i said no.. why..
i pray a few time ....why, why because she felt too close to me
i suppose ..and i think that umm yeah the desire to want to ...to feel a real sense of self other than..
other than the very superficious thing in this world and ...and the the need maybe for all of us to to feel we are understood and love for who we are
..somehow they are always correspondants to something you going through that moment in life
i think the artist used somehow draw into your environment something that that is similar to you but everyone a while something comes just for some reason that is ..is so
it's so appropriate and you needed so much of that time you needed to go through that experience you needed to learn that lesson so much right then
one lie what's the big deal what about yesterday, what about the day before
because you don't care because you want to say i "fu..king" a model hmm, i "fu..king"
a model you don't care about me at all do you do you tell me you don't care i don't care i don't care
gia is a lesbian and there are sexual encounter between gia and the character linda ..umm there were something very important about the two women really exploring each other really looking at each other and even in the scene that i had to run to the elevator naked which
i didn't want to do necessary..but and what is say about the two of them and and what is say about the two of them and it ...it was extremely important given role like gia and legs in foxfire and cornelia george wallace
i kind of got back to basic of things for myself and ...and get to learn my own my own taste for thing and ..and i went to the writting class
tried writing ..those just good for me to collect myself when billy bob thornton he was here on that chart we talking about pushing tin
he is a lovely man, he is a great man, a great artist
wasn't the saturday night live things that you two do together
i wasn't even there and he.. he chase me on the street he chase you on the street so funny ...you should see it if you have.. it's hysterical
so we sort of work together come to think about, the simpson assasscinated me too
i had actually read the book years... before and ..and umm... when the script came around
i... found the book in my library and i realized that
why umm ...because.. it..yeah.. because it make feel umm... provocative and open and sensual and .. and umm... transpo love to my trailer
this is how you describe lisa actually ...she lived to big; was too honest was too hunger but too full of life those sounds like virtues not sins yeah ..they are.. absolutely virtue
you know there's too many button in the world just too many button or you just.. no... no... no..
no....no.. there is way too many just waited begging to be pressed
i just begging to be pressed you know that just ..
just begging to be pressed and make you wonder it really makes me "fu.king" wonder ...why doesn't anybody ever pressed mine why am i so neglected why isn't anybody reached in... and reveal the truth
one of my favorite question, tell us about the oscar experience
i have a weired thing in my family my.. my father was separate from my mother separating from mother when he won his oscar you know she love acting and she want actress and she... they had seperate then he took his girl friend
and they were at the ceremony 20 something years later and we had just talk to her and she just... you know and where her baby that she was holding at..
that moment and then we call her after and got her into the middle of the phone when she was crying ..it was ...it was hmm..
it was her night and that it was something very full circle about in our family so it was ...it was a very heavy night for that what did you say in your acceptance speech
i kown i say i loved my brother ....because eveybody lost their minds
i assume you and your brother do not have sexual relation of course no ok
not yeah ...is a fair question becuase of all the gossip but we did not yeah
oh, that's the way the world took it come on that is the way the world the world is a little sicker than i could imagine... you know i was i was... sometimes you are a provocatuer
but i am really not, if you do me in my life i...
i know i being honest of something somebody ask me about cutting myself i am being honest yeah if i say i very in love with my brother right now i love my brother ...but
but the.. thing was he been that person at that movie and held my hand through my entire career ...oh sure of course of course and... it was such a big moment for us more than about the world
i feel like the people that hmm that i identify the middle of people i would care about actually know what's real what's not it bothers me more we live in the world that the focus in on certain type thing in a certian way
i would be happy somebody run article about my sexuality or my.. you know fascination of different things that considered dark really analyes that properly.. yeah and really express it in an intelligent way yeah then i think is great
cool what prompted you go from the grim reality of gia and the bond collection to the neon world of action hero based on the video game in larra croft tomb raider
thank you.... but you know the first time i get the phone call that...they ask me to do it..
and then the film maker came out and talk to me and they and they sort of talking about the idea the adventure of it and and how much trainning it would take and going england and the bristish military
this country is in having to understand and it became kinds of umm.. just a different kind of challenge and like the god that really is tempting and i would love to to try the do that i love to see those
ok we know there is a history there there is a wonderful scene between the two of you the relationship between the two of them is... is he... he have secret from her and it's been distance from her and he's been absent
i know and umm ...they have a lot of questions and umm... so it was clear there are something that would be the good idea or very bad idea but hmm but i thought it.. it was a way for me to reach out to my father
why ...why can't used part just this one why can't you stay we can't change time ..
the time was stolen from us and it is not fair no ..is not fair but you have stolen time itself ...and you must give it back must destroy the trial
suddenly i feel so alone you will never alone, i am with you always just i always been
what drew you to beyond border the team and that film the later became very much a part of my life there is a scence in which you are honored by the unhcr in the film what is the unhcr
i want to learn about my started to travel and i didn't
i went to my first war zone went to the first area where i saw so much death and.. never again what i think about being self destructive or taking my life for granted or..
wanting for more or complaining about stupid things or umm .. thinking i knew pain
ever again once i saw them do you have position with them
i very moved by the country and very moved by these poeple who have survived so much and i went back there with the un and i went to the orpanages and something just felt like home to me and family to me...and..and it
became very clear to me that that the my son was there or my daughter was there something was there that were suppose to be my family and i don't know how to explain it ummm... and so i
and he stay in the sleep and i thought he was knock out.... because something..... else ummhmm... and he open his eye and stare at me for longest time and i just stare at him and i started to crying
and ...and he smile and it wasn't that he smile that he likes me which is that i..
i haven't held children in my life and i was considered so dark..
and i always say.. so many things make me feel like..
i maybe i shouldn't be somebody's mom because certainly the world have a opinion on me
i not sure about myself ..because am i going to be the best mom so the fact that this little kid
seems at ease umm... umm... gave me the courage to feel like that i can made him happy and umm... so we become a family...right then has he make you happy ah..um.... unbeliveably happy ...yeah..yeah
he make me belive in fate in some kind of ..
god's know how we found each other but we found each other he is my.. best friend he is my everything

and gathering over 30 crews and people and send them across the world to all this places what do those crew's do on january 11 we all open up our camera at exact same time coordinate across the world how long... 3, 4 minutes
3 minutes for... the same 3 minutes simultenanously shot all around the world by this crew yeah and you are producing it
i thought it was a really fun read because there's a lot of fun in it... a lot of humor to that i am still not comfortable with that kind of comedy wethere i can do that so i was a little shy ... to do it
but umm... but it was a great experiences is...is umm....a very fun film who directed the film
we were....we been marriage 6 years when therapy and we both very unhappy we don't know nothing about each other we don't communicate and at a certain you... think that they are...both having a affair
because they both keep going off to seperate thing and you see yeah and at some point you discovered that the both hitman they are assassin they are assassin and neither know... using each other as a covered and they been living for 6 year..
in this boring marriage not....actually not boring people but they both don't know it what assignment have they been given to kill each other the entire film is a metaphor for marraige is it it is tell us about shooting the action sequences
must have been some... pretty hot stuff going on the funny thing it happen it was written..
the tom raiders and also did troy yeah so.. this person came in to do this little action sequence there are written on half of page and realize that the two people who were working on film loves action and... so suddenly this...2 day action scene became a 3 week
thing where we were... you know saying why you have slide
i don't have a slide across the forward why you have the thing i want to scale down from the....
i wanna to go through the glass scene so we became ...my propose ....very competitive and very aggressiveness so.. so the... the every thing escalated into this really huge... huge fight scence the moments between you and brad pitt
i didn't what to expect until meeting him because he is one of those people you hear about... they seems like a..
they just seems very far away and they don't seem real yeah umm.... and he is extremely down to earth and he is just umm... goofy and funny and... and..and very good very urr... at the end of the day we just..
i think when you are in the right environment with the right people on the right then you get...you get goofier he always encourage to be dumber

and when she finally pinned him down, he started in with this prison talk.
then he said he wasn't sure that he could commit to her just now.
i thought it would be better if you gave it to her.
robert, i think you might have misunderstood ray when he was talking to you.
you know how when you're sleeping and you£­£­ you kind of stop breathing?
when you're married, there's always someone there to nudge you alive.
then next week i'm throwing her a bridal shower, and a week from saturday's the rehearsal dinner, and then i'm a bridesmaid in her wedding, and then, with any luck at all, i'll never have to see her again.
so, what kind of bachelorette party this gonna be tonight, huh?
what a man, what a man, what a man what a mighty good man
i thought that guy really had us, douglas, but you lost him with that nifty driving of yours.
if you live with your mother, what do you do when you have a girl spend the night?
okay, what do you do when you have a guy spend the night?
when i was little, i was always fighting with the boys, you can't imagine.
i know it was you who snitched on the resistance network at calais, well done!
do you know how long it takes to do 300 kms on foot?
if an average man does 4 km per hour, that means...
it was the entire escape network of the heads of the gestapo for argentina, with all the addresses and bank accounts.
and adeline had to hand them to the chap who came to arrest her.
and furthermore, you weren't forced... to spread the rumor that she'd denounced a resistance network.
it was the only way to gain the trust of the others, and maybe infiltrate their network.
we must do something immediately, we need to find a doctor.
but there's one in the cell next door, you can call her, she's a doctor.
i don't understand, i thought the fighting was finished in paris.
the gangrene is your business, for the rest you ask no questions and you look after him, he's an important guy.
we know that the police took him in, and then he escaped.
how did he escape, and why was he imprisoned, to begin with?
there's an old lady in it, madame tiersbasku, she's a lot like my grandma.
i told you to go to sleep, madam know it all.
that fool lefranc, an 11th hour resistance fighter, really thought it was you who had denounced the calais network.
you know what i owe to your 11th hour resistance fighter?
listen valmore, when you accepted this mission, you knew all the risks.
you're not going to give up now that you've done the hardest part.
it wasn't hard to see that she wasn't with us, that bitch.
don't you see she takes the piss out of us and she plays her new card.
but your big fish, it's in the head that he's sick.
he has a terror, that's upsetting him more than anything else.
and yes, my son was a hero and i didn't even know.
i was far from suspecting that he'd succeed in crossing all the north of france, and thwart so many traps.
they're starting to go off on the sly towards bayonne, and from there towards spain and portugal, and then towards south america.
their meeting point is in a mansion in the countryside, on the road to poitiers, near algrande, you'll remember?
it's spelled with a "t", mount as in mountain, a little mountain.
i know that, and you, you're a big mountain of knowledge.
the marchiano circus is proud to present these brand new acts.
and to begin with, i present to you, the best dancer of all time,
little bitch, you think you can screw with us like that, do you think we're fucking blind, perhaps?
i'll tell you one thing, it's us who'll fuck you and i swear we'll enjoy it.
and even if he was, do you think i would admit to you that i did it?
in your wildest fucking dreams, would i ever give you that satisfaction?
the defendant has got to show the actuality, not the appearance of bias.
well, at the same time that kibler was accepting bribes, my client came before him.
now, my client was found guilty and sentenced by kibler to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole in 20 years.
your honour, augustus hill murdered a police officer in cold blood.
due to the circumstances of corruption, that my client was denied his fundamental right to a fair trial, presided over by an impartial judge.
and that therefore, augustus hill is entitled to an automatic reversal of his conviction.
but there is no precedent for the court to make such a ruling.
in fact, to do so would, in effect, create a rule of law that is beyond the court's jurisdiction.
a list of names of all the murderers convicted by kibler.
now, if one of them testifies that they didn't offer a bribe and we show that they were sentenced unfairly, we prove bias.
you think i'm gonna help you turn this prison into the people's court?
you win this one, you'll be reopening the case of every prisoner in here.
the only reason judge lema is overruling all my objections is racism.
it couldn't be because most of your objections are stupid, right?
we'll probably never know what judge kibler thought about augustus hill.
but we have a pretty clear picture about what he thinks about justice.
and the sentencing, given the severity of the convictions, does not appear to be unduly cruel or unusual.
therefore, i rule in favour of the state and deny augustus hill's motion for a reversal of his conviction.
do you remember the first time i stood in your office, mcmanus?
you told me that my, quote, my celebrity status wouldn't give me any extra advantages inside of oz.
i don't need you to tell me when to help a brother.
look, could we just put aside all the bullshit between us for once?
the campaign to free mr. jackson started with foster perry, the publisher of an upcoming anthology of marginal literature titled unheard america.
many critics are saying this is a commercial ploy to create a sensation around the book, but several figures in the arts have committed their efforts to mr. jackson's case, claiming he is a rare talent lost inside our country's barbaric prison system.
yo, you gonna let him fucking disrespect you like that, man?
look, he and the wop are two breaths away from going down.
i was quick-tempered and spiteful to the point where i can't tell if i gave you a fair trial.
now seeing you like this, l-- l think maybe the punishment exceeded the crime.
and as much as i tried to manipulate the legal system to get off, to get out of it, i took her life.
according to the law, each crime is worth a certain number of years.
see, the way i figure it, you and me, we're not like the rest of them.
the latinos, the homeboys, the aryans, see, they all got each other.
and in oz, most times, the illusion is better than reality.
some people say the bible is the greatest story ever told.
and it's the two of us, our word against whoever the jabber is.
mack's in the other room right now spilling his guts out.
it is already a matter of public record that richard kibler, while serving as a judge on the state criminal court, took money in exchange for giving out more lenient sentences to three convicted murderers.
mr. said claims bias against his client because he neither gave bribes nor knew of that possibility.
well, at the same time that kibler was accepting bribes, my client came before him.
now, my client was found guilty and sentenced by kibler to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole in 20 years.
mr. said has asked the court for an automatic reversal of hill's conviction due to the circumstance of judge kibler's conviction.
due to the circumstances of corruption, that my client was denied his fundamental right to a fair trial, presided over by an impartial judge.
and that therefore, augustus hill is entitled to an automatic reversal of his conviction.
but there is no precedent for the court to make such a ruling.
it couldn't be because most of your objections are stupid, right?
no. lt couldn't be because maybe, you know, you not as good a lawyer as you think you are.
all i wanna do is get out of here and be free.
either you can do that or you leave me the fuck alone.
at no point did judge kibler, in word or deed, act beyond the limits of the rules of judicial procedure.
and the sentencing, given the severity of the convictions, does not appear to be unduly cruel or unusual.
i want you to contact your publisher, show him those poems.
do you remember the first time i stood in your office, mcmanus?
you have the opportunity to help someone here, a fellow inmate.
i don't need you to tell me when to help a brother.
we're gonna turn you into a symbol of justice in america.
you're gonna be like the phoenix, rising, through your poetry, from the ashes of a crack house.
a crowd has gathered outside oswald maximum security penitentiary in growing support for arnold jackson, an inmate whose poetry has fomented a movement of writers and artists demanding that he be granted a parole review.
the campaign to free mr. jackson started with foster perry, the publisher of an upcoming anthology of marginal literature titled unheard america.
yeah, so, what are the chances of the cancer coming back?
ninety percent of stage-two men are alive after five years, and 63 percent are alive after ten years.
look, he and the wop are two breaths away from going down.
us, we're gonna pull up a lawn chair, we gonna sit back, we gonna relax, and we gonna watch them go.
mr. beecher, i appreciate your taking the time to see me.
well, you know, it's a nice break from getting fucked up the ass.
according to the law, each crime is worth a certain number of years.
you gave me a maximum of 1 5 years in this fuckhole!
look, when you helped me out the other day by the phones, i told you i owe you.
see, the way i figure it, you and me, we're not like the rest of them.
one day they inspired me to try and imitate them with a human voice to make the same loud sounds the gibbons make.
and in doing so all hell broke loose in the gibbon cages.
may all their songs and prayers be answered by the sacred forces.
in this way we can live in beauty with power from our ancestors.
we don't care to cling to the life of this body until it naturally gives up.
we don't care to be aborted by the body that we're wearing.
and i heard the voice of my gibbon who says. "ooo!" but i don't see anything.
so i looked in the direction the gibbon looks and the gibbon looked just like this beside me on the ground.
i deny it... but there are times in my job where i find an outlet for stress.
i've never invited my boss but some of my co-workers have seen my performances.
why is it that so many hip-hop groups you see walk around hip jibber-jabbering their lyrics of bullshit?
would you pay $25 to see somebody taking the stage call your queen a bitch.
what do you have to have to get a credit card?
you have to have money in the bank otherwise you don't get a credit card
if you kill people you get a monument in a park.
where are the monuments for people who have had ecstasy and bliss and incredible orgasms and that have made people ecstatic made people dance and play?
i enjoyed dabbling in the acting and trying all kinds of things and working with people.
i liked the surrealism of a room full of people watching intently you having sex.
the fear of death is connected with the fear of ourselves.
because death is a mirror in which the true meaning of life is reflected.
when a child died in old days, the body is put with a doll
so it is not lonely in the travel to the world beyond
"that was how the priest, rikard, himself became a vampire. "
"that night he fled the town, never again to see his wife and child. "
the only thing he was good at was girls and guns.
rico sent one of his servants after tim when he got too close.
it's the story of a young priest who met a gruesome fate.
it started when a number of women were murdered, over 1 o0 years ago.
"that was how the priest, rikard, himseff became a vampire. "
"that night he fled the town, never again to see his wife and chifd. "
all dick would ever talk about was his last good memory of the war.
three weeks earlier he'd been rescued after ejecting over the south china sea.
no matter what this wrought, commander, i did the right thing.
in a war-stress recovery unit, the patient doesn't get to determine treatment.
i guess, to me, he represents the half million who were defined by that war.
four years ago, commander of my old seal platoon started talking to himself in public.
dr. inge, as head of the war stress recovery unit at the paley medical center, would you explain its function and that of section b?
wsr is an open-unit facility designed to help veterans overcome war-related disorders.
it was not, as you are about to suggest, negligence on the part of the staff.
if they had known about it, they would have fixed it.
i ran over to the window, but it was too late.
was there anyone else in the room with him at the time?
you know, i'm getting tired of you making me your problem.
now, i just do what they tell me to do, you understand?
now, look, if you need to do anything or have anything, just please ask me.
do me a favour and don't make a big deal out of this.
by withholding richard la croix's antipsychotic medication, you were giving him back his mind.
his subsequent leap from ten storeys was a reflection of his need to escape from those who would limit his consciousness.
he got so used to sitting in the same chair that his spine took on its shape.
when he ate, food bypassed his tongue, so he never got the pleasure of tasting it.
he was convinced something was gonna happen to one of his pilots, he locked the lieutenant in his quarters prior to exercises.
you pled mental defect and got him off with a non-punitive letter of censure.
i think you're still trying to atone for mistakes you made in vietnam, 30 years ago.
now, somewhere, deep in your consciousness, you think you're springing these men from that pow camp at dong ha, you're saving their lives.
as far as i can see, your problem is low hcg levels.
the physical activity had little to do with it, although i recommend you take it easy.

i hasten to add ...it didn't spoil the beauty of princess haydee of janina
it's raining so hard, i hope he'll fall on his back, not on his face
he doesn't deserve to die with his nose in the mud
it was only justice for you to accuse and defeat my father
yes, the count of morcerf committed felony, and not just in janina
maybe that's how you see things, countess... , don't call me countess
those days are over, that's why i'm leaving my estate to your community
i wasn't allowed to see the sun, let alone to love
then one day, in the depths of despair i met someone who talked to me as i talk to you now
one of my men was arrested and i've a meeting off the coast tonight.
with this wind and a small crew, i could use a hand.
i'm alone apart from jeppe, the fisherman who brought me here.
tell him to disembark, i'll take his boat ad you'll be my sailor.
and you claim to be in a position to acquire... 51% of the capital of your bank, why 51%?
to have the freedom to act as i please wherever inspiration leads me.
but the fact is this gem is valued at 50.000 francs.
dantes asked me to distribute the proceeds from its sale among his friends such as you.
i'm not a traitor to man or god so i'm warning you.
you didn't see fit to exercise divine justice, so i'll do it my way.
i'm surprised a priest with such a fine horse should stop in such a wretched place to seek god.
i don't seek god i cane to vain him i'm taking his place.
if the pharao and its cargo have sunk, bankruptcy is inevitable.
i o think you made me wear that 'cake on my head all this time.

we must add 32.500 francs at the end of this month.
who runs this place said you wouldn't have been so careless.
and you'd invite me to the balcony you rented for the show.
by order of his excellency judge simonetti a pardon has been granted for rocca priori known as peppino.
my dear viscount, after all that you couldn't attend your mazzolata.
i saw those men swim with the strength born of despair.
i saw the wild sea smash and swallow up what was left of your unfortunate ship.
who was to serve another year in algeria will soon return to paris?
it's true that i used my contacts to obtain his early return.
she seems so at ease with that lavish life to which she wasn't destined.
the way she ran barefoot in the wilderness with her hair untied like a little savage.
mr. arago disagrees and he's the greatest physician of our time.
he says that when your railways disappear into a tunnel at 30km an hour the pressure will kill the passengers.
just as the words 'unlimited credit' have a meaning so has the word 'immediately'.
you meet one of the worlds richest men and instead of filling your safes he empties them.
i know you wanted a son to take over from you.
of course i'm sad at the thought of the bank passing to strangers.
the telegraph network has over 534 stations towers, pigeon houses or church steeples creating a relay between 24 major french towns.
as you can see, i'm in charge of the last relay before paris.
progress is a great thing, you must be proud to work here.
yes, except i have to climb up there one of these days.
in one hour spanish shares have recovered and probably doubled yesterday's value.
with what i lost selling them and the lost profit due to their rise i will lose a million francs at best.
i was happy and proud to wear it, but it's far too beautiful for me.
this necklace is yours, if you don't want it, sell it.
i don't improvise i use the cleverest... the most informed advisor.
thanks to monte cristo, i'm the only french banker to invest in zacatecas.

on elba he'd been given a letter from napoleon to you.
the letter said that the ex-emperor was preparing to flee the island to seize power back in france.
temporarily heloise will try again when she sees the poison didn't work.
she'll concoct another one and i wont know the formula or the antidote.

here is the front page article from tonight's edition of 'le messager'

the light you're seeing is the probe's way of delivering information back to its source.
augur and i have designed a system to capture the images being transmitted.
the holes we're drilling are less than a 3,000th of a millimeter in diameter.
sounds like you had quite an adventure with our friend here.
these renderings and text illustrate the procedure the probe used to capture the butterfly and replicate it.
so we need to understand the text to find out the purpose of the probe.
pike died before we had a chance to question him on this painting.
the fact that the companions implanted him with the cvi changes nothing for me.
i'm constructing a model based on these coordinates to determine where the probe is sending it's data.
we believe the probes home is somewhere in that star system.
how will the knowledge of the taelon language help you to serve companions?
all implant have the same motivational imperative - to serve the companions.
i would offer that the command of the taelon language can only aid in my effectiveness.
i don't expect all implants to have the desire or the capability to learn taelon.
my implant, william boone, has expressed his desire to learn the taelon language.
i have not yet had to respond to such a request.
ar'ral implanted one of the native people's of australia when he was posted as the australian companion.
this aborigine wished to record the taelon history on earth in our native language.
william boone has presented the synod with a multitude of unique challenges since his implantation.
many of his reflections have caused serious debate within the synod.
you're familiar with our earth animals, the tortoise and the hare?
well, in one of our fables there's a race between the two.
the slow and steady tortoise overtakes the sleeping hare and wins the race.
just as the dependable ma'li defeats the gifted but not disciplined la'sha.
so you've projected the probe's point of origin to be in a nebula at the other end of the galaxy from taelon.
i know it seems inconsistent but it's just a preliminary projection.
all of its information is stored in the beam of light known as a neutrino pulse.
this light is within the outer regions of our known light spectrum.
yeah, but it's a huge leap from being able to copy the probe's light source to being able to communicate with it.
i was able to calibrate our equipment to receive the images form this light.
augur's translation program deciphered those images so we could read them.
to communicate with the probe, all we have to do is reverse the process.
we believe that this is the operational directive for the probe.
these characters are similar to the taelon that i've been studying, but it's as if these are written in different dialect.
unless we get in the way of its seek-and-study mandate, which appears to be its prime objective.
yeah, that's right, but this thing is far too complex for us to assume anything.
what i still don't understand is why did the taelons haven't recovered this yet?
i mean, if it's lost, why haven't sandoval and i been involved in locating it?
its investigative function could have let it to seek data from beneath the earth's surface.
organize the class four search team and meet me at boone's office immediately.
this is the dna sequence which was mapped onto the manufactured butterflies.
most of the sequence was unaltered, just a few key strands were changed.
i'm just saying that this guy could to put us in jail, and it is not.
i think we owe him so much that it at least listen.

fondrique city's transportation needs have been left solely to my caravan.
its abundant production plants are guarded so tightly that even i can't get in without my pass.
i ran the day i discovered what the person i thought was my father and my real father had been doing.
yes, fondrique did use the caravan to import cargo but their cargo wasn't all in boxes.
if you leave, they lose their contract with the city the caravan goes under, and everybody dies.
any caravan that participates in something like that should go under!
i ran the day i discovered what the person i thought was my father and my real father had been doing.
fondrique did use the caravan to import cargo but their cargo wasn't all in boxes.
! stop it, julius! they helped me! i'm sorry i'm late! you're not late, moore! julius! come again? julius and i have been friends since childhood.
but he's the son of the owner of the transportation company... ...which passes through demislad, and i'm just a simple dancing girl.
you mean fondrique as in the big city? fondrique city's transportation needs have been left solely to my caravan.
its abundant production plants are guarded so tightly... ...that even i can't get in without my pass.
so they're actually after you, and not her? that's still no reason to run away.
but we do have a reason! i ran the day i discovered what the person i thought was my father... ...and my real father had been doing.
even if it means dooming everyone in the caravan? if you leave, they lose their contract with the city... ...the caravan goes under, and everybody dies.
any caravan that participates in something like that should go under! i hope fondrique goes under, too! don't give me that!
but i have to do what my big sister told me.
she said i should always help people in need! she does everything i can't, so easily... it's really irritating.
besides, they say journeys are emotional scars for life! that's too true to be funny.
you're really funny, miss, uh... i'm milly thompson! what did he ask you to do? nothing nasty, i hope? why won't you say something?
i feel so powerless! maybe he wasn't my real father, but i loved him.
that's why i want him to stop! i don't want to build my happiness on the suffering of others! but that's just nonsense... my actions are making everyone suffer... ...including you.
i can't leave you! moore! julius! you must stop running! is that my father's order?
! no, that is the order of the entire caravan! stop!
you've come so far! milly's right! don't give up, julius! come on, let's go.
julius... mr. priest! you little... moore! jesus, what am i doing?
! thank you so much! but what made you decide to come? i was infected by your nosiness.
i think i actually caught it from him... so you mean business, do you? then expect no mercy! v... vash the stampede.
i used to love it and it's been a long time.
i mean, the last time i tortured somebody, they didn't even have chain saws.

he's an even harder guy to wake up than you are.
i mean, i performed the ritual, said all the right phrases...
ok, i pretty much missed out on some stuff, didn't i?
because... this is all making a kind of sense that's... not.
the thing is i can only act what i've experienced myself.
and i lack the experience for the part of a mother.
for instance, i use my bath water to brush my teeth.
and then i flush the toilet with it, so i use the same water three times.
sometimes it's not and then it's best to be honest about it.
just like you didn't want your wife to be in any scene of your amateur movie.
i wouldn't be surprised if she came out a changed woman.
you have to die a bit first to be able to make a new start.
isn't it a bit obvious to start your autobiography with your birth?
isn't it obvious to use your mother's death as a reason to clean the place up?
i'm 4 years old and i'm tiny... and mummy told me to see if daddy was coming.
so i go on the balcony... and i don't see anything at all.
and she says you that you can change this bad memory... to a positive memory.
you give yourself a new experience... that can be as wild, as positive, as fantastic as you want.
wiebe, should i leave the living room empty, as a symbol of my inner self?
now that i've let go of the past and of mummy.
how come everybody who run off from sweet home can't stop talkin' about it ?
it looks like if it was so sweet, you wouldn't run away.
the best thing is to love everything just a little bit.
that way, if it breaks or runs off or is taken away,
i'm gonna let her, but first get me that ham out of there.
i'm gonna make us a nice, big breakfast against the cold outside.
see, my plan was to get us all over to the other side where my own mammy is.
they stopped me from gettin' us all there, but you had to be put...
especially at night, when it's no good for me to come.
it'll take some convincin', but maybe you could come after supper.
i figure between that and my night work at the bodwins,
i might be able to put somethin' aside for me and mama.
well, i never worked on the river... but i can pick up anything heavy as me, hogs included.
white folks here better than kentucky... but you just might have to scramble some.
was a circle... and a cross burnt right in the skin.
she points at this mark, and she says-- she says to me...
meanest place for a negro i ever seen... outside of pulaski county, kentucky.
i seen negroes so stunned and hungry... they lived in caves, fought owls for food.
seen some who slept in trees in the day... and moved only by night... who buried themselves in slop to hide from... posses and lawmen and regulators.
met a negro boy once-- about 14- who lived by hisself in the woods...
- [ sighing ] and said he could never remember living' anywhere else.
seen a witless coloured woman hang... for stealing ducks she believed was her own babies.
halle bought baby suggs' freedom... but slavery done already busted her legs... and busted her back, hands, everything.
when she come here, she ain't had nothin' left to make no livin' with... besides her heart.
i want you touch me... on the inside part... and call my name.
good people take you in, treat you good... you oughta try to be good back.
just 'cause you can't see no chains don't mean they not there.
and as long as the world is white, that's where we stayin'.
maybe i just knew that long as we was in kentucky with schoolteacher... they really wasn't mine to love.
look like when i jumped off that wagon... wasn't nobody in this world i couldn't love if i want to.
i'd wake up in the morning and... decide for myself what to do with the day.
sometimes i-- i hear my boys-- hear 'em laughin' a laugh i ain't never heard.
first i get scared, scared somebody might hear 'em... and get mad.
then i remembered that if they laughed that hard till it hurt... that'd be the only hurt they have all day.
- it ain't my job to know what's worse, paul d.
it's my job to know what is and keep my children away from it, 'cause i'd rather know... they at peace in heaven than live in a hell here on earth, so help me, jesus.
the first day we got here to bluestone road... you dribbled clear spit on my face.
just like when you come back and drink that water, it run down your chin.
- i'd have known that was you... except for paul d.
looked to me like he wanted you out from the beginning.
they stopped me from gettin' us all there, but you had to be put... where you'd be safe, and i did that.
now you come back... and baby, i ain't gonna never let you go.
[ baby suggs ] you mean i never tell you about your daddy, halle?
how he bought my freedom with all that toil... and never had a chance to see the promised land for hisself?
didn't i tell you about the bodwins... who find me this here house... and give me work in theirs?
how the bodwins, they saved your mama's neck from the rope.
especially at night, when it's no good for me to come.
it'll take some convincing', but maybe you could come after supper.
i figure between that and my night work at the bodwins...
i might be able to put somethin' aside for me and mama.
how could you make a green house like this inside the house?
i would've never guessed that there is something like this inside a house.
i had no idea that you were straight forward like that.
by the way, don't you think the husband would be tired?
even if you marry one of the rich girls and enter a different world of money...
it could be very difficult for an ordinary person to get used to ...
so you feel bad that you couldn't keep your promise to the poor girl next door.
so you can't turn your back to her because of sympathy and responsibility?
for this month's issue, we were planning a photo shoot of a sexy man among successful young entrepreneurs.
but entrepreneurs don't seem too comfortable about having a sexy image.
whether you guys are happy, unhappy, or getting a divorce, it's none of my business.
so leave me out of it, and you take care of it yourself.
he'd lose his place as the husband of the largest shareholder of mun ho group.
let me reveal one more thing while we are at it.
because of you, i took over this company that has been going under.
if you leave, do you think i'll keep this company alive?

didn't i tell you about the bodwins... who find me this here house... and give me work in theirs?
is that why you scared... to go down them steps and out yonder... by yourself?
is that why you didn't go back to miss lady... and finish learnin' your letters?
i figure between that and my night work at the bodwins...
i might be able to put somethin' aside for me and mama.
- [ whimpering continues ] - [ boy ] mama, help me!
- [ boy screaming ] - [ girl ] here, boy!
how come everybody who run off from sweet home can't stop talkin' about it?
it looks like if it was so sweet, you wouldn't run away.
the best thing is to love everything just a little bit.
that way, if it breaks or runs off or is taken away... you know, maybe, you still have a little love left over.
maybe we ought to just leave things the way they are.
sethe, i'm not sayin' this 'cause i need a place to stay.
i don't think i saw her but a few times out in the field... once working' indigo.
by the time i woke up mornings, she was in line.
she opened up her dress, and right on her rib-- right here--
was a circle... and a cross burnt right in the skin.
somethin' happen to me, you can't tell me by my face... you know me by this mark.'
scared me so i couldn't think of nothin' to say... so i says, 'yes, ma'am.
only time i stayed in one spot for more than a month or so... was with a weaver woman in wilmington, delaware.
meanest place for a negro i ever seen... outside of pulaski county, kentucky.
i seen negroes so stunned and hungry... they lived in caves, fought owls for food.
seen some who slept in trees in the day... and moved only by night... who buried themselves in slop to hide from... posses and lawmen and regulators.
met a negro boy once-- about 14- who lived by hisself in the woods...
- [ sighing ] and said he could never remember living' anywhere else.
i don't have to tell you about sweet home... what it was.
maybe you don't know what it was like for me to get away from there.
sometimes i-- i hear my boys-- hear 'em laughin' a laugh i ain't never heard.
first i get scared, scared somebody might hear 'em... and get mad.
then i remembered that if they laughed that hard till it hurt... that'd be the only hurt they have all day.
and when the people would gather-- they'd come from all around to hear baby suggs holy--
[ chuckling ] oh, my people... they do not love your hands.
those... they only use... tie... bind... chop off... and leave empty.
i'm gonna let her, but first get me that ham out of there.
i'm gonna make us a nice, big breakfast against the cold outside.
- [ beloved grunting ] - but paul d, he distract me.
then later on... when you asked me about them earrings i used to dangle for you to play with...
see, my plan was to get us all over to the other side where my own mammy is.
they stopped me from gettin' us all there, but you had to be put... where you'd be safe, and i did that.
how he bought my freedom with all that toil... and never had a chance to see the promised land for hisself?
didn't i tell you about the bodwins... who find me this here house... and give me work in theirs?
is that why you scared... to go down them steps and out yonder... by yourself?
is that why you didn't go back to miss lady... and finish learnin' your letters?
i wouldn't have to ask you about hi m, would i?
you'd tell me if there was anything to tell, wouldn't you?
maybe we ought to just leave things the way they are.
sethe, i'm not sayin' this 'cause i need a place to stay.
just 'cause you can't see no chains don't mean they not there.
and as long as the world is white, that's where we stayin'.
i don't have to tell you about sweet home, what it was.
maybe you don't know what it was like for me to get away from there.
so wide, when i stretched out my arms, all my children could get in between.
looked like i-- looked like i loved 'em more after we got here.
it's my job to know what is and keep my children away from it, 'cause i'd rather know...
they at peace in heaven than live in a hell here on earth, so help me, jesus.
right here is all that is and all there needs to be.
right here is all that is and all there needs to be.
see, my plan was to get us all over to the other side where my own mammy is.
they stopped me from gettin' us all there, but you had to be put...
and never had a chance to see the promised land for hisself?
didn't i tell you about the bodwins, who find me this here house...
especially at night, when it's no good for me to come.
it'll take some convincing', but maybe you could come after supper.
dr van buren: 'early on the morning of june 22, 1859, a woman's body was found in prince's cut, a basin on the coventry to oxford canal.'
'as the boatman philip tomes would say in evidence later, he had moored his narrowboat up canal from oxford when he noticed something in the water.'
and i am determined to discover if this was the case.
the men in the dock, common boatmen, whose names are not their own, whom the christian religion has hardly touched, are charged with murdering a young woman, joanna franks.
he left coventry to work in london as an ostler, that his new wife might not starve.
when he had saved one sovereign, he sent it to his wife that she might join him.
i'll go to the bodleian, see what i can find out.
mr stevens, you're a canal clerk, employed at tooley's yard, banbury.
'i saw her go back to the fly boat looking content.'
if you had done your job, she might have saved herself.
you said you went to sleep and never saw her again.
but in earlier testimony, you said she went ashore and you saw the others go looking for her.
i went to the mortuary... only to have my very worst fears confirmed.
the woman who lay there, cold and disfigured, was my wife joanna.
mr lyons, the medical evidence shows that her death could not be suicide.
but it is not proof that these men committed her murder, my lord.
'sirs, the men in the dock are illiterate men, irreligious men.'
'lewd men who drank to excess and drank cargoes they were meant to guard.
it is also true that we have no witness to this evil murder.
although the evidence of the boy wootton is proof enough that there was much drunken lewdness.
you may conclude that they were so befuddled with drink as to ignore such a natural instinct of self-preservation.
you may also consider... that if these men are not guilty of this heinous crime, well, who else on or near the fly boat barbara bray may have had both motive and means of carrying it out?
'when she got on the fly boat at coventry with her sovereign.'
'yet for eight shillings she could have gone by train and been with her husband in a day.'
'then, according to evidence in court, she went aboard with a trunk and a carpetbag.'
'we've seen the trunk, but we never heard of the carpetbag again.'

i heard that the owner actually met the beatles in pakistan.
yeah, why do you think they ran off to india, huh?
that should cover everything and dessert too, if you want it.
so, uh, just try and stay out for a few hours, okay?
so you just forget that he destroyed the most beloved daughter of your tribe?
that he killed every man, woman and child that touched her life?
but finally they were able to dismember him, but... not kill him.
the pieces were scattered, buried in every corner of the earth.
you might give him a chance to find your lost treasure.
he is a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain.
# marvel at their pale skin, wonder how they chew on their pointy...
# teeth and hair are beauty, they know it's a duty to be countess in their hearts...
angel and i do recon, see how far they've got assembling the judge.
you check any places the boxes could be coming into town - shipping yards, airports.
as they have been before, and i imagine will be again.
one thing i've learnt here on the hellmouth is that there is no good time to relax.
of a demon brought forth to rid the earth of the plague of humanity.
to separate the righteous from the wicked, and to burn the righteous down.
he is a wanker, but he's the only one we've got with half a brain.
if he fails, you can eat his eyes out of the sockets for all i care.

and angel's always in front of the tv with a big blood belly.
# marvel at their pale skin, wonder how they chew on their pointy...
# teeth and hair are beauty, they know it's a duty
angel and i go to the factory and do recon, figure out how far they've gotten assembling the judge.
you, guys, check any places the boxes could be coming into town - shipping yards, airports, anything.
well, i've got to get up and down between three floors.
you know, i still think you could've consolidated it on one floor.
do you have any idea how expensive it is to be disabled in this country?
the sooner i get back to work, the better it's gonna be for both of us.
you've been absolutely terrific, dr. schneider, and i hope i never see you again the rest of my life.
we never had a patient quite like you, jason, quite so driven.
they were able to re-wire the monitors to give you voice-access to the computer from every floor.
per your specifications, the lift is triggered automatically by sensors in your wheelchair, as are the lights.
- well, what's odd is that he really beat the crap out of her last night and today she doesn't look so bad.
she's wearing a lot of makeup for this early in the day.
charlie moore says they're gonna prosecute him for battery even if she doesn't cooperate.
'cause it's an election year, the mayor wants to crack down on domestic violence.
relationships like that are far too complicated to understand from the outside.
next time, do us all a favor and don't call 911.
i'll tell him we're trying to reach his wife to drop the charges.
give him an incentive to call her and then call us.
i told her, if he'd seen something, why did he wait until now?
but he could still cause trouble, she said, get the cops snooping around.
you know, i still think you could've consolidated it on one floor.
yeah, i've got all my gym equipment, i got nurses, there's me.
per your specifications, the lift is triggered automatically by sensors in your wheelchair, as are the lights.
also per your specs, you can turn them off with your sipping straw.
did you give the job away when i was on the operating table?
'cause you didn't think i'd survive the surgery, is that it?
so, you've been working on my project keeping it warm for me?
well, i hope i've been doing a little more than that.
no, in fact, i have a photographic memory for names, faces, blueprints, trivial statistics.
but i don't have any memory from that friday afternoon until the accident.
from here i got a straight shot right down into the loft.
if you were my neighbor and i knew you had this...
'cause it's an election year, the mayor wants to crack down on domestic violence.
so he made bail last night, he came home, and then they had another knockdown dragout fight.
well, her jewelry box and perfume are still on the dresser.
she might leave her husband but she's not gonna leave her jewelry.
but, if she's not home by noon tomorrow, i'll go talk to thorpe.
i'll tell him we're trying to reach his wife to drop the charges.
give him an incentive to call her and then call us.
and what if he says he doesn't know where she is?
then, as soon as i thought i was old enough, i just...
she got married again a couple of years back..., ...to a poet.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
if anyone deserves to be in the elysian fields..., ...it's alcmene.
not a day has gone by that i haven't looked in on her.
i may be a god now, but that doesn't change who i am.
believe me, hercules..., ...i don't want you to change who you are.
if you keep it inside, it's just gonna make things worse.
i always wanted you to go out in the world..., ...and make a life, iolaus..., ...and i'm glad you did.
but the truth is..., ...i don't know you well enough to be proud of you.
mother, i'm trying to work things out with zeus..., ...like you wanted.
and your love for a mortal woman will be your undoing!
what in the name of all the gods have you done?
and she'll remain like this forever..., ...unless you surrender your godhood to me.
and what makes you think i won't cover the world with your ashes?
you know, maybe it might just come to him how miserable he is without you.
if i thought he wasn't going to suffer..., ...i would have killed him outright.
no, i'm the one that should apologize..., ...to you, and to my mother.
i had my mind made up about you before you ever came home.
the only way i can truly help mankind is to be among people, not above them.
as a complete god, you could do so much more for them, and for yourself.
we should have good k.u. coverage all the way through l.d.s. release.
in fact, we're covered all the way through the landing and airlock egress.
to discover a means to defend ourselves against the alien species, should they ever return to earth.
now, as you know, gentlemen, eve was re-created from a frozen lab embryo.
a toxic agent works once, but then it becomes useless once the alien's biology adapts.
you've gone out of your way to give this... this lab animal... a living situation that's fit for a queen!
i was determined to push our program even further into space.
and so today, jack kennedy's vision is maintained by the commitment of american business.
and i thought to myself how easy it would be to destroy all that god has created.
i think, as we look to the future, our greatest mission might be right here at home.
the substance found in dr. orinsky's wounds is combinant alien-human dna.
this dna is structurally similar to eve's, but it's not a perfect match.
obviously, eve has not left the compound, which means, gentlemen, that there's another one out there.
none of our intelligence suggests that a foreign power was involved.
listen, i went over orinsky's phone records, and this is the last place he called.
i cross-checked all the patients, and i came up with one named herman cromwell.
we got one dead n.s.e.g. doctor, we have a guy who warned the government not to go to mars, they slapped him in a loony bin... and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight.
we need to do blood analysis on sampas, gamble and ross.
and if these two were to mate, the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable.
well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
we could use the lab's cyclotron to bombard her with radiation.
that would awaken her dormant genes, but there is a problem.
they told me what happened... how you got infected up on mars.
i'm sorry, paddy... for not listening when you asked for help.
i've used dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin.
of course, i have no idea whether or not this is going to work.
we should have good ku coverage all the way through l.d.s. release.
in fact, we're covered all the way through landing and air lock egress.
i was just a very young assistant up on the hill.
it didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary...
tell you the truth, i haven't been feeling so great either.
yeah, i think what we all need is a little tender loving care.
how easy it would be to destroy all that god has created.
i think, as we look to the future, our greatest mission might be right here at home.
oh, i know what you been doin', and frankly, i don't give a damn.
dad... but i have seen too many young men with promising careers...
we need to do blood analysis on sampas, gamble and ross.
now, i know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days...
if these two were to mate, the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable.
can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
now, you listen to me, you arrogant son of a bitch!
if you so much as touch a hair on his head, you will rue the day you were born!
i've used dennis's blood sample as the basis for this toxin.
of course, i have no idea whether or not this is going to work.
not for one nation... not for one people... not for one creed... but for all humankind.
patrick ross, son of a senator, football star at yale, and now the first man on mars.
i need you to check rover two's next drilling site for me.
patrick, would you take a look at your primary o-2... and power levels on your d.c.m.
we'd like the crew to take a star tracker pass... and perform an i.m.u. alignment before we update the state vector.
capcom, let the crew know navigation wants a fix on a star position... and alignment of the interior moment unit... before putting a new state vector on board.
you've gone out of your way to give this... this lab animal... a living situation that's fit for a queen!
i suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing.
we do have a few people here who would like a further examination.
boy, there's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me.
i was just a very young assistant up on the hill.
it didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary... and that i shared that vision.
and so today, jack kennedy's vision... is maintained by the commitment of american business.
but i like to think that his spirit is embodied... in young men like patrick ross.
tell you the truth, i haven't been feeling so great either.
yeah, i think what we all need is a little tender loving care.
thank you, father, for what i'm sure were overly kind words.
i've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew... to represent the mission to mars... and an image that comes to my mind... is looking through the porthole... at the blue-white globe... beautiful... so fragile, so small.
and i thought to myself... how easy it would be to destroy all that god has created.
i think, as we look to the future... our greatest mission might be right here at home.
oh, i know what you been doin', and frankly, i don't give a damn.
but i have seen too many young men with promising careers... piss it all away on a piece of ass.
this dna is structurally similar to eve's... but it's not a perfect match.
obviously, eve has not left the compound... which means, gentlemen, that there's another one out there.
one step off the premises, and a toxic capsule explodes in her brain.
you know, it's really great to see you again... and i was hoping we'd meet under better circumstances... but, i remember laura baker having a little bit more soul.
it turned a thriving planet with... rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life... into a useless hunk of rock.
when i heard they were going to send a mission to mars...
you are following a lead based on the interrogation... of a certified nutcase.
we got one dead n.s.e.g. doctor... we have a guy who warned the government not to go to mars... they slapped him in a loony bin... and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight.
we need to do blood analysis on sampas, gamble and ross.
now, i know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days... on all interplanetary missions, and the mars quarantine ends tonight.
i think it's safe to assume he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.
well, then in less than two weeks, these offspring reach adolescence... and then they enter the chrysalis stage.
well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
we've seen spiking in her biorhythms... which indicate a rudimentary connection... but half her alien genes are dormant.
i'm taking this because i'm about to go back to africa on somebody's ass.
i've used dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin.

you know, it's really great to see you again... and i was hoping we'd meet under better circumstances... but, i remember laura baker having a little bit more soul.
it turned a thriving planet with... rivers and oceans and rudimentary plant life... into a useless hunk of rock.
when i heard they were going to send a mission to mars...
you are following a lead based on the interrogation... of a certified nutcase.
we got one dead n.s.e.g. doctor... we have a guy who warned the government not to go to mars... they slapped him in a loony bin... and a seven-minute time gap during the space flight.
we need to do blood analysis on sampas, gamble and ross.
now, i know that there is a sexual quarantine of ten days... on all interplanetary missions, and the mars quarantine ends tonight.
i think it's safe to assume he's banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.
well, then in less than two weeks, these offspring reach adolescence... and then they enter the chrysalis stage.
well, can she tell us where he is without leaving the lab?
we've seen spiking in her biorhythms... which indicate a rudimentary connection... but half her alien genes are dormant.
i'm taking this because i'm about to go back to africa on somebody's ass.
i've used dennis' blood sample as the basis for this toxin.
not for one nation... not for one people... not for one creed... but for all humankind.
patrick ross, son ofa senator, football star at yale, and now the first man on mars.
i need you to check rover two's next drilling site for me.
patrick, would you take a look at yourprimary o-2... andpower levels on your d.c.m.
we'd like the crew to take a star trackerpass... andperform an l.m.u. alignment before we update the state vector.
capcom, let the crewknow navigation wants a fix on a starposition... and alignment of the interior moment unit... before putting a new state vector on board.
you've gone out of your way to give this...this lab animal... a living situation that's fit for a queen!
i suggest you spend more time finding a way to 86 the damn thing.
we do have a few people here who would like a further examination.
boy, there's enough fine booty out there to cure what ails me.
i was just a very young assistant up on the hill.
it didn't take me long to realize that he was a visionary... and that i shared that vision.
and so today, jack kennedy's vision... is maintained by the commitment of american business.
but i like to think that his spirit is embodied... in young men like patrick ross.
tell you the truth, i haven't been feeling so great either.
yeah, i think what we all need is a little tender loving care.
thank you, father, for what i'm sure were overly kind words.
i've been chosen on behalf of my wonderful crew... to represent the mission to mars... and an image that comes to my mind... is looking through the porthole... at the blue-white globe... beautiful... so fragile, so small.
and i thought to myself... how easy it would be to destroy all that god has created.
i think, as we look to the future... our greatest mission might be right here at home.
oh, i know what you been doin', and frankly, i don't give a damn.
but i have seen too many young men with promising careers... piss it all away on a piece of ass.
this dna is structurally similar to eve's... but it's not a perfect match.

kung lao will make his stand in the tournament called mortal kombat.
here, the elder gods grant the greatest fighters... of the universe the right to defend their own realms... against the warriors of the dark realm called outworld.
tell me, rayden, would you rather be old and happy or young and cursed?
if my future is unwritten like you say... then i'll write it the way i want, from now on!
but, if you're serious about marrying jen... you have to put aside this foolishness once and for all.
but barron, how can you ask me to abandon my faith?
your purpose, if the rumours are true... is revenge upon the earth realm warrior, kung lao.
a difficult proposition from inside these mines... but possible with my help, of course.
to find more and train them well, that is one path.
the other promises bliss... but it will also lead you to betrayal, to suffering and death.
it occurred to me that with your magic powers... you could release the warrior within.
in exchange for settling your score on earth with kung lao.
it might be worth it, just to get another shot at you, traitor.
if i'm the traitor... why are you the one being exiled?
could you truly love kung lao more than your own father?
if you would've loved me, father, you would've never made me choose.
until you commit to fulfil your destiny, you cannot defeat takeda.
there's much more at stake here, kung lao, than even the life of jen.
this realm of yours is the greatest prize in the universe.
and now that shang tsung has taken jen and takeda... we know that he can strike out at anytime in any form... and will stop at nothing to defeat you.
you must find a place in the heart of the city to call your own.
a place where you can find and train new fighters for the next tournament.
i'm not but i have to admit i saw some very strange stuff and... if i'm gonna risk my life, better it to be for something worthwhile.
i could use your help, but i can't be responsible for your safety.
all the other things you talk about make no sense to me.
it may take a while, but shang tsung will be punished.
bessie and bodie's new edition still pulling a day for a night?
i swear to god, dawson, my sister gave birth to rosemary's baby.
i overslept, and i didn't have time to cram for my spanish test.
i know things have been crazy since alexander was born but it's the first time for bodie and i and the learning curve's been steep.
but he is still my friend and only my friend and i'd appreciate it if you could give him a place to crash for the night.
believe me, dawson anything billy ever meant to me, you now mean 1 0 times that.
i have no intention of leaving until jen's come back to me.
so the question is, what do you do about it, dawson?
did she fill in the blanks that make a story a story?
because my guess is, there's a lot you don't know, dawson.
i really did want to let you know how much i appreciate your generosity in giving him a place to crash and everything.
billy's not exactly here to watch the leaves change color is he, jen?
i mean, we never really got a chance to say goodbye.
my parents threw me out so fast, there wasn't time for closure.
look, this isn't the easiest situation in the world for me either.
imagine if some ex-girlfriend of yours suddenly showed up to town and put everything in a whirlwind...
all i'm trying to do is prevent billy's ex from becoming my ex too.
my feelings for you haven't changed, dawson, can't you see that?
if you're gonna fight therapy every step of the way then we're both wasting time.
so let me know because if that's the case, then we might as well...
i am the last person who should give you or anyone else romance tips.
however, it seems every relationship produces its share of disappointment and insecurity and pain.
look, billy, it's been good to see you again but i should go to that party and find dawson since i owe him about 400 explanations.
all right then, before you leave since who knows when and if we'll ever see each other again how about for old time's sake, you and me just one last kiss?
- yeah, i'm here, i'm alone and i'm sorry about everything, dawson about the way that i treated you.
i mean, i was foolish, and it was stupid of me to think that...
all right, not that i care but you might want to pace yourself with this stuff.
pacey, i know i don't say it enough, but you're a really terrific friend.
i just talked to jen, and apparently she's not as confused as she seems.
so it looks like the nice guy is gonna get the girl after all.
truth is, it's really no different than it is right now.
i mean, geography aside, i am still the same stupid girl who's always found it easier to escape into a relationship than to face life on her own.
i would gladly trade in all my experience for just an ounce of your idealism.
and i wish i knew some better way to say this...
i've got to try life on my own for a while.
you can't just make me fall for you and then bail as soon as it...
bessie and bodie's new edition still pulling a day for a night?
i swear to god, dawson, my sister gave birth to rosemary's baby.

i swear to god, dawson, my sister gave birth to rosemary's baby.
i know things have been crazy since alexander was born but it's the first time for bodie and i and the learning curve's been steep.
i promise things will settle down just as soon as we get through this adjustment period.
billy, do you have any idea what my grandmother would do if she knew you were here?
the reason my parents sent me here was to get me away from you.
yes, but it's completely over between billy and i and i told him everything about us, and that i'm with you now.
but he is still my friend and only my friend and i'd appreciate it if you could give him a place to crash for the night.
but in the meantime, you and i should take advantage of our newfound closeness here.
i'll bet you're dying to get to know what jen was like in new york.
billy, i already know all about you and jen and her life in new york.
so nothing i'm curious about, no information i'm fishing for, okay?
hey, dawson, i don't want to lie to you, so yeah, billy still has feelings for me.
i mean, we never really got a chance to say goodbye.
my parents threw me out so fast, there wasn't time for closure.
you wanted to make a break from those guys who sexualized you.
i'm not one to stand in the way of true love.
but if jen has a connection to this guy, which it seems like she does....
we're a couple of nice guys which stopped being a desirable trait about half a century ago.
i am the last person who should give you or anyone else romance tips.
however, it seems every relationship produces its share of disappointment and insecurity and pain.
anyone who's never been hurt is either very lucky or very lonely.
do you know how much i just wanna scoop you up and take you to new york?
and i would just end up turning around and coming here.
i think that's where we disagree, dawson because not only does this concern me, it concerns me gravely.
so if there was ever a third and expendable wheel, it would be you.
i guess scuba diving wasn't such an inspired idea after all.
yeah, well, i don't think that scuba diving water skiing or bungee jumping...
i just talked to jen, and apparently she's not as confused as she seems.
so it looks like the nice guy is gonna get the girl after all.
truth is, it's really no different than it is right now.
i mean, geography aside, i am still the same stupid girl who's always found it easier to escape into a relationship...
i would gladly trade in all my experience for just an ounce of your idealism.
and i wish i knew some better way to say this--
i've got to try life on my own for a while.
you can't just make me fall for you and then bail as soon as it....
she was waving it about with her finger on the trigger.
anything could have happened, i tried to stop her, but she turned the gun on herself and she pulled the trigger.
my instructions were to take his statement, not to arrest him.
well, what did you make of him before you mislaid him?
"you look back and you can just glimpse the last time you were happy.
"you look ahead and you can't even imagine the next time.
i'm just here to give you my solemn promise that in a few weeks' time, your beautiful cathedral will bear witness to the most dramatic event seen in this city for nigh on 400 years.
it will be a community production in the true tradition of the ancient mystery plays with ordinary folk playing out the eternal drama of good and evil.
i'm especially grateful to the man who's been my link with the cathedral authorities.
so how about you all put your hands together, so to speak, for the gentle and patient
well, i suppose god would know, what with him being god and stuff like that.
although i'm no religious freak myself, which you probably think's a bit strange, what with the cross and the...
harold lives at 27 a. this is 27 without an a.
you'll find his front door at the back, in the yard.
to see if money will get misadventure or accidental death, is that it?
my client believes that mr waterson will confirm this version of events when his statement becomes available.
so that mrs swain's remains could be released to next of kin for a christian burial.
off the record, i will add that the chief constable shares my concern about the way that this matter has dragged on.
if a man keeps running around with other women, what does say about the wife?
if i run around with other women, my wife would reach for the shears and a divorce lawyer.
you just got back this morning and now you're off again?
i'm a traveller, got to keep moving, nature of the job.
he assumed we'd track him back to beverly's houseboat and find that, so he dumped it.
and the night i saw him at the pub, he was supposed to have a thousand in cash for harold park.
you see, the cheque was drawn on his wife's account and signed by her in the middle of february, but the bank refused to honour it, because in their opinion, the signature wasn't genuine.
your client, your ex-client, tried to pay off his lawyers with a forged cheque?
swain is remanded in custody, but continues to deny he actually murdered anyone.
yeah, but whatever happens, he's going down for 57 kinds of conspiracy.
bear witness to the most dramatic event and i'm looking for god.
...bear witness to the most dramatic event seen in this city for nigh on 400 years.
after years of gratuitous self-examination, you finally did it, you acted.
i mean, i thought you and joey were going to draw out this 'will they-won't they'drama for at least another couple of years.
- sam and diane didn't get together for at least 4 seasons and mulder and scully... they haven't even kissed!
- if you and joey can get across this romantic checkmate thing you've been in for god knows how many years...anything is possible!
- sitting behind the wheel of a very powerful and dangerous automobile is a huge responsibility.
- one lapse of judgement and you could run over a cat, a child, a nun.
- you know i could have this license revoked, just like that.
in fact, i think i'm just going to take you in and book you right now.
- i have been having major anxiety attacks, to the point of medication,ever since you pulled your little stunt.
- spinning scenarios in my head about being carded off to prison and becoming a sex slave to some sadis named bomber bertha.
- well, unlike certain sewer rats, she made the effort to welcome the new, and slightly insecure, to capeside.
- well, she probably didn't recognize me i just had my tips frosted.
there are people in this community who rely on these donations.
- but don't you think it's a little early to be clearing out his closet?
i loved your grandfather from our very first date through 43 years of marriage and when he had his stroke,
i sat by his bedside and for months all i did was pray for his recovery.
i watched him waste away in that bed for almost 2 years.
- so whether i clean out his closet today or not, he's gone.
- before you let those thoughts get the best of you, here's the truth.
- the promo meeting ran long and after that there was traffic all the way up i-95 and i know that ann landers said... that you're never supposed to give more than one excuse when you're explaining yourself to somebody,
- in fact, we don't even know each other at all.
but i was wondering if i could change that and maybe get to know you a little better take you out to dinner and a movie sometime.
- it's the one filled by desire and attraction, and all of that, but the second kiss is rational.
- you got time to worry, and over analyze and most women... they prefer that first kiss, but...
- i'm partial to the second one because it's about something more.
- you'll get that second kiss joey and when you do it'll be great.
i'm really glad we've already bipassed the end of the evening "will she kiss me?" drama.
- so, um, it should pretty much me smooth sailing from here on out.
- yeah, but now you have to endure the agony of "well,
- i've already kissed her so should we just check into a motel and go at it like porn stars?" anxiety.
- they'll probably put up something horrible that will makethis place even more boring then it already is.
- i guess all our movie watching will have to berestricted to my bedroom then.
- it seems a little sad, really, that i was the girl who's sole purpose was to allow you figure out who you were really in love with.
- jen, please don't think of it like that, i mean, you and i had fun, we just...
- um, i was thinking we could go get a little bit of dinner.
we're probably a little too late for the movie, but that's okay.
see, i suffer from asthma, and i know how much i'd hate it if anybody treated me differently because of that.
- well, goodnight pacey, and i really think that you're quite a guy.
- my parents couldn't stand me so they shipped me off to you.
- so here i am, living in this strange town without a friend to my name, and you know what the sad thing is?
why don't you just rub some salt in this open, painful wound.
- you know, kristy livingstone, she was kind of like a metaphor.
- the reason i went to see drake is because i want to know what my options are.
- you can either give me another chance wholeheartedly or go to drake and... write him a very large check and make our marriage another statistic.
- i mean, in france i could have started over, you know.
i wouldn't be joey the waitress, or joey the daughter of a convict, or joey half of the "will they/won't they" couple of the century.
- i didn't go to france because it just seemed like the easy way out, you know?
- the easiest escape from my life, which in spite of a few highlights is pretty pathetic.
but i didn't want to take that easy way out, dawson.
- it just seemed like sticking around here would only make me stronger.
what you and i have may never be simple... but that doesn't mean that we're not going to be scorching.
- besides, who's to say that you can't have some of france right here in capeside, hum?
- here we are along the river sende', a tour of the il de la city, the favorite spot of lovers and friends.
- and from here we also have a view of the magnificent structure that we simplists here in capeside like to call...ze swingset.
- granted, it's no eiffel tower, but it's all we got.
- but don't forget about the other franc-o-fellow opportunities in town.
after years of gratuitous self-examination, you finally did it, you acted.
i mean, i thought you and joey were going to draw out this 'will they-won't they'drama for at least another couple of years.
- sam and diane didn't get together for at least 4 seasons and mulder and scully... they haven't even kissed!
- if you and joey can get across this romantic checkmate thing you've been in for god knows how many years... anything is possible!
- sitting behind the wheel of a very powerful and dangerous automobile is a huge responsibility.
- one lapse of judgement and you could run over a cat, a child, a nun.
- you know i could have this license revoked... just like that.
in fact, i think i'm just going to take you in and book you right now.
- oh, there's a conversation i would love to hear taking as my father is the town sheriff!
- i have been having major anxiety attacks, to the point of medication,ever since you pulled your little stunt.
- spinning scenarios in my head about being carded off to prison and becoming a sex slave to some sadis named bomber bertha.
- okay, now, correct me if i'm wrong, didn't you cause the accident?
i sat by his bedside and for months all i did was pray for his recovery.
- but when his condition worsened, do you know what i prayed for?
- the promo meeting ran long and after that there was traffic all the way up i-95 and i know that ann landers said... that you're never supposed to give more than one excuse when you're explaining yourself to somebody,
but that is the truth mitch, and i really need you to believe me.
i know this is sort of abrupt seeing as we hardly know each other.
- in fact, we don't even know each other at all.
but the thing is, it hasn't happened since then and it was yesterday.
- well, that's not unusual, because the way i see it, the second kiss,it's always tougher than the first one.
- you got time to worry, and over analyze and most women... they prefer that first kiss, but...
- i'm partial to the second one because it's about something more.
- so, um, it should pretty much me smooth sailing from here on out.
- yeah, but now you have to endure the agony of "well,
- yeah, the stripe you have right across your heart and how at any moment it could just start strangling your heart and you stop breathing and die.
- she said you wanted to keep in a secret, no special treatment or anything.
- so here i am, living in this strange town without a friend to my name, and you know what the sad thing is?
- is actually that you may be the best friend i've got.
- i was under the impression that i could overcome my unlucky ways but after what's happened tonight, obviously not.
- back to the old pacey, the black sheep, the loser, the brunette!
- you're not pulling another little prank on me here... you know, i screw you, you screw me.
- guess you'll just have to take that chance, won't ya?
- because i'm not sure i can stay married to a woman i love and hate in equal measure.
- the reason i went to see drake is because i want to know what my options are.
i wouldn't be joey the waitress, or joey the daughter of a convict, or joey half of the "will they/won't they" couple of the century.

- one lapse of judgement and you could run over a cat, a child, a nun.
- you know i could have this license revoked, just like that.
but i just want to let you know that i got my eyes on you now, blondie.
- you cause anymore trouble in capeside and officer pacey is coming after you.
me not going to france... you and me talking dirty in the halls...
- i mean, do you think we're making some massive, monumental mistake?
i mean granted we'll be entering some uncharted boy/girl territory but...
- i honestly think regardless of how complicated things are on a day to day basis, we'll be fine.
- oh, there's a conversation i would love to hear taking as my father is the town sheriff!

- well, unlike certain sewer rats, she made the effort to welcome the new, and slightly insecure, to capeside.
- well, she probably didn't recognize me i just had my tips frosted.
there are people in this community who rely on these donations.
- but don't you think it's a little early to be clearing out his closet?
i loved your grandfather from our very first date through 43 years of marriage and when he had his stroke,
i sat by his bedside and for months all i did was pray for his recovery.
i watched him waste away in that bed for almost 2 years.
- so whether i clean out his closet today or not, he's gone.
- before you let those thoughts get the best of you, here's the truth.

we return our arts to the dark from which they were created.
never to be summoned a second time. an organization called arcam was formed to seal away know ledge of this ancient civilization.
and have dominion over what enfolds the earth. change the blessings of heaven to those of hell and create humanity anew.
that was the message left on the stone tablet that we have. the "blessings of heaven" are the sun's ultra-violet rays. you control ultra-violet radiation.
what is this? but it has other functions besides changing the atmosphere.
it's such a crazy theory that no one would believe it.
i'll take you with me down to the bottom of hell!
what kind of fool enters a holy place with his boots on?
your orihalcon suit that you're so proud of is like a toy to me.
will you stop defiling the house of god with your blood?
noah is starting to go out of control in response to your powers!
what the hell do you think you can do with that body made of junk?
i don't know who sent you, but you're not ready to take me on yet.
this is the spriggan, yu ominae, a member of the special operatives unit of arcam, which seeks to seal off dangerous ruins of ancient civilizations.
don't get so hung up on the past you forget your job now.
when you act like that, you endanger everyone who's entrusted you with their lives.
that was the message left on the stone tablet that we have.
putting that together with your data, the "blessings of heaven" are the sun's ultra-violet rays.
i see why the pentagon is so anxious to secure you.
how many crimes have they justified in the name of the states!
there must be some meaning behind the location of the ark.
why would it be here at the top of a mountain that stands alone?
my country must be the world's leader at all times, you see.
and to do that, we absolutely had to get our hands on this.
your orihalcon suit that you're so proud of is like a toy to me.
will you stop defiling the house of god with your blood?
noah is starting to go out of control in response to your powers!
what the hell do you think you can do with that body made of junk?
your friends, though, are in concrete at the bottom of the bosporus strait.
i don't know who sent you, but you're not ready to take me on yet.
don't get so hung up on the past you forget your job now.
when you act like that, you endanger everyone who's entrusted you with their lives.
that was the message left on the stone tablet that we have.
putting that together with your data, the "blessings of heaven" are the sun's ultra-violet rays.
i see why the pentagon is so anxious to secure you.
how many crimes have they justified in the name of the states!
there must be some meaning behind the location of the ark.
why would it be here at the top of a mountain that stands alone?
if the atomic bomb is the symbol of power, then noah will surely become the symbol of peace.
my country must be the world's leader at all times, you see.
noah probably caused the ice age that destroyed the dinosaurs, but it has other functions besides changing the atmosphere.
it's such a crazy theory that no one would believe it.
i'll take you with me down to the bottom of hell!
what kind of fool enters a holy place with his boots on?
one which perished as a result of it's own unchecked technological progress.
they said, "return the art created in the infinite darkness to the darkness."
the special agents that operate within it, are known as spriggan.
subtitled for the exclusive use of the anime club of cape cod!
your friends should be under the bosporas strait, packed in concrete about now...
i don't know where you're from but it's way too early in the morning to be fighting.
it enables the user to draw more than 30 times as much power as is normally used.
that reminds me, how long has it been since we've taken any vacation?
when our satellite probe was destroyed the investigation into the magnetic field occurrence was quite significant.
this ancient stone manuscript we discovered in one of the ruins, along with the other message plate prove that we are the ones who are holding the key to noah.
you were fascinated by the past, and forgot about the actual mission.
if you act like that, those who trust us, and entrust their lives to us will be exposed to danger.
information from the satellite probe has revealed a shift in the magnetic field.
mayzel's research has certainly been progressing, and it seems he's reached the heart.
i think there is a meaning in the fact that the ark is in this area.
what was so special about the top of this mountain, that no other mountain around was suitable for?
tracing back our history the ice ages that wiped out the dinosaurs and other life forms were the result of noah's power, too.
but, i think noah has another function besides controlling the atmosphere.
but it was so eccentric, that no one would believe such a fact.
that just maybe the countless dinosaurs and other strange animals in stasis outside in the ark were probably used in experiments for creating the life forms that would carry on the next generation.
the history of the human race was created within this "noah's ark!"
come now, let us build a new world with our hands.
as it has been since ancient times, the power that is given, is only given to the chosen one.
a person like you has no right to be on this ark.
where on earth is a god who was made by humans?
noah began to behave rashly, when it began resonating with your power.
its message is a warning to us who live today from an unknown civilization built long ago that vanished into the distant reaches of eternity.
it says, "we return our arts to the dark from which they were created ."
i can't send you to a place like that in your current condition.
this job is out of the question while you're still hurt.
i don't know who sent you, but you're not ready to take me on yet.
this is the spriggan, yu ominae, a member of the special operatives unit of arcam, which seeks to seal off dangerous ruins of ancient civilizations.
we analyzed the magnetic field it destroyed our satellite with and the results have been quite useful.
the plate and stone tablet found at each of the ruins verifies this.
when you act like that, you endanger everyone who's entrusted you with their lives.
according to the information from our probe satellite, the magnetic fields are focusing .
putting that together with your data, the "blessings of heaven" are the sun's ultra-violet rays.
by adjusting the ozone layer and carbon dioxide that enfold earth, you control ultra-violet radiation.
my country must be the world's leader at all times, you see.
and to do that, we absolutely had to get our hands on this.
your orihalcon suit that you're so proud of is like a toy to me.
will you stop defiling the house of god with your blood?
noah is starting to go out of control in response to your powers!
what the hell do you think you can do with that body made of junk?
so you see, mr. big record producer i wrote " stinky britches" several years ago!
i see no resemblance between that song and " stinky britches" by our artist alanis morissette.
on this 15th day of what is considered to be the most important trial of the day johnnie cochran will defend capitalist records.
the question now is, will cochran use his famous chewbacca defense?
in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury you've heard my client's song, recorded over 20 years ago.
you've heard the exact same song produced by these cheats in the past month.
and mr. twig has no idea mr. hat is even back.
i care a lot about mr. twig, but mr. hat and i have so much history.
we're all here to help our friend chef, who has touched our lives.
i remember when i was starting out, chef suggested i buy a pompadour hat.
ladies and gentlemen of the supposed jury, you must now decide on reversing the decision for my client.
i know he seems guilty, but, ladies and gentlemen this is chewbacca.
heading on up to south park, gonna see if i can't unwind.
"i like girls with big ol' titties, i like girls with big vaginas."
come on down to south park and meet some friends of mine.
stinky britches, you've got stinky britches stinky stinky britches, you've got stinky-
i'm sure that would scare the hell out of him, cartman.
and so, in summation, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you've heard the version of my client's song recorded over twenty years ago.
in a teary-eyed courtroom, johnny cochran has just finished his closing arguments, ...and, as was anticipated, he did use the chewbacca defense.
whether or not it worked, is up to the jury to decide.
i appreciate that, children, but raisin' $2 million is not an easy thing to do.
my only hope is to whore myself to every woman in town.
i really thought i had it this time with "cheddar cheese girl."
what you need is a guy to write realy good lyrics for you.
and if it wasn't for chef, i would never've had a career in music.
so will you buy some of our candy bars to help him out?
— i call it "chef's pleasure bag." — how does it work?
all you do is put this paper bag over your head, and it increases your sexual pleasure.
at least, when they do you're not sure what they're saying.
since it seems like nothing's going on inside you get this image that they are simple-minded people.
he had something far more interesting, and i felt like dragging it out.
so i tried provoking him by making the canvas big or small, or switching from pastels to charcoal.
everyone, thank you for your kindness at this busy ti me.
thanks for coming all the way to osaka at this busy time.

but if you'd spare me a copy, i'd be more than happy to work it.
i'd appreciate it. lf you could wait out front for 1 5 minutes we'll dupe one off for you.
if it starts to work at him, let me know, okay?
and if it starts to work on me, i'll let you know.
let's see, noons poisons muskavich dumps him in the tub, sets out the corn flakes.
three days later somebody does the exact same thing to him.
i mean if i had someone, i'd want to share my life and thoughts, and work with them.
if i shared this, i'd put them at risk and i don't have that right.
after the host body dies the demon can survive for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
at the same time azazel says to me when he moves as spirit no man can resist.
so someone he can't get into by touch, he can still get into by spirit.
because, if when he's in spirit form he's fighting for his life, he's going to be that much more powerful.
so, like i said at the start i was beaten outsmarted, poisoned by detective john hobbes.
can you imagine what it feels like to be alive for thousands of years and realize you're actually going to die because some self-righteous cop decided he was going to save the fucking world?
so you're telling me that under no circumstances would a holy man like you ever, you know break the iaw or do something....
look, lou i couid jump across the table, snatch your heart out of your chest squeeze the blood out, and stick it in your front pocket.
if it starts to work at him, let me know, okay?
and if it starts to work on me, i'ii let you know.
let's see, noons poisons muskavich dumps him in the tub, sets out the corn flakes.
three days later somebody does the exact same thing to him.
"but even when i can get inside you, after i'm spirit, i won't.
"i'ii fuck you up and down, left and right." that's in the bible.
i think i got my mind around this thing now, but let me let me run this by you, okay?
after the host body dies the demon can survive for one breath or 500 cubits, right?
at the same time azazei says to me when he moves as spirit no man can resist.
so someone he can't get into by touch, he can still get into by spirit.
can you imagine what it feels like to be alive for thousands of years and realize you're actually going to die because some self-righteous cop decided he was going to save the fucking world?
yes, a demon can die and hobbes figured out how to beat me at my own game.
so you're telling me that under no circumstances would a holy man like you ever, you know break the law or do something....
look, lou i could jump across the table, snatch your heart out of your chest squeeze the blood out, and stick it in your front pocket.
if it starts to work at him, let me know, okay?
and if it starts to work on me, i'll let you know.

um, i thought... (stammers) to be honest, i thought you meant you just wanted to go to the toilet.

to be honest, i was just looking forward to a nice quiet dinner.
the man who, despite an extremely tight schedule always completes the first work-print by the deadline.
the ghost animation director who lives in the shadows of the industry.
my, my i've heard rumors about you, but i never thought i'd actually see you like this.
i'd say i should've arranged a business dinner... but having a studio as i do, though a small one, it's really you know.
and because of that premise, an act like this can be bizarre and peculiar.
in short, unless this scene that i'm acting out has a sense of reality that could be experienced by the audience as well i would look like nothing but an idiot fiddling with my own intestines like this.
in the past, movies were a wonderment, a horror, and so to speak, magic itself.
it is hard to believe now, but people back then were amazed by a baby on screen smiling at them.
just as a kid whose smile alone became insufficient to win affection and would start behaving amiably.
or a woman on the verge of being dumped would take to new sexual techniques the movie industry started exercising its utmost skills.
however, the audience, having escalated their desire to watch is now reaching the point of apathy.
no matter what or how you show it to them, it won't amount to much.
replacing illusions and tricks, it became a standard rule spreading reality in the movies.
to disassemble the story and drive the reality away from the screen instead of the other way around.
a newly born monster, by a new magic called "story" went through a rebirth and became a movie.
however, from then on, movies turned toward the creation of more natural, more realistic worlds, in other words, a more naturalistic world.
the materials are gonna be on the rostrum only once before the print is made!
we're gonna replace 'em all with negative-cutting is done, of course!
we'll pick up the timing from the magnetic and synchronize pictures to the sounds on the sheet, so the adr won't require any pictures!
so we won't need any film, and therefore there's no editing!
the stalled project had started moving forward again and the crew's work environment had started taking on a more dramatic air.
however, producing a movie is always nothing more than a monotonous process.
in order to conceal the monotony they rely on their numbers and exercise their utmost skill.
but ultimately, not knowing what to do they end up performing a boring and stupid play on stage.
while the true director, waiting in the wing gloats and maliciously manipulates him.
being in the vortex of this stupid play called "movie," what did my predecessor see?
that kind of attitude is why he treats us with no regard.

from the close-up of a shining holy lady who receives divine favor to the rain-soaked pavement of the warehouse district where lonely gangsters stand still.
everything that was sincere was filled with light and pictured the world of the black to white scale.
the world people wanted to believe in was actually the fiction given birth to by technology.
in 1927, herbert kalmus successfully developed a negative film that was light-sensitive to the three complementary colors to rbg:
the mask of truth was smeared with a violent-colored paint called technicolor!
the effort of making heavily made-up faces appear to have the brilliance of natural skin only change the orderly idea into a real fake.
on the other hand, as a public amusement first and foremost the newly-born color films had to do more than just reproduce the colors of the things that existed in the real world.
color movies had to be artificially processed as things with their own strengths in order to contribute to the spectacle.
but the glory of the color films did not last long.
as color became a normal part of filmmaking the colors retrogressed from being the motivation, to the background and the subtle coloration of kodacolor put an end to the last myth of the colors!
