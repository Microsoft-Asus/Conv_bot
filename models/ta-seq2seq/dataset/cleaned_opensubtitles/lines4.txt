in fact, we were monsters, a terror far worse than death.
i wish the others could talk to you the way i have.
listen, they were powerful enough to draw you into their vessel which proves beyond a doubt that they are highly advanced.
well, yes, but i doubt the other soul hunters will take my word for it.
we can return you to our world and find a way to release you from your bondage.
at first, for brief times, of course as you have achieved here through the holograms.
allow you to feel the ground under your feet again until that day when we will release you permanently.
i know that my order will set this mistake right once they understand they have made a mistake.
you have the power to take me inside and prove to all that you are highly developed, living souls who were cut off at the moment of your supreme evolution.
and once my soul joins yours you will know instantly that i am telling the truth and you will have good reason to trust us.
i beg you give us this opportunity to correct our mistake.
let my soul be a bridge between us until that day when you shall be released.
all i know is that he gave his promise and his life to protect you and this place and the billion minds trapped inside this thing.
make sure the promise he made on your behalf is kept or i promise you, the hunters will become the hunted.
- now i'm sure you could choose to contest this, then we get into the illegal use of my image by your client's holobrothel which would require a countersuit and i doubt very much you'd win that one, counselor.
- captain do you really expect me to go back to my client with nothing?
i believe only in what i can see and hear and touch.
if i believed in souls, i couldn't exactly do this for a living.
dr. wolfgang pauli was a physicist on earth during the late 20th century.
whenever he stepped inside the physics lab, something would go wrong or break down, usually a very expensive piece of equipment.
so for the first time, they had some proof that the pauli effect wasn't real.
until they found out that at the exact moment the equipment exploded he was on a train passing by right in front of the place.
oh, before i forget, you know how to use one of those?
there's one in your room and in case you need instructions, i don't want any problems.
as you know, when i married lise i took over the day-to-day operation of her late husband's corporation.
problem is, we inherited black projects and research programs that he started but he never told anybody about.
i picked this as a midway point to meet a researcher who's been doing these things for a couple of years.
we'll get together he'll tell me why he needs the money, i'll listen, go back to mars.
you're the first person i've met outside the field who knows what it is.
there's only a dozen of us back on earth who specialize in it.
but he was willing to fund my program and for that alone i will always consider him a good man.
anyway that has nothing to do with why i wanted to see you.
- at the height of our medical expertise we can extend human life to 110, maybe 115 years.
but there are dozens of alien life forms that can live double, even triple that.
you may have found something new and i understand you want time to investigate.
that doesn't cover the data you've gathered for the last three years.
or on the other hand, if you're here for a fight, i can get into that too.
you think you can just come in here and intimidate me into leaving, think again.
it could be a form of telepathic communication or something more elemental.
i'm going to try increasing the power to see if that helps.
if i take away your memories the sum and substance of all that you have seen, done, known are you still you anymore?
and by taking these things away, do i now own you?
all i know is, the only time they show up is when someone's about to die.
i just have a dry spot in my throat from the air conditioning.
and what was taken from us, what is ours were among the rarest of the rare.
thousands of years ago, ralga was a distant world whose name had been forgotten by all but our order.
they were an advanced people who chose not to leave their planet and go beyond the stars.
an exquisite race of poets and dreamers and philosophers and leaders.
the passing of the physical form is like a beacon to us.
and we came at once, because we could feel the passing of a billion minds.
only three times in our history have we done such a thing.
then it was decided to place the ralga vessel of souls in one of our whisper galleries where they would never be alone.
where they might talk to each other, there in the great gallery.
we were certain that no one else was aware of the location.
there is strength enough in one mind, one soul, to change the universe.
can you imagine how much strength there would be in 1 billion souls all focused on escape?
they would have to find someone they could influence and direct.
someone with the knowledge and the resources to do physically what they cannot do.
this is a big place, but if he's still here, and our visitor seems confident that he is then we can and will find him.
i want an organized search of every level, starting with the empty quarters.
if you hadn't noticed, we're in the middle of a situation so why don't you go chase an ambulance and let me get back to my business.
i was hoping we could work this out amicably but apparently you prefer a long, drawn-out court fight which is fine with me, since you'll be liable for all the court costs in addition to statutory and punitive damages.
they were taking me to a place i did not wish to go so i made them sleep.
i went off on my own and my wandering brought me here.
there's this place in downbelow that makes the best barbecued beef burgers.
not that i have the slightest delusion that this is beef but if it tastes great, you learn not to ask questions.
well, mr. garibaldi's feelings about heaven notwithstanding i think you've just described hell as well as anything i've ever heard.
you don't understand because you are trapped in a prison of your own flesh.
if these souls were valuable it's because of what they did or the way they saw the world.
what you describe is an existence without the possibility of any change.
now, we tried to interfere, but they got ahead of us.
when you jumped in front of the other, we were able to adjust the power in the nanoseconds between the time it left the wall and struck you.
if you have this much control over the outside why not just have bryson or someone else destroy the globe that keeps you prisoner?
it seems even death would have to be better than this.
i came to see how you were doing and to thank you.
no one has ever done for one of us what you have done for me.
all of our ships are made to attach themselves to any other ship and burn through.
when our order is united and determined there is no one that can stop us.
look at the sheer power they've been demonstrating from the start.
these aren't your ordinary souls that you're used to dealing with.
they evolve past that point and become beings of pure energy.
your people were drawn to ralga because you felt the imminent passing of their physical bodies.
and just as it happened, just as they became transcendent you took them.
you took them and you stuck them inside a piece of glass for 10,000 years.
we got a lot of soul hunter ships outside and inside, a group that will die to strike back.
so you blow up the station, you take out the soul hunters.
- but they suspect that this is part of an elaborate scheme on your part to prevent us from taking back the vessel of souls so you can keep it for yourselves.
forgive me, friends, but in my order i am considered quite young, only 4000 years old and as such, i am also considered quite naive.
listen, captain, before you open fire, let me try and talk to him.
they're able to do this because bryson is a conduit to the outside world.
you dedicated your life to preserving, to finding a means of immortality.
you can't let whatever's inside that thing kill a quarter million people on this station.
in fact, we were monsters, a terror far worse than death.
i wish the others could talk to you the way i have.
listen, they were powerful enough to draw you into their vessel which proves beyond a doubt that they are highly advanced.
well, yes, but i doubt the other soul hunters will take my word for it.
we can return you to our world and find a way to release you from your bondage.

luis is a good lab assistant, harry, but he's a flake.
he probably just decided to take a vacation without telling us.
because you are listening to the voice and not the thoughts behind it.
to be anla'shok, you must be able to go inside under all circumstances even waiting to go into battle.
you do seem to have the sitting part down to an art so i suppose there's hope.
as for thinking, well, let's leave that for the advanced classes.
we follow orders until one comes along that violates our conscience.
then we have to decide whether or not to follow it and take the consequences.
you see, i don't know what's best for the whole world.
i don't understand the ethical structure of the universe and i don't think it's my place to tear up the constitution i swore an oath to protect.
if i did it your way, one of those would have to go.
then the other two would become meaningless just like this conversation.
ever since n'grath went down there's been a vacuum in the power structure.
we have the muscle to take over all the downbelow rackets.
listen the last place i had an operation like this was beta 7.
and there was a guy like allan in charge of security for the whole colony.
but if there is any lesson to be learned from the humans it is that we are made stronger by our differences, not weaker.
if the pak'ma'ra cannot learn to be what we think they should be then perhaps we should learn to use them for what they are.
seems like every time you use a telepath in an intelligence-gathering capacity it's an interstellar incident just waiting to happen.
we'll create several teams, which will maximize flexibility and guarantee none of you gets used more than you should.
you've really got a bug up your butt about her, don't you?
did it ever occur to you that because somebody doesn't agree with you that doesn't mean they're the enemy?
she wants to talk to you but she doesn't want anyone to know that she gave you the tip.
tell her i'll meet her in the accessway to brown 6.
just that his attackers were human and they were making a statement about who runs things around here.
zack's checking things on his end, but there's not much to go on.
this matter is now officially under the jurisdiction of the anla'shok.
rangers are required to deal with such things without resorting to outside intervention.
but i can't have a bunch of vigilantes running around my station.
captain, all members of the alliance, including earth have recognized the independent authority of the rangers.
death in a cause is one thing, but death without meaning...
if i told you to climb a mountain and bring me a flower from the highest point and you will die after completing your task would that be meaningless?
being anla'shok does not mean worrying about what others will think about us.
it does not mean deciding what to do based upon whether or not it serves our sense of ego or destiny.
it means living each moment as if it were your last one.
it means doing each right thing because it is the right thing.
and now we must try to help him in the same way.
so, what kind of terror are we talking about here, delenn?
but if he isn't fully healed he could die in the effort.
as anla'shok, we choose to do that which frightens us knowing that there are no guarantees.
if you want to leave here, the way is past him.
none of us will move to stop you if you can get past him.
i want everyone to know there's a new power in town because from now on babylon 5 belongs to me.
and anyone that doesn't understand that is gonna get exactly the same.
i was on the side that says it's not the role of the military to set policy or depose presidents or fire on our own ships.
we follow orders until one comes along that violates our conscience.
unless the fear coming off all of you was his goal.
now, either way, unless you help us help you there's gonna be more killing.
you go after zack, you'll have the whole station down around our necks.
listen the last place i had an operation like this was beta 7.
and there was a guy like allan in charge of security for the whole colony.
but a lot of guys under him didn't like him any more than we did.
well, finally, since we've opened up membership in the anla'shok to all the other alliance races, we've been joined by a few recruits from the outworlds.
two drazi and a pair of yolu three abbai and a pak'ma'ra.
if it's not five days dead and decayed, they won't touch it.
we've had to move the quarters of the pak'ma'ra well away from the other recruits.
if the pak'ma'ra cannot learn to be what we think they should be then perhaps we should learn to use them for what they are.
well, we've already considered using them for garbage disposal but there are things that even a pak'ma'ra won't eat.
they limp from planet to planet, bartering their supplies of quantium-40 which everyone needs for jumpgate production.
we see them every day, but no one wants anything to do with them.
my intent is to use you sparingly only when there's no other way to gather information critical to saving lives.
seems like every time you use a telepath in an intelligence-gathering capacity it's an interstellar incident just waiting to happen.
we'll create several teams, which will maximize flexibility and guarantee none of you gets used more than you should.
i know this work is a strain and i don't want anyone to feel overburdened.
we have the information, but we will attend to it ourselves.
this matter is now officially under the jurisdiction of the anla'shok.
captain, all members of the alliance, including earth have recognized the independent authority of the rangers.
under the new constitution the anla'shok are above local security and police forces, yours included.
it does not mean deciding what to do based upon whether or not it serves our sense of ego or destiny.
it means living each moment as if it were your last one.
he must take back that power or he will never be whole again.
we will go with him and bring him to the point of his terror.
turval told me that the new recruits had not been fully trained with the denn'bok.
the fighting pike is a dangerous weapon, delenn not to be taken lightly or learned prematurely.
because you are listening to the voice and not the thoughts behind it.
to be anla'shok, you must be able to go inside under all circumstances even waiting to go into battle.

on behalf of myself, captain atherton and his crew, welcome to the maiden voyage of the argonautica!
each and every one of the hundreds of men and women... in service upon this vessel... has but one objective:
and tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich...
i realize that my dream has come true, and i thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for making it so.
i spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
i'll be damned if i'm gonna lose it to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
and we got creepy crawlies swarming' all over, killin' us off left and right.
makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think?
better that than in the belly of one of those things.
i don't care what you do, but i'm gonna keep on goin'.
you back off right now, soldier, before i put you down.
i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle.
and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle.
on behalf of myself, captain atherton and his crew, welcome to the maiden voyage of the argonautica!
each and every one of the hundreds of men and women... in service upon this vessel... has but one objective:
and tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich--
i realize that my dream has come true, and i thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for making it so.
you beat my engine man to death, it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
which is okay by me, since overtime will run you double rate.
i spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
i'll be damned if i'm gonna lose it to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
it'll be another 24 hours before they start searching for us.
are you saying they're not even gonna start looking for this ship for another day or two?
it was built to be almost entirely airtight in case of fire.
with these hatches closed, there's no way those things can get in here.
you back off right now, soldier, before i put you down.
i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle.
and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle.
you're not the least bit curious as to where we're going?
like the sign says, "if the cash is there, we do not care."
if i could have your attention for just one moment, please.
on behalf of myself, captain atherton and his crew... welcome to the maiden voyage of the argonautica!
to create the greatest most luxurious, most expensive, pleasure ship ever built.
and tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich.
you loot the ship, and then you sink it for the insurance.
i spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
but, the problem is, the cost of keeping it operating is a hell of a lot more than we're ever gonna take in.
you mean, we're all gonna die because you screwed up on the math?
but those at 20,000 feet... have been found to eat full-grown sharks.
at thirty or forty thousand feet... well, you do the math.
we got creepy crawlies swarming all over the place killing us off left and right.
makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think?
better that, than in the belly of one of those things.
i don't care what you do, but i'm gonna keep on goin'.
i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle... and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle... and in less than two minutes, he got the cork off, slid inside... and ate the fish.
[ man ] we are on schedule, are we not ?
- [ finnegan ] you didn't hire me for my social graces.
you beat my engine man to death, it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
which is okay by me, since overtime will run you double rate.
- [ laughing ] - [ mamooli ] what are you laughing at ?
a direct hit on any of these warheads and pfft !
as the assistant to the purser, i'm afraid i'll have to report you.
you tell me what happened here, or i pull the trigger.
i spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
i'll be damned if i'm gonna lose it to a bunch of pencil-necked bankers.
is a hell of a lot more than we're ever gonna take in.
you mean, we're all gonna die because you screwed up on the math ?

makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think ?
[ finnegan ] i once saw a guy put a fish in a bottle.
and then he corked it and sealed it tight... and threw it to a baby octopus.
now, the octopus, he felt his way all around that bottle.
he got the cork off, slid inside... and ate the fish.
you know, where is it written that i have to go out there and work?
i mean, you know, finnegan, why don't you get your ass out there sometime?
you're not the least bit curious as to where we're going?
like the sign says, if the cash is there, we do not care.
if i could have your attention for just one moment, please.
on behalf of myself, captain atherton and his crew, welcome to the maiden voyage of the argonautica!
to create the greatest, most luxurious, most expensive pleasure ship ever built.
and tonight, seeing all of you here... so beautiful, so elegant, so rich...
you loot the ship, and then you sink it for the insurance.
i spent my whole life, my entire fortune, building this ship.
but the problem is that the cost of keeping it operating... is a hell of a lot more than we're ever gonna take in.
you mean, we're all gonna die because you screwed up on the math?
at 4,000 feet, the ottoia are about as long as a pencil... with bodies about the size of a golf ball.
but those at 20,000 feet... have been found to eat full-grown sharks.
it'll be another 24 hours before they start searching for us.
are you saying they're not even gonna start looking for this ship for another day or two?
it was built to be almost entirely airtight in case of fire.
with these hatches closed, there's no way those things can get in here.
you back off right now, soldier, before i put you down.

you beat my engine man to death, it's gonna take a hell of a lot longer.
which is okay by me, since overtime will run you double rate.

- the only way to slow 'em down is to feed 'em!
all i got is a wet stick of gum and a breath mint!
[ man ] we are on schedule, are we not ?
- [ finnegan ] you didn't hire me for my social graces.
whatever it was, it nearly took my bloody head off !
- [ laughing ] - [ mamooli ] what are you laughing at ?
as the assistant to the purser, i'm afraid i'll have to report you.
you tell me what happened here, or i pull the trigger.

far below the south china sea lies an underwater mountain range... with canyons deep enough to hide the himalayas... deeperthan any man or machine has ever explored.
throughout the centuries... countless vessels have vanished into these waters without a trace.

a direct hit on any one of these warheads and we'd be history.
we got a hole in the starboard bow the size of nebraska.
the problem is that the cost of keeping it operating... was more than we'd evertake in.
so we're going to die because you screwed up on the math?
but those at 20,000 feet... have been found to eat full-grown sharks.
at thirty or forty thousand feet... well, you do the math.
we got creepy crawlies swarming all over the place killing us off left and right.
makes for a bit of a tight jam, don't you think?
better that, than in the belly of one of those things.

the left arm, upper body and head have taken most of the damage.
the body's wrapped round the harvester blades and the blades have passed through into the upper part of the torso.
it's easy, quick, and can be made to look like a fall.
the trick would be to set up the scene of the accident as well.
we'd been arguing about a boyfriend of mine, a catholic boy.
he was so angry with me, he didn't check his car.
i got your message about the wine club and i'll be there.
dad's kicking me out of the house so he and sherry can have a little party.
i happened to mention that i had been married twice before.
a look clouded over her face as if i had confessed to some unspeakable sin.
i didn't tell you because it's none of your damn business, just like it's none of your business who i marry or who i don't marry.
i don't know why i'm even wasting my time talking to you.
dad, i'd like you to know that everybody is 100% behind this decision.
i'm so glad that you're so happy your father is breaking up with me.
and then there's a phone call or two, but they never see each other again.
well, i just want you to know that i am around for you if you ever get lonely or you just need to talk.
it's about the data intercepts you were sent to investigate at the annex.
how is it that you know so much about what's going on at the centre?
a former centre operative... has been working with a coconspirator inside the centre.
in order to conceal their identities and their activities... he murdered everyone at the annex.
in fact, it was miss parker who sent me to the data annex in the first place.
miss parker is many things, but she would never do that, especially to you.
i've been intercepting communications... between a man named damon and his source at the centre.
the source has been transferring sims that i performed to the data annex.
the lack of security allowed damon... to break in as needed and download the sims.
but my new software found a trail leading right back to them.
but i do know that he plans on using it tomorrow at 5:00.
but what's so important about four old sims... that would cause him to kill all those people?
i know it's unlikely, but if the plane were to encounter... a focused burst of electromagnetic energy in the ultrahigh frequency range... the pilot would lose control.
jarod, i'll be sure to alert our client about your concerns.
i'd love it if you'd surprise me with something we can work with.
i believe the two of you are taking the concept of sibling rivalry to new levels.
his growing sense ofhumanity was creating inner conflict over his work.
against my wishes... the centre brought in an operative named damon... to help break him.
the schedule 7 or not, with me as the prize, they would welcome you back.
well, the way i figure... there's a time and a place for everything.
serbia and bosnia... on the eve of the peace talks which are scheduled to start monday in washington.
the centre owns you, and there's nothin'you can do about it.
the guilt you're feeling comes from a conflict... over your desire to exact revenge for kenny... and the necessity of what you did.
i just keep playing the moment over and over in my head.
how is it that you know so much about what's going on at the centre?
a former centre operative... has been working with a coconspirator inside the centre.
the source has been transferring sims that i performed to the data annex.
but the data annex is only for storage... of routine, unclassified information.
but my new software found a trail leading right back to them.
you were at the wrong place at the wrong time, mr. broots.
but what's so important about four old sims... that would cause him to kill all those people?
our clients were impressed with your recommendations... to improve the safety of their aircraft.
jarod, we know the enemy is trying to genetically alter... the smallpox virus to carry ebola.
our only interest is in developing a vaccine to prevent a holocaust.
i can only hope that one day, i'll be half the father that you are.
you know, i planned to spend her birthday... traveling through france.
shortly beforejarod escaped from the centre... we were having trouble controlling him.
his growing sense ofhumanity was creating inner conflict over his work.
against my wishes... the centre brought in an operative named damon... to help break him.
what i didn't know was that damon and the centre had a hidden agenda.
he's gonna kill him, and probably both of us as well.
listen, for kenny's sake, finish the last sim and walk away from this place.
i just keep playing the moment over and over in my head.
you saved broots's life... and the lives of untold numbers of people.
today my colleagues will reach the site where ancient civilization may have created a shrine to mew, the most powerful pokémon to have ever existed now believed to be extinct.
giovanni's financing the expedition, when he learned that my work's in the field of cloning he agreed to fund my research... but only if i would try to create for him an enhanced living replica of mew.
if so i may finally have the dna i need... to create the pokémon powerful enough to survive the cloning process.
perhaps then i can unlock the secret to restoring life itself.
if my cloning theories are correct, we'll have amber back with us one day soon.
i loved our daughter as much as you did but she's gone, no one can bring her back, and i can't go on watching you try.
many strange and wondrous legends evolved from the pursuit of life's mysteries.
but none is stranger than this tale... of the most powerful pokémon of all!
it will be hosted by my master, the world's greatest pokémon trainer, at his palace on new island.
a chartered ferry will leave from old shore wharf... to take you to the island this afternoon.
it will not be long before my master's intentions are clear.
locked out...now we'll never know what kind of party we're missing!
all mewtwo cares about is proving how strong those super clones are.
i'd rather risk my life out in mewtwo's storm... than watch these pokémon destroy each other.
you are greater than mew, improved through the power of human ingenuity.
we used the most advanced techniques to develop your awesome psychic powers.
narrator: today, ash, brock, and misty are taking a short break from their pokémon adventures.
as always, ash is determined to become a pokémon master, and, as always, he's ready to endure any hardship, bear any burden with strength, stamina, and a will of steel.
# i wanna be the very best # # like no one ever was # # to catch them is my real test # # to train them is my cause # # whoo whoo whoo # # i will travel across the land #
# searching far and wide # # each pokémon to understand #
# # the power that's inside # # inside # # pokémon # # it's you and me # # i know it's my destiny # # pokémon # # ooh, you're my best friend #
# in a world we must defend # # pokémon # # a heart so true # # our courage will pull us through # # you teach me, and i'll teach you # # pokémon #
# # claim my rightful place # # come with me, the time is right # # there's no better team, yeah # # arm in arm, we'll win the fight # # it's always been a dream #
# # it's always been a dream # pokémon # # it's you and me # # i know it's my destiny # # pokémon # # ooh, you're my best friend # # in a world we must defend #

it will be hosted by my master, the world's greatest pokémon trainer, at his palace on new island.
a chartered ferry will leave from old shore wharf to take you to the island this afternoon.
the ancient writings tell of the storm wiping out all but a few pokémon.
in their sorrow, the water of their tears somehow restored the lives lost in the storm.
# brother # # my brother # # tell me, what are we fighting for?
# # we've got to end this war # # we should love # # one another # # oh, can't we just pretend # # this war never began?
# # we can try # # brother, my brother # [both moan] # we face each other # # from different sides # # the anger burns # # can't remember why #
# it's kinda crazy # # to cause such pain # # our foolish pride # # makes us hate this way # [roars] # we watch our world fall apart # # tell me, what good is winning #
i see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant.
it is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.
they just keep getting more beautiful every time i see 'em.
hey, guys, how did we wind up in this place anyway?
# ooh # # oh, yeah # # here we are # # safe at last # # we can breathe a sigh # # it seems the storm has passed # # through it all # # no one knew #
# that all the tears in heaven # # would bring me back to you # # oh # # no one i know # # imagined we would make it # # but it only matters # # that we both believed #
# whoa # # you and me # # we're a miracle # # meant to be # # and nothing can change it # # mountains move and oceans part # # when they are standing in our way #
# you and me # # we're a miracle # # angels stand watching over us # # and heaven shines upon us # # every day # [new song begins]
# rock and rock and roll # # rock and roll #
# free up your mind # # let the music free up # # and it will help you to find # # let the music help you # # the beats will give you a sign # # ooh #

but i am engaged to raoul — or will be when he asks me.
you would choose a soldier who has not yet proposed above a king?
if the great athos offers, then the great d'artagnan must drink.
i'm sorry i haven't been to see you lately, my friend.
i hear there was an incident at the musketeers' gate, where a man came intent on killing me.
is it our policy now to let would—be assassins go free, d'artagnan?
and the only one who can answer that question is you.
athos... if we fail in this attempt — and we probably will -
'you've created in me the need to be a better man.
'i will love through heaven or hell 'to love you as you should be loved.
i have raised a son who destroys lives instead of saving them.
and i have failed to save a son who died within an iron mask.
[d'artagnan's voice] phillippe is in the lower dungeon of the bastille.
at midnight, i will delay the new guards for 10 minutes.
if phillippe is in the bastille, to the bastille we will go.
i'd rather die covered in blood than an old man lying in my piss.
the king known as louis xiv, brought his people food, prosperity and peace.
he is remembered as the greatest ruler in the history of his nation.
let's pretend that i am king and you are captain of my musketeers.
pretend my wish is law, and my wish is to enjoy this party.
yes, raoul is my reason, but not the way you think.
once, all of us believed in serving something greater than ourselves.
but we all had a common dream - that one day we would be able to serve a king worthy of the throne.
it is what we dreamt, what we bled for, and what we have waited a lifetime for.
so i am here to find out if his life was in vain.
and the only one who can answer that question is you.
i ordered him placed far from the fighting... but he plunged in against my wishes.
he forgives me for all that he knew i would do.

you would choose a soldier who has not yet proposed above a king?
if the great athos offers, then the great d'artagnan must drink.
i'm sorry i haven't been to see you lately, my friend.
and the only one who can answer that question is you.
if we fail in this attempt - and we probably will -
i ordered him placed far from the fighting... but he plunged in against my wishes.
he forgives me for all that he knew i would do.
i beg you... return me to the prison where i have lived for so long.
you will hunt down porthos, athos and aramis and bring me their heads.
if phillippe is in the bastille, to the bastille we will go.
i'd rather die covered in blood than an old man lying in my piss.
the king known as louis xiv, brought his people food, prosperity and peace.
he is remembered as the greatest ruler in the history of his nation.
some of this is legend, but at least this much is fact,
when rioting citizens of france destroyed the bastille... they discovered within its records this mysterious entry:
i want you to find out who the secret leader of the jesuits is,
and when you have... for god and for france, i wish you to kill him,
let us pretend as if i am king and you are... the captain of my musketeers,
let us behave as if my wish is law... and my wish is to enjoy this party... as should you,
his majesty is very, very kind... but i'm engaged to raoul... or will be when he manages to ask me,
you would choose a soldier a soldier who has not yet proposed, above a king?
when the great d'artagnan visits, he must be offered the best wine,
and if the great athos offers, the great d'artagnan must drink,
it's true the king has noticed her, but i don't think it has anything to do
it has everything to do with it, the king is a dog,
but if this king harms my son merely to take a lover... then this king will become my enemy,
and so will any man that stands between that enemy and me,
it is good that you watch me, but i fear you watch me too closely,
did you send raoul to the war so that you could be free to pursue her?
when a king is dishonorable, you are removed from your oath of honor
an oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed,
i understand that there was an incident at the musketeer's gate... where a man came intent on killing me,
is it our policy now to allow would-be assassins to go free?
he says he just fell stone dead as he was reading him the mass,
i never thought he'd last this long, how could he just keel over?
she had been told by her own priest that you had died at birth,
she blamed herself for ever believing it... and she wished to restore your birthright,
for his whole claim of power rested on the sanctity of royal blood,
so, instead, he devised a way to keep you forever hidden,
yes, raoul is my reason, but not in the way you think,
once all of us believed in spending our lives... in the service of something greater than ourselves,
you've created in me the need to be a better man,
i will love through heaven or hell... if that is where i must go... to love you as you should be loved,
i'll be gone for a few days,make sure everything is ready when i get back,
you want me to do the impossible and do it alone?
good, of course we wish you to be a good king,
but first you must pass as louis,and louis is cold and cruel,
but now i know that forgiveness must first come from you... before it can come from god,
for it was i who took the second of your twin sons away from you,
and i was never brave enough...to find the truth when i was told one lie after another,
i have raised a son who destroys lives...instead of saving them,
wait two dances then withdraw to your room... and spend the night in safety,
we have much to talk about... and have the rest of our lives to do it
in fact, i pray that god reward you for your mercy to do it,
but please... do not, i beg you... return me to the prison where i have lived for so long,
philippe has been moved to the lower dungeon of the bastille,
at midnight, i will order the guard changed... and will delay the replacements for ten minutes,
if philippe is in the bastille... then to the bastille we will go,
i'd rather die covered in blood... than an old man lying in my own piss,
let him be fed by a deaf mute... but feed him well,
and let him find redemption in wearing the pains he has placed on others,
the king known as louis xiv... brought his people food, prosperity and peace... and is remembered as the greatest ruler... in the history of his nation,
some of this is legend, but at least this much is fact.
i know you're blind because... if you'd seen the tits that just walked out of here... you'd have tears in your eyes.
sometimes there are more important things to life than a good pair of tits.
i, like my father before me, have trusted you... with the gravest of missions.
i want you to find out who the secret leader of the jesuits is.
and when you have... for god and for france, i wish you to kill him.
i know this is a terrible thing i ask, especially from a priest, but--
and if the great athos offers, the great d'artagnan must drink.
i'm sorry i haven't been to see you lately, my friend.
i belong to the past, when the uniforms were black and grown men wore them.
at least it gives you more time to practice your violin.
all the errors of my life are made right in him.
and now, for the life i've always wished him, he's leaving my home.
i have never known a finer man than you, nor cared more for a friend.
but if this king harms my son merely to take a lover... then this king will become my enemy.
and so will any man that stands between that enemy and me.
then i must hurry... for i treasure your son... as i treasure you.
and you will release those men, for they serve france and you.
and you will release those men, for they serve france and you.
when we were young men... and we saw injustice, we fought it.
now we know that some problems cannot be solved with a sword.
when i became a musketeer, i was told that each time i drew my sword...
i should consider not what i was killing... but what i was allowing to live.
the loss of raoul... and of d'artagnan... who you held as a brother, and now you hate.
what gives you the right to judge me and to play god with the lives of others?
on his deathbed, he revealed your existence to louis and your mother.
she had been told by her own priest that you had died at birth.
and for six more, he lived in that mask, not knowing why.
now he knows those who should have loved him tore him from his birthright... and threw him into loneliness and pain.
that's why we must eat, drink and make love to life.
as king, if you like plow maids... you can have a thousand.
y es, raoul is my reason, but not in the way you think.
once all of us believed in spending our lives... in the service of something greater than ourselves.
but we all had a common dream-- that one day we would finally be able to serve a king worthy of the throne.
it is what we dreamt... what we bled for... and what we have spent a lifetime waiting to see.
so i am here to find out if his life was in vain.
and the only one who can answer that question is you.
i ordered him placed far from the fighting, but... he plunged in against my wishes.
he forgives me for all that he knew i would do.
you want me to do the impossible and do it alone?
i offer you the perfect solution--a revolution without bloodshed... without loss of life, even without treason.
but now i know that forgiveness must first come from you... before it can come from god.
for it was i who took the second of your twin sons away from you.
and i was never brave enough... to find the truth when i was told one lie after another.

we have much to talk about... and have the rest of our lives to do it.
i have prayed every day to see you become greater than your office... better than the law.
please show me what my faith and my blood have purchased.
in fact, i pray that god reward you for your mercy to do it.
but please... do not, i beg you... return me to the prison where i have lived for so long.

dr. benton, we have reviewed dr. swanson's chart and the autopsy.
i thought the autopsy was inconclusive due to the state of the body.
i just don't want my husband to know i was at the clinic.
i thought i was too old for this kind of thing to happen.
i did some overseas work in africa where abortion is illegal.
and i saw 15-year-old girls in septic shock from botched procedures.

but it is in the back that light strikes the night.
- true cinema didn't wear, for our provincial eyes, the face of madame arnoux in frédéric moreau's dreams.
we knew cinema via canudo and delluc without ever having seen it.
the exhortation to work with our hearts instead of using our hands.
i know no era that lacked work for all its hearts.
you know we have plenty of things to say to each other.
i know there are things you think and don't say... or don't want to say... to me, because of some problem of yours i don't know about,... and that hurts, you know?
it's a cliche to think every- thing stops when everyone does.
and then everyone thinks that... stopping after all that routine... means stopping time and entering into rest,... and thinks that is night:
a soldier's rest,... a boring piece of theatre,... a prelude to sleep,... a hollow interval,... a much needed nothingness.
now that night is near,... a new time denies time,... fuels desire,... fosters excesses:
moments become eternal,... unconfessable secrets are... brutally revealed,... pretences collapse,... some mad gesture can make everything explode,... unusual passions,... unsuspected desires.
night is the motor of eloquent silence,... where time is not time,... where place is no place at all,... where darkness is radiant... and nothing is impossible.
i thought this was... the best place... to tell you i've reached a decision... about your obsession of getting rid of me... and not be a burden to you and the world.
i'm still young,... but i'm aware of my illness,... that i can't live alone,... that i lie to myself to kill time.
it had been a week since... my friend and i didn't shower.
he was naked in his room... with a naked broad, and she said:
whenever i did it with you... i wouldn't take my shorts off in front of her.
i'd go to the bathroom with my pyjamas,... wash again and put my shorts directly in the washing machine.
i haven't seen you for a month and you... prepare tasteless fish and a salad... full of worms and a tasteless fish.
i came to dinner because i leave the day after tomorrow... and you rack your brain for the most adequate dishes.
so you can imagine the look on my face at the doorstep.
i was tired,... worried,... with the shopping bags cutting my wrists... and my purse empty, and it's not even the end of the month.
but i got out of it by... talking about trivial things.
about my excellent health,... how nice the people are around here,...
i would surrender to whoever... who would take me... for ever and ever.
in such a way that none of me would remain... and of myself i... would be drained.
i would surrender... for a kiss,... for a single kiss,... from whoever... wouldn't... kiss me.
i would surrender to whoever wants me... as if... i weren't aware,... as if... it were out of despair.
we believe iran is only two years away from nuclear capability.
last week, we received satellite photos showing a reactor in the dasht-e-kavir desert may be producing weapons-grade plutonium.
i remember her as this cute little old lady in leisure suits.
well, the two agents following us seem to think you look pretty hot.
if this were an iranian military pilot down in, let's say, texas,
i doubt your government would be willing to dispense of it with just a wink and a smile.
but, hopefully, your presence here will help to open a dialogue between our two governments.
the best way to do that, sir, would be to consider this incident a mutual mistake and to release commander keeter into our custody.
the united states is trying to prevent a widespread middle eastern crisis.
you are very forward, major, for a woman in my society.
my third-class year at the academy, it was all getting to be too much for me.
i was 19, i didn't even remember what my father looked like.
the computer is the reason it's on the ground in the first place.
the technicians on the seahawk believe a heat sink worked loose from the repeated carrier landings.
i'm gonna plead guilty, throw myself on the mercy of the court.
it's a gesture that would be meaningful to my people, commander.
except, sir, how major mackenzie and lieutenant commander keeter are going to get out.
my man will drive mac and keeter across the turkish border.
you set him up to fight your fight with the secnav.
a good operative never takes a fight that somebody else is willing to take for him.
an iranian armoured unit has been following us, waiting for my signal to move in.
i had a feeling breaking keeter out was a little too easy.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.

'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no-limit hold 'em table.
i want him to think that i'm pondering a call, but all i'm really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage.
all right, your 15, plus i have another 33 to raise you.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
now, the closest i get to vegas is west new york, driving this lousy route handed down from knish... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin' rule...
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, crispy linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
i mean, that was like... buy in at 8:00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, i think i'm hooked up for this summer.
i just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
i mean, as long as i don't fuck up moot court, i think the job's mine.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
- yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he?
- until the time we went for... more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against friends academy.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, i gotta take enough cash off the white guys... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself... in the style that i've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
hey, look, i can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
i heard you asking before, and i hear you asking now, but i can't do that.
worm and i fall into our old rhythm like clyde frazier and pearl monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city... signalling, chip placing, trapping.
i can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
um, why don't you just go ahead, and i'm gonna jump in the shower.
and if i miss a little bit of the mulligan meeting, just cover for me, all right?
amarillo slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim...
"you can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once."
he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, worm.
i know, grama, that's why i'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if i could help, asking if i knew where to find you.
marinacci and the d.a. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act... you pulled today at your group's meeting.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
no, i've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right?
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps, but there's still plenty of money for the taking.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
you know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could have just stayed home.
these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?
mr. mcdermott, that is a supreme court free speech case... that has no bearing in the premises.
each group was apprised to ignore that aspect of this matter... and focus instead on the idea of de facto segregation.
what we have here is a clear case of gerrymandering, impacting schoolchildren and schools in the district... that was created solely to separate students by race.
although not dispositive, the student body is more than 99 percent white.
i mean, i'd say good luck, but i know it's not about luck in your game.
eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
well, that's the important thing with the game of hold 'em.
you're never down and out until your chips are all gone.
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
but, man, you're fixing to go down hard, and it almost seems like you want to.
i mean, i caught a frozen wave of cards like you fucking read about.
i think i'm getting you outta hock, i find out i'm seven grand in.
find the games, scout 'em out, i sit, i mop 'em up.
you know, we might have a shot at this... if we sat together and just did our thing.
the whole time i was in the joint, i was just dumping money to guards.
this one guy, pete frye, i probably lost like ten grand over 18 months.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
you wanna take it up with kgb, you go right ahead.
otherwise, you got one day, or this'll feel like a swedish massage.
i tell you to play within your means, you risk your whole bankroll.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i got stones enough not to chase cards, action... or fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on espn.
you want me to, uh, call some people, try and buy you some time, i will.
i sat with the best in the world, and i won.
you put a fucking move on chan, you son of a bitch.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
in a heads-up match, the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
he doesn't look like much, but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob.

yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
it's like i used to have a running partner, you know what i'm saying?
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.

a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front ofhim.
- [ narrating ] i just got top two pair on the flop, and i want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, i'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
[ narrating ] now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and i'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
[ mike narrating ] you don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but i'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappyjobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.

i watched you, i stood by you while you lost everything before.
- i don't think i can go through that with you again.
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb's joint, okay ?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
[ scoffs ] where'd you get the scratch for that ?

i'd heard about it for years on the street, before i was even in law school.
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
- michael is lead counsel... in the moot court you're presiding over next week, gene.
besides, he could use the background if he's gonna... clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right?
let's just say i'll put you at the top of the list if you're right.
okay. [clears throat] well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
judge kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush, but he came up short, and mr. eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
i mean, that was like... buy in at 8:00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, i think i'm hooked up for this summer.
i just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
i mean, as long as i don't fuck up moot court, i think the job's mine.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
just get in it and drive me far away from here.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
i was this close to bangin' her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin' trust fund babies in here.
hey, look, i can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
i heard you asking before, and i hear you asking now, but i can't do that.
[mike narrating] in confessions of a winning poker player, jack king said,
"few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems,
[mike narrating] worm and i fall into our old rhythm like clyde frazier and pearl monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city... signalling, chip placing, trapping.
i can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
i mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
i think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, worm.
i watched you, i stood by you while you lost everything before.
- i don't think i can go through that with you again.
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb's joint, okay?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
i watch the cards also, but i watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps, but there's still plenty of money for the taking.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
you know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could have just stayed home.
[mike narrating] these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?
mr. mcdermott, that is a supreme court free speech case... that has no bearing in the premises.
each group was apprised to ignore that aspect of this matter... and focus instead on the idea of de facto segregation.
what we have here is a clear case of gerrymandering, impacting schoolchildren and schools in the district... that was created solely to separate students by race.
although not dispositive, the student body is more than 99 percent white.
[announcer] eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
it's like i used to have a running partner, you know what i'm saying?
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.
find the games, scout 'em out, i sit, i mop 'em up.
you know, we might have a shot at this... if we sat together and just did our thing.
he told me anytime i wanted a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.
you just go in there, you ask for sean frye, you're in.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
you wanna take it up with kgb, you go right ahead.
otherwise, you got one day, or this'll feel like a swedish massage.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike, showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
in a heads-up match, the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five-card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no-limit hold 'em table.
i want him to think that i'm pondering a call... but all i'm really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage.
all right, your 15, plus i have another 33 to raise you.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.

that's the fourth time you done played that bitch of spades on my ass.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black mariah... so i don't want to hear your bitchin', okay?

amarillo slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time... held to his father's maxim—

i'd say good luck, but i know it's not about luck in your game.
eric seidel cannot win this hand and yet he doesn't know it.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave... sits for like another 20 more minutes... cashes out for the full amount.
i'm not gonna get down on my knees for that jerk-off.
all i said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds.
he told me anytime i want a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.
you just go in there, you ask for sean frye, you're in.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
sometimes the odds are stacked so clear, there's only one way to play it.
other times, like holding a small pair against two over cards... it's six to five, or even money, either way.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild... you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike... showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
when my mother let me leave the yeshiva, it nearly broke her.
but she knew— she knew the life i had to lead.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone... one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
[ narrating ] he doesn't look like much, but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
[ narrating ] he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front ofhim.
- [ narrating ] i just got top two pair on the flop, and i want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, i'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
[ narrating ] now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and i'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
[ mike narrating ] you don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but i'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappyjobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
amarillo slim to my right, playing in the world series of poker.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
in a legal sense, can fuckin' steinbrenner just move the yankees ?
does he have the fuckin' right to just move them ?
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, crispy linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
[ chuckles ] the fuck you know what we all got.
summer clerkship in your office says i know what you're holding.
okay. [ clears throat ] well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
there's like two whole economies in there-- there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right ?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, i gotta take enough cash off the white guys... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself... in the style that i've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
i was this close to bangin' her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin' trust fund babies in here.

but as canada bill jones said, "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money. "
um, why don't you just go ahead, and i'm gonna jump in the shower.

[ mike narrating ] amarillo slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim--
"you can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once. "
speaking of which, are you even gonna get a job ?
or are you just gonna go back to printing those credit cards ?
i watched you, i stood by you while you lost everything before.
- i don't think i can go through that with you again.
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb's joint, okay ?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
[ scoffs ] where'd you get the scratch for that ?
you've been rolling fags in the village again. [ grunts ]
i watch the cards also, but i watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i mean, you gotta-- you gotta think of it as a war.
you are officially never invited to our game again. [ chuckles ]

[ announcer] eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
well, that's the important thing with the game of hold 'em.
you're never down and out until your chips are all gone.
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
but, man, you're fixing to go down hard, and it almost seems like you want to.
i mean, i caught a frozen wave of cards like you fucking read about.
i think i'm getting you outta hock, i find out i'm seven grand in.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.
find the games, scout 'em out, i sit, i mop 'em up.
you know, we might have a shot at this... if we sat together and just did our thing.
the whole time i was in the joint, i was just dumping money to guards.
this one guy, pete frye, i probably lost like ten grand over 1 8 months.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit ?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
you wanna take it up with kgb, you go right ahead.

i was giving you a living, mike, showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
i sat with the best in the world, and i won.
you put a fucking move on chan, you son of a bitch.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.

although not dispositive, the student body is more than 99% white.
i'd say good luck, but i know it's not about luck in your game.
eric seidel cannot win this hand and yet he doesn't know it.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave... sits for like another 20 more minutes... cashes out for the full amount.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away... but i can't give up on him that easy.
he told me anytime i want a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.
you just go in there, you ask for sean frye, you're in.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
sometimes the odds are stacked so clear, there's only one way to play it.
other times, like holding a small pair against two over cards... it's six to five, or even money, either way.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild... you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike... showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
when my mother let me leave the yeshiva, it nearly broke her.
but she knew- she knew the life i had to lead.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone... one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no-limit hold 'em table.
i want him to think that i'm pondering a call, but all i'm really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage.
all right, your 15, plus i have another 33 to raise you.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
now, the closest i get to vegas is west new york, driving this lousy route handed down from knish... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin' rule...
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, crispy linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
i mean, that was like... buy in at 8:00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, i think i'm hooked up for this summer.
i just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
i mean, as long as i don't fuck up moot court, i think the job's mine.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
- yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he?
- until the time we went for... more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against friends academy.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, i gotta take enough cash off the white guys... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself... in the style that i've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
hey, look, i can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
i heard you asking before, and i hear you asking now, but i can't do that.
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
but as canada bill jones said, "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money."
um, why don't you just go ahead, and i'm gonna jump in the shower.
and if i miss a little bit of the mulligan meeting, just cover for me, all right?
amarillo slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim...
"you can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once."
he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, worm.
i know, grama, that's why i'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if i could help, asking if i knew where to find you.
marinacci and the d.a. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act... you pulled today at your group's meeting.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
no, i've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right?
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps, but there's still plenty of money for the taking.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
you know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could have just stayed home.
these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?

eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
well, that's the important thing with the game of hold 'em.
you're never down and out until your chips are all gone.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
it's like i used to have a running partner, you know what i'm saying?
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.
i'm not gonna get down on my knees for that jerk-off.
all i said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds.
he told me anytime i wanted a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.

some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
- now all i have to do is lean on him until he falls over.
[narrating] he doesn't look like much, but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
[narrating] he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front ofhim.
- [narrating] i just got top two pair on the flop, and i want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, i'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
[narrating] now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and i'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
[mike narrating] you don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but i'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappyjobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.

the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
[mike narrating] i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
- yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he?

in a heads-up match, the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
#not me 'cause i just wanna do it to myself #
#i'm just checkin'it up, baby one more time for you #
# turn your back on the people who draw the lines #
#put your faith in the answers that you can't find #
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
- [narrating] i just got top two pair on the flop, and i want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, i'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
[narrating] now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and i'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
[mike narrating] you don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but i'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
amarillo slim to my right, playing in the world series of poker.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, crispy linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
okay. [clears throat] well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
[mike narrating] i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
- yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he?
- until the time we went for... more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against friends academy.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, i gotta take enough cash off the white guys... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself... in the style that i've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
"few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems,
"but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy... the outstanding tough beats of his career."
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
but as canada bill jones said, "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money."
um, why don't you just go ahead, and i'm gonna jump in the shower.
and if i miss a little bit of the mulligan meeting, just cover for me, all right?
[mike narrating] amarillo slim, the greatest proposition gambler of all time, held to his father's maxim...
"you can shear a sheep many times, but skin him only once."
i know, grama, that's why i'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if i could help, asking if i knew where to find you.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
no, i've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right?
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me.
- good, man, hey, i was startin' to wonder about you.
i thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
[mike narrating] these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?
all the luck in the world isn't gonna change things for these guys.
i mean, i'd say good luck, but i know it's not about luck in your game.
[announcer] eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
well, that's the important thing with the game of hold 'em.
you're never down and out until your chips are all gone.
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
but, man, you're fixing to go down hard, and it almost seems like you want to.
i mean, i caught a frozen wave of cards like you fucking read about.
i think i'm getting you outta hock, i find out i'm seven grand in.
i'm not gonna get down on my knees for that jerk-off.
all i said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds.
the whole time i was in the joint, i was just dumping money to guards.
this one guy, pete frye, i probably lost like ten grand over 18 months.
sometimes the odds are stacked so clear, there's only one way to play it.
other times, like holding a small pair against two over cards, it's six to five, or even money, either way.
i tell you to play within your means, you risk your whole bankroll.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i got stones enough not to chase cards, action... or fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on espn.
you want me to, uh, call some people, try and buy you some time, i will.
i sat with the best in the world, and i won.
you put a fucking move on chan, you son of a bitch.
[mike narrating] i've often seen these people, these squares, at the table.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
- now all i have to do is lean on him until he falls over.
i am still up 20 grand... from this last time i stick it in you.
[mike narrating] they're trying to goad me, trying to own me.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.

mr. mcdermott, that is a supreme court free speech case... that has no bearing in the premises.
each group was apprised to ignore that aspect of this matter... and focus instead on the idea of de facto segregation.
what we have here is a clear case of gerrymandering, impacting schoolchildren and schools in the district... that was created solely to separate students by race.
although not dispositive, the student body is more than 99 percent white.
[announcer] eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
it's like i used to have a running partner, you know what i'm saying?
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.
find the games, scout 'em out, i sit, i mop 'em up.
you know, we might have a shot at this... if we sat together and just did our thing.
he told me anytime i wanted a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.
you just go in there, you ask for sean frye, you're in.
how come all your moves are so smart and noble... and i'm always the idiot piece of shit?
you act like you're the only one with any fucking ambition.
you wanna take it up with kgb, you go right ahead.
otherwise, you got one day, or this'll feel like a swedish massage.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike, showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.

he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
'cause i hope you're not thinking of putting all that glimmer in play.
he's as close to a friend as there is in this place.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.

a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
- michael is lead counsel... in the moot court you're presiding over next week, gene.
besides, he could use the background if he's gonna... clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right?
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
judge kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush, but he came up short, and mr. eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?

hey, look, i can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
i heard you asking before, and i hear you asking now, but i can't do that.
worm and i fall into our old rhythm like clyde frazier and pearl monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city... signalling, chip placing, trapping.
i can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
i mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
i think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
i watched you, i stood by you while you lost everything before.
- i don't think i can go through that with you again.
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb's joint, okay?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
i watch the cards also, but i watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.

#lay me down in the circle where the spotlight shines #
# turn your back on the people who draw the lines #
he doesn't look like much, but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no-limit hold 'em table.
i want him to think that i'm pondering a call, but all i'm really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage.
all right, your 15, plus i have another 33 to raise you.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
now, the closest i get to vegas is west new york, driving this lousy route handed down from knish... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin'rule...
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
one rounder, crispy linetta, sat under some pretense, but they found out he was a pro, he couldn't cross the street without a legal hassle.
well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
i mean, that was like... buy in at 8:00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, i think i'm hooked up for this summer.
i just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
i mean, as long as i don't fuck up moot court, i think the job's mine.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
just get in it and drive me far away from here.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
i was this close to bangin' her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin' trust fund babies in here.
"few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems,

he sees all the angles, but he doesn't have the balls to play one.
hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 15 years, worm.
i know, grama, that's why i'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if i could help, asking if i knew where to find you.
marinacci and the d.a. were ready to cut cards for your services at that point.
of course, it was an altogether different trick, that disappearing act... you pulled today at your group's meeting.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right?
no, i've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right?
down here, the millionaires are scarce or they're playing craps, but there's still plenty of money for the taking.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
you know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could havejust stayed home.
these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?

i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey.
we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
dowling had it three hands ago, and two hands ago i got the black maria, so i don't want to hear you bitchin', okay?
- yeah, but he shot the moon on that hand, didn't he?
- until the time we went for... more than just pocket change and got caught.
we had the starting five take a dive against friends academy.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
and the trick is, i gotta take enough cash off the white guys... to lose it to the guards so that they keep doing me favors and shit, but i gotta trim enough smokes off the black guys that i can trade and keep myself... in the style that i've grown accustomed to, and all of this without getting my ass kicked.
hey, look, i can get started on this easy if it's you and me working together.
i heard you asking before, and i hear you asking now, but i can't do that.
worm and i fall into our old rhythm like clyde frazier and pearl monroe.
we bring out all the old school tricks, stuff that would never play in the city... signalling, chip placing, trapping.
i can probably crack the game just as quickly straight up, but there's no risk in this room.
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
i mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.
i think the most important thing is to be respectful to the judges but not obsequious.
i watched you, i stood by you while you lost everything before.
- i don't think i can go through that with you again.
i felt alive for the first time since i got busted at kgb's joint, okay?
you just told me you felt alive for the first time at a fucking card table.
i watch the cards also, but i watch the players reacting to the cards.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me.
- good, man, hey, i was startin' to wonder about you.
i thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives?
all the luck in the world isn't gonna change things for these guys.
he doesn't look like much, but kgb is connected all the way to the top of the russian mob.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
they all know me as a small-timer, but that's about to change.
a game like this doesn't come together often outside the casinos.
the stakes attract rich flounders, and they in turn attract the sharks.
there's no other game in which fortunes can change so much from hand to hand.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front of him.
- i just got top two pair on the flop, and i want to keep him in the hand.
against your average guy, i'd set a bear trap, hardly bet at all.
now i hope a spade falls and teddy makes his flush.
that way he'll bet strong, and i'll beat him with my nines full over aces.
you don't hear much about guys who take their shot and miss, but i'll tell you what happens to 'em.
they end up humping crappy jobs on graveyard shifts, trying to figure out how they came up short.
amarillo slim to my right, playing in the world series of poker.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
i'd heard about it for years on the street, before i was even in law school.
a rotating group of ten or twelve judges, prosecutors and professors.
they all have money, and in my playing days... it would have been pretty sweet to have any one of them owing me favors.
only problem is, no one can get in the game anymore.
- michael is lead counsel... in the moot court you're presiding over next week, gene.

we were the only two kids attending who didn't have a trust fund.
they hauled him up before the school board, offered him a deal.
tell us who else was involved, and we'll go easy on you.
just get in it and drive me far away from here.
there's like two whole economies in there... there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
i was this close to bangin' her when they sent me away.
she works as a hostess for all these fuckin' trust fund babies in here.
"few players recall big pots they have won, strange as it seems,
"but every player can remember with remarkable accuracy... the outstanding tough beats of his career."
now, some people might look down on worm's mechanics, call it immoral.
but as canada bill jones said, "it's immoral to let a sucker keep his money."
i mean, the key is a seamless passing of the baton among the team.

in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me.
- good, man, hey, i was startin' to wonder about you.
i thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?

all the luck in the world isn't gonna change things for these guys.
eric seidel cannot win this hand, and yet he doesn't know it.
chan is trying to sucker him in by taking his time.
so, he took, what, about eight off of roman and maurice?
yeah, yeah, he comes in after you leave, sits for like another 20 more minutes, cashes out for the full amount.
it's like i used to have a running partner, you know what i'm saying?
if we fucked up back then and got caught, the worst thing that was going to happen was maybe catch a beating, get expelled.
the guy's been kicked around his whole life, from his father on down.
maybe he's not the same guy he was when he went away, but i can't give up on him that easy.
i'm not gonna get down on my knees for that jerk-off.
all i said is just keep your mouth shut for five seconds.
he told me anytime i wanted a game when i got out, just look up his nephew.
you just go in there, you ask for sean frye, you're in.
sometimes the odds are stacked so clear, there's only one way to play it.
other times, like holding a small pair against two over cards, it's six to five, or even money, either way.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike, showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.
- now all i have to do is lean on him until he falls over.
your goal is to win one big bet an hour, that's it.
get your money in when you have the best of it, and protect it when you don't.
he's the one guy in the game you don't want to fuck with.
but if you're looking for high stakes, this is the only place in town.
these are community cards everyone can use to make the best five card hand.
the key to the game is playing the man, not the cards.
a brilliant player can get a strong hand cracked, go on tilt... and lose his mind along with every single chip in front ofhim.
this is why the world series of poker is decided over a no-limit hold 'em table.
[ narrating ] i want him to think that i'm pondering a call, but all i'm really thinking about is vegas and the fucking mirage.
all right, your 1 5, plus i have another 33 to raise you.
and i let that vision blind me at the table against kgb.
now, the closest i get to vegas is west new york, driving this lousy route handed down from knish... to rounders who forget the cardinal fuckin'rule--
i'd heard about it for years on the street, before i was even in law school.

besides, he could use the background ifhe's gonna... clerk for one of you fellas this summer, right ?
we know what we're holding, and we know what you're holding.
[ chuckles ] the fuck you know what we all got.
let's just say i'll put you at the top of the list if you're right.
okay. [ clears throat ] well, you were looking for that third three, but you forgot that professor green folded it on fourth street, and now you're representing that you have it.
the d.a. made his two pair, but he knows they're no good.
judge kaplan was trying to squeeze out a diamond flush, but he came up short, and mr. eisen is futilely hoping that his queens are gonna stand up.
i mean, that was like... buy in at 8:00, next thing you know it's morning.
but hey, you know, i think i'm hooked up for this summer.
i just caught his eye by reading his hand, that's all.
i mean, as long as i don't fuck up moot court, i think the job's mine.
[ mike narrating ] i met worm at dwight inglewood preparatory academy over in jersey.

there's like two whole economies in there-- there's cash and there's trade.
so i gotta keep three games going at once, all right ?
a game with the white guys, a game with the brothers, and a game with the guards.
- it was a real blood game over at kgb's place.
you sat down with the mad russian and he emptied your pockets ?

hey, that guy hasn't had to work in 1 5 years, worm.
every place in manhattan, they all keep books, all right ?
if you get listed as a mechanic, then not only are you gonna get the shit kicked out of you, you're not gonna get a fuckin' game anywhere in new york.
i know, grama, that's why i'm trying to put together a roll here.
a lot of people coming up to me, asking if i could help, asking if i knew where to find you.
that's how i knew the d.a. made his two pair, and judge kaplan missed the flush.
i was watching their eyes when they checked their river cards.
you only start with jacks or better split, nines or better wired, three high cards to a flush.
if it's good enough to call, you gotta be in there raising, all right ?
no, i've been standing out here all this time just to say hi.
listen, things haven't been that smooth on the home front, so tone it down a little, all right ?
in fact, on the weekends you can't get a game in the city, because all the new york rounders are taking care of the tourists here.
hey, hey, why don't you warm up a seat for me.

i thought, maybe, you know, the boys upstate brought about a few changes in you.
you know, if we wanted to take each other's rolls, we could havejust stayed home.
[ mike narrating ] these two have no idea... what they're about to walk into.
down here to have a good time, they figure... why not give poker a try?
after all, how different can it be from the home games... they've played their whole lives ?
do they allow people like you in places like this ?
zagosh, when you get yourself a job, then you can be my fuckin' p.o.
mr. mcdermott, that is a supreme court free speech case... that has no bearing in the premises.

i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i got stones enough not to chase cards, action... or fucking pipe dreams of winning the world series on espn.

when my mother let me leave the yeshiva, it nearly broke her.

[ mike narrating ] i've often seen these people, these squares, at the table.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.

you wanna take it up with kgb, you go right ahead.
otherwise, you got one day, or this'll feel like a swedish massage.
i tell you not to overextend yourself, to rebuild, you go into hock for more.
i was giving you a living, mike, showing you the playbook i put together off my own beats.
after a little while, there wasn't a crap game going... 'cause all the high rollers are over there watching him.
some are playing with him, giving away their money to this guy to say...
and he makes a move toward his checks, and he looks at me.
and he looks at his cards, and he looks at me again.
short-stacked and long odds against, all their outs gone, one last card in the deck that can help them.
i used to wonder how they could let themselves get into such bad shape... and how the hell they thought they could turn it around.
in a heads-up match, the size of your stack is almost as important as the quality of your cards.
i chopped one of his legs out in the first hand.

anyway, without even asking, he gave me first look at his new line.
when the dominant faction grows old and weak, another rises up to take its place.
which is why we humans have to keep an eye on those stinking monkeys.
it's like i've died again and this time gone to heaven.
you know, for the past 12 years, i have had to fight for everything.
my only consolation was knowing that if i could just persevere, that my day would come.
and now, by the grace of god, the same god who gave us lycra, that glorious moment is finally here.
and now my life is, "oh, can we send you some hats, ms. van horn?"
"how is this fabric, ms. van horn?" damn, your boyfriend's handsome.
and this is how it's going to be from now on.
no backstabbing, no adversary, no smug, condescending diva driving me to do the best work i have ever done in my entire life.
when i was a kid, they were the two best pro wrestlers.
backbreaker was the champ and the hawaiian was always the number-one contender.
then backbreaker retired, and the flyin' hawaiian finally became the champ.
but it was a somber luau, because he never got the backbreaker's respect.
oh, he was so distraught, he became the cryin' hawaiian, and later, according to police, the crack-buyin' hawaiian.
what it all boils down to is that you want margo's respect.
jack gallo park will be a place where man can be accepted with open arms.
a place where people come as strangers, and leave as friends.
i'm on the yacht wearing her cockamamie shoes, when i trip and land in christy turlington's lap.

ironically, this comes just hours after the park was renamed in honor of local humanitarian, jack gallo.
jack gallo park will be a place where man can be accepted with open arms.

i just started reading the most wonderful book called jonathan's attic.

maya: (reading) in her heart of hearts, clarissa knew that one day, she could teach jonathan how to love again.
but until then, she would simply remain his devoted governess, quelling her passion with...
and i blow him an air-kiss and he says, "hey, let's do lunch,"
and i say, "yeah, let's." and this is when it gets really weird.
sounds like he's finally forgiven you for wrecking his birthday party.
hey, if he didn't want his dog drinking margaritas, he shouldn't have put him in a sombrero.
which is why we humans have to keep an eye on those stinking monkeys.
hey, this sounds like the start of a whole new era.
and now, by the grace of god, the same god who gave us lycra, that glorious moment is finally here.

a place where people come as strangers, and leave as friends.
straight to the sofa bed like a bullet, before you've even put the light on.
no, i just... thought you'd be really tired by now, that's all.
- but someone else being here with you is a real comfort.
just for tonight and tomorrow, anyway, till the door's sorted, to give me peace of mind.
chester said to come in here and try out his sunbed, but, truth be told, it's a pain in the sit-upon.
a couple of hours on this, i know what a grilled kipper feels like.
if she's here when the rat pack arrive, we won't be playing happy families.
put another way, the headline "man feeds own sister to bengal tiger"
it's not really one i can go on the news at ten with.
would it be fair to say that from where you were standing in the nature reserve, this man was not much more than a speck on your glasses?
i think i'd be interested if alan was telling us about jackie... - sorry, julie -
julie with no knickers on because she couldn't find any toilet paper.
if you've just joined us, you're watching the 43rd world stare-out championship finals.
well, we've been eagerly awaiting this match, though it's likely to be a test for the commentators.
he's the one on the left there, sitting with john warren.
mr mycroberg acted promptly, i remember, against seamus rafferty in an earlier round, when things got out of hand against sonny wirtz.
(man) this estate has the worst drugs problem in the southeast, right?
it's got the worst prostitution problem, it's got the worst petty-crime problem!
really, i just want to do the job as well as bill did, so just think of me as bill without the beard.
i think if we do that, we can achieve something rather good.
(annie) i had a couple of four-year-old twins just urinate all over me.
i was trying to sing to them, and they just pissed all over me, basically.
we have to keep quiet, cos this is where all the policemen are working very hard.
and just over there, in those drawers, that's where we keep all the details of the crimes all the bad men do.
well, we're very pleased to accept mr austin's offer - subject to one or two conditions.
as you know, tradition here is very important, and we would hope that mr austin would bear that in mind.
no matter how many times you say it, it will always sound like "tits".
in isolation it sounds strange, but i do intend to have a chain of hotels all called the titz.
you've got to force people out of their cars, onto public transport, by doubling the price of petrol.
then the roads are less busy, there's less pollution and journeys don't take so long.
it's a strange question, but i have a first hand answer as i've now run away for good...
from my voice you can probably tell that i'm a man.
and therefore, as susan says, communism has left its mark on you, or more precisely on us, the worst scar possible.
not even in victorian times was the degradation of women so bad.
she then stresses that modern day phallocratic despotism has its roots in asia the ancient essence of this ideology...
they cover you with a blanket and stare at you like at skoch.
first i have to explain a bit as this started along time ago.
it all happened one rainy, summer night in a totally normal bed.
i can't say i missed having men around but i did become fond of two objects they left behind.
grandfather eduard's spitting glass represented the clear mythical essence of manhood to me.
despite his senility he was the last authentic communist because he had seen things with his own eyes.
uncle karel was the only one who i considered a role model.
i wanted coffee with foam and you made it without foam.
i promise i'll eat the sandwich next time, i wasn't hungry.
i agree with her to a certain point, but i don't agree with lumir or breta and evzen's opinions seem to be rather peculiar, which brings us back to jirka...
you see, the way you look at something is very important.
- doggie, do you want poppy seed cake or a roll with your coffee?
and do you want apricot or strawberry jam, or ham and eggs?
i can't be primal and tyrannical or weak and submissive, but an equal and understanding partner.
if you throw him out you give him a strong argument and that's not good.
a topic eczema is not hereditary, even in alcoholic families, i can guarantee that.
and then you'll suffer quietly, with occasional breakdowns, in the end you'll lose respect for yourself.
they've had enough of that there's other girls to look at
# they've tried to set him up with tiffany and lndigo
# but they don't know a thing about love his friends would say he's dreamin' and livin' in the past
# but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked let go
so i pulled off the road and i just sorta stopped in this... ..i guess it was a rest area.
i was just kind of shaking and... (sighs) rest areas are homosexual hangouts.
i've been standing in the same spot... ..for five and a half hours.
you know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some travelling.
but it's tough going out there with all the crap they make today.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
(healy) it seems that women today are more impressed by the almighty buck... ..than some schmo who 's spent 17 years scraping by on peace corps wages.
... ..she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
i cured all sorts of horrible illnesses in third world countries.
i'm not going to use my philanthropy... especially after what i did.
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
well, his friends would say he's dreaming and living in the past
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
so anyway, school ended a couple of days later and her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay off those debts and well, i never saw mary again.
look, your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you anyway.
look, come on, man, you're a real glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.
this guy runs a little hot, but he gets the job done.
so dom tells me you're looking for some lady friend you knew back at school.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
i've been standing in the same spot for five and a half hours.
you know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traveling.
i don't know why anybody would wanna bounce around you know, if they had their own condo in nepal.
well, i try to be, but it's tough going with all the crap they make today.
i guess i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
at approximately 10:40 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested.
he was identified as an escaped mental patient and subsequently he confessed to the murder you're being held for.
no, ted, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant to his apartment with his last check.
i let my head get in the way of this one.
you know, i always pick guys from what i feel in here.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when, despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
so then in '94, i went back to dade community college for a semester.
and when the wal-mart cashier job fell through, i hooked up with peking pizza.
i delivered a pie to her and she answered the door in her nightgown and, wow, that was it for me.
i went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later i'm laid out in her office with a broken back.
you know, that's an idea i think is waiting to pop.
just like a nice, you know, nice, big, oversize waffle-cone stuffed full of chopped liver.
i say none of us leaves this room until our young mary here stops jerking us around and decides, once and for all, who she really wants.
now, mary, i know this is tough but you really will be doing them all a great favor to tell them the truth about us.
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
his friends would say "stop whining." they've had enough of that
his friends would say "stop pining, there's other girls to look at"
his friends would say "stop whining." they've had enough of that
his friends would say "stop pining, there's other girls to look at"
well, his friends would say he's dreaming and living in the past
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
so anyway, school ended a couple of days later and her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay off those debts and well.
i must have blocked it out of my head or something because i was driving down the highway last week and i started thinking about mary.
and all of a sudden it was like i couldn't breathe.
jesus. do you remember five years ago when your kidneys failed?
now. if you were a loser would they have found a donor with a tissue match so quickly?
you have to say "seeking deaf-mute with, you know 3- pound cock and trust fund."
i want a guy who can play 36 holes and still have enough energy to take me and warren to a ball game and eat hot dogs.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traveling.
i don't know why anybody would wanna bounce around you know.
i guess i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
you know, classics like the karate kid or harold and maude.
at approximately 10:40 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested.
he was identified as an escaped mental patient and subsequently he confessed to the murder you're being held for.
ted. the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant to his apartment with his last check.
yeah, i cured all sorts of horrible illnesses in third world countries.
but the bottom line is, i'm not gonna use my philanthropy as some kind of currency.
you know, i always pick guys from what i feel in here.
but for some reason with pat, i kept saying to myself:
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when, despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
so then in '94, i went back to dade community college for a semester.

i delivered a pie to her and she answered the door in her nightgown and, wow. that was it for me.
i went home that night, shaved my beard. and a week later i'm laid out in her office with a broken back.
have you ever thought about maybe moving back up to rhode island?
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
you two should be kissing my fucking hairy beanbag. you know?
because if it wasn't for me, she might have married that schmuck.
in fact, you know that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through nine years of intensive psychotherapy.
his friends would say "stop whining." they've had enough of that
his friends would say "stop pining, there's other girls to look at"
his friends would say, stop whinin', they've had enough of that
his friends would say, stop pining', there's other girls to look at
well, his friends would say he's dreamin' and livin' in the past
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
and where would you and your beer-bellied architect be going to?
i mean, are they putting up a new museum in town, or is it...
to tell you the truth, i'm sort of burnt out on talkin' about it.
yeah, one of those ones you can hook onto the clothesline, and he can run back and forth.
and, uh, there's plenty of room for him to... to dig and, uh, play.
well, you should, because it's probably the greatest love story of our time.
the point is is that love isn't about money or social standings or age.
uh, when you're looking at architecture, try to visualize the buildings as a whole, you know?
uh, try to see them in their natural state, in their totalitarian... ism, so to speak.
sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traveling.
i try to be, but it's tough going out there with all the crap they make today.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
it's just that i think you should be careful with this guy, that's all.
i mean, let's face it, you're beautiful, and and you've got money, and you trust people.
mr stroehmann, on behalf of the south carolina law enforcement community,
i would like to apologize to you for any pain or temporary inconvenience that you may have been caused.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay check.
the landlady said when he came back from miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary.
it seems that women today are more impressed by the almighty buck than some schmo who's spent 17 years scraping by on peace corps wages.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
i cured all sorts of horrible illnesses in third world countries.
but the bottom line is, i'm not going to use my philanthropy as some kind of currency, especially after what i did.

she moved to ourlittle rhode lsland town from minnesota two years earlier.

but i want somebody with freedom in theirjob, you know? somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
and where would you and your beer-bellied architect be going to? super bowl?
hey, i saw her a few months ago at a convention in las vegas.
how could you see her at a convention? well, i'm a chiropractor.
well, you should, because it's probably the greatest love story of our time.
the point is is that love isn't about money or social standings or age.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 1, 2, 3.
hey, pat, do you want a, um a budweiser or a heinie?

how long have you known him? not very long, but i like him.
i know he's a little different, but that's what i like about him.
no, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay cheque.
and in the future, do a little research before you send a guy like that out into the woods.
i mean, jesus christ, it's creepy, ok? you're not seriously thinking about going out with this guy again? mary, honey, he's a psycho.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in sudan.
at 16, he committed his first murder, a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s, he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed, there wasn't enough evidence to hold him.
look... the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load.
now, that is a medical fact and the reason for it is that you're no longer trying to get laid.
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
i got a great practice, like the people i work with, warren.
- don't flatter yourself. i-l-l was following her! i always do.
how the hell do you think i got rid ofthe last guy...
that's... that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through nine years of intensive psychotherapy and you know something?
they went away for a little while, but then you came back in my life, milady, huh? woogie...
i did not come back into your life, ok? i don't even know how you found me.
i say none of us leaves this room till our young mary here stops jerkin' us around and decides, once and for all, who she really wants.
now, mary, i know this is tough but you really will be doing them all a great favour to tell them the truth about us.
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
his friends would say, be reasonable, his friends would say, let go
because puffy used to bark his balls off whenever he saw him.
and you know that puffy, he only barks at the bad people.

i don't know why anybody would want to bounce around, you know, if they have their own condo in nepal.
start fresh in a new place, give up the architect game.
slow things down a bit, read more books, see more movies.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
you know, classics like the karate kid or harold and maude.
it's just that i think you should be careful with this guy, that's all.

or if you felt like that, maybe you'd wanna go with me.
look. your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you anyway.
look. come on, man. you're a real glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.
this guy runs a little hot, but he gets the job done.
so dom tells me you're looking for some lady friend you knew back at school.
i am not surprised at all because puffy used to bark his balls off whenever he saw him.
and you know that puffy, he only barks at the bad people.
no, i was thinking along the lines, maybe, of somebody like an architect or something.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
and where would you and your beer-bellied architect be going to?
no, i mean. are they putting up some sort of a new museum in town. or?
well, to tell you the truth, i'm sort of burnt-out on talking about it.
i've been standing in the same spot for five and a half hours.
you know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
well, i try to be. but it's tough going with all the crap they make today.
i guess i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
mr. stroehmann on behalf of the entire south carolina law enforcement community i would like to apologize to you for any pain or temporary inconvenience that you may have been caused.
at approximately 10:40 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested.
i sent my assistant to his apartment with his last check.
the landlady said when he came back he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary.
you know, i always pick guys from what i feel in here.
but for some reason with pat, i kept saying to myself:
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when, despite a grim psychological profile the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
so then in '94, i went back to dade community college for a semester.
and when the wal-mart cashier job fell through, i hooked up with peking pizza.
i delivered a pie to her and she answered the door in her nightgown and, wow. that was it for me.
i went home that night, shaved my beard. and a week later i'm laid out in her office with a broken back.
have you ever thought about maybe moving back up to rhode island?
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
you two should be kissing my fucking hairy beanbag. you know?
because if it wasn't for me, she might have married that schmuck.
in fact, you know that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through nine years of intensive psychotherapy.
his friends would say "stop whining." they've had enough of that
his friends would say "stop pining, there's other girls to look at"
his friends would say, stop whinin', they've had enough of that
his friends would say, stop pining', there's other girls to look at
well, his friends would say he's dreamin' and livin' in the past
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
so, anyway, uh school ended a couple days later, and her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay off those debts and well, i never saw mary again.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
i mean, are they putting up a new museum in town, or is it...
to tell you the truth, i'm sort of burnt-out on talkin' about it.
yeah, one of those ones you can hook onto the clothesline, and he can run back and forth.
and, uh, there's plenty of room for him to... to dig and, uh, play.
well, you should, because it's probably the greatest love story of our time.
the point is is that love isn't about money or social standings or age.
uh, when you're looking at architecture, try to visualize the buildings as a whole, you know?
uh, try to see them in their natural state, in their totalitarian... ism, so to speak.
sometimes i wish i could be like magda and not go home.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traveling.
i try to be, but it's tough going out there with all the crap they make today.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
no, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last paycheck.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in sudan.
patrick r healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of 14.
at 16, he committed his first murder, a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s, he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
have you ever thought about, uh maybe moving back up to rhode island?
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
i got a great practice, like the people i work with, warren.
maybe you should just, like, move down here and marry me.
that's... that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through nine years of intensive psychotherapy and you know something?
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
# his friends would say, stop whinin', they've had enough ofthat
# his friends would say, stop pining', there's other girls to look at
# well, his friends would say he's dreamin' and livin' in the past
# but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
so, anyway, uh... ..school ended a couple days later,... ..her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay offthose debts and... ..well, i never saw mary again.
after 13 years,... ..she's probably gonna think i'm a stalker or something.
you know what you should do is hire a private investigator.
yeah, one ofthose ones you can hook onto the clothesline,... ..and he can run back and forth.
and, uh, there's plenty of room... ..for him to... to dig and, uh, play.
well, you should, because it's probably the greatest love story of our time.
the point is... ..is that love isn't about... ..money or social standings... ..or age.
i've been standing in the same spot... ..for five and a half hours.
you know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some travelling.
i don't know why anybody would want to bounce around,... ..you know, ifthey have their own condo in nepal.
start fresh in a new place, give up the architect game.
slow things down a bit, read more books, see more movies.
no, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay cheque.
(heaiy) itseems that women today are more impressedby the aimightybuck... ..than some schmo who's spent 17years scraping by on peace corps wages.
if she's as special as you say,... ..she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
at 16, he committed his first murder,... ..a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22,... ..when despite a grim psychological profile,... ..the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s,... ..he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed,... ..there wasn't enough evidence to hold him.
the most honest moment in a man's life... ..are the few minutes after he's blown his load.
now, that is a medical fact and the reason for it... ..is that you're no longer trying to get laid.
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
i got a great practice, like the people i work with, warren.
that's... that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through... ..nine years of intensive psychotherapy and you know something?
i say none of us leaves this room... ..till our young mary here stops jerking' us around... ..and decides, once and for all,... ..who she really wants.
now, mary, i know this is tough... ..but you really will be doing them all a great favour... ..to tell them the truth about us.
his friends would say, stop whinin', they've had enough of that
his friends would say, stop pining', there's other girls to look at
well, his friends would say he's dreamin' and livin' in the past

i try to be, but it's tough going out there with all the crap they make today.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
it's just that i think you should be careful with this guy, that's all.
i mean, let's face it, you're beautiful, and and you've got money, and you trust people.
mr stroehmann, on behalf of the south carolina law enforcement community,
i would like to apologize to you for any pain or temporary inconvenience that you may have been caused.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay check.
the landlady said when he came back from miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary.
it seems that women today are more impressed by the almighty buck than some schmo who's spent 17 years scraping by on peace corps wages.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
i cured all sorts of horrible illnesses in third world countries.
but the bottom line is, i'm not going to use my philanthropy as some kind of currency, especially after what i did.
patrick r. healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of 14.
at 16, he committed his first murder, a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him.

and, uh, there's plenty of room... for him to... to dig and, uh, play.
the point is... is that love isn't about... money or social standings... or age.
it's about 2 people connecting... having something in common... you know, kindred spirits.
uh, when you're looking at architecture, try to visualize the buildings as a whole, you know?

# his friends would say, be reasonable, his friends would say, let go

his friends would say, "be reasonable" his friends would say, "let go"
i just wondered if maybe you were going to the prom. and--
or if you felt like that, maybe you'd wanna go with me.
so anyway, school ended a couple of days later and her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay off those debts and well.
αnyway, i know it's not the type of thing you'd forget, but i guess i just-- l kind of, you know-- l must haνe blocked it out of my head or something because i was driving down the highway last week and i started thinking about mary.
and all of a sudden it was like i couldn't breathe.
look. your brother jimmy never gave a shit about you anyway.
look. come on, man. you're a real glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.
υou have to say "seeking deaf-mute with, you know 3-pound cock and trust fund."
i want a guy who can play 36 holes and still have enough energy to take me and warren to a ball game and eat hot dogs.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
i've been driνing for like 15 hours straight so i could use the company.
i know what you mean. i'νe been standing in the same spot for five and a half hours.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traνeling.
i don't know why anybody would wanna bounce around you know.
i guess i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
υou know, classics like the karate kid or harold and maude.
αt approximately 10:40 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested.
he was identified as an escaped mental patient and subsequently he confessed to the murder you're being held for.
ted. the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant to his apartment with his last check.

they have lollipops, they have fudgesicles they have popsicles but they don't have any other meat on sticks.

i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
his friends would say, be reasonable, his friends would say, let go
so, anyway, uh school ended a couple days later, and her father got transferred to florida in july.
so i worked all summer to pay off those debts and well, i never saw mary again.
after 13 years, she's probably gonna think i'm a stalker or something.
you know what you should do is hire a private investigator.
because puffy used to bark his balls off whenever he saw him.
and you know that puffy, he only barks at the bad people.
i've been standing in the same spot for five and a half hours.
you know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some traveling.
i don't know why anybody would want to bounce around, you know, if they have their own condo in nepal.
start fresh in a new place, give up the architect game.
slow things down a bit, read more books, see more movies.
i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
you know, classics like the karate kid or harold and maude.
no, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay check.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in sudan.
at 16, he committed his first murder, a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s, he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed, there wasn't enough evidence to hold him.
the most honest moment in a man's life are the few minutes after he's blown his load.
now, that is a medical fact and the reason for it is that you're no longer trying to get laid.
have you ever thought about, uh maybe moving back up to rhode island?
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
i got a great practice, like the people i work with, warren.
maybe you should just, like, move down here and marry me.
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
his friends would say "stop whining." they'νe had enough of that
his friends would say "stop pining, there's other girls to look at"
well, his friends would say he's dreaming and living in the past
but they'νe neνer fallen in loνe so his friends need not be asked
jesus. do you remember five years ago when your kidneys failed?
now. if you were a loser would they haνe found a donor with a tissue match so quickly?
τhis guy runs a little hot, but he gets the job done.
so dom tells me you're looking for some lady friend you knew back at school.
i am not surprised at all because puffy used to bark his balls off wheneνer he saw him.
αnd you know that puffy, he only barks at the bad people.
no, i was thinking along the lines, maybe, of somebody like an architect or something.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
αnd where would you and your beer-bellied architect be going to?
no, i mean. are they putting up some sort of a new museum in town. or...?
well, to tell you the truth, i'm sort of burnt-out on talking about it.
i know what you mean. i'νe been standing in the same spot for five and a half hours.
υou know they made it illegal to hitchhike in this state?
well, i try to be. but it's tough going with all the crap they make today.
i guess i just wish they made movies like they used to make.
mr. stroehmann on behalf of the entire south carolina law enforcement community i would like to apologize to you for any pain or temporary inconvenience that you may haνe been caused.
αt approximately 10:40 this morning a man was apprehended not far from where you were arrested.
i sent my assistant to his apartment with his last check.
τhe landlady said when he came back he kept talking about falling for some doctor named mary.
i let my head get in the way of this one.
υou know, i always pick guys from what i feel in here.
αnd when the wal-mart cashier job fell through, i hooked up with peking pizza.
hey, cat, how about a couple of brews over here, man?
υou two should be kissing my fucking hairy beanbag. you know?
because if it wasn't for me, she might have married that schmuck.
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend τucker was lying about a couple of other things.
but they've never fallen in love so his friends need not be asked
his friends would say, be reasonable, his friends would say, let go
i must have blocked it out of my head or something, 'cause i was driving down the highway last week, and i started thinking about mary,
and all of a sudden it was like i couldn't breathe.
because puffy used to bark his balls off whenever he saw him.
and you know that puffy, he only barks at the bad people.
but i want somebody with freedom in their job, you know?
somebody who can do it anywhere and just leave at a drop of a hat.
i mean, are they putting up a new museum in town, or is it...
to tell you the truth, i'm sort of burnt-out on talkin' about it.
yeah, one of those ones you can hook onto the clothesline, and he can run back and forth.
and, uh, there's plenty of room for him to... to dig and, uh, play.
well, you should, because it's probably the greatest love story of our time.
the point is is that love isn't about money or social standings or age.
uh, when you're looking at architecture, try to visualise the buildings as a whole, you know?
uh, try to see them in their natural state, in their totalitarian... ism, so to speak.
i'd like to bounce around for a while and do some travelling.
i don't know why anybody would want to bounce around, you know, if they have their own condo in nepal.
start fresh in a new place, give up the architect game.
slow things down a bit, read more books, see more movies.
no, the bad news i got is about our friend healy.
i sent my assistant down to his apartment with his last pay cheque.
if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.

patrick r healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of 14.
at 16, he committed his first murder, a pretty teacher's aide named molly pettygrove.
he was incarcerated until the age of 22, when despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him.
in his mid-20s and again in his early 30s, he was suspected of homicides in the states of utah and washington.
have you ever thought about, uh maybe moving back up to rhode island?
i thought about it, but i got too much of a good thing going on here.
i got a great practice, like the people i work with, warren.
maybe you should just, like, move down here and marry me.
that's... that's what i really wanted to talk to you about.
you know that i have actually been through nine years of intensive psychotherapy and you know something?
i told him to pick up warren and get down here.
see, your friend tucker was lying about a couple of other things.
but tomorrow, the sky's gonna f all down on both of us.
i'm going over to the 23rd pr ecinct, and i'm swearing out a warrant f or your arr est.
"how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"
you'r e watching "sports night" on csc, so come on back.
danny, he should not be the head coach of a major college f ootball team.
yeah, but he is, and you know what that job's like, so i'm just saying -- -
is this one of those days when you have a hard time making the distinction?
we wer e this close to beating miami -- this close.
anytime you've got a thousand people sending letters and making phone calls, it's a pr etty good bet that at least one of them's gonna be out of his mind.
jer emy, is this why you haven't been sleeping at night?
-- 'cause, you know, network security's working with the fbi, and they pr etty much have the bases cover ed.
well, they don't have the bases cover ed, because i intercepted this e-mail this morning.
"lately, i think you and me ar e the only ones who know anything about f ootball.
"rostenkowski should be run out of town on a rail, and you'r e just the man to do it."
- however, my f ather would also say you'r e a f ool.
that's entir ely possible, but in own def ense, so was don quix ote.
i want to take natalie to dinner, and i want to do it right.
i wrote some softwar e that helps me f actor in menu, ambiance, location, any number of elements that can be translated into binomial f unctions.
it's based on the fourth generation of l7 software that runs with the old omni applications.
it doesn't allow f or tr ends, and it's not as f ast as i'd like it to be,
restaurants -- they don't impr ess women as much as we think they do, and f ood always tastes good on the first date.
you'r e not in vegas, and you'r e not in l.a.
yeah -- well, you'r e not gonna go up the middle against an 8-man f ront, but still...
oh, still, maybe you run a play-action f ake, you toss it off to the tight end out in the flat.
the problem with that is that without establishing a running game first,
-- no one's gonna bite down on the play f ake.
i don't have 80,000 f ans scr eaming in my f ace.
so it's easy for me -- i don't have 10 million people watching at home on tv, including a pack of rabid alumni.
so it's a lot easier f or me to make that decision than it was f or him.
but since you asked me what play i would have called, i'll tell you.
you should know that tony orlando is not ltalian, and if you guessed that the man was of latin descent, you'd be incorr ect as well.
mr. tony orlando hails f rom gr eece, we thought you should know that.
dan, y-you just had to ad-lib a 30-second segment in the f r eezing cold, and god knows what graphic i put on the scr een.
look, all i want is to get it right, and when i don't, i expect to be tr eated like a prof essional.
look, mr. allan i'm a duly elected member of the mars provisional government.
under the new treaty we're authorized to produce our own passports, identicards and currency.
it's not my fault that earth isn't recognizing that in practice.
they're holding off putting our data into the system as a form of harassment forcing us into using earth documentation because it isn't worth the hassle.
well, i have no intention of putting up with bureaucratic blackmail.
if you have a problem with it, take it up with someone who cares.
so within days of mars declaring independence every major corporation with ties to earth was running for cover.
they'd been exploiting and strip-mining mars for decades, so they were scared covering their tracks as fast as possible.
it got so bad that in dome one you couldn't buy a paper shredder for love or money.
so, what does this have to do with lise and me?
after forming the provisional government, we went after their records offered immunity to anyone who would come forth and help us.
along the way, we developed sources inside most of the major corporations still working on mars.
it's a company that financed several black projects under clark's administration.
now, we know about the telepath virus he was working on but who knows what else they were cooking up.
all he knew was the hit would be going down in the next couple of days.
my guess is they want it done before the two of you leave for mars.
i don't think i'd choose that word for it but beats being stuck here.
so i appreciate the offer even though i know this isn't entirely for my benefit.
then my decision was even more correct than i had imagined.
i'll see to it that your belongings are transferred to my ship when we are ready to leave.
we've known each other on and off for something like 15 years.
we break up, we get back together, we break up, we get back together.
pending a full autopsy, it looks like a stab wound where it'd do the most damage the quickest.
no other signs of violence, so he was taken completely by surprise.
well, that's the problem when you go from being a soldier to a politician.
you have to listen to people you would've shot six months earlier.
doing what i'm doing right now expanding my contacts as much as i can.
if something's gonna blow up, i wanna know before it does.
i'll have my people there in plainclothes, but that's the best we can do.
we still don't know who he is or how to stop him or...
with ambassador delenn on minbar overseeing completion of the new alliance facilities it falls to me to single out two individuals for appreciation.
one, michael garibaldi who has served babylon 5 with distinction for six years.
help me create a force i can use against the psi corps and i'll give you the chance to strike at bester.
if you don't pull that off in two years, when i come back this way again well, consider that a sign of things to come.
i'm told it can handle just about any sort of environment and it only has 240 light-years on it.
maybe you'd let me take it for a spin around the block sometime.
long after we are gone our voices will linger in these walls for as long as this place remains.
but i will admit that the part of me that is going will very much miss the part of you that is staying.
and sometimes i can be a real pain in the ass.
all i know is, anything that i've ever wanted i've never gotten.
but i do know the one thing i want in this world more than anything else is you.
all right, so it'll be lise hampton-edgars-garibaldi and we'll never get all that put on our bathrobes, but...
all we do know is that, for some unknown reason this unfortunate undertaking was executed by gregory fitch, our head of security.
we were planning to confront him but apparently he hanged himself in his home last night.
in his suicide note, he took responsibility for the whole thing.
so anything else you might have heard would be sheer speculation and impossible to prove.
surprising, considering that little blond you've got on the side in syria planum.
i gotta tell you, she'd wear the hell out of me in just a few hours.
after all, that had to be one of your biggest fears, wasn't it?
an alliance between lise and someone in a position to dig into your past must be your worst nightmare.
now, since i don't work for the government anymore i don't feel i have to play by the usual rules.
and since lise and i are married now we've got some plans for the future of edgars industries.
if anything should happen to lise and me you know, slip in the shower, fall down a flight of stairs or die from anything other than old age this money will be paid to certain people who will take out each and every one of you.
i would have to imagine, at 100,000 credits a head every mercenary from here and earth will be out looking for you.
the ironic part is that i'm in a better position now to help mars than when i was there.
yeah, well when this place was built, i think irony was one of the primary materials used in construction.
it's just that all my family my mom and dad, they passed away a long, long time ago.
the two of you and stephen, g'kar hell, even londo, you're the...

after forming the provisional government, we went after their records offered immunity to anyone who would come forth and help us.
but with your husband's death, you own one of the 10 biggest medical research companies on mars.
it's a company that financed several black projects under clark's administration.
we break up, we get back together, we break up, we get back together.
i think we finally got a chance at making it right.
maybe there's not an obvious reason, but there's always a reason.
besides, if you're gonna knock off someone for fun you're not gonna take on an armed officer.
you have to listen to people you would've shot six months earlier.
when we were fighting we were able to put our internal disagreements on the back burner.
i haven't been able to give it time because we're up to our ears looking for the hit man after garibaldi and there's less than eight hours until the ceremony.
i'll have my people there in plainclothes, but that's the best we can do.
i have had the distinct honor and pleasure to serve alongside both of them.
and now that they are leaving babylon 5 to pursue other goals well, i think it only proper to give them a going-away party.
we wouldn't have been there if it hadn't been for that other guy.
mr. allan assured me that the narn who pulled the trigger will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
i wanted to talk to you about pressing charges against the narn.
i wanna see the guy who came here to kill me and lise.
i give you my word, i will not lay a finger on him.
but you're giving me five minutes, or you'll have to shoot me because i'm going down there.
get in his head and tell me who hired him or the deal's off.
the hell with you and your little war against the psi corps!
i just wanted to come by and see you before you left.
i was hoping you could stick around a little bit longer till delenn got back from minbar.
maybe you'd let me take it for a spin around the block sometime.
you know, g'kar what i said earlier, at the podium i meant every word of that.
i mean, there's been more than a few times when i wanted to deck you.
but when the day is done i've always had the greatest respect for you.
go anywhere in the station when it is quiet and just listen.
after a while you will hear the echoes of all our conversations.
lise i just thought that before the universe threw us anything else that we should get married.
i know that i don't have a lot to offer you.
all i know is, anything that i've ever wanted i've never gotten.
but i do know the one thing i want in this world more than anything else is you.
we were planning to confront him but apparently he hanged himself in his home last night.
in his suicide note, he took responsibility for the whole thing.
i know, you're wondering how i got this information since i'm not the head of intelligence for the alliance anymore.
after all, that had to be one of your biggest fears, wasn't it?
i just wanted her out of the room before i got to the really good part.
that was just the short-term solution to easing all of you out of the building.
and since lise and i are married now we've got some plans for the future of edgars industries.
now, part of all that money is gonna go to repair the damage you did back home.
yeah, well when this place was built, i think irony was one of the primary materials used in construction.
like the irony of you coming here just when most of us me included, are getting ready to leave.
you know, i never thought i was gonna make it out of here alive.
i always figured i'd end up facedown somewhere in brown sector.
under the new treaty we're authorized to produce our own passports, identicards and currency.

we wouldn't have been there if it hadn't been for that other guy.
mr. allan assured me that the narn who pulled the trigger will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
i wanted to talk to you about pressing charges against the narn.
i wanna see the guy who came here to kill me and lise.
i give you my word, i will not lay a finger on him.
but you're giving me five minutes, or you'll have to shoot me because i'm going down there.
get in his head and tell me who hired him or the deal's off.
the hell with you and your little war against the psi corps!
i just wanted to come by and see you before you left.
i was hoping you could stick around a little bit longer till delenn got back from minbar.
maybe you'd let me take it for a spin around the block sometime.
you know, g'kar what i said earlier, at the podium i meant every word of that.
i mean, there's been more than a few times when i wanted to deck you.
but when the day is done i've always had the greatest respect for you.
go anywhere in the station when it is quiet and just listen.
after a while you will hear the echoes of all our conversations.
lise i just thought that before the universe threw us anything else that we should get married.
i know that i don't have a lot to offer you.
all i know is, anything that i've ever wanted i've never gotten.
but i do know the one thing i want in this world more than anything else is you.
we were planning to confront him but apparently he hanged himself in his home last night.
in his suicide note, he took responsibility for the whole thing.
- i know, you're wondering how i got this since i'm not the head of intelligence for the alliance anymore.
after all, that had to be one of your biggest fears, wasn't it?
i just wanted her out of the room before i got to the really good part.
that was just the short-term solution to easing all of you out of the building.
and since lise and i are married now we've got some plans for the future of edgars industries.
now, part of all that money is gonna go to repair the damage you did back home.
yeah, well when this place was built, i think irony was one of the primary materials used in construction.
like the irony of you coming here just when most of us me included, are getting ready to leave.
you know, i never thought i was gonna make it out of here alive.
i always figured i'd end up facedown somewhere in brown sector.
many believe the nazis conjured strange spirits and followed occult practices that had lain dormant in europe for thousands of years
now, documents prove that their beliefs were based on a perversion of ancient pagan lore a twisting of mythic battles between forces of light and darkness and a terrifying journey into a world ruled by mystics madmen and murderers
the himalayas of tibet ln the 1 930's, the nazis began searching the top of the world
for evidence of ancient high priests who they believed were their blood ancestors
the nazi belief in these ancestors was to form the foundation of germany's new religion a religion with adolph hitler as its high priest
lnspiring hitler's evil crusade was a belief that pure aryan blood was being contaminated by so-called inferior races and that once rid of foreign elements a new race of aryan supermen would rule the world
this was the nazi interpretation of ancient myths and occult lore dating back thousands of years
to prove their superiority the nazis would leave no myth or religion unexplored, in effect borrowing from any belief they could adapt to the aryan cause
to achieve absolute control he not only used the power of myth but co-opted christian ritual
his inner circle, who had strong ties to the occult would help him to accomplish this goal
alfred rosenberg who wrote the book laying out the tenets of the nazi religion
joseph goebbels, hitler's minister of propaganda whose diary records his use of astrological forecasts in planning the war against the allies
at the foundation of this new religion was an ancient occult legend that tells the story of a continent somewhere in the north atlantic.
there lived a race of super beings who had fallen from grace through evil and vice.
a great flood wiped these beings off the face of the earth.
but before they could all be destroyed, certain priests escaped by boat, eventually finding their way to india and the high peaks of tibet.
reichsfuhrer-ss heinrich himmler an extreme nationalist, made it his mission to prove that the germanic peoples were the descendants of the atlantic master race.
nationalists, particularly those who believed in the superiority of the aryan race, always had entertained the notion of a vanished island,
that the mythical super beings of atlantis eventually made their way from tibet to northern europe, and that their descendants became the nordic or aryan races.
government-funded expeditions under himmler's direction were sent to tibet, searching for evidence of their ancestors.
ln 1 946, in a post-war interrogation by the u.s. army, the ss scientist who led one of the tibetan expeditions described his first meeting with himmler.
he said... "himmlermentioned his belief that the nordic race did not evolve but came directly down from heaven to settle on the atlantic continent, and that ancient immigrants from atlantis had founded a great civilization in central asia."
although he was a very rational calculating power broker, he was also a romantic idealist and he certainly believed in these myths.
otherwise he wouldn't have spent the money and the time and the energy he did sending expeditions to tibet.
and this, of course, was stepped up by the time the war was on in that by this time
they were able to do experiments of a rather still innocent type
the quest to prove the superiority of the aryan race soon moved into the criminal.
the nazis will begin killing people and using their bodies for experiments.
they believed that once they had proven that their ancestors were gods, it would be a simple step to recreate this race of aryan godmen through selective breeding.
that you could somehow force human evolution in a sort of hot-house environment by selecting the parents of a child, and then re-breeding their offspring until the day
these future warriors had to be well educated, and only from families of pure aryan heritage.
the ss had been generally rather tall, well made men warriors.
ln addition to their size they had to be of pure blood.
now for the officers, they had to prove pure german ancestry without interbreeding back to 1 7 50.
himmler's ss, at one point three million strong, were encouraged to father as many children as possible, regardless of their marital status.
"the ss," he told them "had a sacred duty to their nation and to their fuhrer to beget healthy aryan babies."
one of himmler's ideas concerned polygamy, the only way in which he could breed the master race of it faster was by, in fact, instituting the practice whereby ss men would be able to take more than one wife.
ln 1 935, himmler created the ss lebensborn program, meaning "fountain of life."
the ss lebensborn was providing conditions whereby young girls could, in fact, be served by ss studs.
he suggested that young aryan girls in germany who hadn't been able to find a boyfriend or a husband need not forego the pleasures of motherhood.
to breed the children whose offspring the nazi party believed would become gods.
an estimated eleven thousand lebensborn babies were bred between 1 935 and 1 945.
some were raised at lebensborn homes, while others were adopted and raised by ss families.
during the war, children with aryan appearance were abducted from conquered nations, and sent to lebensborn homes in germany.
nazi records indicate that two hundred thousand polish babies alone were kidnapped and placed in lebensborn homes, where they received careful training in every aspect of nazi culture and mythology.
long before hitler came to power, these beliefs were flourishing against an already racist backdrop.
there were many organizations in germany and austria around the turn of the century, which blended racist ideology with occult practices.
but their ideas became popular only at the conclusion of world war i.
the once-mighty empire of germany had been disarmed and at the mercy of the victorious nations after the first world war.
ln formerly wealthy cities, disabled veterans haunted the streets, like ghosts from another lifetime.
somebody who grew up in berlin in the twenties remembers anything, he remembers the urban landscape with cripples from the first world war who, of course, had no pension no nothing, who begged on the streets without legs and arms,
who remembered the great misery of what you might call the urban landscape.
but far from being the communist organization that its name implied, the party turned out to be extremely right wing.
hitler liked what he heard, joined and eventually became leader of the organization.
attending an early rally where hitler spoke was a disillusioned war veteran named rudolf hess.
and he came back taking three steps by one, jumping up and said, "hey i saw one this evening.
he's going to bring back germany to the recommendation it had before the war and this is the only man who is able to do it."
hess was convinced the dynamic orator he heard was the long-awaited messiah, prophesied in german occult circles.
and was dedicated to the revival of the so-called aryan master race.
members practiced astrology, sun worship and other occult sciences, thinking that this would help them reach their goal.
ln 1 920, hitler's party officially changed its name to the german national socialist worker's party, the nsdap or, as it would soon become known, the nazi party.
with hitler as its leader, the nazi party grew quickly, sweeping people up in a frenzy of fear-mongering and fiery oratory.
hitler lived in an environment that was already hostile to judaism.
he would have easily found these ideas in popular publications such as ostara, an overtly racist occult magazine written by a renegade and ultimately defrocked monk and mystic named lanz von liebenfels.
ostara magazine was a good example of how hitler would have picked up his racism and his anti-semitism.
he even paid a visit to lanz's editorial office to obtain back numbers.
lmmensely popular at the time, the journal preached that the nordic or aryan races had much to fear from people darker than themselves, and targeted jews as the most threatening.
the ostara claimed that the jews were preventing the aryans from taking their rightful place as rulers of the world, an eternal struggle dating back to biblical times.
you should therefore read ostara, publications for blondes and the male rights movement.
the publication outlined what would become the nazi world view ... racialselection,
hitler's developing theories of race were ready to be further influenced, this time by thule society supporter,
alfred rosenberg, the racist philosopher and occultist who would eventually become the furher's voice in spiritual matters.
so for rosenberg, blood racial stock, racial identity became the key notes of this new ideology.
rosenberg preached that the blood of a people carried the soul of the race.
i think, if you look back down the esoteric traditions of the west, you find that blood has always been considered as a very important vehicle of the spirit.
it is a sacred substance that contains more than the physical life of each person, but also the spiritual life.
nordic myth replaced the christian bible as the foundation of the new nazi religion.
ln a pageant orchestrated by rosenberg and captured on film, the nazis celebrated their newly-conceived version of aryan culture and history.
rosenberg wrote... "todaya newmythos is dawning, the mythos of the blood.
the belief that the godly essence is to be defended through the blood.
the whole secret knowledge of nature of the divine, the demonic.
we will wash off the christian veneer and bring out a religion peculiar to our race."
as a symbol for the new religion hitler chose the swastika.
the swastika can be found all over the world in many different cultures throughout history.
from earliest times, it was the symbol of good luck in china, and to this day, it remains a religious emblem in the hindu and buddhist faiths.
it had been carried by knights on shields as a magical protection and it had also had connections, it was non-christian in an overt sense.
as an adult, he became an obsessive devotee of the composer.
richard wagner was the most singularly admired person in adolph hitler's life and career ever.
the music is absolutely have the effect of a drug completely eliminating the intellectual, the critical approach.
wagner's opera parsifal, which glorifies the power of pure blood, was a source of inspiration to hitler.
it is an epic retelling of the quest for the holy grail.
according to legend, the grail was a mystical vessel bearing sacred blood, and it promised unlimited powers to anyone who drank from it.
ln 1 938, hitler commissioned this portrait of himself dressed as a knight.
hitler's bid for power began on november 9th, 1 923, with an attempted overthrow of the bavarian government.
at that time they were carrying a swastika flag and this sort of fell with the people and the blood of the dead got upon it.
and a ritual arose whereby every new nazi flag and banner was not empowered until hitler had touched the flag against this flag.
with hitler's elevation to leader, the blood religion became the undisputed religion of the nazi party, complete with holy days and martyrs
propaganda minister goebbels orchestrated a ritual in which the sixteen nazi heroes were honored as martyrs of the reich who died were resurrected, then achieved eternal life.
according to hitler, their blood was the holy water of the third reich.
i suppose most movements they have their martyrs and those who died in 1 923 they too,
they were considered to be martyrs and they were an example how you should stand firm and defend for what you believe in so there was that religious undertone.
the first martyrs of the reich became known as the "sixteen lmmortals."
ln munich, the ritual began with a funeral march down the very streets where the immortals fell.
at the front of the procession they carried the blood flag.
along the route, hung huge red flags bearing slanted germanic runes, the ritual symbol of sacrifice from pagan lore.
so in a way we can see this as a transfer of the easter procession in jerusalem up to the church of the holy sepulcher through the stations of the cross.
and when i was about sixteen seventeen, my father took me to munich, and i went to this feldenhalle and there the coffins were all lined up
and there were guards standing presenting their rifles and steel helmets, and it was all rather eerie.
the centerpiece of it, if you like, is that you are willing to sacrifice yourself for your fatherland.
lndoctrination into the nazi faith with hitler as god, began early and continued into adulthood.
for girls, the compulsory organization was the league of german maids, where they were taught self-sacrifice to marry young, and that their bodies belonged to the nation.
ten year old boys became members of the organization of young german people.
at fourteen they joined the hitler youth, and at eighteen, the nazi party.
at each stage, they were taught the nazi creed of sacred blood rituals, racial superiority and total allegiance to hitler, even to the death.
it was great to be told that you belonged to the greatest race, the greatest nation on earth.
i thought that because i was a german, that german blood was running through my veins, that made me superior to all the others.
and i mean i read it more than sixty years ago.
ln conjunction with mein kampf, the principles of the blood religion began to form the basis of nazi policy.
nazi doctors would secretly administer lethal injections, telling their parents they died of natural causes.
a euthanasia program was instituted for the mentally and physically impaired.
propaganda films claimed these were acts of kindness, freeing trapped souls from tormented bodies.
by 1 935, hitler had created the blood laws, which made it a criminal act for a pure german to marry or even have sex with a jew.
purifying the aryan bloodline was only half of hitler's demonic plan.
to finally clear the way for the last stage of human evolution and assure the coming of the aryan millennium, the nazis felt that one obstacle remained:
a barbaric measure for the unfortunate who is struck by it, but a blessing for his fellow man and posterity.
the passing pain of a century can and will redeem millenniums from sufferings."
the idea that the few should be scarified for the good of the many extended even to hitler's sa, the storm troopers
eventually the sa, who were among hitler's first supporters, became an obstacle, one that he had no qualms about removing.
they broke up demonstrations and they protected their own big meetings.
the middle class and the army came to fear the sa.
and with himmler, rid the party of the storm troopers in one night.
the night of the long knife that happened in, on the 30th of june, 1 934, so i was just twelve years old.
himmler's conception of the ss was no less than the creation of a new blood stock elite for the nazi order in europe.
at every stage, the ss was constantly reminded that it was no less than a warrior elite whose values of hardness and military valor were absolutely central to its existence.
and more than that, that they were in fact, ensuring the survival of the race in this way.
himmler was born a catholic, but by the time he met hitler, he was already a confirmed occultist.
it's difficult for us afterwards to equate this man who certainly believed in a god and to,
to link him up with a man who was master of the killing machine in germany.
but actually, the two things of course, are linked because what he was trying to do was to rout out the forces
which he believed had corrupted germany and get back to their pure-blooded forefathers.
himmler brought a range of unlikely influences to his design for the ss, including the hindu religion.
during the war, he reportedly traveled with a copy of the bhagavad gita, a holy book from the hindu religion.
it tells the story of a great battle on the field of righteousness between the forces of good and evil.
the hindu belief in reincarnation and its rigid caste system appealed to himmler.
it was a perfect model for a nazi warrior elite which would rule the world.
historians now say that himmler was convinced that he was the reincarnation of king heinrich, a german leader from the middle ages who stopped the slavs from invading germany.
that his ss had returned to the fatherland to fight a similar holy war.
on the night of july 1 , 1 937, to mark the millennium anniversary of king heinrich's death,
the king's remains were placed in a new grave and himmler laid a wreath of oak leaves, a symbol of ancient pagan origin.
he eulogized the man he believed he had been in a past life.
as the sarcophagus was sealed, he pledged to fulfill the king's mission of conquering the lands to germany's east.
himmler modeled his ss on the 1 3th century order of teutonic knights, who killed and enslaved the people they conquered.
it became a sacred center for the inner core of his elite ss knights.
himmler chose wewelsberg because he was told by his occult or spiritual advisor that this was going to be the magical strong point of german resistance
when one looks at the plans and memoranda and the miniature models that were laid out of how the wewelsberg would ultimately rebuild it, indeed, looks like the holy city in rome.
wewelsberg is built in the shape of a triangle, with three corner towers.
and in the middle of the well would have burned a kind of holy fire.
along the edges of the crypt were twelve pedestals, upon which would have stood urns waiting to contain the ashes of deceased generals.
what would happen is that the ss always had to have the thirteen leadership.
and consequently when an ss general died, he was ritually cremated.
king arthur gathered the twelve most chivalrous knights in a great hall.
ln himmler's version, he created the hall of ss supreme leaders, in a room above the crypt.
this radial pattern was made up of symbols from the ancient nordic alphabet.
himmler tried to create a replica of the grail chapel from the arthurian legend.
a mystical chalice, the grail was said to have contained sacred blood.
himmler saw the grail as an object of immense esoteric or occult power and he believed that if he possessed this physical object, that the war would be won with great ease.
rahn believed it was hidden in the caves of southern france.
himmler was drawn to rahn's knowledge of the occult and his lifelong pursuit of the grail.
himmler personally funded rahn's expeditions, several of which concentrated on the area around montsegur in southern france.
there stood the site of the great fortress of the cathars, the heretical sect accused of devil worship and wiped out by the church in the 1 3th century.
a letter on file from rahn to ss headquarters suggests that he believed he was close to realizing his lifelong dream.
to bring my work to a successful conclusion, i must personally inspect the sites.
many believe himmler issued orders to have rahn killed once it was clear his quest for the grail had failed.
two months later, he was found dead in the austrian alps.
this included secret societies such as the freemasons, who the nazi believed were an occult organization created by the jews to conspire against the germanic people.
while himmler suppressed certain occultists, he also advanced the careers of others, such as karl maria wiligut.
the mystic became a high-ranking ss officer, and one of himmler's prized possessions.
well, the interesting thing about wiligut is that he is really perhaps the leading example of an occultist
in the immediate circle and service of reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler.
wiligut believed he was a direct descendant of the norse god, thor.
copies of his papers found in himmler's personal file reveal that wiligut believed he possessed extrasensory powers.
one document entitled "the nine commandments of god, was signed by wiligut and initialed by himmler.
written in both modern german and the runic alphabet, it suggests that wiligut thought he was using his powers to rediscover the ancient rites and rituals of germany's pagan past.
according to nordic legend, the runic alphabet used by wiligut was given to mankind by odin,
the runes were derived from, probably from a mixture of ancient signs that were carved on stone in pre-literate times.
and these alphabets actually had meanings, each letter has a meaning.
these symbols appeared throughout the nordic world on such objects as viking ships, battle spears and shields.
the alphabets of ancient priests and magicians, runes were believed to be mystical tools for fortune telling, casting spells and invoking magical spirits.
it has got the reputation of being an extraordinarily powerful magical system.
as germany's warrior elite, members of the ss were taught the meaning of the runes.
a photograph that survived the war shows an ss officer at a blackboard teaching the runes to a class of ss recruits.
many organizations within the third reich had their own special rune.
the ss, perhaps the best known, of course used the double sig rune.
these mysterious figures were worn on the shoulders and helmets of all ss uniforms.
serving as a constant reminder to germans of their pagan past.
after the ss recruit had passed his training and taken the oath, if he was an officer, he was then given the ss dagger which was a sort of hunting knife with a black handle, the ss runes on it,
one picture we have, it shows a full tableau of such a sort of nazi or hitler shrine for the purpose of baptism of infants,
an ss altar in place of a crucifix a picture of hitler.
rings were exchanged, as well as bread and salt, the ancient pagan symbols for the fertility and purity of the soil.
these ritual activities would take place to imply the pagan community of which every ss man and his bride was now a part.
the nazi year was marked with celebrations taken from the ancient germanic calendar.
the maypole festival, initially accepted as a celebration of fertility, was transformed into a show of nationalism and military strength.
hitler said... "andsoit is that this day, the first of may, the land is filled with celebrations of the resurrection of the german people out of eternal inner strife."
people need festivals to mark the year, and they tried to substitute the pagan festivals for the christian festivals.
at externstein, during the summer solstice, a shaft of light shines through a window and lines up with a point on the altar.
while externstein was considered a holy place for germanic tribes, it is far from unique among ancient temples in tracking the sun's movements.
himmler was convinced, however, that it was proof of the superior intellect of prehistoric germanic priests.
ln nazi germany, the festival at the summer solstice will be turned into a fascist rite.
the winter solstice is not just the end of the year, but it is also the festival on which one thought of the ancestors and of the past.
on which the individual is clear that he is nothing, an atom to be wiped away at any time, while linked in the eternal chain of his lineage by a true humility.
there was singing going on and then suddenly it was announced that the fuhrer come, the fuhrer is coming.
and then you saw him walking up to the stage and there was shouting of...
by the winter of 1 942, however the tide turned, and the nazis began to experience what they thought was impossible... defeat.
as the nazi war effort grew more and more desperate, they expanded their use of the occult sciences, from research and ritual to a basis for making military decisions.
certain members of the german naval command became convinced that the allies were already employing mystical forces to wage war against germany.
they believed that the british successes at locating and destroying german u-boats had been achieved through occult means,
and that the best way to combat this was also by using the occult as a weapon.
this led himmler to establish a top-secret institute dedicated to the ancient occult practice of pendulum dowsing.
ln this letter written by himmler, dated january 1 2, 1 943, he refers to dowsing research and training having made great progress during the year.
still the most common occult arts employed by the nazis were astrology and prophecy, although they were approached in two distinctly different ways.
for goebbels, nostradamus was a perfect propaganda tool, whose work could be interpreted as predicting a great victory in germany's future.
nostradamus' prophecies are written in four line poems called quatrains and they're so dense and esoteric that you can interpret them in many different ways.
a particular quatrain that goebbels seized on seemed to refer directly to hitler, and quickly became part of the nazi leader's mystique.
there's a very famous quatrain which has got the word "hister" in it, which, you know, was everyone was bandying around was saying that that was hitler.
they made up a flier of the nostradamus prophecies and threw them all over france, that france would be destroyed if it did not capitulate.
british lntelligence discovered the deception, and, recognizing its propaganda potential, began to wage their own nostradamus campaign.
just as the nazis had flooded france with fake nostradamus prophecies, the allies smuggled their own black propaganda into germany.
the black propaganda campaign in england soon took a new turn with the arrival of hungarian-jewish emigre and astrologer,
now the purpose behind this forecast was to somehow plant in the minds of the germans the fact that the ss might now be disloyal to hitler.
but howe's master stroke came with a so-called special edition of der zenit, dated april, 1 943.
he cleverly waited until july to publish an april edition, thus seemingly being able to predict events he knew would come true.
and what howe and his colleagues did was to look at the sinking of german submarines, record the dates, and then in producing the april edition,
astrology and espionage would soon collide again in what is still considered by many to be the most bizarre incident of the second world war.
when rudolf hess, the deputy fuhrer and one of hitler's closest friends and advisers made an astonishing solo flight to scotland.
hess's idea to make the flight began with his belief that the british, a nordic race, would be made sympathetic to the aryan cause, and could even be persuaded to side with the germans if only churchill could be overthrown.
one of hess's mentors, karl haushofer, reinforced this idea by telling hess about a dream he had.
ln it, he saw hess walking through a scottish castle with tapestries hanging from the walls, bringing peace between germany and great britain.
ln addition to prophecy, astrology would also come to play a role in hess's decision to make the flight.
astrologer and close friend ernst schulte-strathaus, cast a horoscope for the deputy fuhrer that revealed an auspicious arrangement of the planets.
on may 1 0th, 1 941 , there was a particularly powerful astronomical lineup.
basically there were six planets in taurus and a full moon exactly on the opposite side of the zodiac in scorpio.
and, according to astrological tradition, when you get such a lineup you'll get a major shift in global affairs.
and therefore, it was fair to assume that may 1 0th, 1 941 , could provide the turning point in the war.
there has always been some doubt whether hess flew to scotland based upon astrological advice.
however recently discovered documents written by hess from prison in england include a letter to his mother.
ln it, he asked her to have two documents notarized, a record of karl haushofer's dream, and the horoscope cast by schulte-strathaus.
before hess made the flight, some believe he conferred with the fuhrer.
six days before my father flew, there was a discussion between hitler and my father which lasted four hours.
whatever words passed between hitler and hess, at 5:45 p. m. on may 1 0th, 1 941 ,
hess climbed into a messerschmidt fighter and set off for scotland.
his plan was to meet with the duke of hamilton, a man he had met through karl haushofer.
hess hoped to use the duke to bypass churchill and attempt to make peace directly with the king of england.
but the letters that he sent my father were, of course, all intercepted by the secret service.
instead of a greeting party, when hess entered british air space, he was shot down by the raf and forced to bail out.
he hurt himself getting out of the aircraft, certainly hurt himself on landing.
and he wanted to be captured and he thought that he could be taken straight to see my father, just by saying that he wished to see him.
hess was discovered by a scottish family, shown here on their farm where the plane crashed.
hess claimed to have a very important message for the duke of hamilton.
but at first they refused to believe that the man who had parachuted into their field was the deputy fuhrer of the third reich.
my father was told that a german pilot had landed and was asking to see the duke of hamilton.
my father went and saw the prisoner who introduced himself as hess.
it was quite amusing because my father went to see churchill, and was taken in to see the great man who was about to relax
and when my father said, "l think it could be the case."
he said, "well, hess or no hess, i'm still going to watch the marx brothers film."
he made a tremendous performance of surprise, shock, horror and everything else.
when it appeared that hess's mission had failed, of course, then all the propaganda came out that hess was a lone madman.
he did it on his own and he was a bit you know, a few cups short of a tea set.
hitler blamed the entire hess affair on the advice of hess's astrologers.
ln response, the nazi propaganda ministry issued an edict called "action hess"
that forbade the public practice of any occult sciences, including astrology.
the result was a further clamp down on the activities of astrologers who were eventually all rounded up in the aktion hess, a month after hess's flight.
they arrested all the prominent astrologers that they knew about and took them away for interrogation.
karl kraft, the man who provided goebbels with the powerful re-interpretations of nostradamus as well as strikingly accurate astrological predictions, would suffer the ultimate punishment, according to a former colleague.
eduard calic was a political prisoner who became friends with kraft during their time in a concentration camp together.
wulff then started casting horoscopes for general schellenberg who was head of counter-intelligence under himmler.
walter schellenberg was the chief of the political secret service which was part of the ss.
when schellenberg wanted to discuss some matter with himmler, he would explain that an astrologer had predicted this matter.
ln 1 943, wulff predicted that hitler would survive a great danger on the 20th of july, 1 944, that he would fall ill in november of 1 944, and die a mysterious death before the 7 th of may, 1 945.
when i was still in prison with schellenberg during the proceedings at nuremberg, we still talked about it, and schellenberg was very proud that, through wulff he could influence himmler.
according to schellenberg's interrogation, during the final weeks of the war,
himmler became obsessed with the astrology of a coup, when the stars suggested he might successfully overthrow the fuhrer.
it was late april, 1 945, when the soviet troops were already encircling berlin, already entering the outskirts of berlin, so the war was pretty well lost.
both schellenberg and himmler tried to curry favor with the allies.
and intriguingly in the last days of the war, a meeting between himmler and a representative of the world jewish congress, to which wulff as himmler's astrologer was present.
wulff was instrumental in convincing himmler to temporarily stop the killing.
having taken this action, it appeared that himmler was ready to launch his coup.
but ultimately, his fear and loyalty to the fuhrer prevented him from seizing power.
himmler remained hopeful that some mystical force of destiny would alter the defeat that was clearly at hand.
himmler was also very interested in historical parallels between the situation in the mid-forties and previous-historical periods.
himmler looked back to the previous great german war with russia,
sevens year war fought between frederick the great of prussia and the russians.
fortunes have said to have turned then when the russian czarina elizabeth died.
he was arrested by the british, but during a physical examination, crushed a cyanide capsule he kept in his mouth.
at 1 1 :04 p. m. , on the 23rd of may, the reichsfuhrer who had summoned occult forces in the service of aryan glory was dead.
adolph hitler attempted to build a sinister new world order led by a so-called race of aryan supermen spreading a reign of terror unlike any the world had ever known
many believe the nazis conjured strange spirits and followed occult practices that had lain dormant in europe for thousands of years
now, documents prove that their beliefs were based on a perversion of ancient pagan lore a twisting of mythic battles between forces of light and darkness and a terrifying journey into a world ruled by mystics madmen and murderers
the himalayas of tibet ln the 1 930's, the nazis began searching the top of the world
for evidence of ancient high priests who they believed were their blood ancestors
the nazi belief in these ancestors was to form the foundation of germany's new religion a religion with adolph hitler as its high priest
lnspiring hitler's evil crusade was a belief that pure aryan blood was being contaminated by so-called inferior races and that once rid of foreign elements a new race of aryan supermen would rule the world
this was the nazi interpretation of ancient myths and occult lore dating back thousands of years
his inner circle, who had strong ties to the occult would help him to accomplish this goal
among them were deputy fuhrer rudolf hess whose correspondence reveals a devotion to astrology and forecasting by the stars
head of the ss and the nazi death camps whose personal papers revealed that he was the master occultist of the third reich and, ultimately, the architect of the new nazi religion.
at the foundation of this new religion was an ancient occult legend that tells the story of a continent somewhere in the north atlantic.
there lived a race of super beings who had fallen from grace through evil and vice.
a great flood wiped these beings off the face of the earth.
but before they could all be destroyed, certain priests escaped by boat, eventually finding their way to india and the high peaks of tibet.
these escaped priests, believed by mystics to be the original race of aryan godmen, were said to be the ancestors of all indian and european people.
he said... "himmlermentioned his belief that the nordic race did not evolve but came directly down from heaven to settle on the atlantic continent, and that ancient immigrants from atlantis had founded a great civilization in central asia."
although he was a very rational calculating power broker, he was also a romantic idealist and he certainly believed in these myths.
otherwise he wouldn't have spent the money and the time and the energy he did sending expeditions to tibet.
ln tibet, villages were subjected to full body inspections by nazi researchers, looking for what the party called "aryan physical traits"
the nazis will begin killing people and using their bodies for experiments.
they believed that once they had proven that their ancestors were gods, it would be a simple step to recreate this race of aryan godmen through selective breeding.
the ss had been generally rather tall, well made men warriors.
now this, himmler did decree this for the ss in so much as they should all be five foot nine inches tall.
now for the officers, they had to prove pure german ancestry without interbreeding back to 1 7 50.
himmler's ss, at one point three million strong, were encouraged to father as many children as possible, regardless of their marital status.
"the ss," he told them "had a sacred duty to their nation and to their fuhrer to beget healthy aryan babies."
one of himmler's ideas concerned polygamy, the only way in which he could breed the master race of it faster was by, in fact, instituting the practice whereby ss men would be able to take more than one wife.
ln 1 935, himmler created the ss lebensborn program, meaning "fountain of life."
lebensborn was designed to facilitate the birth, housing and raising of as many pure aryan babies as possible.
he suggested that young aryan girls in germany who hadn't been able to find a boyfriend or a husband need not forego the pleasures of motherhood.
according to lebensborn doctrine, an illegitimate child was no disgrace, as long as the mother was genetically fit.
during the war, children with aryan appearance were abducted from conquered nations, and sent to lebensborn homes in germany.
nazi records indicate that two hundred thousand polish babies alone were kidnapped and placed in lebensborn homes, where they received careful training in every aspect of nazi culture and mythology.
long before hitler came to power, these beliefs were flourishing against an already racist backdrop.
there were many organizations in germany and austria around the turn of the century, which blended racist ideology with occult practices.
but their ideas became popular only at the conclusion of world war i.
the once-mighty empire of germany had been disarmed and at the mercy of the victorious nations after the first world war.
ln formerly wealthy cities, disabled veterans haunted the streets, like ghosts from another lifetime.
somebody who grew up in berlin in the twenties remembers anything, he remembers the urban landscape with cripples from the first world war who, of course, had no pension no nothing, who begged on the streets without legs and arms,
he infiltrated an organization that was a backroom political club called the german worker's party.
but far from being the communist organization that its name implied, the party turned out to be extremely right wing.
hitler liked what he heard, joined and eventually became leader of the organization.
attending an early rally where hitler spoke was a disillusioned war veteran named rudolf hess.
and he came back taking three steps by one, jumping up and said, "hey i saw one this evening.
he's going to bring back germany to the recommendation it had before the war and this is the only man who is able to do it."
hess was a supporter of one of the more prominent groups, the thule society, which actively sought a germanic messiah,
and was dedicated to the revival of the so-called aryan master race.
with a membership that included some of munich's richest and most powerful citizens, the society financed hitler's german worker's party.
ln 1 920, hitler's party officially changed its name to the german national socialist worker's party, the nsdap or, as it would soon become known, the nazi party.
with hitler as its leader, the nazi party grew quickly, sweeping people up in a frenzy of fear-mongering and fiery oratory.
he gave them the strong charismatic leader they'd yearned for since the war.
he would have easily found these ideas in popular publications such as ostara, an overtly racist occult magazine written by a renegade and ultimately defrocked monk and mystic named lanz von liebenfels.
ostara magazine was a good example of how hitler would have picked up his racism and his anti-semitism.
he even paid a visit to lanz's editorial office to obtain back numbers.
lmmensely popular at the time, the journal preached that the nordic or aryan races had much to fear from people darker than themselves, and targeted jews as the most threatening.
he saw blood, particularly in a religious sense as the determining factor.
ln other words, a church had to be a church of the blood rather than a church of faith or a church of belief.
rosenberg preached that the blood of a people carried the soul of the race.
i think, if you look back down the esoteric traditions of the west, you find that blood has always been considered as a very important vehicle of the spirit.
it is a sacred substance that contains more than the physical life of each person, but also the spiritual life.
nordic myth replaced the christian bible as the foundation of the new nazi religion.
ln a pageant orchestrated by rosenberg and captured on film, the nazis celebrated their newly-conceived version of aryan culture and history.
rosenberg wrote... "todaya newmythos is dawning, the mythos of the blood.
we will wash off the christian veneer and bring out a religion peculiar to our race."
as a symbol for the new religion hitler chose the swastika.
the swastika can be found all over the world in many different cultures throughout history.
from earliest times, it was the symbol of good luck in china, and to this day, it remains a religious emblem in the hindu and buddhist faiths.
thor was the god of thunder and power and so on, a very macho patriarchal kind of god.
among the norsemen, the swastika was a reminder of the arctic sun, worshipped throughout pagan lore as a bearer of life and good fortune.
adolph hitler was only twelve years old when he saw his first wagner opera.
as an adult, he became an obsessive devotee of the composer.
richard wagner was the most singularly admired person in adolph hitler's life and career ever.
wagner's genius for pageantry became an inspiration for the grandiose rallies hitler would soon stage,
wagner's opera parsifal, which glorifies the power of pure blood, was a source of inspiration to hitler.
it is an epic retelling of the quest for the holy grail.
according to legend, the grail was a mystical vessel bearing sacred blood, and it promised unlimited powers to anyone who drank from it.
it was believed the grail could only be found by the purest of knights.
and this idea of a christian grail knight seeking the mythos of pure blood is central to both wagner and hitler's own conception of what nazi racism was doing in this supernatural sense.
ln 1 938, hitler commissioned this portrait of himself dressed as a knight.
hitler's bid for power began on november 9th, 1 923, with an attempted overthrow of the bavarian government.
leading a private army called storm troopers, he launched a surprise attack on a beer hall where government leaders were meeting.
it was a failed coup, but in the ten years before hitler seized power, the sixteen would become martyrs.
at that time they were carrying a swastika flag and this sort of fell with the people and the blood of the dead got upon it.
and a ritual arose whereby every new nazi flag and banner was not empowered until hitler had touched the flag against this flag.
nazi blood attained a sacred symbolic power, ritualized and sanctified in the ceremony known as
ln 1 933, hitler succeeded in becoming "the fuhrer," the leader.
... atitlewhichwouldcome to resonate with religious connotations of "the anointed one,
propaganda minister goebbels orchestrated a ritual in which the sixteen nazi heroes were honored as martyrs of the reich who died were resurrected, then achieved eternal life.
goebbels assured that all germans would partake in the ceremony by broadcasting it over loud speakers placed on street corners throughout the country.
they fight, die and are victorious, just as the third reich was founded."
according to hitler, their blood was the holy water of the third reich.
i suppose most movements they have their martyrs and those who died in 1 923 they too,
they were considered to be martyrs and they were an example how you should stand firm and defend for what you believe in so there was that religious undertone.
the first martyrs of the reich became known as the "sixteen lmmortals."
ln munich, the ritual began with a funeral march down the very streets where the immortals fell.
at the front of the procession they carried the blood flag.
along the route, hung huge red flags bearing slanted germanic runes, the ritual symbol of sacrifice from pagan lore.
during this annual ceremony, the names of the sixteen were called out, with anonymous voices answering the hero's roll call, as if the dead marched in spirit with the living.
and when i was about sixteen seventeen, my father took me to munich, and i went to this feldenhalle and there the coffins were all lined up
and there were guards standing presenting their rifles and steel helmets, and it was all rather eerie.
and so at many intervals their names were mentioned and they said. .
ln 1 933, the party took over all germany's youth organizations.
for girls, the compulsory organization was the league of german maids, where they were taught self-sacrifice to marry young, and that their bodies belonged to the nation.
ten year old boys became members of the organization of young german people.
at fourteen they joined the hitler youth, and at eighteen, the nazi party.
a euthanasia program was instituted for the mentally and physically impaired.
propaganda films claimed these were acts of kindness, freeing trapped souls from tormented bodies.
"the gravest and most ruthless decisions will have to be made.
a barbaric measure for the unfortunate who is struck by it, but a blessing for his fellow man and posterity.
the passing pain of a century can and will redeem millenniums from sufferings."
the idea that the few should be scarified for the good of the many extended even to hitler's sa, the storm troopers
eventually the sa, who were among hitler's first supporters, became an obstacle, one that he had no qualms about removing.
without the sa, he probably, he would not have come to power because people were afraid of the sa.
the middle class and the army came to fear the sa.
to the army, the ss was a more acceptable organization, like themselves, the members of the ss were from the german upper class.
the sa had a congress in vichy, not far from munich and they were all in bed at night when hitler and the ss moved.
the sa leadership was rounded up and executed so quickly, so ruthlessly, many never knew why.
he planned to turn the ss into germany's new aristocracy, the "new supermen" prophesied by hitler's religion of the blood.
himmler's conception of the ss was no less than the creation of a new blood stock elite for the nazi order in europe.
at every stage, the ss was constantly reminded that it was no less than a warrior elite whose values of hardness and military valor were absolutely central to its existence.
and more than that, that they were in fact, ensuring the survival of the race in this way.
himmler was born a catholic, but by the time he met hitler, he was already a confirmed occultist.
it's difficult for us afterwards to equate this man who certainly believed in a god and to,
to link him up with a man who was master of the killing machine in germany.
but actually, the two things of course, are linked because what he was trying to do was to rout out the forces
which he believed had corrupted germany and get back to their pure-blooded forefathers.
himmler brought a range of unlikely influences to his design for the ss, including the hindu religion.
during the war, he reportedly traveled with a copy of the bhagavad gita, a holy book from the hindu religion.
it tells the story of a great battle on the field of righteousness between the forces of good and evil.
the hindu belief in reincarnation and its rigid caste system appealed to himmler.
it was a perfect model for a nazi warrior elite which would rule the world.
himmler believed he was on the path to realizing his karmic destiny:
that his ss had returned to the fatherland to fight a similar holy war.
on the night of july 1 , 1 937, to mark the millennium anniversary of king heinrich's death,
himmler staged a sacred reburial rite at quedlinburg cathedral, the original location of the great king's castle and the site of his tomb.
he eulogized the man he believed he had been in a past life.
as the sarcophagus was sealed, he pledged to fulfill the king's mission of conquering the lands to germany's east.
the reichsfuhrer ss attempted to reinstate the feudal system that the knights had lived by.
as new lands were conquered, each ss officer was to take possession of a feudal estate.
himmler transformed a series of ancient castles into ss training schools that were both military and religious centers.
here, recruits were initiated into the ways of so-called warrior priests.
himmler chose wewelsberg because he was told by his occult or spiritual advisor that this was going to be the magical strong point of german resistance
to a great army from the east, and there would be a great battle there and the eastern hoards would be turned back.
to assure an ample supply of slave labor, he built a concentration camp nearby.
from 1 939 to 1 945, four thousand prisoners worked on himmler's castle.
along the edges of the crypt were twelve pedestals, upon which would have stood urns waiting to contain the ashes of deceased generals.
what would happen is that the ss always had to have the thirteen leadership.
and consequently when an ss general died, he was ritually cremated.
his ashes were placed and then he, his place was taken by a new general.
himmler tried to create a replica of the grail chapel from the arthurian legend.
a mystical chalice, the grail was said to have contained sacred blood.
himmler saw the grail as an object of immense esoteric or occult power and he believed that if he possessed this physical object, that the war would be won with great ease.
to himmler, the sacred blood of the grail legend was pure aryan blood.
rahn would continue his quest for the holy grail, only now as a knight of the nazi party.
himmler personally funded rahn's expeditions, several of which concentrated on the area around montsegur in southern france.
there stood the site of the great fortress of the cathars, the heretical sect accused of devil worship and wiped out by the church in the 1 3th century.
and there was a very strong tradition as indeed there still is, that the cathars had possessed the secret of the grail and that just before the castle of montsegur fell, the three knights of the cathar order escaped over the walls
to bring my work to a successful conclusion, i must personally inspect the sites.
first, i have to go to the wildenberg ruins, the german castle of the holy grail.
himmler confiscated the libraries and artifacts of any occult society that was not associated with him.
this included secret societies such as the freemasons, who the nazi believed were an occult organization created by the jews to conspire against the germanic people.
himmler believed he'd found the key to popularizing the ancient pagan tradition in modern germany.
the mystic became a high-ranking ss officer, and one of himmler's prized possessions.
well, the interesting thing about wiligut is that he is really perhaps the leading example of an occultist
in the immediate circle and service of reichsfuhrer ss heinrich himmler.
wiligut believed he was a direct descendant of the norse god, thor.
copies of his papers found in himmler's personal file reveal that wiligut believed he possessed extrasensory powers.
one document entitled "the nine commandments of god, was signed by wiligut and initialed by himmler.
written in both modern german and the runic alphabet, it suggests that wiligut thought he was using his powers to rediscover the ancient rites and rituals of germany's pagan past.
you throw them and then you read the particular combinations of runes that arise.
it has got the reputation of being an extraordinarily powerful magical system.
as germany's warrior elite, members of the ss were taught the meaning of the runes.
a photograph that survived the war shows an ss officer at a blackboard teaching the runes to a class of ss recruits.
many organizations within the third reich had their own special rune.
the ss, perhaps the best known, of course used the double sig rune.
an ss altar in place of a crucifix a picture of hitler.
and the babe would have been presented, if you like, into the community of germanic warriors through this kind of tableau.
this rare footage shows one of his ss officers marrying gretal, the sister of hitler's mistress eva braun.
rings were exchanged, as well as bread and salt, the ancient pagan symbols for the fertility and purity of the soil.
these ritual activities would take place to imply the pagan community of which every ss man and his bride was now a part.
the nazi year was marked with celebrations taken from the ancient germanic calendar.
the maypole festival, initially accepted as a celebration of fertility, was transformed into a show of nationalism and military strength.
hitler said... "andsoit is that this day, the first of may, the land is filled with celebrations of the resurrection of the german people out of eternal inner strife."
people need festivals to mark the year, and they tried to substitute the pagan festivals for the christian festivals.
they began to annex the festivals which the pagans had celebrated:
nazis even began to restore ancient pagan temples, like externstein, which was dedicated to a solar deity.
at externstein, during the summer solstice, a shaft of light shines through a window and lines up with a point on the altar.
while externstein was considered a holy place for germanic tribes, it is far from unique among ancient temples in tracking the sun's movements.
himmler was convinced, however, that it was proof of the superior intellect of prehistoric germanic priests.
summer solstice festivals were a celebration of life and of the sun's powers.
dramatically staged and carefully choreographed, speeches were given preaching self-sacrifice and heroism.
ln the largest of these rituals, torch-bearing troops created symbolic patterns in the night.
at the end of the year, the long night of the winter solstice honored germany's dead.
on which the individual is clear that he is nothing, an atom to be wiped away at any time, while linked in the eternal chain of his lineage by a true humility.
the full calendar of rituals culminated with the rally at nuremberg, where the vows between party and people were renewed year after year.
all the uniforms and there was an electric atmosphere already before it all started.
there was singing going on and then suddenly it was announced that the fuhrer come, the fuhrer is coming.
from the onset of the war in 1 939, country after country fell to the nazis.
by the winter of 1 942, however the tide turned, and the nazis began to experience what they thought was impossible... defeat.
as the nazi war effort grew more and more desperate, they expanded their use of the occult sciences, from research and ritual to a basis for making military decisions.
certain members of the german naval command became convinced that the allies were already employing mystical forces to wage war against germany.
they believed that the british successes at locating and destroying german y-boats had been achieved through occult means,
and that the best way to combat this was also by using the occult as a weapon.
this led himmler to establish a top-secret institute dedicated to the ancient occult practice of pendulum dowsing.
over maps of the north atlantic, clairvoyants would swing an object suspended from a string, attempting to locate the position of allied convoys.
still the most common occult arts employed by the nazis were astrology and prophecy, although they were approached in two distinctly different ways.
rudolf hess and heinrich himmler genuinely believed in the occult, and used it for making political decisions.
the book contains subtle references to a crisis in britain and poland in the year 1 939, the year nazi germany invaded poland, nearly four hundred years after nostradamus wrote his book.
for goebbels, nostradamus was a perfect propaganda tool, whose work could be interpreted as predicting a great victory in germany's future.
there's a very famous quatrain which has got the word "hister" in it, which, you know, was everyone was bandying around was saying that that was hitler.
ln goebbels' diary, he expressed his excitement when bernt, a member of his staff, began to formulate a plan to use the prophecy.
the americans and english fall easily to this kind of propaganda.
we are therefore pressing into service all star witnesses of occult prophecy.
they produced a volume of fifty fake nostradamus prophecies which forecast british victory on the war.
just as the nazis had flooded france with fake nostradamus prophecies, the allies smuggled their own black propaganda into germany.
but howe's master stroke came with a so-called special edition of der zenit, dated april, 1 943.
he cleverly waited until july to publish an april edition, thus seemingly being able to predict events he knew would come true.
they incorrectly titled the magazine der zenit, instead of the actual title, zenit.
astrology and espionage would soon collide again in what is still considered by many to be the most bizarre incident of the second world war.
when rudolf hess, the deputy fuhrer and one of hitler's closest friends and advisers made an astonishing solo flight to scotland.
hess's idea to make the flight began with his belief that the british, a nordic race, would be made sympathetic to the aryan cause, and could even be persuaded to side with the germans if only churchill could be overthrown.
one of hess's mentors, karl haushofer, reinforced this idea by telling hess about a dream he had.
ln it, he saw hess walking through a scottish castle with tapestries hanging from the walls, bringing peace between germany and great britain.
ln addition to prophecy, astrology would also come to play a role in hess's decision to make the flight.
rudolf hess, along with himmler was probably the nazi, the leading nazi, most interested in astrology.
on may 1 0th, 1 941 , there was a particularly powerful astronomical lineup.
basically there were six planets in taurus and a full moon exactly on the opposite side of the zodiac in scorpio.
and, according to astrological tradition, when you get such a lineup you'll get a major shift in global affairs.
and therefore, it was fair to assume that may 1 0th, 1 941 , could provide the turning point in the war.
there has always been some doubt whether hess flew to scotland based upon astrological advice.
however recently discovered documents written by hess from prison in england include a letter to his mother.
ln it, he asked her to have two documents notarized, a record of karl haushofer's dream, and the horoscope cast by schulte-strathaus.
before hess made the flight, some believe he conferred with the fuhrer.
one knows that when the four hours were over, my father and hitler came from the room, and hitler had his arm around the shoulder of my father and said,
"hess, you have been always and still are a very stubborn chap."
hess climbed into a messerschmidt fighter and set off for scotland.
his plan was to meet with the duke of hamilton, a man he had met through karl haushofer.
hess hoped to use the duke to bypass churchill and attempt to make peace directly with the king of england.
having written the duke several letters in advance of his mission,
instead of a greeting party, when hess entered british air space, he was shot down by the raf and forced to bail out.
he hurt himself getting out of the aircraft, certainly hurt himself on landing.
and he wanted to be captured and he thought that he could be taken straight to see my father, just by saying that he wished to see him.
hess was discovered by a scottish family, shown here on their farm where the plane crashed.
hess claimed to have a very important message for the duke of hamilton.
but at first they refused to believe that the man who had parachuted into their field was the deputy fuhrer of the third reich.
my father was told that a german pilot had landed and was asking to see the duke of hamilton.
my father went and saw the prisoner who introduced himself as hess.
"do you mean to tell me that the deputy fuhrer is in our hands?"
and when my father said, "l think it could be the case."
well, hitler's reaction to hess's flight was one of his major acting performances.
he made a tremendous performance of surprise, shock, horror and everything else.
when it appeared that hess's mission had failed, of course, then all the propaganda came out that hess was a lone madman.
he did it on his own and he was a bit you know, a few cups short of a tea set.
hitler blamed the entire hess affair on the advice of hess's astrologers.
ln response, the nazi propaganda ministry issued an edict called "action hess"
that forbade the public practice of any occult sciences, including astrology.
the result was a further clamp down on the activities of astrologers who were eventually all rounded up in the aktion hess, a month after hess's flight.
they arrested all the prominent astrologers that they knew about and took them away for interrogation.
karl kraft, the man who provided goebbels with the powerful re-interpretations of nostradamus as well as strikingly accurate astrological predictions, would suffer the ultimate punishment, according to a former colleague.
eduard calic was a political prisoner who became friends with kraft during their time in a concentration camp together.
he said, "eduard, you will survive but they will kill me because i know too many secrets."
the astrologers who were arrested under the action hess were treated in different ways depending on their use to the reich.
those already working for himmler were released immediately and allowed to continue their work.
schellenberg did not believe in astrology, but he made use of it.
when schellenberg wanted to discuss some matter with himmler, he would explain that an astrologer had predicted this matter.
he believed that wulff's influence would carry great weight with himmler.
when i was still in prison with schellenberg during the proceedings at nuremberg, we still talked about it, and schellenberg was very proud that, through wulff he could influence himmler.
according to schellenberg's interrogation, during the final weeks of the war,
himmler became obsessed with the astrology of a coup, when the stars suggested he might successfully overthrow the fuhrer.
it was late april, 1 945, when the soviet troops were already encircling berlin, already entering the outskirts of berlin, so the war was pretty well lost.
himmler remembered a conversation he'd had earlier with wulff in which wulff told him that it looked as if there would be disaster for germany until 1 945.
wulff and schellenberg continued to urge himmler to overthrow hitler and install himself as the leader of the waning reich.
both schellenberg and himmler tried to curry favor with the allies.
and intriguingly in the last days of the war, a meeting between himmler and a representative of the world jewish congress, to which wulff as himmler's astrologer was present.
himmler apparently agreed that there should be no more exterminations of jews.
having taken this action, it appeared that himmler was ready to launch his coup.
but ultimately, his fear and loyalty to the fuhrer prevented him from seizing power.
himmler remained hopeful that some mystical force of destiny would alter the defeat that was clearly at hand.
himmler was also very interested in historical parallels between the situation in the mid-forties and previous-historical periods.
himmler looked back to the previous great german war with russia,
sevens year war fought between frederick the great of prussia and the russians.
and himmler took this as a sign that history was about to repeat itself and germany was going to be saved.
two weeks later, goebbels and his entire family descended with adolph hitler into the fuhrer's private bunker.
at 1 1 :04 p. m. , on the 23rd of may, the reichsfuhrer who had summoned occult forces in the service of aryan glory was dead.
ln november, 1 945, several top nazis were brought to trial by the allies at nuremberg.
occultist alfred rosenberg was found guilty of crimes against humanity and hanged in october, 1 946.
the third reich, which was to have lasted over a thousand years, ended after only twelve.

we think that he conspired with peggy blane... to kill his brother for the insurance money.
jake impersonated his brother, and by marrying peggy... he took the suspicion off himself.
there was no motive for the crime because peggy got the money.

or at least someone in a red wig who looked just like you.

- get your nose to whistle "take a moment," make your feet squeak.
my client needs somebody to pull a rabbit out of a hat.
they think you're finding blame which defeats the purpose of no-fault.
but if you could get the judge to see the lawsuit as an alternative to castration, he may be more agreeable.
that doesn't change when you've slept with one of the lawyers.
under that robe, besides a great body, is a good judge.
the thing about hope, many people wish that moment never presents itself.
because if it does, well, there's a chance the hope could be dashed.
i knew a man who was secretly in love with a woman who was his best friend.
but he never dared tell her, for fear she wouldn't return his feelings.
you're not the judge anymore but there's a few things i'd like to put on record.
first, i realize when people who love each other part no court of law can fix it.

chan ho-nam, you can tell obviously that your fellows are making troubles
paul, simon, as being professional lawyers, can you tell me who is right and who is wrong?
actually, i can get any creep here and check his i.d. card,
i have reason to suspect him as being a triad member
i just want to go straight, and i don't want to do anything with the triads again
but you should get triad's cover to sell newspaper in street
tell me, can a triad collect protection fee from the hk bank?
i don't think i can't make a living without sticking to triads
we would like the chairman of our club to hand over the cheque
mr. chiang, i can't imagine a club can do charity deed like this
that's why i talked to lam and got a very good idea, that is to bid a new mini-bus route from central to jordan
you know, when the new airport is used, the terminal in jordan will be prosperous
at first, we said we would join together to run the route, but he isn't the one to figure this plan out
lam and i would like to bid a new route, from kwai chung to jordan and then to western district,
do you think the staffs of the bank will collect it?
let me tell you an incident happened 2 months ago in taiwan,
call plane, bat and choi for me, ask them to pay my debt
i am in need of cash, if they don't pay back, all of us will be starved to death!
after a meeting, the directors agreed to grant you this table
you'll run it, but the company will share 30% of your net profit
tung sing's decided to let ho yung join the race, he will get the golden belt for us
about the hung hing representative, i don't think you'll have guts
ho nam, i can tell from your face that you dislike him
mr. chan, if you want to invite him here again, please tell me first
do you want to spend your new year holidays in the cells?
alright, i would leave my family alone... and play with you!
thanks to brother ho nam, he is a good coach to me
brother nam, our places are messed up by the tung sing boys
all my friends in seminary envied me... but big religion and big money was the last thing i wanted.
but my father's influence in the church quickly squelched all that... and landed me in boston.
i suppose this was his way of getting even with me... for becoming a priest.
a rich parish obligated me to remain close enough to the upper crust... so that i would never loose my way back home when the time came.
i think all of you know my husband well enough... to know that... if humility were a cup of tea, his cup would runneth over.
so, i would like to take this opportunity to do brag for him... and to tell you about... his appointment to president roosevelt's foreign finance committee.
eleanor meticulously prepared... to exercise the ultimate privilege... of being her own person.
contemplative, focused... and quietly confident with her decision... she knew in her heart that she was ready.
i come to this firm in good faith... seeking respectable employment... and you insult me with this sordid scheme of fornication.
if that's how it sounds my presentation has not been effective.
it's not your presentation that needs examination... it is the virtue of your mission.
my mission is to help my oldest and dearest friend... in an intensely important and delicate situation.
then he is either a very strong man or a very stupid one.
there are some thing in life which are better left undone... no matter what the cost.
- i knew i would botch it... and we're not even at the hard part yet.
i did so want everything to go well, i thought i might be good at this...
for though she understood those ramifications... it was suddenly clear to her that roger martin did not.
she felt she could bear risking her own soul... to have a child this way... but now another person's spirituality was involved.
shrouding this event in business was supposed... to relieve such danger... but roger martin professed love.
she closed her eyes and tried not to think about it... but even in darkness... one thing was as clear eleanor as the light of day... she now felt responsible for roger's unrequited love.
- then, i can only assume... since you are a bright man with a promising future in the church... that for the past 4 months you've not been trying to dodge them... but rather you've been engaged in one life or death situation... after another and have had no choice but to cancel.
fortunately, mr. barret is a patient man... and has now asked if they can adjust their schedule to yours.
the barret estate was magnificent... but it could not compete with my father's house.
mr. and mrs. barret this has been a really wonderful evening... thank you so much for sharing your home with me.
i agree that long range investment will never be the same.
americans want to take their profits quickly... they'll never stay in for the long haul.
so then it makes sense that large sums of american investment money... have found their way to germany.
every instinct should have told me leave well enough alone... but alas, foolish pride won out.
you appear to be an astute student of the investment game, father.
if i may be so bold, where do you get your information?
i haven't been able to see her or talk to her.
i think at the least i deserve to see the mother of my own child.
i am in no state of mind now to deal with your motives... or those of my brother, who obviously sent you here.
but i will expect a full explanation from you when next we meet.
i can never forget a face that i've put into one of these graves... but i find i can easily forget those.
makes me wonder if our lord has a selective memory also?
i believe whatever happened to our marriage... and to roger martin, was probably my fault to begin with.
it did not occur to arthur that he should try to relieve her guilt... or offer to share the blame nor did it occur to eleanor... that she had just committed the same mistake as all women... since the beginning of time.
she had not only forgiven a man his ways... but had taken responsibility for them as well.
she closed her eyes and said goodbye to her female god.
i thought you should know in the event that he mentioned it to you.
forgive me, father michael, for what i am about to say.
send him my apologies and tell him we have to postpone.
syril sat by the window in darkness all night... watching the elements, considering their source.
how's he going to feel when you lay his hand on his head at communion?
please, don't blame me for trying to protect him from that.
i compromised my judgment when i came to boston... and threw away my conscience that night in your house.
i will face the consequences with my god... but please, eleanor, don't have me sent away.
i said there would be no negotiation... but if i may, i should like to make a bargain with you.
oh god, whose goodness is always to have mercy... and to spare... we humbly beseech thee, that the soul of thy servant, eleanor... whom thou hast this day commanded to depart this world...
although the paths of our lives may turn unexpectedly... and end all too soon...
i can only believe that the journey is never in vain and... perhaps it is this very journey... which gives life hope and meaning.
i can't start the day without some dribbling' fat, can i?
eh, speaking' of which, i can call sadie on me new instrument.
this is me crappaty home, and this is how i am, ray.
no gracey airs, and if you don't like it, you can piss off out of it.
and let me rustle up one of ray say's famous breakfassays.
i do 'em for all me artists... when we're on foreign engagements, you know.
as you know, boo braves anything, goes anywhere in his perpetual quest... for fresh talent to spice up your midweek merriment here.
and guess which exotic part of the world i came across tonight's star turn?
she could've made an effort and done some spice girls or something, for christ's sake!
i told you you was wasting your time on the little slit!
i had me doubts about her doin' again at first, but, well, he won me over.
try as i do, i cannot say no to that man.
we haven't had a band in here this big since ve day.
in fact, now that i look at 'em, it's the same band.
♪ sing as we go although the skies are gray ♪
♪ beggar or king you've got to sing a gay tune ♪
- just remember where you got your start... my crap-house, and you know what they say,
"shouldn't shit on folk on way up, 'cause you're bound to meet 'em on way down."
i bet that judy garland never went on stage in her bloody pajamas, so i don't know why she wants to.
oh, come on, lv, love, whatever it is that's buggin' ya, just let it stop, eh?
just for a few hours, 'cause, look, we're cutting things a bit fine now.
ray'll be here in a minute and your mum's getting just a little bit fucking irate, all right?
so please give a big mr. boo welcome... to brenda bailey and her farmyard frolics.
two things... that's all you had to do... get the dress and have her ready.
you drove him as fast as you could to an early grave!
with your men and your shouting... and your pals and your nights... and your nights and your nights... and your nights and your nights and your nights... of neglect!

a little girl that's big... a northern light... a rising star...

these people are out of control! your attention, please! i am extremely sorry to disturb you! i am meryl stryfe from the bernardelli insurance society! the man you are after, vash the stampede... ...is a dangerous man! in order to protect your precious lives and possessions... message from mission control! temporarily suspend all pursuit of vash! everybody proceed to base! suspend temporarily?
chairman, perhaps we should stop this while the city is still standing! that goes without saying! where is the man in charge? who are you people?
! let me see the man in charge! how could you commit such an outrage?
! you couldn't take down the humanoid typhoon... ...no matter how many thousands of people you set on him! yes, the risk is very high... ...but we really need that $ $60,000,000,000! it's for the plant, isn't it? that's right.
over half of the plant is unusable... ...due to a support system bug.
move it, now! damned ignorant drivers! let me borrow that! what are you doing here?
! both of you are supposed to be locked away for 700 years! shut yer trap! we released ourselves for good behavior yesterday! th-that's called a jailbreak! too bad, i was getting quite fond of the quiet life, too! but who can lie idle knowing that $ $60 billion is there for the taking? right, gofsef? the nebraska family... ...felons of over 150 class a offenses... hey! don't tell me you plan to sic that big man on him.
that's right, we don't want them to see this! but we desperately need money! i have a son lying sick at home.
but the doctor took off and abandoned this dying city! there's no one left in this city i can take him to! that's why, i...
everybody, down! over there... ma'am! vash the stampede is over there! bingo! it was so easy!
too easy! are you sunk after only one shot? that's funny!
that's so funny! where is vash the stampede? what the...? that's him.
the devil's helper... ... who reduced one of the great cities to ashes! the legendary outlaw, vash the stampede... ... is just over there.
th... that... that can't be! now that's more like it! hey...
why is everybody getting the wrong idea? that can't be him! vash the stampede is a horrible fiend.
if you get in his way, he can destroy cities... ... and get out of the worst situations imaginable! even if it hails bullets on him...
even if he is against 1,000 men... ... he will emerge without a scratch.
! aw, you're doing just fine! i was hoping you'd ditch the woman and save your own skin! mr. vash isn't that sort of a person! come to think of it... so you won't kill, no matter what? you're disgusting! however, that makes you a hypocrite! i know at some point you've killed those who gave you a hard time.
how do i know? because you haven't yet had your turn to be killed! the $ $60,000,000,000 reward on your head is proof! what do you say to that?
! vash the stampede! why won't he say anything? why is he taking that kind of abuse?
! so you're finally ready to fight! oh, you wanna draw? it's pointless, no matter what calibre pistol you use! you can't stop a car ramming at 120 lies an hour! you've felt it twice already!
even your measly brain can realize... ...that my son's fist is a force to be reckoned with! this is your last chance to run!
although, no matter how fast you run... ...the next thing you know, you'll be in tiny pieces! now pay attention, for i am about to lecture you... ...on just how much of a fool you really are! using this! my human mincemeat special course! go help them, quick! and then die in the most humiliating way! no way! he changed its course! that was great! he veered off my son's fist with six bullets! not quite.
our report, our report! uh? report. 4 months and 12 days after receiving our orders... ...we achieved contact with our target, vash... ...contact with our target, vash the... ...the... no!
this can't be real! now, everybody join along! love peace! the longer one holds onto a memory... ...the longer one lives in the past.
the deeper the memory they hold onto is... ...the more beautiful the past will become.
the beautified memories will eventually turn into hate... even if they look ahead, they lose the ability to walk.
if you're going to name him joey, you should name him chandler.
chandler's funny, sophisticated, and very lovable once you get to know him.
just imagine for a moment that susan meets someone, and they hit it off.
they're coming back from the theater, and they stop at a pub for drinks.
you decided to make salmon because you had some left over.
then you realized if you bitched, then you would stop cooking...
joey's your buddy. "where is everybody?" "well, they're hanging out with joey."
hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him joey, you should name him chandler. (phoebe doesn't think so.) oh, come on!
i mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, he'll be there.
and he'll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that you're really hot.
well, i, i like the idea of naming him after someone i love, and joey and chandler are great names.
but, all right, i don't-maybe i'll just name him the hulk.
okay, y'know, would you feel better if we went someplace else?
i mean we could pack all this stuff up and y'know go to your apartment.
god, growing up here, this place must've been a real babe magnet.
yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
this-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is.
see, see, okay, i work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually.
it's-it's, they're-they're wearing it in milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then i see how people respond, and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale's, so?
and obviously in uh, in-in this case, i am going to report back, "usa not ready."
well, we were going to do that after-i mean umm, next.
well, we're starving, why don't we all go get something to eat?
in high school, you weren't jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!
all right, all right, so up until '92-93 he was very trusting, then '94 hit, carol left him and bamn!
okay, it's probably why kids picked on me in school, and why i never do well with women?
so, as of 4 o'clock tomorrow, i'm either gonna be mark johnson or john markson.

is there some way that they could, uh, not be here?
it's just that, uh, farm birds really kind of freak me out.
god, growing up here, this place must have been a real babe magnet.
yeah, well, it would have been, but, uh, my parents just moved here.
so part of my job is to wear the clothes and then i see how people respond.
and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale's, so...
hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life.
okay, it's probably why kids picked on me and why i never do well with women.
no, it's just i'm so pregnant that i-my guitar doesn't fit anymore.
so i thought 'til i'm not, i'm just gonna play all my songs on this drum.
umm, actually, i came down to ask you a big favour.
oh, well, don't tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.
i left a bra drying on the shower rod, you don't think your son will think it's yours and be horribly traumatised?
hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.
joey's your buddy. "where is everybody?" "well, they're hanging out with joey."
hey, y'know what, if you're gonna do that, if you're gonna name him joey, you should name him chandler. (phoebe doesn't think so.) oh, come on!

actually that-that's not true, in the incredible hulk uh, no. 72, dr. bruce banner found¡¦ y'know, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriend's a lesbian.
so, i decided i'm definitely going to go with either joey or chandler.
yeah, well, it would've been, but uh, my parents just moved here.
ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet.
this-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is not-that's-that's not what it is.

lately, the show's been about us getting excited to go to london.
and then we realized in real life, we're doing that same thing.
it's weird for all of us to be here without her.
she's in the episode, on the phone and things like that.
it's basically a "let's kick the brits up the butt" episode, really.
you're gonna see a lot of comedy, a lot of romance...

i heard her scream, and then i found her on the floor, and i called 911.
i promise, if you just let me spend the night and get some sleep,
i'm only taking care of her until her mom gets out of rehab.

when i was his age, i'd leave home at 6 in the morning with some clothes.
and i'd return by evening only after selling and making some money.
but now somebody has taken me out of the darkness of ignorance.
i was told a good man is one who has the courage to bravely and honestly own them up in public.
your parents taught you to wear a watch but no manners!
you come to london laundry and talk to me like this!
but one thing is sure, in my long service i earned respect.
if i ask for the winning ticket the ministry won't refuse me.
kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good-looking guy.
it's like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it.
acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play.
when they were doing it on stage, was it really hot?
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage then all the sexual tension between them is gone.
as long as it's hot on stage, you got nothing to worry about.
well, kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good-looking guy.
yeah, it was like somebody wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it.
so as long as it's hot on-stage, you got nothing to worry about.
it's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
she is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.
i get to have sex with the star of the play!

if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time.
that fridge has got to be stocked, okay, that's your department now.
so as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.
it's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.
so uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?
y'know what, i don't know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.
you're accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?
y'know, i-i could see how this could happen, y'know you're up there every night, you're naked, touching, kissing.
well, that is what happened, and i don't even see you denying this!
i'll tell you what, chandler, why don't you call me when you grow up!
ohh, god, i just got so nervous that he would say no.
well, you gotta give him something that he can't say no too.

don't worry we also have cereals, muffins, waffles and jams, jellies and marmalades, which i'm sure are the same thing.
we're watching the game here saturday, if people want to come over.

also we're watching the game here saturday, if people want to come over.
oh, god, i just got so nervous that he was gonna say no.
well, you gotta give him something he can't say no to, like, uh, knicks tickets.
i just wanted to come over to say that i'm sorry.
you know, i acted like the biggest idiot in the world.
"an extra ticket." not "two tickets." i have and extra ticket.
so the first time you asked a guy out he turned you down?
she is the star of the play, and she is my girlfriend.
i get to have sex with the star of the play!
you were in acting class together, and she slept with you.
acting class is a lot more like a movie than a play.
he crossed the border to finland same day as holma was killed.
two days later he buys a one-way airplane ticket from göteborg to murmansk.
we have calculated the size, value, and origin of the cargo.
what has been smuggled out of russia that is to kill for?
he has persistantly claimed to have met a swedish parachute soldier on the russian tundra.
five minutes ago it sounded like the world's most incredible story.
wont he show me enough respect to hear my explanation in the same room
can he not show me that respect then you can go to hell!
if you are tried in sweden, you'll be sentenced to life.
and if you brush your teeth every night, it'll be 7~8 years.
excuse me, i'm sorry, but i need to take some blood.
it'd be great if you and your little girl had the same blood type.
so you just happened to hear about this world class scholar and athlete who just happened to be at death's door?
well, we do have our contacts at all the major medical centers across the country.
the age of sending our fragile irreplaceable sons to war is over.
from a thread of dna taken from a single human blood cell and implanted in the nucleus of an unfertilized egg... we will forge a new warrior.
a warrior who leaves no widows or orphans and feels no grief or fear.
and with enough fuel his wounds will heal themselves almost instantly and he'll be able to march for days with no sleep.
and if i'm to believe what the scientists are telling me about a gene that carries extra sensory powers... he may even someday be capable of getting his orders telepathically.
and he will never doubt the moral foundation of any order... even in his heart.
you'll note the child has reached full gestation in only 19 weeks.
if the growth agents we've been experimenting with keep working miracles at the same rate... he'll be ready for the kind of work general ames has in mind by the time he's chronologically ten years old.
when he told me he was going to marry an artist,
i told his mother to get his old room ready for the day when he'd have to throw himself on the mercy of his hard-working parents.
i am so happy to say i haven't been right yet.
to my son, on the publication of his first novel, the first of many.
a fearless soldier is not the same thing as a heartless killer and if you'd ever been within 10,000 miles of a combat zone... that's something you'd know.
i thought the entire point of this project was to create a fearless soldier who would never question the moral foundation of an order.
he is designed to be a normal human in the normal world... but that's all he is, a brilliant design.
there is no more heart and soul inside of him than there is in a patriot missile.
he won't make a guess over the phone, so i'm gonna go see him and let him run all the tests in the world.
meanwhile, i picked up this book when i was researching "slow bleed".
stroke covers blackout and amnesia and doesn't say anything about the hallucinating.
martin james stillwater, look me in the eye and listen carefully.
i mean, i think i might have something very, very serious.
that's what you thought a couple of years ago when you thought you had chest pains.
they think somebody gets a little too lucky, they reach for the scissors.
any old ladies show up here with sharp sewing utensils, they'll have to talk to me.
i think the first report should be on just about now.
business associates have expressed shock at the heart attack death of eccentric petroleum magnate, kingman flagg.
we make these little beauties in czechoslovakia, or whatever the hell they're calling it these days.
you can pack it with one cc of anything you like and it will dissolve in the human body within 15 minutes.
i mean, as far as anyone knows, kingman flagg died of a heart attack.
and if alfie should ever be caught, which of course he won't be, he doesn't know one name.
i can remember how to drive a car and which way is left and right, but... but not things in life, like on tv.
not mom and dad and the first time i rode a bicycle.
just keep it where i won't accidentally get a glimpse of it, please.
why do you always get so grumpy when somebody mentions the magazine article?
i'd say there's somewhere between two and three liters of blood in various rooms in this house.
do you know what i expect to find with that much blood?
because it really does stretch the imagination to picture such a grievously wounded man being able to flee the scene.
do you see the problem i'm having putting all this together?
i already told you, i don't understand what's going on here either.
you have a new book coming out in a month or so, don't you?
if you're suggesting that my husband murdered his little girl's pets as a publicity stunt, get the hell out of here.
now you do know it's illegal to file a false crime report.
let's say we're gonna do it because we don't want 'em to see the blood all over the house.
i don't care why, just so long as we do it.
if you turn yourself in now... you could save yourself and your family a ton of trouble.
have you run tests on the blood you found at the house?
to fill you in, stillwater was attacked at his home yesterday afternoon.
he told the police the attacker was a lost identical twin with superhuman powers, who took two bullets to the chest and then drove away in an infiniti.
but if alfie can't be controlled, he'll have to be destroyed.
i will find alfie, and i'll get him back on track.
the lab is pretty sure that the blood in the rug is stillwater's.
what kind of nutcase would store up two quarts of his own blood?
you think about those two children, and then you tell me...
is this the kinda guy you wanna give the benefit of the doubt to?
what're you gonna do... trap him in a house in the snow and saw his feet off?
i don't know about the house in the snow part, but i'm a pretty big fan.
please, don't send out some shoot-to-kill posse until we talk to him again.
"the twine dug red ditches in his daughter's wrist... as gavin cinched it hard around the table's oak leg.
i have strict orders to stay out of your way, lieutenant.
just think of me as a magic force field between you and the tabloids.
listen, sweetheart, i forgot to tell you we're going to be up at the cabin tomorrow.
and don't you try and tell me nothing's wrong because i know when something's wrong with my son.
i would like to find out all i can about it.
now, if you would be so kind as to help me gather all of the records of the triple w project,
i was having terrible writer's block for a while... but that's all over now...
because the plot of my new book is writing itself this very second.
i can't figure out how he's managed to take all this away from me and leave me so empty.
marty, perhaps you should go back to the beginning... and tell us exactly what's happened.
there's a lot of crazy stuff going on right now, so...
i asked the police to come up there and check on you.
and what time would you say he came into the bank?
9:00 on the dot, because he was the first customer in the bank.
as soon as we get rid of stillwater... we get alfie back on line and it'll be as if nothing ever happened.
drew, i think that may be a slightly optimistic appraisal of the situation.
i'd sure like to get a second opinion before we make any drastic change in plan.
can we get an electronic hook-up to the federal lab in bethesda?
we can take care of that before we take care of the others.
there's not a medical examiner in the world that would know the difference.
well, i think what we all need is a fire in that fireplace... and a nice family dinner together.
honey, i think the girls need rest more than food right now.
"and in the latest development in the bizarre and now tragic story of the fugitive mystery writer...
stillwater's parents have been found murdered in their mammoth lakes home.
'i've known marty stillwater since he was on training wheels... and the man going inside that house was indeed marty.'
police suspect stillwater in connection with another brutal murder in a texas parking lot.
you should know the results from the blood test are in.
my orders are to rescue two young girls and their mother from a dangerous armed killer.
the results on the blood came in from the federal lab.
we were getting those strange readings because it was old blood.
every night, a small, child-like person in a... red and green striped sweater appears in her room...
when she was in high school, that pop singer hit someone with her boyfriend's car and fled the scene!
a samurai, kazamatsuri, had killed an aide to our lord, and stolen the precious sword bestowed on us by the shogun.
we were granted the sword and the domain 80 years ago.
fifteen years ago the fief i belonged to had a border dispute with a neighboring clan.
i was a guard there, under orders to kill anyone crossing the border.
no trace of anger, no resentment, did he let show on his face.
as i prayed for him, i felt something greater watching over me from above.
when a man abandons ego and obstinacy, he can accept the gods and learn how to truly love.
it took me a long time to realize that essential truth.
i really don't want him to be employed by some lord.
but if he receives a stipend from a lord and master, he must draw his sword for the lord's sake.
a widower, his last words were of regret for his daughter.
i, a single man at the time, left the fief and adopted her.
as i prayed for him, i felt something greater watching over me from above.
when a man abandons ego and obstinacy, he can accept the gods and learn how to truly love.
it took me a long time to realize that essential truth.
the most important thing is to give your all until the very last.

you know, it's like america stepped in something and is scraping off its shoe directly over my tv set.
i'm telling you, jerry springer, jenny jones, they're all broadcasting straight from hell.
apparently, some guy wanted to be a woman, so he chops it off.
then he decides he likes chicks after all, so he becomes a lesbian.
so, uh, john, how much will you pay me not to go down to your office and tell margaret you're still sneaking cigarettes, huh?
how much will you pay me not to paint your white cane brown?
and this is way better than sweeping up hair at a beauty salon.
although the fumes from those hair dyes can give you a pretty good buzz.
anyway, uh, h-he's recommended a program downtown at mount sinai, and i really think that we should give it a try.
now, i know that you work, so if you can't take him,
you just may go to heaven whether you like it or not.
thanks, that's the first time anyone's ever suggested i go in that direction.
you know, it's like america stepped in something and is scraping off its shoe directly over my tv set.
i'm telling you, jerry springer, jenny jones, they're all broadcasting straight from hell.
apparently, some guy wanted to be a woman, so he chops it off.
then he decides he likes chicks after all, so he becomes a lesbian.
so, uh, john, how much will you pay me not to go down to your office and tell margaret you're still sneaking cigarettes, huh?
how much will you pay me not to paint your white cane brown?
i'm gonna stand way over here, and i'm gonna give you my diagnosis, free of charge.
your blood pressure's too high, your cholesterol's through the roof, and your legs are killing you.
i know you said never to talk to you unless it was absolutely necessary-- right.
--but i-i just wanna say thanks a lot for making me a nurse's aide.
anyway, uh, h-he's recommended a program downtown at mount sinai, and i really think that we should give it a try.
now, i know that you work, so if you can't take him,
you just may go to heaven whether you like it or not.
thanks, that's the first time anyone's ever suggested i go in that direction.
the boys over at cia have access to his overseas accounts.
the past five days, there's been a depletion of funds without reimbursements.
obviously, gundars is using this party as cover to auction the plane.
your mission is to get into his palace find out where the plane is and stop him from selling it.
your fight here promises to be the most exciting event that budapest has seen in some time.
since you such a nice guy i ain't gonna break your boy up too bad.
i have something that i want to say, and if you don't mind i just have a...
it's like a story that i feel i need to tell you.
i got 45 seconds to figure out this logarithmic code or we'll all die because we'll blow up.
why don't you stick to your perfume ads and leave the espionage to me?
- you dizzy from massive blood loss because the bitch stabbed you 15 minutes ago!
i could have crippled him for life if i wanted to.
we're going to go a long way and we have to be ready friday.
and we have to be ready for the match after, and so on.
robert, whether you're on the right or the left... no problem!
you bring the game to them, you know how to play.
like our friend over there, who's stopped scoring for the same reason.
we have something in us that likes bold players, players who persevere and who are intelligent.
i didn't have what it takes to go forward and attack.
i know what it's like, standing with your back to the goal, with a forward, maybe two, bearing down on you.
and winning is about team spirit, it's about solidarity and generosity.
and we've got to work for that, it won't come on its own.
so get your physical presence there in front of the goal.
if you come straight in from the wing, you'll get three or four chances, i'm telling you.
but the fact that we've got players who play for all the great foreign teams, that means something.
if you're not mentally strong, you won't make it abroad or even in the top french teams.
if you give them the slightest chance to do something you're dickheads!
but if you put on pressure right from the start, if you're aggressive... problem solved!
why do some teams win everything for three or four years and then just collapse?
it's because of the chemistry, and that's very hard to find.
what i want... and i hope you, too, have the same hopes, is to go as far as possible, to the end of the road.
we're now at a delicate phase, a very tense one, a very exciting one...
if it goes past that it becomes dangerous... because we lose all control.
it always surprises me to see how big football has got around the world.
now we're up against an adversary that we know very well, that most of you know very well.
they're past masters at provocation, at upsetting your balance and getting you all wound up.
the only thing i'm worried about is that one of you might crack.
for those of you who have a vision of international football, you know that yugoslavia fell apart but... they're still the same team, they're good footballers.
tackle him if someone's behind you or be ready to take off in the opposite direction.
when he turns away from marcel you have to get the ball.
the 22 of you here right now, those who didn't make the team and those who managed to make their presence felt.
you should all spare a thought for your team-mates, for having this chance.
before anything else i'd like to remind you that we'll be together for a long time, i hope.
even if our strategy has been modified by the fact that we selected 28 players, and now, as you all know, we have to... select only 22 out of them.
we've had a year in which we've concentrated on communication and on trying out different combinations.
i know this has given all of you lots to think about and maybe even changed how you approach the game.
youri moves up on the right wing, so you move, nice and easy, into the middle.
on the wing, manu and liza make a bit of room.
near lyon, 24th june 1998 a few hours before france v denmark
a cock can give you a nasty peck with its beak.
we're not in this match, we can't win it like this.
they're having it all their way, they're doing what they want.
they move up, nice and easy, put on the pressure and...
we have to get back together, regroup ourselves, and then we move back up, but all together.
and if we feel it's not right then we drop back.
we all drop back as one and then we move up again.
if the pot starts boiling again, will you see me before you get in a jam?
if you want to talk, come in and shoot the breeze.
the familiar constellations that illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed:
eternal, unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet's birth and demise.
through the infinite reaches of space the problems of man seem trivial and naive indeed.
and man, existing alone seems himself an episode of little consequence.
i don't want to drag you into this, but i can't help it.
you see, i think you can't just go around proving things and pretending like you're tough.
but, uh, would those other people be right or would they be wrong?
well, tim, are you asking me to talk about my personal life at work?
well, maybe because i didn't search his locker for long brown hairs.
which, according to the lab, either belonged to a collie or al's mother.
cognitive dissonance is when pieces of our lives no longer make sense.
beliefs we always held true seem to be false so we reorder our way of thinking.
i'm not gonna feed your appetite for lurid gossip and tawdry innuendo.
and, by the way, i installed an alarm on my locker.
i talked to vic he gave me a few pointers and, uh, voila.
julian, are you telling me that you discussed your love life with a hologram?
maybe i'll go and wake up miles... play a little tongo.
i remember back in... must have been '58, i was playing the sands.
between the three of us we must've dropped 15 big ones and believe me, back then, that wasn't chump change.
so frank goes over to the pit boss- what was his name?
you don't have to be an einstein to clue into any of that.
at one point, you were going to make an observation about...
if this babe doesn't raise your temperature you better check the obituary column because chances are you're in it, pally.
let's have a nice, warm round of applause for miss lola chrystal.
do you know how difficult it was for me to get a holographic image of major kira?
lucky for you, julian used her image in one of his spy programs- though it did take me an hour to get rid of the russian accent.
look, i appreciate what you've done for me but i'm afraid it's all been in vain.
i may be romeo in the holosuite but i know the first time i see the real kira
i've done a complete overhaul on the lola hologram- or should i say the kira hologram?
i'm telling you, odo you're going to think she's the real thing.
to begin, a little dom perignon, '55 and some oysters rockefeller... to be followed by caesar salad chateaubriand and cherries jubilee.
this is all very interesting, but, uh... don't you feel a little silly being here in a holosuite?
if you think about it, there's not much to be mad about.
i saw the way she looked at you while the two of you were dancing.
have you ever had a moment of pure clarity- a moment where the truth seems to just leap up and grab you by the throat?
i bet this has something to do with your visit with shakaar.
here in vegas, there's only one way to make sure you don't lose any money.
the moment you step off the plane you walk right into the propellers.
thought it would give him the right attitude for the era.
if you're going to work vegas in the '60s you better know the score otherwise, you're going to look like a clyde.
so, why don't we all meet here tomorrow night at 2100?
we can listen to vic's whole set then maybe hit the casinos play a little blackjack, roulette.
vic... these stories are all very interesting but i didn't come here to reminisce about your past.
yesterday, when my friends and i were here... you seemed to know things.
for instance, dax and worf are married... the chief misses his wife.
you don't have to be an einstein to clue into any of that.
look, pally, if you want to win the girl we got to thaw you out a little bit.
you know, turn up the heat... get those emotions you claim to have bubbling to the surface.
what i do need is someone to handle the black and whites.
my piano player just threw ten sevens in a row at the craps table and took off for reno.
if this babe doesn't raise your temperature you better check the obituary column because chances are you're in it, pally.
let's have a nice, warm round of applause for miss lola chrystal.
lucky for you, julian used her image in one of his spy programs-- though it did take me an hour to get rid of the russian accent.
look, i appreciate what you've done for me but i'm afraid it's all been in vain.
if odo wants to have dinner with me then why doesn't he ask me himself?
because i'm asking you for him and neither one of us will take no for an answer.
now, tell me, have you ever had a moment like that?
one or two, but, of course that's over a span of seven lifetimes.
vic, these stories are all very interesting, but i didn't come here to reminisce about your past.
yesterday, when my friends and i were here, you seemed to know things.
you haven't told me what to do about kira and shakaar.
forget about that fink. i bet he doesn't look half as good in a tux.
do you know how difficult it was to get a holographic image of major kira?
lucky for you, julian used her image in one of his spy programs.
i appreciate what you've done, but it's all been in vain.
i may be romeo in the holosuite, but i when i see the real kira i'll turn back into nanook of the north.
come fly with me, come fly, let's fly away lf you can use some exotic booze
there's a bar in far bombay lt's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
i've got two dozen more copies of this treaty to sign before the meeting.
who knew that the presidency was 50% panic and 50% paperwork?
the members of the alliance voted to boycott future meetings of the council until we guarantee the safety of their shipping lines against the recent attacks.
why the hell are we getting the sole rap for this?
it's the spaces in between where their ships are being attacked.
they say that if we are not strong enough to protect our own members or at least find out who's responsible what point is there in belonging to the alliance?
in the past it was a great relief to leave babylon 5 and a great joy to return home.
now it is a relief to leave centauri prime and be anywhere else.
100 credits for you not to be there for the day.
and for you not to be there the rest of your life, well they could never afford it.
there's only one way to know and that's to go in and take a look.
i know a guy, a security consultant in the drazi capital.
i worked with him when we were stationed on the mining colony on europa.
he had the good sense to get the hell out before i did.
you must understand, all we knew is that you went with mollari to centauri prime.
many of us felt that you had been taken prisoner or were going to be executed...
if you weren't a friend, i'd have you along in a second, but you are.
this could get really bad and like i said, my contact trusts no one but me.
i think they're even better than the last time i saw you.
when you get stabbed and shot in the back enough times sooner or later you learn to look behind you.
they know your people found a missing life pod at the site of the last attack.
and it'd be far easier for them to deny knowing anything if he were dead.
when you have to go through two or three at a time, you are most vulnerable.
see, now you can fly over and drop these things called bombs.
he will meet us tonight in the park at the base of the hotel.
he has the location of this balcony and a precision signal light.
have the white star come in low, land in the field just outside the capital...
- to get on board and get the hell out of there before the local boys react.
what if they come to me not because of the lesson but because of the teacher?
i worry, ta'lon, that my shadow may become greater than the message.
during the fight, it came off one of the guys who killed the pilot.
but you have no idea who they were, even what race they belonged to?
one, it hurts a hell of a lot more to hit a drazi than it did to hit these guys.
and two, if the drazi had known that the pilot was coming to see us they would've been downstairs, not hanging around waiting for me.
they're dividing the alliance making the members suspect each other, divide and conquer.
no, except the centauri need the alliance as much as anyone else.
he'll do whatever's necessary to track this problem back to its source.
and then very shortly thereafter he will almost certainly be dead.
at the last moment, he was saved by an outside force one that seemed to have the run of the palace.
this tells me that there are two different forces at work in the royal palace.
so if the centauri really are behind these attacks one of these two factions is involved.
mollari is alive only because someone back home wants him that way.
in the past, we have had little to do with other races.
evolution teaches us that we must fight that which is different in order to secure land, food, and mates for ourselves.
troubleshoot the alien sector and work the life-support systems, analyze the...
anyway i have a lot of respect for his work, and he has a lot for mine.
and yes, he will be which is why i had to think long and hard when he asked me to take over for him.
i thought you were compiling data on alien disease transmission for delenn and the alliance.
earth dome has a hell of a lot more resources than we've got here.
and i'd have a huge staff, and with the alliance giving me the authority to go where i need to put this information together in a lot of ways, it's a match made in heaven.
like i said, dr. kyle will stay on until the end of the year but effective january 1, 2263 i will be the new head of xenobiological research at earth dome.
well, i would be a liar if i said that i was happy to hear this.
i've got two dozen more copies of this treaty to sign before the meeting.

your shirt buttons from the left but a woman's blouse buttons from the right because servants used to dress them.

this is a button from one of the uniforms of our imperial palace guards.
and the design here is the seal of emperor tuscano who first commissioned the palace guard 2000 years ago.
we know now that the centauri are almost certainly involved in these attacks.
but londo would have not dropped that information in our laps if he were involved.
we were attacked on centauri prime by other centauri opposed to mollari.
at the last moment, he was saved by an outside force one that seemed to have the run of the palace.
this tells me that there are two different forces at work in the royal palace.
so if the centauri really are behind these attacks one of these two factions is involved.
mollari is alive only because someone back home wants him that way.
if he should begin asking the wrong questions they would kill him in an instant.
one thing's for sure i sure am going to miss this place.
in the past, we have had little to do with other races.
evolution teaches us that we must fight that which is different in order to secure land, food, and mates for ourselves.
but we must reach a point where the nobility of intellect asserts itself and says no.
well, yeah, i i had some things i had to think about.
now that i've come to a decision, i wanted you to be the first to know.
i got a call from dr. benjamin kyle, head of xenobiological research at earth dome.
we've crossed paths here and there over the years and he was even loaned out to b5 for a while when the place first went online to troubleshoot the alien sector and work out the life-support systems, analyze the...

i know a guy, a security consultant in the drazi capital.
i worked with him when we were stationed on the mining colony on europa.
is this the book of g'kar that i have been hearing so much about since i got back?
they are finding it useful in learning how to get along with other races even yours.
just checking your reactions to see if time had slowed them down.
i think they're even better than the last time i saw you.

they're dividing the alliance making the members suspect each other, divide and conquer.
no, except the centauri need the alliance as much as anyone else.
he'll do whatever's necessary to track this problem back to its source.
and then very shortly thereafter he will almost certainly be dead.
at the last moment, he was saved by an outside force one that seemed to have the run of the palace.
this tells me that there are two different forces at work in the royal palace.
so if the centauri really are behind these attacks one of these two factions is involved.
mollari is alive only because someone back home wants him that way.
in the past, we have had little to do with other races.
evolution teaches us that we must fight that which is different in order to secure land, food, and mates for ourselves.
we've crossed paths here and there over the years and he was even loaned out to b5 for a while when the place first went online to troubleshoot the alien sector and work out the life-support systems, analyze the...
anyway i have a lot of respect for his work, and he has a lot for mine.
and yes, he will be which is why i had to think long and hard when he asked me to take over for him.
i thought you were compiling data on alien disease transmission for delenn and the alliance.
earth dome has a hell of a lot more resources than we've got here.
and i'd have a huge staff, and with the alliance giving me the authority to go where i need to put this information together in a lot of ways, it's a match made in heaven.
like i said, dr. kyle will stay on until the end of the year but effective january 1, 2263 i will be the new head of xenobiological research at earth dome.
well, i would be a liar if i said that i was happy to hear this.
each government can only operate its military within its own borders without causing an incident.
it's the spaces in between where their ships are being attacked.
they say that if we are not strong enough to protect our own members or at least find out who's responsible what point is there in belonging to the alliance?
well, as much as i hate to admit it they've got a point.
ten credits for you not to be there for an hour.
100 credits for you not to be there for the day.
there's only one way to know and that's to go in and take a look.
i know a guy, a security consultant in the drazi capital.
i worked with him when we were stationed on the mining colony on europa.
he had the good sense to get the hell out before i did.
is this the book of g'kar that i have been hearing so much about since i got back?
they are finding it useful in learning how to get along with other races even yours.
just checking your reactions to see if time had slowed them down.
i think they're even better than the last time i saw you.
and the drazi agents awaiting his delivery of illegal supplies plan to take their losses out on him.
they know your people found a missing life pod at the site of the last attack.
and it would be far easier for them to deny knowing anything about it if he were dead.
suffice to say he wants to get off planet as soon as possible.
to prevent invaders from taking their city they built their streets too narrow for armies or engines of war.
when you have to go through two or three at a time, you are most vulnerable.
now they live indoors like the rest of us, but the architecture remains.
your shirt buttons from the left... but a woman's blouse buttons from the right because servants used to dress them.
first, i will leave you here to finalize your travel arrangements back to babylon 5.
he will meet us tonight in the park at the base of the hotel.
he will meet us tonight in the park at the base of the hotel.
he has the location of this balcony and a precision signal light.
what if they come to me not because of the lesson but because of the teacher?
i worry, ta'lon, that my shadow may become greater than the message.
during the fight, it came off one of the guys who killed the pilot.
but you have no idea who they were, even what race they belonged to?
one, it hurts a hell of a lot more to hit a drazi than it did to hit these guys.
and two, if the drazi had known that the pilot was coming to see us they would've been downstairs, not hanging around waiting for me.
this is a button from one of the uniforms of our imperial palace guards.
and the design here is the seal of emperor tuscano who first commissioned the palace guard 2000 years ago.
we know now that the centauri are almost certainly involved in these attacks.
but londo would have not dropped that information... in our laps if he were involved.
we were attacked on centauri prime by other centauri opposed to mollari.
at the last moment, he was saved by an outside force one that seemed to have the run of the palace.
this tells me that there are two different forces at work in the royal palace.
so if the centauri really are behind these attacks one of these two factions is involved.
mollari is alive only because someone back home wants him that way.
if he should begin asking the wrong questions they would kill him in an instant.
one thing's for sure i sure am going to miss this place.
in the past, we have had little to do with other races.
evolution teaches us that we must fight that which is different in order to secure land, food, and mates for ourselves.
but we must reach a point where the nobility of intellect asserts itself and says no.
well, yeah, i i had some things i had to think about.
now that i've come to a decision, i wanted you to be the first to know.
i got a call from dr. benjamin kyle, head of xenobiological research at earth dome.
we've crossed paths here and there over the years and he was even loaned out to b5 for a while when the place first went online to troubleshoot the alien sector and work out the life-support systems, analyze the...
and i'd have a huge staff, and with the alliance giving me the authority to go where i need to put this information together in a lot of ways, it's a match made in heaven.
on the other hand, it does mean i'd have to leave here.
i was so eager to test my new engine, i pushed it beyond its limits.
coaxial warp doesn't seem to be the smoothest way to travel.
since when is not wanting to spend time with the doctor a capital offense?
you'd have to throw the whole crew in the brig for that one.
maybe. i was just wondering if there's something on your mind.
you're showing up for your duty shifts, you do what's required, but your heart doesn't seem to be in it.
i limped back to the engineers on benthos with phaser holes through their brand- new exatanium fuselage.
i think they would have been happier to see phaser holes through me.
when i get this ship back, i'm going to be doing the first test on a new mithran- class fighter.
i'm told it's more advanced than any warship in the quadrant.
because if you're not, i don't want to sit here anymore.
if you can carry on an adult conversation without all the histrionics...
and you think we need a device like that to dilute the particle stream as it enters the coaxial drive.
exactly, and a spare polaric modulator from voyager's impulse drive should do the trick.
you don't have to worry about making a lot of choices.
i usually go to bed at night not knowing what the next day has in store... what trouble i might get into.
and, tom... don't dismiss the suggestion i made...about coming with me to fly the new ship.
it might be fun to escape the shackles for a while.
and as hard as i might try to become a better assistant to you, it's clear to me now that i'll never be half the healer that you are.
do you mean to tell me you've been trying to live up to my standards?
the misplaced aggression, the shirking of responsibilities... all classic signs of an inferiority complex.
i had no idea my superior abilities were affecting your psyche so strongly.
oh, i think that we would need at least a week.
oh, i wish we could, but we've only got a day.
tom... as your captain and as your friend... i want you to report to sick bay for some tests.
we have to find out if there's something physical that's causing this behavior.
no offense, but i'd like to get out of your body as soon as possible.
the alien seems capable of some sort of selective dna exchange.
neurological scans yielded very little, but i did find something very interesting in his blood analysis.
there are traces of a second dna pattern in his nucleotide structure.
i don't know, but i'm running more scans to see how this might have affected his neurological functions.
captain, a vessel just emerged from coaxial space off our starboard bow.
it may take a while... but i will do whatever i can to find everyone you've violated.

a woman is trying to get custody of her sisters' twins.
evidently the little girls are budding country music stars and the woman feels that this is no way to raise children.
she says nothing's wrong and then she starts screaming at me and i start screaming back.
last week she moved out, she's staying with her girlfriend and today i got served with this.
¢ü the black, yellow and brown man will wash away. ¢ü
¢ü yes, the black, yellow and brown man will wash away. ¢ü
and if you're religious, for god's sake, keep it to yourself.
all i want to know is how fast you type, what's your experience, level of education and...
and now you're trying to put your stamp on our children.
ms. shaw, ms. monroe, regardless of my personal feelings about this case.
i can assure you of one thing, you have no legal standing to challenge custody here.
the court wouldn't dare take children away from their parents because of said parent's political beliefs.
mr. and mrs. tanner are extremists, and they are hazardous to their own children's welfare as well as society.
and we are prepared to prove that this custody battle is not only a matter of child welfare, but of national security.
i will let you be her on the phone at the beginning, but you will not be calling our clients "hos".
and after a month, you will have to be you all the time, including when you are on the phone.
this summer we sang at a patriot's day picnic in richmond and at the solstice festival in tampa.
also, we got to do the national anthem at an anti-immigration rally in ft.
but at their rallies, they just wave their mexican flags and talk spanish.
with our songs, we're saying that whites need to stand up and fight back, because the minorities, they're winning.
are you aware that the daily required number of calories for someone of your age and height is somewhere between 1,800 and 2,500?
and are you aware that two out of three americans are overweight?
listen, as much as i enjoy the company of you, show people,
i have a closing to prepare, so i'll see you and your full heads of hair at the courthouse.
you're a forty year old single mother working in a steakhouse.
the only good thing that you have going for you is your daughter.
evidently, he was talking on it when he got struck by the lightning?
those studies linking cell phones and lightning have been completely debunked.
mr. shore can deride me for pulling the national security card, but do not tell me that the timothy mcveighs of this world and the christian identity organization and the like, which support violence and are antigovernment, you can't tell me that they don't pose a threat to this country.
for god's sake, these two little girls are being taught to adhere to a whites-only, immigrant-bashing, jew-hating ideology.
he ate lots of red meat and invented the swim fin.
when our current president, who, by the way, has invented nothing, signed the patriot act into law in 2001, not a single member of congress could be found who had read the bill all the way through.
granted, a family that is so filled with spite and ignorance and shockingly untutored ideas that it beggars the imagination, but still a family.
and as long as lauren and katey are well fed and well cared for, a family the law cannot and should not touch.
if that is the case, if there is any actual evidence linking them to a crime, by all means, be my guest, please, have at 'em, arrest them.
but if there is no cause to arrest them, then leave this family alone.
okay, let me just say something before we go in here.
i have tried to have patience with him, but i feel like i'm fighting a losing battle.
i know how busy you are, so i thought we'd cut right to it.
we represent a woman by the name of annabelle caruthers whose husband was regrettably killed after being struck by lightning while talking on a cell phone manufactured by your client cybus technologies.
it is if she is contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
you've got all kinds of little tips in there that could expose you to both criminal and civil liability.
yes, you can certainly have your day in court, possibly prevail, though i doubt it.
and in the meantime, word of your arrest will undoubtedly make it to the modeling agencies, and there goes your livelihood.
will you be representing her for free in those, ms. ford?
my suggestion would be to go to rehab and get the help you need.
my daughter was afraid, when she broke up with him that he might try to kill her.
you didn't really think that donna was in any physical danger from my client, did you?
well, let me just see if i can get this clear.
you were afraid that mr. martin might kill your daughter but you stayed silent on the whole matter out of respect for her privacy?
this is probably what accounts for the sweat you see on my forehead.
see, if you didn't make those representations unemployment in the commonwealth goes up a blip.
if you or mr. donnell return the 70,000 within 30 days, that'll be the end of it.
if you don't, i refer the matter to the district attorney.
and could you describe what that means for the jury, doctor?
essentially, it's a psychological splitting mechanism causing a segregation of normal integrated patterns of perception.
dr. braun, i am both mindful of your presence in the courtroom every day and of your loss.
i hope you realize what i do shouldn't be interpreted as a failure on my part to feel your tragedy.
i'd like to say i don't care but i do care.
because this place of business is where i come to work every day.
and if you expect me to be a part of your schemes or lies or whatever it is you're pulling then you've never bothered to know who i am.
i will never be a participant in that kind of crap.
but you'd better think real hard about exactly what it is you're trying to keep going.
summary judgment motions are brought by the defense in almost every civil action.
just that if i invited him to my room, he'd probably come.
the idea of setting ronald martin free has to seem horrific.
if you hang a shingle with me, you'll at least have an office to come to.
you can pick up some court appointments, hustle up some contingencies.
i'm not sure we'll get by summary judgment on the tobacco case.
if donna braun's killer gets off on insanity, our wrongful death claim gets wobbled.
if that happens after sheila's trial and if she's convicted, he'll have a better hand.
he might even deal her sentence a little to get her to testify against you.
if i could feel a part of getting a man to face a problem, an illness that would be something.
so i'm asking you if you don't want to do anything for yourself, then do it for me.
and every day she becomes a little more gone, a little more forgotten until one day, she doesn't exist at all.
and all you take back into that jury room with you is him.
ronald martin, the man who strangled donna braun for seven minutes.
dr. braun, i am both mindful of your presence in the courtroom every day and of your loss.
"more than all our expert testimony, more than all our unconvoluted..."
i'm sorry. "...uncontroverted evidence what the defense is going for, more than anything else, is your common sense the seat-of-the-pants wisdom of the reasonable person."
on the charge of first-degree murder we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
on the charge of second-degree murder we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
on the charge of voluntary manslaughter we find the defendant not guilty by reason of temporary insanity.
ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this completes your service and i thank you for your time.
and i want to also caution you that when you leave this room you may be subject to second-guessing.
i want to emphasize to you that aside from the parties and attorneys and myself you are the only people who heard all the relevant facts of this case.
- your honor dr. braun cannot be considered a flight risk.
he's a health risk, goes about shooting people in the head.
might we have the first grade teacher of the defendant as well?
the synagogue of b'nai zion will vouch for dr. braun's character.
i'm sure you're aware that product liability cases can potentially drag on forever and you might be worried about that.
there's medical information, scientific evidence technical data with respect to cigarettes.
and you will believe dr. clark because he is the only doctor who actually treated margaret ray.
as for whether cigarettes cause lung cancer we will not be calling witnesses to prove that, either.
we will present evidence of a two-year investigation conducted by the fda, in which it found nicotine to be addictive.
so much, in fact that the fda now regulates cigarettes as drug-delivery devices.
it's one of the things we're proud of in this country.
no, it's a slippery slope once you start arguing that people shouldn't have the right to make personal choices.
they put out a product, when used as directed, causes cancer.
it's the plaintiff's contention that when their product does kill somebody they should bear some responsibility.
well, that's another thing i won't be doing in this trial.
i would never presume to be able to articulate his pain.
enticing people to use a product that could give them cancer probably will give them cancer and feel no remorse.
the defendant, t.l. michaels, generates revenues exceeding $28 billion a year.
that offer is only being made because sometimes it's cheaper to shoo away a mosquito rather than to slap it dead.
look, i'm not gonna pretend that we measure up on legal talent.
we might be crazy, but there's a climate out there right now.
states are suing tobacco companies for health costs associated with smoking.
it's just a matter of time before a jury in massachusetts is gonna wanna pinch you.
and if we get them there, to the point where they want you to feel a sting even a little sting imagine.
and here's the biggest thing of all most victims don't bother to sue because you're too big a windmill.
what if you should ever lose a jury trial to a plaintiff who puts on so simple a case?
- lf they can get rid of it now they can sell it as a nuisance settlement.
as soon as the trial's in progress, any settlement is perceived as defeat.
for which he was judged to be insane at the time.
but there was no suggestion of insanity at the time father o'brien forgave him.
the jury never got to hear the truth in ronald martin's trial.
they never knew that he previously tried to kill another girl because he suppressed that information.
a lot of injustice would occur but this isn't such a case.
and jerry braun shouldn't be crucified because of what might hypothetically happen if you don't condemn him on some legal principal when morally, it's not so simple.
like, i'd take a picture... and extra faces would show up.
then i discovered... that if i just held the camera and thought real hard...
someone took a picture of an old photo of his wife, then re-exposed the film.
no, the lab boys are positive it's not a double exposure.
our leaders are coming here to discuss peace... not to be pampered and spoon-fed in expensive hotel suites.
do you think, ms. kell... that the world would take the talks seriously were they held... on the back porch of someone's house in the country?
she and my uncle lawson will arrange it so that you can talk to eric.
and matthew here... as you've probably guessed, is one of the world's most gifted psychics.
which means you no longer need to worry about the peace-talk negotiations.
steve, i'm perfectly capable of finding out who abducted those two diplomats.
on your last assignment... you were found sleeping serenely on a backroom couch... while supposedly watching deputy minister kell... who disappeared.
somebody lured me into that room... and chloroformed me to get me out of the way and you know it.
i don't like the idea of having to stay around so long.
well, our client has a perfect right to be completely satisfied... that the peace conference will be canceled... thereby assuring the continuance of the border wars.
i do hope... your matthew can have a little more luck than the others i've tried.
imagine neglecting to tell... his wife, before he died, where he left $500,000 worth of diamonds.
i'm sorry, diana, but i'm going to have to insist... that you take a real vacation.
plane tickets, hotel reservations, specific orders to have the time of your life.
tell me you haven't been able to get accurate compass readings.
it's because you've been caught in something called the devil's triangle.
though her exact position was kept a secret for fear of spies it's thought she was just south of the piantagenet bank when she went missing.
less than 60 feet of water, yet she was never found.
i'm sorry, but i'm coming to you for help and i've got nowhere else to go.
i would hope that after everything you'd have the courtesy, the decency, and not to mention the respect to listen to what i have to say.
you come out on the side of history with help from us.
not much to apologize over the next 50 years, except for maybe the spice girls.
sag ihm, wir werden einen passagier umbringen, fur jede falsche antwort.
you will answer the question or we will begin killing passengers.
all cinemas, theaters and other places of entertainment are to be closed immediately until further notice.
the evacuation of british children is going on smoothly and efﬁciently.
though her exact position was kept a secret for fear of spies it's thought she was just south of the plantagenet bank when she went missing.
less than 60 feet of water, yet she was never found.
i'm sorry, but i'm coming to you for help and i've got nowhere else to go.
i would hope that after everything you'd have the courtesy, the decency, and not to mention the respect to listen to what i have to say.
the boat that you were on was busted into a million pieces.
and as for the queen anne, it was nothing more than a ghost ship.
the queen anne is stuck here on the eastern edge of it.
you've been caught in a time warp, some kind of limbo dimension... and now you've popped out the other side into 1 998.
consequently, as of today, september 3, 1 939, this country is at war with germany.
oh, sh- [ siren wailing ] -[ man speaking german ]
all cinemas, theaters and other places of entertainment... are to be closed immediately until further notice.
the evacuation of british children... is going on smoothly and efficiently.
though her exact position was kept a secret... for fear spies might give her up to the axis, it's been determined that the queen anne... was just south of the plantagenet bank when she went missing.
less than 60 feet of water, yet she's never been found.
and as for the queen anne, it was nothing more than a ghost ship.
no, no, no, you and i were on that ship, scully, in 1 939.
it's been reasonably determined that the queen anne was just south of the plantagenet bank when she went missing.
less than sixty feet of water yet she's never been found.
- he went to bermuda and chartered a powerboat out of hamilton harbor.
we tracked him on the satellite for an hour and a half.
i'm sorry, but i'm coming to you for help and i've got nowhere else to go.
i would hope that after everything that we have been through that you would at least have the courtesy and the decency and not to mention the respect to listen to what i have to say.
look, sir, if you know anybody at the office of naval intelligence it would be of great help.
i could lose my job, my pension, i could even be subject to legal action.
after poland, hitler's on his way to denmark, holland and france with a few stops in between.
the french all but roll over on us, the italians seize their opportunity and the japanese come through the back door.
this was an overly ambitious episode actually, and one that took a tremendous amount of extra planning and extra care and extra work for everyone involved.
it was filmed in long takes, oners, that were put together artfully and made to look like real time.
so what you're seeing is actually edited film that pretends to be in one continuous, long take through each act.
you can see where some of the edits are if you pay very careful attention, but our attempt was to disguise them.
he is being brutalised by the british sailors who have found him in the sea who believe he's a german spy, calling him jerry.
there's an edit in this little area here to get mulder upright to answer the questions.
now he's going to be hauled roughly into the interior of the ship where, once again, we cut.
but this is all long, long single takes that took a lot of rehearsal and, ultimately, a lot of very careful camerawork and focus pulling.
dave luckenbach really was, for me, a kind of codirector on this whole episode.
he, as the steadicam operator, had the job of keeping the action framed in an interesting way.
mulder brought into the hallway and taken to captain yip harburg's room, the british captain.
some of these actors were british, and some were affecting british accents.
i think we ended up shooting this scene a half-dozen times before we got it exactly right.
the camera needs to be a character here, looking back and forth, anticipating the dialogue, pushing in, keeping the framing interesting.
he's confused about the time or the others are confused because they're in the devil's triangle.
suddenly he hears a message over the radio, which is neville chamberlain declaring war against germany.
in hearing this, he realises that it's not that he has come onto the ship in 1998, but that he has come onto the ship in 1939.
there's a whip pan here when mulder hears something at the door and all of a sudden, for the first time, we see that the characters...
we're going to see that people in the x-files are actually showing up now as characters, nazi characters,
very similar to the characters that they play, in terms of their villainy, in the series.
i have mulder finding that indeed it's jeffrey spender dressed as a nazi.
i got a chance to use some of my favourite '40s music here too, or '30s and '40s music, to transition scenes and it was kind of a thrill.
this was actually one of the less effective shots i did.
i had to sort of span time here a little bit, so it's a little bit of a pan across nothing, while i get mulder dressed or re-dressed and bring in the nazis coming down the corridors.
corey kaplan did such an amazing job - our production designer - on this episode.
she was able to take what was already there, which was quite beautiful, and authenticate it, make it look as if it were a completely period ship.
there are little visual references to the wizard of oz throughout, including that billboard you saw, the poster board you saw behind mulder.
here he ducks in to the ballroom as the nazis... just eluding the nazis who run past.
there are dancers here, but i had actually only about eight real expert dancers.
everybody else had to be taught how to dance in the sort of period style.
so every time we see this angle change, you'll see that there's another cut.
it requires some piece of machinery, piece of expertise, that's all done in continuous action.
what you're looking at, really, is take two of a very complicated sequence.
everyone had to hit their marks, say their lines properly, and the camera had to work just so.
i would have probably done this a few more times to get it just the way i wanted it.
i have to say it turned out amazingly well, in spite of the fact i only got to do it twice, because the wheelhouse started to leak with all the water we were pumping clown on it.
the folks at the queen mary actually forced us to shut clown.
so this was a stroke of just tremendous luck that we got what we got here.
they'd spent the night before having a few beers and going over their lines, so they were word-perfect.
along with scully, who had to move the action, not just by knowing her lines, but she actually marches...
she does a lot of very physical marching in and out of offices here and has to maintain a tone and keep her energy up through each piece of the film,
which all has to match, tonally, in an ever-rising and escalating sense of urgency.
mulder and scully are actually out of the x-files during the larger story arc here, so this is scully's office for now, which is why we're not in the x-files office.
the x-files office is being manned by agent spender, wno's mulder's half-brother, and a villain.
scully going to get help from skinner, who we'vejust seen in nazi dress, who offers her no help at all.
similarly as he's done, he seems like a villain here, as he appeared to us on the ship with mulder when we saw him at the end of the last act.
the cameraman needed to get out of the office behind gillian and get in front of her, so we needed to create some obstacles which we made human obstacles.
now, these elevator scenes are very tricky, because the cameraman has to get inside with scully, in the elevator, so he's gotta squeeze in, keeping his framing.
there was a cut there and i chose to have scully step on the woman's toe to hide the fact that she is now completely separated from that last scene that she did.
so, being in the elevator and getting out of it were shot as two different scenes.
the focus puller has a really difficultjob here, because each time the camera moves in and out and the subject matter changes its focus plane, the focus puller has to be exact.
if he's not, we get out-of-focus shots and we can't use those.
for the first time in a long time, (chuckles) she can't get out on her cellphone.
seems like that cellphone works everywhere but in the fbi elevator of all places.
this is a nice moment that chris owens created, looking off, creating a moment, so he's not just watching scully's action but he's thinking.
it was nice to be able to come off scully to chris owens.
this was, coming up, one of the most difficult scenes for the cameraman, when we jump out into the fbi parking garage and the lone gunmen pull up in their van.
the cameraman actually has to get in the van with them, sit down, and we see agent spender running behind.
the choreography of this, the timing, and the camera difficulty are...
it just was a superior effort by everyone to actually make this work in the time we had.
it was one of the first scenes that we shot, maybe actually the first scene, and the difficulty scared us all.
getting this scene, making sure the camera functioned as a character here, pushed into the action, made it feel alive and interesting throughout, in such close quarters, was daunting.
this was a really fun scene to shoot- these angry mob crowd scenes - because it always felt like it filled the frame and it kept everything intense, but it also felt at the same time, when you got into these tight corners,
like you couldn't move the camera as much as you wanted to.
we had moved from vancouver where we had been for five years.
we were all very nervous about the look of the show, and if it could still be scary enough, if we'd have enough atmosphere, which vancouver had so much of.
what we found and what we learned real quickly was that there were so many resources available that we didn't have in vancouver, in terms of location and things like the queen mary.
so this was one of the first episodes we did coming back from vancouver to los angeles.
see those whip pans and the cuts that are hidden there.
tight corners again for the cameraman, having to scoot down very, very narrow passageways.
there may have been... it's either 34 cuts in the whole picture, or 17 plus 34.
back in the ballroom here, with agent spender, or his nazi counterpart.
the amazing effort and attention to detail that the production folks, the art people on the show -
sandy getzler, in this case, the art director - were able to accomplish on a limited budget with limited time.
this ballroom will actually change over and become a decrepit version of itself in a later scene.
spender and scully in a sort of allusion to the earlier scene where scully had told spender what to do.
actually running beside the queen mary and having it all lit up, as you see.
we weren't able to empty the queen mary so if you look carefully you can see that there are tourists or diners on board, eating in the restaurants there.
now the use of split screen, which actually are cuts in themselves, but they make the action appear continuous with the sliding wipes.
it's a very effective use of an optical to continue the sense of real time.
the makeup and wardrobe and hair departments all worked overtime and had extra staff, extra personnel in to make sure everyone looked authentic.
these are actually some of the most beautiful scenes in the picture, as you get a chance to see not just the environment, but the extras so clearly.
it actually gave it an atmosphere that i had not imagined, so we lucked into that.
it was a great thrill to stage these fight scenes, to figure how to put the cuts in them, and get the woman hitting the man over the head with the bottle.
to keep the fighting interesting it had to look realistic, and yet it was all staged fighting which sometimes doesn't look realistic.
once again, the use of the wipe here - the optical wipe across - to get us back to scully and the lone gunmen who have now boarded the queen anne.
we are imagining this is in... that they have boarded the same ship as mulder.
it looks in every way like the same ship as the one mulder has boarded.
i'd imagined mulder and scully crawling on the floor with a lot more action around them.
i just couldn't figure out how to stage it because i didn't have the extras or scope.
mulder and scully are here in '39 trying to elude the nazis and it looks like they are dead meat here.
until a shot is fired, but no one's been hit but the nazi.
and now skinner, who's helped scully in the fbi, has revealed himself as a traitor to the nazis, helping mulder and scully get away.
gillian's dress was specially designed, actually, an original design by christine peters, who was the wardrobe designer on the episode.
so that was, for me, an inspiration for this scene where both scullys pass by one another and have a sense of one another, but how could they when they seem to be in two different time periods?
all the staging and the switching here from period to period is done by stopping the camera, starting the camera, holding, freezing the frame.
that... it is 1998 and this is indeed a ghost ship.
the changeover from the ballroom you've just seen, with the fight going on - a beautifully-appointed ballroom to this - that had to take place in the course of hours while we did other work that night.
that was the art department's hardest challenge on the show... doing things...
it's almost like we were producing a play and needed to move the scenery around while the actors were on stage.
not only do they kiss, which mulder and scully have never done to this point, but scully's got to land a punch on mulder.
when she threw that punch, i actually thought she had hit him.
with a camera now, slowly, with bubbles that we've added into the tank, slowly rising to the surface to find the same floating body that we saw in the beginning.
and the boat that we've added to the tank and the crew aboard that boat- that we are on... actually in the tank or afloat on the tank - pulling mulder out of the water.
it goes from bermuda down to puerto rico and back up to florida.
the queen anne is stuck here on the eastern edge of it.
all cinemas, theatres and other places of entertainment are to be closed immediately until further notice.
the evacuation of british children is going on smoothly and efficiently.
we pulled that down 45 minutes ago off the nro satellite, which early this morning sent a picture of a ship which inexplicably appeared in the middle of the atlantic.
the ss queen anne which by all accounts vanished without a trace over sixty years ago.
though her exact position was kept secret for fear spies might give her up to the axis.
it's been reasonably determined that the queen anne was just south of the plantagenet bank when she went missing.
i'm sorry, but i'm coming to you for help and i've got nowhere else to go.
i would hope that after everything that we have been through that you would at least have the courtesy and the decency and not to mention the respect to listen to what i have to say.
look, sir, if you know anybody at the office of naval intelligence it would be of great help.
i could lose my job, my pension, i could even be subject to legal action.
after poland, hitler's on his way to denmark, holland and france with a few stops in between.
the french all but roll over on us, the italians seize their opportunity and the japanese come through the back door.

how would i know that if i'd been in the water?

and as for the queen anne, it was nothing more than a ghost ship.
no, no, no, you and i were on that ship, scully, in 1 939.
tell her you'll pull her chart and call her within two days.
i don't know how i'm supposed to learn in this environment.
all i want to do is put a sterile dressing on to clean the wound.
i'll leave you some saline and gauze so you or your friend, can keep it clean.
the level of passion with which these people attack you, it's bizarre.
someone used the word "genocidal." said i was eradicating deaf culture.
mark, i wanted to know how she thought she was doing before my final assessment.
i tried to put myself in his shoes and be critical.
now i am so grateful to be putting all of myself into medicine.
and i want you to know there are no lingering hard feelings on my part.
i wouldn't have asked so many questions if you had told me what you were doing.
well, i'm sorry that you thought it was your business to ask me.
i don't know how i'm supposed to learn in this environment.
our relationship has turned adversarial and it's not good for the patients.

my parents died in a fire when i was a baby.
i was raised by my aunt in a little trailer park just west of corpus christi.
i heard harold scream, and i turned, and he was on fire.
i reached out for him, but the flames were too hot.
the housekeeper's statement takes you away from the scene of the fire.
but, uh, i would appreciate it if you didn't leave town right away.
it seemed like every time the gas company came out to fix one break... another one would spring up.
i can shut off the main outside, but you should really- really have that replaced.
i'd appreciate it if you'd leave the investigation to the police.
- a case like this could really make a cop's career.
which puts you right at the top of the list in the murder of harold kincade.
- not unless you have more than a suspect rap sheet.
look, deputy, why don't you get back out on patrol, huh?
we don't want the system to break down now, do we?
i had nothing to do with the death of your husband.
i could never do anything like that... especially to someone like you.
i have a picture of you outside che ling's apartment building.
he was kind enough to help me tie up some loose ends.
yesterday, burns and carver were blown to bits in a cabin owned by you.
it might look better if you didn't appear so anxious to get out of town.
that's kind of like jumping out of the fire into the fire, isn't it?
you think you know the truth about your father... and mr. lyle and who killed your mother.
he had a little girl who looked like she hadn't had a decent meal in weeks.
my wife's a sucker for the lazy and unmotivated, mr. burns.
i imagined you as a little girl with a pony and private schools... leading this charmed life like alice in wonderland.
my parents died in a fire when i was a baby.
[kristi] harold and i used to love this place... especially in the early years.
i don't wanna sound disrespectful... but your husband didn't seem to treat you very well.
you wanna tell me again why you came to clear bay?
i was on retainer to do some work for harold kincade.
i had nothing to do with the death of your husband.
- then explain why doris found all this in the guest room.
i've changed... and i hope that someday you'll understand that... embrace it.
this whole deal isn't worth the powder to blow it to hell.
jarod burns murdered my husband and then killed sheriff carver to cover his tracks.
it's just my good fortune that he screwed up and killed himself.
what you didn't see was sheriff carver and me go out the back door... before your homemade bomb blew it to bits.
oh, sheriff carver, he confessed to the murder of your husband... and he implicated you in the whole thing.
routine maintenance calls to the gas company about that pesky leak... before the "accidental"explosion.
the only thing that was missing was a patsy- a fall guy to come along and pin the whole thing on.
you think you know the truth about your father... and mr. lyle and who killed your mother.
but the fact is, you only know what the centre wants you to know.
you'd think maybe you could have told me this-- oh i don't know-- before i packed up my entire life!
you don't understand, grace has had a really-- what's in the hat box?
okay, you always tell me what you think of the men i date.
i'm talking about marriage, not rudy the jewish cowboy you met on the internet.
or have i reached that magic point in my career where every time somebody sees the virgin mary on a tortilla
i get called out of my basement warren to offer my special insight on the matter?
we won't get a clear idea of the situation unless someone talks.
if you make a phone call right now, it could compromise agent mulder.
gary, i wanna believe that you're protecting us, but, uh, i'm kind of afraid of that rifle.
it makes it hard for us actual people to concentrate on what you're saying.
it stopped being mark backus when he turned it into a zombie.
and then he instructed it by means of mental telepathy to attack me.
you see who's getting hurt if you bust down this door?
so far there's been very little communication between the police and the people inside...
there was a reason "hiding in the light" seemed so familiar.
i found it, or variations of it, in five other x-files.
what if it could induce a visual hallucination, a sort of temporary conversion disorder?
well, what you're describing would be more like some kind of a visual agnosia_
for my part, i'm happy to let this entire matter drop.
i'm sure i can persuade miss starns to do the same.
agent scully, i have to say i'm at a bit of a loss here.
do i infer correctly from this that you believe there's some merit to agent mulder's claims?
i believe that agent mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty.
aside from that belief, i can only present the few hard facts i've been able to gather.
furthermore, gregory pincus has apparently disappeared without a trace, along with half a dozen other key witnesses integral to this investigation.
among them, agent mulder's nurse at the hospital and several vinylright employees.
yes, mr. valenzuela, i'm calling on behalf of the vinylright corporation.
we would like to put a crisp $100 bill into your hands...
we're not gonna get a clearer idea of the situation unless someone in there talks to us.

because i guarantee i will not stand for another second of this abuse.
i'll have to ask you to come back in the morning.
i've come a long way, and i know he wants to see me, so what do you say?

well, there's a rule of thumb in charm city that says a woman who goes out alone is looking for a good time.
oh, and i suppose she was looking to get murdered as well?
that son of a bitch, higby, insisted she ran off somewhere.
by the time you reported her missing, elaine was already dead.
if i was accused of murder for every time i sent a woman a glass of wine,
i'd spend half my life with my thumb on the fingerprint pad.

jennifer gerrick and elaine beretta were both incapacitated by an electric shock before they were murdered.

we will use these to strike terror into the hearts of our enemies.

the bombs are constructed from land mines... so the materials can't be traced.
last night we sacrificed a mole... in order to protect a more important contact:
his alliance with terrorists arose partly as a way of continuing to rebel... partly because danger appeals to him.
so, betraying bright star to us makes it even more dangerous.

nobody comes in, nobody goes out, we're checking ids, looking for isabel martinez.
i froze this image at the peak of maiya's dimensional phase.
i think it's the universe's way of bringing them together so it can restore its balance.
but we have to put maiya and isabel in the same physical space.
but i know what you live for, jonathan: the art of the deal.
and you're not going to walk away from me that easily.
i've been invited to the taelon mother ship to discuss my candidacy with the head of the synod.
but everything that you've been through, are sure that you feel safe meeting zo'or on the mother ship?
we still have to buy us some time alone with maiya and isabel on the mother ship so they can merge.
we need a diversion big enough to draw the security out of the lab where they are holding maiya.
she appears to have liberation contacts, but we cannot prove her direct connection just yet.
in any event, she does not appear to be a liberation leader of any importance.
and you must also acknowledge that the companions are so well-admired,
that no candidate can win the presidency without the support of the taelon synod.
i can prove to you that the jaridian invasion is not just a possibility, it is a certainty.
if you're so worried about the jaridians, why don't you just pack your bags, get out of here, and leave us to fight them ourselves?
i agree to accelerate the human bioengineering programs, you support my bid for the presidency.
the synod will officially endorse you over president thompson, and guarantee that you will become the next president.
we felt each other's the presence even before we ever met.
we come from different worlds, but we know we are one.
can you tell us the result of his meeting with zo'or?
well, i think it's certainly fair to say that zo'or fancies my chances against president thompson.
did zo'or say that he was pulling his support from president thompson?
no, actually, the only time he ever mentioned the president was to say he was in the taelons' pocket.
i took the liberty of marking up this likeness of kayla, your counterpart in maiya's world.
that's really strange, looking at your own face, especially when it doesn't belong to you.
what is the effect of having both maiya and isabel present in this dimension?
i mean, doesn't that violate the physical laws of the universe?
i have to admit that my initial reaction was to reject it out of hand.
but we've all witnessed the momentum that even my potential candidacy has generated.
i know you, you all have questions and i'll try to answer some of them.
but first, my lawyers have worked out an agreement with the attorney general.
and the dimensional phasing that you're experiencing is caused by both you and isabel being physically present in the same dimension.
you and i didn't have the same problem in maiya's dimension.
assuming your theories are correct, what sort of adjustment will our universe make?
i believe the universe will adjust itself to its natural order.
i took a reading the last time you went through a dimensional phase.
when a dimensional phase hits, it looks like you lose density.
yeah, it is as if his body is trying to reduce itself to its core necessities and ridding itself of the excess.
my guess is that the same phasing is happening to isabel.
i froze this image at the peak of maiya's dimensional phase.
and isabel must be the mirror image of maiya when she phases.
we'll send isabel to the ship as part of the doors' security team.
we still have to buy us some time alone with maiya and isabel on the mother ship so they can merge.
we need a diversion big enough to draw the security out of the lab where they are holding maiya.
on a ship at sea the worst possible disaster is a fire.
if you're so worried about the jaridians, why don't you just pack your bags, get out of here, and leave us to fight them ourselves?
i'm giving you an opportunity to elevate yourself and save your people.
the synod will officially endorse you over president thompson, and guarantee that you will become the next president.
i assume that when you were hunting me, you had my psychological profile prepared.
we come from different worlds, but we know we are one.
as long as one of us lives, neither one of us will be truly gone.
no, actually, the only time he ever mentioned the president was to say he was in the taelons' pocket.
how did you respond when zo'or offered to back your candidacy?
i took the liberty of marking up this likeness of kayla, your counterpart in maiya's world.

a colony of rogue telepaths have been unwisely allowed to take up residence here.
since they're humans, they fall under the jurisdiction of earth law.
the rogues have engaged in unauthorized scans of several dozen ambassadors.
they have extracted an unknown amount of privileged information intending to exchange those secrets for a homeworld of their own.
they have reportedly begun a hunger strike which they believe will create sympathy for their cause.
this is all fine by me since it means that group one is already contained.
several bloodhound units are already on patrol running them to ground.
several of them broke into an armory last night seizing an unknown number of ppg rifles and handguns.
in that way, these are our children who have gone astray.
we have to at least try to bring them in alive so that we can correct their thinking.
and so have my people, at least the ones out there.
i can help, but you have to remove the psi cops first.
my people will do anything necessary to keep from going back to the psi corps.
i believe i can get them to back off if i talk to them directly but if any of us leave here we'll be arrested.
and there's nobody who loves you enough to even question it.
see, the truth is i don't care if i go up for your murder or not not after what you did to me.
he came up with a set of rules to prevent them from turning against mankind.
the cybertechs adopted them in the early pre-ban experiments and i've found them useful myself from time to time.
before we finished adjusting you i made sure we planted asimov's two most important rules in your mind:
you cannot harm me directly or, through inaction, allow harm to come to me.
to make it harder for someone else to break the conditioning i put the block in the part of your brain that controls the neural system.
you can want to kill me as much as you want the same way i can say "i wanna raise this hand. "
well i'd love to stay and chat, mr. garibaldi but i just have so much work to do.
be sure and turn out the lights on your way out.
swore to find a better way for us, for our people.
without violence, without preying on our own kind or letting others prey on us.

we demand the release of byron and all others like us who have been taken into custody safe passage off babylon 5 to neutral territory and the commencement of negotiations aimed toward creating a homeworld for telepaths.
you have two hours to comply or we will begin the executions.
we welded half the doors shut, the other half are guarded by psi cops.
there must be other ways, too small for them to bother with.
his injuries will be less than yours or theirs if you try to interfere with us.
try that again and we'll kill five at a time instead of just one.
but if we go in while bester's still in charge they will panic and kill the hostages.
unless we want to give in, give them what they want.
it is not the policy of the interstellar alliance or this station to bargain with terrorists for the lives of hostages.
if we open that door even once we will never be able to close it again.
if your people or bester interfere, i won't be able to control them.
after we've had some time together i and those directly responsible for the recent violence will surrender.
i want your personal guarantee that the rest of my people...
those who harmed no one will be allowed to leave the station in peace.
captain this is the only way to end this without further bloodshed.
those responsible for the violence will surrender and the innocent will leave.
we'll program it to take your people back to brown level, but nowhere else.
there will be no interference from bester's people and those not involved with the violence will be allowed to leave.
you cannot save my life but you can save my soul.
i called you my willow the strength that would survive me and shelter those who follow.
well, it may be nothing, but i watched him while we were stuck in medlab.

do you think we should put this on a business footing?
you mean, how much will i pay you to dish the dirt on your friends?
it now belongs to the master, who i know will put it to good use.
don't think i'll let you waste ã3 million on a bunch of nutters!
you may not like the sound of this, but ã3 million is peanuts.
if money isn't an issue with craigie and chris wainwright, what is?
30 seconds later the lights go up and craigie has a knife in his ribs.
no fingerprints on the handle and any on the blade wiped as it went in.
you give me the film you shot and i won't nick you for it.
so when do we get the full story, then, chief inspector?
as i told mr gibbs, whoever gets the money may have had a good reason to kill him.
he leaves the lodge jointly to you, miss cuttle... and guess who else?
tim, there's one more thing i need to know from you.
that night of the storm when the cannonball fell, were you up on the roof?
'give them to me,' he said, like i was a servant!
and i thought of her, and how miserable he had made her over all those years.
and, that a girl like that should end up in a place like this.
i poured them into my hand and put them in my pocket.
the bunny boy was just turning in last night when he heard a "chrook chrook".
and there was alan, digging a hole - using my spade, i might add, which he borrowed last week.
i don't care how you earn a living, alan, as long as you do.
so i work my guts out and gray patterson gets the attention?
if i were 50 years younger, she wouldn't have stood a chance.
you know, 10 minutes in your company and i feel... ..better.
it's no surprise that alan isn't here to face the charges, nor is reg buckley, the so-called company secretary.
i've asked the police to investigate and we await their response.
ask reg by all means, but leave her out of it.
now, i'm not saying we do anything illegal, but why don't we stroll round to alan's house en masse?
meantime, i'd like a list of everyone who invested in the mill, please.
why would a woman grass on a bundle of fun like reg?
to be honest, i thought it was my ex-boyfriend, but then two people got out, stocking masks,
one of them punched me in the face and bundled me in the back.
"all he could see when you offered him the glass was another whisky."
there's a rogue print, just one, on the whisky bottle we found beside alan's body.
we have, but the same techniques can be used on others.
in the meantime, birkoff has exacted a location... from the group's last encoded command set.
i'm gonna put this hood on your head... and we're out of here.
if anybody had found out you'd seen this place... you'd never leave here, ever.
who knows what he will accomplish or how many people will benefit if he lives?
you want to lock him up because that's what the rule book says?
but is it worth holding up a dozen other operations that need his attention?
we've tried for two years to get sourced into this group.
i'm not gonna do anything for anybody until somebody lets me talk to my mom.
go tell that to the guy with the bullfrog in his throat who thinks he's in charge.
he probably didn't, but they wanted to make sure... before they kill him.
now we're going to go back to your room, and we're gonna get your things.
i'm trying to figure out if the location greg extracted from the code is real.
he says he can make the problem go away if we let him go.
before we can release you... you will need to sign several non-disclosure statements.
then take a binding oath in the presence of an international officer.
would you like me to scream and wake up all the people?
if i kick the shit out of you you'll never forget me.
but how else could i get drunk if not like a pig?
there's no other animal so similar to the man than the pig.
there's no other disgusting animal in this world than the pig.
when the evil was driven away by god's son out of the man, he hid among pigs.
i bought this from the airport in new york, seven dollars...
we wanted this to be a surprise but this blockhead ruined everything.
you were saying you're waiting for the citizenship before coming here.
it will be easier for me to come when i have the citizenship.
i would have stayed more with them but i needed money to come and see you.
so, i went back to new york to earn money so that i can come here to you.
and after the revolution who was sent to america using relations?
nicu, who after 5 years is still washing leibovici's plates and toilets!
these assholes put some bromide in my food to make fun of me.
it is said there're some who grill meat rolls out of human flesh.
i don't know where you are now and i don't even want to know.
don't you dare see me again with or without your tank!
all newborn animals are blind for a few days or a few weeks.
but pigs are born with a film on their eyes that dissolves in the first light of day.
i want a white wedding and i want to have a baby.
i'd have liked one with you but fate was against it.
one night on the pig farm a sow had a litter of twelve.
they drove me crazy with their squealing, they were so scared and hungry.

would you like me to scream and wake up all the people?
if i kick the shit out of you you'll never forget me.
this is what happens when you get drunk like a pig.
but how else could i get drunk if not like a pig?
there's no other animal so similar to the man than the pig.
there's no other disgusting animal in this world than the pig.
all the animals are blind for a while when they are born, a few days or a few weeks.
only the pigs have a kind of cloth on their eyes, when they are born which disappears with the first sunray.
i would have stayed more with them but i needed money to come and see you.
so, i went back to new york to earn money so that i can come here to you.

the commonality links all taelons, but it does not allow us into every corner of each other's minds.
by rejoining the commonality, da'an has accomplished something only the kimera could do.
now, at that time patient j was diagnosed with a severe paranoia, induced dementia which manifested itself with violent psychotic episodes.
after a few days of what my colleagues so flatteringly refer to as the barrow treatment,
certain that this meant his end was imminent, the servant begged to be sent to the outpost of ger'om, which po'om honored.
later that day po'om went to the marketplace and asked death why he had smiled at the servant.
and i already explained that if you do not deliver what you promised
i have a dozen other scientists willing to take your place.
at this distance from the earth the subject should respond within 2 days.
and will the subject be cognizant of what's happening to him?
for the kimera the shaqarava embodied the essence and totality of their race.
but the taelons could not control the violence that the shaqarava allowed.
i mean, he won't ask da'an, because he doesn't trust him either.
but if it's true, you can bet the taelons are behind it somehow.
do you anticipate any negative reaction to our bringing the ship so close to the earth's surface?
after due consideration president thompson was so anxious for the american people to get an opportunity to view the mother ship up close, he practically volunteered to pilot it himself.
jonathan, if da'an was against us we'd be destroyed by now.
how do you know he's not timing our destruction to the point when it serve him best?

barrow assured us his equipment would be functional from long range.
there's a transmission beaming from the mother ship in a wide radius over the city.
i have absolutely no reference for this in any of the operating manuals.
you'll have to download the information directly from the bridge computer.
which means you're going to have to create a diversion in order to collect the data so we won't be detected.
no, david, i would love to get together it would be fun...
maybe you want to stop by the office we'll grab a bite?
so, if you just wanna hit some we don't have to keep score...
if you've been playing and you're really looking for competition you should just go to the club and try to pick up a game.
and i would say, well, i can't do anything, but i need to work.
this is bull, i can't be walking around here without a job.
but she had no reaction like you know how when you vomit it's sort of violent, and you think you're dying and you're sweaty and red?
she just finished her pie and calmly vomited all, right into the pie dish and slowly got up and paid her check.
and then all the waiters looked to the new girl that was me, and they said,
"we'll give you an extra five bucks if you clean up the puke."
exactly and if you can psyche him now, a week before the match...
what you should start to do, is start calling him all the time.
they're crystals that you just put on a flat surface and then you grind them into a powder...
and then you take this powder and snort it up your nose.
and we shared the same room, slept in the same bed, because a good night's sleep is for the idle rich and my mom made all the arrangements so we had to be in bed together, and we went out to dinner, before we went to bed.
we were sleeping and about 2:00 in the morning, my mom turns to me and says,
you probably don't have the same hand/eye coordination you used to.
that's why i figured, if i get you out and start training you every day you'll get the old reactions back, you'll get the "eye of the tiger".
i went out with one guy that was so young he still lived at home with his parents.
his mom and dad would encourage me to just take him in.
he got a job in the states and wants me to come.
she wants to marry the pacard boy and go off to america.
how can i go on... now that i know... that i'm a monster?
is that what you and she knew, that i was supposed to know too?
if you shoot him, right away you're gonna have sympathy on your side
media is gonna be all over this, like horseshit on a race track
the scene where king kong attacks the village to get that screaming woman.
he attacks the village and he forces his way through these 2 giant doors.
that's the scene they use for the poster kong breaking through the giant doors.
they built a wall, to keep out this giant gorilla .
mike, i'm not gonna discuss the fact that you're a fucking cop.
we've known each other since 16 years, i am your fucking friend.
i don't get it harry,how could you have possibly lost all that money?
not one of those horndogs had their eyes on one thing but my boobs the whole entire night .
he's a fucking bookie, let the cops bring him in .
this has nothing to do with me being a cop, i gambled, i lost, i owe him.
it's your wife do you know that you're husband owns louie 13000$ ?
why don't you tell your wife what you spent the money on?
dostoievski once wrote a letter to his wife in which he described his sensation of having an orgasm.
after he lost a conisderable amount of money at the roulette table.
you understand me, never, it doesnt pay in the long run.
and while you're in prison, try to read a little, not dostoievski but some mark twain.
you don't want me to wack chicago because there's a bullshit code that don't let you welch on a bet but you're gonna rob a loanshark to pay it off.
if i don't pay back chicago, he's gonna fucking own me.
i'm gonna get down deep in this connection keep on tangling' with your wires
seems to me it's about a guy singing about a shortage in his wiring system.
i've lost something of mine, that brought me alot of good luck in the past.
and i just wanted to have something of yours for luck.
excuse me, could i have a piece of apple pie ?
with some vanilla ice cream on top it's ok esmeralda, get him some pie.
* i'm so darn glad he let me try it again *
* 'cause my last time on earth, i lived a whole world of... *
if erica lancaster found out about the affair... certainly is motive.
from the time her plane landed until she caught her cab,
erica had plenty of time to get to the bridge, kill sam and get back.
or is the other woman our killer, and how do we find her?
this key could be to a gym locker or a bike lock.
this could be an office key, or a home key, but this little guy here...
bomb squad was on the scene last night responding to calls of suspicious activity, but they didn't find a thing.
sam mcfarland's marriage proposal plans may have stopped more than traffic.
did you know that when egyptian princesses died, they weren't embalmed for several days to prevent necrophilia.
the natural degradation of the human body made it unappealing, even to the most deviant of men.
report said there was no forced entry, suggesting that the victim knew her killer, so i checked her brain chemistry, and detected significantly elevated glutamate levels.
which means our victim was in a heightened emotional state just prior to the attack.
picasso sold her the blotter, but he did not hit her, nor was his tongue anywhere near her stomach.
i got some good news from the dna we pulled off the salt rimmer.
you still didn't explain to me how your blood ended up on vanessa may's jacket.
she had ringside seats, so maybe she took home a souvenir.
all right, so i guess it's true what they say-- you get hit in the head one too many times, and you start forgetting things.
but lucky for us, we got a way to make you remember what happened.
all we know is that they both lost their lives on the brooklyn bridge yesterday.
suicide victims usually leave evidence of their existence at the site of the jump.
patches laced with dynamite are used to treat the bite of the brown recluse spider.
and because of her job at the museum, she was traveling through the southern united states, and that's where she was bitten.
she could have transferred the dynamite to the tie any number of ways before he was strangled with it.
and even if she did strangle him, it doesn't prove she killed him because we can't put the murder weapon in her hands.
so erica lancaster applied the patch and then tugged on sam mcfarland's tie that morning.
so it was an act of affection and not violence that led to the transfer of the dynamite onto the shirt and the tie.
i'm sure this is a very proud moment for all of them.
you didn't just show up and discover the body in the morning, you were there all night.
she's got to go back to london, but i've been prepared for this from the start.
we both knew we had two weeks together, and then that's it.
you need that too, because a thief could just tear this up.
we have to have a party in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.
so i had to invite him to a party if i wanted to see him outside of work.
and now i have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
as much as i'd like to meet josh and warn him emily and i won't be here.
she's gonna come by to say goodbye and then i've got a special evening planned.
rachel wants me to be funny, you don't want me to be funny.
from now on, i'm gonna be funny sometimes, and not funny others.
that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends asking to hear stories about you looking through monica's photo albums.
you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.
and now i have created the perfect opportunity to seduce him.
as much as i'd like to meet josh and warn him emily and i won't be here.
did she tell you that when she was little she was partially responsible for new legislation regulating the strength of swing sets?
then what are you going to put on top of that?
you've got 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.
and you're sitting here in a hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.
well, joshua's coming in tomorrow and since i don't have the guts to ask him out,
- i'm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.
they were so ornate and beautiful, i mean look at that!
i don't know how museums work in england but, here, you're not supposed to take stuff.
yeah, but what am i gonna do, i mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, y'know no commitment.
ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through monica's photo albums, i mean you don't do that if you're just in it for two weeks.

i just want to go over there and grab him and kiss him.
how could i kiss him without letting him know that i like him?
i thought that if i could get you here i could seduce you.
uh, i don't wear suits to work and i bought six of them from you.
you've got, like, 14 hours until she has to be at the airport.

i mean, i loved the attention but i just couldn't handle the impact.
i felt sort of pigeon holed... um, sort of like i couldn't breathe anymore.
[harry] we'd like you to go back to the place where you left off.
i know deadlines are a horrible sort of nuisance... but we would need to move on this immediately.
i mean, we really have to get something in to them.
i think i need to get out of town right now.
i just don't want to be with you like that right now.
so basically she left him when i was 12, and we moved back here... and he stayed there... in his house, on top of a hill.
i wouldn't consider her for anything without knowing who she is.
i wasn't saying that you would want to consider her without knowing who she is.

so basically she left him when i was 12, and we moved back here and he stayed there, in his house, on top of a hill.
look, i realize that this is late, but this is her piece.
this is what she wanted to use and i would like you to at least consider it.
i mean, i loved the attention but i just couldn't handle the impact.
i felt sort of pigeon holed... um, sort of like i couldn't breathe anymore.

i think i need to get out of town right now.
that is a... a really fucked-up thing to say to me.
you don't know shit about me and lucy, and i don't know what greta has been telling you, but she is fucking gone.
i mean, i loved the attention but i just couldn't handle the impact.
i felt sort of pigeon holed... um, sort of like i couldn't breathe anymore.

we got a good-looking kid who didn't come home last night.
what i'm saying here is that it's not beyond the realm of human possibility that the young man is out having himself a good time.
it's obvious the kid is out racking up some rrs and he's lost touch of time.
now, the paper has chosen me to pinch hit for him.
why don't i take the paper while you stay here and wait for gary to call?
if anybody should fill in for gary, it should me moi, not toi.
what did it look like i was doing on the roof?
to tell you the truth, looked like you pushed that fella off the roof.
i don't care if you ripped off a... a busload of nuns.
all i want to know is, where did you find the wallet?
the only reason you're sitting here instead of in the station house right now is because i've got a couple of good friends down there.
now, i need to know where you found the wallet, and i need to know now.
i think if i heard that i couldn't go for any reason,
i'd have to say that would be the single most crushing blow of my life.
listen dougal, i've been thinking about things and i think it would be better if i didn't go to america.
i think we'd all be happiest where we belong, on craggy island.
i think if i heard that i couldn't go for any reason,

i think we'd all be happiest where we belong, on craggy island.
as long as we can all go to america, that's the important thing.
i think if i heard that i couldn't go for any reason,
we had two bags of grass... 75 pellets of mescaline... five sheets of high-powered blotter acid... a salt shaker half-full of cocaine... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer...
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car ?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
- 'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency... and they'll run us down like dogs.
it's the mint 400... the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle... in honor of some fatback grosero... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
how else can you cover a thing like this righteously ?
well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards ?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
- when it comes to a thing like this, they don't fool around.
number 45 riding in the number-four position... is choking as the dust flies !
you'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face !
total control now... tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas.
two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted.
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think, "what's happening here ?"
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.
bazooko circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday night... if the nazis had won the war.
- let me make sure i've got this all lined up.
you want me to, uh... throw this into the tub when "white rabbit" peaks, is that it ?
that sense of inevitable victory... over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense-- we didn't need that.
- ~ that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scared me half to death ~
- maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour...
- ~ that ain't the way to have fun, son ~ - for 48 consecutive hours.
just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.
well... they must have, uh, brought the car around by now.
these cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in one of these backstreet motels... hang pictures of jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
if we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.
- ~ yummy, yummy, yummy i've got love in my tummy ~ - ~
let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon.
i welcome you... to the third national d.a.'s convention... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
and now, without further ado... the man who will define this cancer eating at the heart of america...
you've got to be crazy on acid to think a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.
you will notice that i have distinguished... four-- four distinct states of being... in the cannabis or marijuana society.
if he figures out what is happening... then he can rise one notch... and become hip.
and then if he can convince himself... to approve of what is happening... then he becomes groovy.
you will not be able to see his eyes, because of tea-shades... but his knuckles will be white from inner tension.
and his pants will be crusted with semen... from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim.
and when you scream for help... you'll sound like a raccoon.
man, i'll try just about anything... but i'd never in hell touch a pineal gland.
the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic... that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip...
- and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.
i know what that means, you fat goddamn pimp bastard !
that's the name of a horse i used to own, ma'am.
the only chance now, i felt... was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess... that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us... could possibly believe it.
fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.
what leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole lifestyle... that he helped create.
a generation of permanent cripples... failed seekers... who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
~ i'm jumpin' jack flash it's a gas, gas, gas ~
~ i was drowned i was washed up and left for dead ~
~ lf you see it once you'll never be the same again ~
~ i gotta keep on runnin' gonna have me some fun ~
- suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us... and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats...
- [ bats screeching ] - all swooping and screeching and diving around the car.
- ~ ohh, ohh, yeah ~ - ~ hey, hey, feel with me, baby ~
- [ grunting ] - ~ 'cause i feel it comin' on ~
female newscaster ] a house subcommittee report says illegal drugs killed... 160 american g.i.s last year... 40 of them in vietnam.
- [ tuning ] - ~ one toke over the line sweet jesus ~
this same lonely desert was the last known home of the manson family.
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car ?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.

i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
number 45 riding in the number-four position... is choking as the dust flies !
you'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face !
[ duke narrating ] total control now... tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas.
two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted.
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.
bazooko circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday night... if the nazis had won the war.
[ panting ] when the rabbit bites its own head off...
i want you to throw that fuckin' radio... into the tub with me.
uh, clearly i was a victim of the drug explosion... a natural street freak just eating whatever came by.
[ voice extremely slowed down ] does anybody want some lsd ?
[ voice slowed down, echoing ] well, all this white stuff... on my sleeve... is lsd.
[ duke narrating ] with a bit of luck... his life was ruined forever... always thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars... men in red woolen shirts... are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know.
just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.
but he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
see you have two cases of beer, a basket of grapefruit... stack of t-shirts and towels, light bulbs.
- you realize what you did when you drive like that ?
what i put in my book, as of noon... is that i apprehended you for driving too fast.
- i advised you to proceed to the next rest area.
finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.
well... they must have, uh, brought the car around by now.
well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.
even if you manage to beat that, they'll still send you back to nevada... for rape and consensual sodomy.
~ yummy, yummy, yummy i've got love in my tummy ~
- ~ and i feel like loving you ~ - [ horn honking ]
[ man ] i welcome you... to the third national d.a.'s convention... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
and now, without further ado... the man who will define this cancer eating at the heart of america...
you've got to be crazy on acid to think a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.
you will notice that i have distinguished... four-- four distinct states of being... in the cannabis or marijuana society.
you will not be able to see his eyes, because of tea-shades... but his knuckles will be white from inner tension.
and his pants will be crusted with semen... from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim.
- [ ringing continues ] - [ metal gate slams ]
those two men in the dock, they gave me the lsd.
- [ duke muttering ] - [ man ] they continue killing innocent people !
[ echoing ] allowing the hopes for peace and freedom of millions of people... to be suffocated.
what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds ?
would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries ?
bit off the head of the bartender, then the cops came and took him away.
- [ yells ] - [ man ] is that your car ?
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip...
- [ shouts ] - and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
i know what that means, you fat goddamn pimp bastard !
that's the name of a horse i used to own, ma'am.
what leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole lifestyle... that he helped create.
a generation of permanent cripples... failed seekers... who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
~ i'm jumpin' jack flash it's a gas, gas, gas ~
~ i was drowned i was washed up and left for dead ~
~ lf you see it once you'll never be the same again ~
~ i gotta keep on runnin' gonna have me some fun ~
we had 2 bags of grass, 75 pellets of mescaline, 5 sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether ...
there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and i knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
a house subcommittee report says, illegal drugs killed 160 american gis last year,
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency and they'll run us down like dogs.
you just backed over a two-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what were you going about, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards?
we were gathered here in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
when it comes to a thing like this, they don't fool around.
ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the start of the $50,000 mint 400 desert race.
with a purse of $50,000 going to the winner of this grueling, gut-wrenching, dust-eating, in-your-face motocross extravaganza!
why should i pay my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be hep.
for just 99 cents, your likeness will appear 200 feet tall on a screen over downtown las vegas.
for just 99 cents more you can have a voice message!
and, sweet jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a sunday morning,
still humping the american dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last-minute, pre-dawn chaos of a stale vegas casino.
i decided to eat only half of the acid at first.
but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woolen shirt.
that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense, we didn't need that.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than 5 years later, you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark, that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.
here i was, alone in las vegas, completely twisted on drugs.
no cash, no story for the magazine, and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.
but he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.

i advised you to proceed to the next rest area ...
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that i would never understand.
these cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in one of these backstreet motels, hang pictures of jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
if we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.
in a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into some sort of towering jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd,
dragged her to a vegas hotel room and then savagely penetrated every orifice in her little body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.
even if you manage to beat that, they'll still send you back to nevada for rape and consensual sodomy.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?
i welcome you to the third national d.a.'s convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
if he figures out what is happening then he can rise one notch and become hip.
and then if he can convince himself to approve of what is happening, then he becomes groovy.
and when you scream for help, you'll sound like a raccoon.
man, i'll try just about anything, but i'd never in hell touch a pineal gland.
what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?
just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.
that way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we?
the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip.
and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.
the glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.
she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.

it's the mint 400... the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle... in honor of some fatback grosero... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
how else can you cover a thing like this righteously ?
well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards ?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
total control now... tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas.
two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted.
after a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing... provided we would stand quietly in the back and not smoke.
ladies and gentlemen... the desert inn is proud to present the one, the only... the incomparable miss debbie reynolds !
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think, "what's happening here ?"
when it comes to that fantastic note... when the rabbit bites its own head off...
i want you to throw that fuckin' radio... into the tub with me.
that sense of inevitable victory... over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense-- we didn't need that.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than five years later... you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west... and with the right kind of eyes... you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke... and rolled back.
- ~ that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scared me half to death ~
- maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour...
- ~ that ain't the way to have fun, son ~ - for 48 consecutive hours.
just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters... that i would never understand.
what if i just jump on you and beat the dog shit out of you ?
would that make you feel any better, you filthy bastard ?
well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.
even if you manage to beat that, they'll still send you back to nevada... for rape and consensual sodomy.
- ~ yummy, yummy, yummy i've got love in my tummy ~

fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.

24 hours ago we were... .. in the polo lounge of the beverly heights hotel, in the patio section, of course, drinking singapore slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of our lord... 1971.
perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir.
it's the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in history.
it's a fantastic spectacle in honour of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious mint hotel in las vegas.
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
the store was closed, but the salesman said he would wait if we hurried.
we were gathered here in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
when it comes to a thing like this, you don't fool around.
you can watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.
you approach the turnstiles, and know that when you get there you have to give the man $2 or he won't let you in.
was i just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind?
or had i really come to las vegas to work on a story?
and sweet jesus, there are a lot of them at 4.30 on a sunday morning.
still humping the american dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the pre-dawn chaos of a stale vegas casino.
i just wanted to cut a little z in your forehead.
get back in the tub, eat some reds and try to calm down.
it seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again.
san francisco in the middle '60s was a very special time and place to be a part of.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in las vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark, that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.

i welcome you to the third national da's convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
the most efficient way for us to do this is for each one of us to try and attempt to imagine what it is like inside of the possessed mind of the addict.
for example, a dope fiend refers to the reefer butt as a roach, because it resembles a cockroach.
if he figures out what is happening, he can rise one notch and become hip.
then, if he can convince himself... .. to approve of what is happening, then he becomes groovy.
any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.
one stitch in time, on him, will usually save nine, on you.
he offered me human blood, said it would take me higher than i'd been.
i thought he was kidding, so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome.
what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these fries, these puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?
and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a crust.
these were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.
he'll be posing as a politician, but you'll have no problem recognising him.
inspector rock will pay you, in cash, $1,000 on the ninth of every month.

it's the mint 400... the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle... in honor of some fatback grosero... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
why should i pay my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you... but in my line of business it's important to be hip.

not in any mean or military sense- we didn't need that.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than five years later... you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west... and with the right kind of eyes... you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke... and rolled back.

the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.

- she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.
the only chance now, i felt... was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess... that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us... could possibly believe it.
fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.

we were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press.

the mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column, which is interesting.
you can watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.
some son of a bitch just kicked me in the back.
the bartender wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
when it comes to that fantastic note when the rabbit bites its own head off,
i want you to throw that fucking radio into... the tub... with me.
san francisco in the middle '60s was a very special time and place to be a part of.
but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world, whatever it meant.
maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
the bill was a factor, i think, because i had no money to pay for it.
lord, just give me five more hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.

they gave me the lsd and they took me to the hotel.
i don't know what they done to me but i remember it was horrible.
what kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song at this moment?

all those pathetically eager acid freaks... who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.
a generation of permanent cripples... failed seekers... who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force... is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
just a flat out high-speed burn through baker and barstow and berdoo.
then onto the hollywood freeway, straight into frantic oblivion... safety, obscurity.
we had two bags of grass... 75 pellets of mescaline... five sheets of high-powered blotter acid... a salt shaker half-full of cocaine... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.

if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.
all right, let's get right to the heart of this thing.
- twenty-four hours ago we were sitting... - ... in the pogo lounge... of the beverly heights hotel, in the patio section, of course... drinking singapore slings with mescal on the side... hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of our lord, 1971.
it's the mint 400... the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle... in honor of some fatback grosero... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
why should i pay my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you... but in my line of business it's important to be hip.
after a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing... provided we would stand quietly in the back and not smoke.
ladies and gentlemen... the desert inn is proud to present the one, the only... the incomparable miss debbie reynolds!
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think, "what's happening here?"
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.
bazooko circus is what the whole hep world would be doing saturday night... if the nazis had won the war.
- ~ that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scared me half to death ~
- maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour...
- ~ that ain't the way to have fun, son ~ - for 48 consecutive hours.
just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
see you have two cases of beer, a basket of grapefruit... stack of t-shirts and towels, light bulbs.
- you realize what you did when you drive like that?
finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship.
well... they must have, uh, brought the car around by now.
these cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in one of these backstreet motels... hang pictures of jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
if we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?
i welcome you... to the third national d.a.'s convention... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
and when you scream for help... you'll sound like a raccoon.
man, i'll try just about anything... but i'd never in hell touch a pineal gland.
maybe so... but then why all this booze... and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard... that had dried to a hard, yellow crust?
these were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.
just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.
that way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we?

the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.
the only chance now, i felt... was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess... that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us... could possibly believe it.
fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.

if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
- 'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency... and they'll run us down like dogs.
- jesus, did i say that, or just think it ?
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.

you want me to, uh... throw this into the tub when "white rabbit" peaks, is that it ?
here i was... alone in las vegas, completely twisted on drugs.
no cash, no story for the magazine... and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.

one of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug.
especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.
and, sweet jesus, there are a hell of a lot of them at 4:30 on a sunday morning,
still humping the american dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the last-minute, pre-dawn chaos of a stale vegas casino.
i decided to eat only half of the acid at first.

and now, without further ado, the man who will define this cancer eating at the heart of america.
if he figures out what is happening then he can rise one notch and become hip.
and then if he can convince himself to approve of what is happening, then he becomes groovy.
you will not be able to see his eyes, because of tea shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension.

those two men in the dock, they gave me the lsd and they took me to the hotel.

the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.

also a quart of tequila, quart of rum, case of beer, pint of raw ether ... and 2 dozen amyls.
not that we needed all that for the trip ... but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency ... is to push it as far as you can.
the only thing that really worried me ... was the ether.
there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible ... and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge.
and i knew we'd get ... into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
this same lonely desert was the last home of the manson family.

the store was closed but the salesman said he would wait if we hurried.

it was to be a classic affirmation of everything ... right in the national character; a physical salute to the fantastic ... possibilities of life in this country.
but only for those with true grit and ... we are chock full of that, man.

it'll be a miracle if we're there before you turn into a animal.
we were, after all the absolute cream ... of the national sporting press.
we were gathered here in las vegas for ... this very special moment in sport.
you better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face ...
there was something like a 190 more bikes waiting to start.
a crab louie and a quart of le piat's ... muscatel for 20 dollars.
i advise you to drive over to the tropicana and pick up on guy lombardo.
- well, why should i pay my hard-earned ... dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you but in my line of ... business it's important to be hep.
total loss of all basic motor skills: blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue.
the mind recoils in horror unable to ... communicate with the spinal column.
which is interesting because you can ... actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way ... but you can't control it.

with a bit of luck his life was ruined forever ...

there was a fantastic universal sense that whatever we were doing was right ... that we were winning.
and that, i think, was the handle ... that sense of inevitable victory over the forces of old and evil.
the bill was a factor, i think because i had no ... money to pay for it.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere ... between 29 and 36 dollars per hour ... for 48 consecutive hours.
do me one last favour, lord just give me 5 more high speed hours before you ... bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this god-damn car and ... off this horrible desert.

the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.

well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
christ, if we keep her full ... of acid, that's more like 2 grand a day.
there was absolutely no choice but to cut her adrift and ... hope her memory was fucked.
- here's an extra ten bucks, buddy, make sure she gets there safe.
i welcome you to the third national da's convention ... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.

you will not be able to see his eyes ... because of t-shades but his knuckles will be white from inner tension.

i don't know what they done to me but i remember it was horrible.
he offered ... me human blood, said it would take me higher than i'd ever been in my life.
i thought he was kidding so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so ... of pure adrenochrome.

man, i'll try just about anything but i'd never in hell touch ... a pineal gland.
maybe you could just shove me into the pool, or ...
man, if i put you in the pool right now you'll sink like a ... god-damn stone.
what kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?
when i came to the general back-alley ambience of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul.
what addict would need all these coconut husks and honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?
north vegas is where you go when you have fucked up too often on the strip.

we had two bags of grass... 75 pellets of mescaline... five sheets of high-powered blotter acid... a salt shaker half-full of cocaine... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer...
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car ?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency... and they'll run us down like dogs.
- jesus, did i say that, or just think it ?
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
[ duke narrating ] the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
- when it comes to a thing like this, they don't fool around.
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think, "what's happening here ?"
so they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside.
- ~ [ drum roll ] - [ announcer ] ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls...
- get out of my way, you-- - [ elephant trumpets ]
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.
for just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 feet tall... on a screen over downtown las vegas.
for just 99 cents more you can have a voice message !
- ~ and the red queen's "off with her head" ~ - [ muttering ]
- ~ remember ~ - [ muttering ] oh, god almighty.
[ echoing ] all i need is a place to cook.
i decided to eat only half of the acid at first... but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woolen shirt.
that sense of inevitable victory... over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense-- we didn't need that.
- ~ [ continues ] you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west... and with the right kind of eyes... you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke... and rolled back.
- ~ try to love one another right now ~ - [ waves gently crashing ]
- ~ that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scared me half to death ~
- maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour...
- ~ that ain't the way to have fun, son ~ - for 48 consecutive hours.
here i was... alone in las vegas, completely twisted on drugs.
no cash, no story for the magazine... and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters... that i would never understand.
these cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in one of these backstreet motels... hang pictures of jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
if we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.
what if i just jump on you and beat the dog shit out of you ?
would that make you feel any better, you filthy bastard ?
- ~ and i feel like loving you ~ - [ horn honking ]
~ love is such a sweet thing good enough to eat ~
- ~ yummy, yummy, yummy i've got love in my tummy ~ - ~ [ humming ]
let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure ?
[ man ] i welcome you... to the third national d.a.'s convention... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
if he figures out what is happening... then he can rise one notch... and become hip.
and then if he can convince himself... to approve of what is happening... then he becomes groovy.
just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.
that way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we ?
the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic... that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip...
- [ shouts ] - and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.
the glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.
- she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.
the only chance now, i felt... was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess... that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us... could possibly believe it.
fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.
he crashed around america, selling "consciousness expansion"... without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait... for all those people who took him seriously.
all those pathetically eager acid freaks... who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.
a generation of permanent cripples... failed seekers... who never understood the essential old-mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force... is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
just a flat out high-speed burn through baker and barstow and berdoo.
then onto the hollywood freeway, straight into frantic oblivion... safety, obscurity.
there is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved... than a man in the depths of an ether binge... and i knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
a house subcommittee report says illegal drugs killed... 160 american g.i.s last year... 40 of them in vietnam.
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
'cause it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.

you'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face!
total control now... tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas.
two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted.
the mind recoils in horror... unable to communicate with the spinal column... which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way... but you can't control it.
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
so they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside.

i want you to throw that fuckin' radio... into the tub with me.
that sense of inevitable victory... over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense- we didn't need that.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than five years later... you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west... and with the right kind of eyes... you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke... and rolled back.
here i was... alone in las vegas, completely twisted on drugs.
no cash, no story for the magazine... and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.
but he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters... that i would never understand.
well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.

how else can you cover a thing like this righteously ?
well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards ?

i want you to throw that fuckin' radio... into the tub with me.
uh, clearly i was a victim of the drug explosion... a natural street freak just eating whatever came by.
[ voice extremely slowed down ] does anybody want some lsd ?
[ voice slowed down, echoing ] well, all this white stuff... on my sleeve... is lsd.

24 hours ago we were... .. in the polo lounge of the beverly heights hotel, in the patio section, of course, drinking singapore slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of our lord... 1971.
perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir.

you approach the turnstiles, and know that when you get there you have to give the man $2 or he won't let you in.
was i just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind?
or had i really come to las vegas to work on a story?
and sweet jesus, there are a lot of them at 4.30 on a sunday morning.
still humping the american dream, that vision of the big winner somehow emerging from the pre-dawn chaos of a stale vegas casino.
i just wanted to cut a little z in your forehead.
get back in the tub, eat some reds and try to calm down.
it seems like a lifetime, the kind of peak that never comes again.
san francisco in the middle '60s was a very special time and place to be a part of.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in las vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark, that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.
the bill was a factor, i think, because i had no money to pay for it.
our room service tabs had been somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour for 48 consecutive hours.

cops will go 50 bucks a head to beat her and gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in a motel, hang pictures of jesus over the room, then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
in a few hours she'll be sane enough to work herself into a towering rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel samoan who fed her liquor and lsd, dragged her into a vegas hotel room,
and then savagely penetrated every orifice in her little body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member.
well, you'll go straight to the gas chamber for this one.
even if you beat that, they'll still get you for rape and consensual sodomy.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?
i welcome you to the third national da's convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
the most efficient way for us to do this is for each one of us to try and attempt to imagine what it is like inside of the possessed mind of the addict.
for example, a dope fiend refers to the reefer butt as a roach, because it resembles a cockroach.
if he figures out what is happening, he can rise one notch and become hip.
then, if he can convince himself... .. to approve of what is happening, then he becomes groovy.
any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.
one stitch in time, on him, will usually save nine, on you.
he offered me human blood, said it would take me higher than i'd been.
i thought he was kidding, so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome.
what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these fries, these puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?
and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a crust.
these were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.
he'll be posing as a politician, but you'll have no problem recognising him.
inspector rock will pay you, in cash, $1,000 on the ninth of every month.

all right, let's get right to the heart of this thing.
24 hours ago we were sitting in the pogo lounge of the beverly heights hotel.
the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grosero, who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
getting hold of the drugs and shirt had been no problem.
but the car and tape recorder were not easy things to round up at 6:30 on a friday afternoon in hollywood.
it was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character.
a gross physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country.
they chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot.
then they cut all kinds of holes in her and sucked out the blood.
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
we were gathered here in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.

with a purse of $50,000 going to the winner of this grueling, gut-wrenching, dust-eating, in-your-face motocross extravaganza!
why should i pay my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be hep.
for just 99 cents, your likeness will appear 200 feet tall on a screen over downtown las vegas.
for just 99 cents more you can have a voice message!
one of the things you learn after years of dealing with drug people, is that you can turn your back on a person, but never turn your back on a drug.
especially when it's waving a razor-sharp hunting knife in your eye.
was i just roaming around in a drug frenzy of some kind?
or had i really come out here to las vegas to work on a story?

no cash, no story for the magazine, and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.

not that we needed all that for the trip but once you get locked into a serious drug collection the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
and i knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.
- a house sub-committee report says illegal drugs killed 160 american gi's last year, 40 of them in vietnam.
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car?
if so... well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
because it goes without saying that we can't turn him loose.
he'd report us at once to a outback nazi law enforcement agency and they'll run us down like dogs.
i want you to understand that this man is my attorney.
he's not just some dingbat i found on the strip, man.

with a purse of 50.000 dollars going to the winner of this gruelling, gut wrenching, dust eating, in your face moto-cross extravaganza.
number 45 ragged in the number 4 position is choking, his rattle flying...
you better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face...
after a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing.
provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke.
which is interesting because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way but you can't control it.
you approach the turnstiles and you know that when you get there you have to give the man 2 dollars or he won't let you inside.

i decided to eat only half of the acid at first.
but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woollen shirt.
san francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.
but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.
we had all the momentum we were riding the crest of high and beautiful wave.
so now less than 5 years later you can go up on a steep hill in vegas and look west an, with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark.
maybe i'd planned it all along subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
the bill was a factor, i think because i had no money to pay for it.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realise that he's about to make a 180 degree turn, at speed.
i see you have two cases of beer, a basket of grapefruit, stack of t-shirts and towels, light-bulbs.
do you realise what you did when you drive like that?
and i can't tell you how grateful i'm for this brak you wanna give me." get a grip, man.
if i boom straight for la he'll bust me for sure.
- i am very sorry, sir, but you're on the 'late' list.
and so your reservation has been transferred to the, moonlight motel which is just out on paradise boulevard.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
christ, if we keep her full of acid, that's more like 2 grand a day.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure?
i welcome you to the third national da's convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
you gotta be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a god-damn cockroach.
you will notice that i have distinguished 4 distinct states of being in the cannabis or marijuana society.
he will attack, for no reason, with every weapon at his command including yours.
beware, any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.
he offered me human blood, said it would take me higher than i'd ever been in my life.
i thought he was kidding so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome.
they'd have to put you in a wheelbarrow, and when you scream for help you'll sound like a racoon.
man, i'll try just about anything but i'd never in hell touch a pineal gland.
what kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song right now, at this moment?
when i came to the general back-alley ambience of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul.
what addict would need all these coconut husks and honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?
north vegas is where you go when you have fucked up too often on the strip.
and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
we'd abused every rule that vegas lived by burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.
the only chance now, i felt was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in a position to bring the hammer down on us could possibly believe it.
he crashed around america selling consciousness expansion without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all those people who took him seriously.
all those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy peace and understanding for 3 bucks a hit.
a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers who never understood the essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture:
the desperate assumption that somebody or at least some force is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
there was only one road back to la, us interstate 15.
just a flat-out high-speed burn through baker and barstow and berdoo.
would he make that connection when my attorney starts screaming about bats and huge manta rays?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
the store was closed, but the salesman said he would wait if we hurried.
but we were delayed en route when a stingray killed a pedestrian.
¶ she's the kind i'd like to flaunt and take to dinner
¶ but she always knows her place she's got style, she's got grace
we were, after all, the absolute cream of the national sporting press.
we were gathered here in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
why should i pay my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse?
i don't know about you, but in my line of business, it's important to be happy.
after a lot of bad noise, he let us in for nothing, provided we would stand quietly at the back and not smoke.
ladies and gentlemen, proudly presenting the one, the only, the incomparable miss debbie reynolds.
the mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column, which is interesting.
you can watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it.
some son of a bitch just kicked me in the back.
the bartender wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
when it comes to that fantastic note when the rabbit bites its own head off,
i want you to throw that fucking radio into... the tub... with me.
san francisco in the middle '60s was a very special time and place to be a part of.
but no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time in the world, whatever it meant.
maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
the bill was a factor, i think, because i had no money to pay for it.
lord, just give me five more hours before you bring the hammer down.
just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off this horrible desert.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a traffic cop.
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.
but he won't understand your signal that says you're turning right.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realise he's about to make a 180-degree turn.
you will be ready for it, braced for the gs and the fast heel-toe.
i welcome you to the third national da's convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
and now, without further ado, the man who will define this cancer eating at the heart of america,
you've got to be crazy on acid to think a joint looks like a goddamn cockroach.
you will notice that i have distinguished four... four distinct states of being in the cannabis or marijuana society.
any officer apprehending a suspected marijuana addict should use all necessary force immediately.
one stitch in time, on him, will usually save nine, on you.
he offered me human blood, said it would take me higher than i'd been.
i thought he was kidding, so i told him i'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome.
what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and honeydew rinds?
would the presence of junkies account for all these fries, these puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?
and these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a crust.
these were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.
he'll be posing as a politician, but you'll have no problem recognising him.
inspector rock will pay you, in cash, $1,000 on the ninth of every month.
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up on the strip and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a safe haven from our storms.
¶ i fell down to my feet and i saw they bled
¶ yeah, yeah, i frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
we had two bags of grass... 75 pellets of mescaline... five sheets of high-powered blotter acid... a salt shaker half-full of cocaine... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer...
would he make that grim connection when my attorney starts screaming... about bats and huge manta rays coming down on the car ?
if so, well, we'll just have to cut his head off and bury him somewhere.
he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency... and they'll run us down like dogs.
- jesus, did i say that, or just think it ?
you have no faith in the essential decency of the white man's culture.
[ duke narrating ] the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
- when it comes to a thing like this, they don't fool around.
you approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there... you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there everything goes wrong.
some angry rotarian shoves you and you think, "what's happening here ?"
so they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside.
- ~ [ drum roll ] - [ announcer ] ladies and gentlemen... boys and girls...
- get out of my way, you-- - [ elephant trumpets ]
a drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother... crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth... but nobody should be asked to handle this trip.
for just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 feet tall... on a screen over downtown las vegas.
for just 99 cents more you can have a voice message !
- ~ and the red queen's "off with her head" ~ - [ muttering ]
- ~ remember ~ - [ muttering ] oh, god almighty.
[ echoing ] all i need is a place to cook.
i decided to eat only half of the acid at first... but i spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red woolen shirt.
that sense of inevitable victory... over the forces of old and evil.
not in any mean or military sense-- we didn't need that.
- ~ [ continues ] you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west... and with the right kind of eyes... you can almost see the high-water mark... that place where the wave finally broke... and rolled back.
- ~ try to love one another right now ~ - [ waves gently crashing ]
- ~ that cigarette you're smokin' 'bout scared me half to death ~
- maybe i'd planned it all along, subconsciously waiting for the right moment.
our room service tabs had been running somewhere between 29 and 36 dollars per hour...
- ~ that ain't the way to have fun, son ~ - for 48 consecutive hours.
here i was... alone in las vegas, completely twisted on drugs.
no cash, no story for the magazine... and on top of everything else i had a gigantic goddamn hotel bill to deal with.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
it'll take him a moment to realize he's about to make a 180-degree turn, at speed.
the rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamite pond.
the dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters... that i would never understand.
these cops'll go 50 bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang-fuck her.
we can set her up in one of these backstreet motels... hang pictures of jesus all over the room, and then turn these fucking pigs loose on her.
well, i figure she can do about four at a time.
if we keep her full of acid, that's more like two grand a day, maybe three.
what if i just jump on you and beat the dog shit out of you ?
would that make you feel any better, you filthy bastard ?
- ~ and i feel like loving you ~ - [ horn honking ]
~ love is such a sweet thing good enough to eat ~
- ~ yummy, yummy, yummy i've got love in my tummy ~ - ~ [ humming ]
let's find a good seafood restaurant and eat some red salmon.
why the fuck can't they make it a little less pure ?
[ man ] i welcome you... to the third national d.a.'s convention... on narcotics and dangerous drugs.
if he figures out what is happening... then he can rise one notch... and become hip.
and then if he can convince himself... to approve of what is happening... then he becomes groovy.
just leave a pile of towels and soap outside the door exactly at midnight.
that way we won't have to risk another one of these little incidents, will we ?
the mentality of las vegas is so grossly atavistic... that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized.
north vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on the strip...
- [ shouts ] - and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate downtown places.
the north star coffee lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.
the glazed look in her eyes said her throat had been cut.
- she was still in the grip of paralysis when we left.
the only chance now, i felt... was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess... that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us... could possibly believe it.
fifteen minutes to get my attorney to the airport... but we'll make it.
he crashed around america, selling "consciousness expansion"... without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait... for all those people who took him seriously.

the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force... is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
just a flat out high-speed burn through baker and barstow and berdoo.
then onto the hollywood freeway, straight into frantic oblivion... safety, obscurity.
we had two bags of grass... 75 pellets of mescaline... five sheets of high-powered blotter acid... a salt shaker half-full of cocaine... a whole galaxy of multicolored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers.
also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer...

he'd report us at once to some kind of outback nazi law enforcement agency... and they'll run us down like dogs.
it's the mint 400... the richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune buggies in the history of organized sport.
it's a fantastic spectacle... in honor of some fatback grosero... who owns the luxurious mint hotel in downtown las vegas.
how else can you cover a thing like this righteously ?
well, we're gonna have to drum it up on our own.
the store was closed... but the salesman said he could wait if we'd hurry.
but we were delayed en route when the stingray in front of us killed a pedestrian.
you just backed over a 2-foot concrete abutment, you didn't even slow down.
what, were you going about, uh, oh, i don't know, 45 miles an hour backwards ?
i was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo... and somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things.
it won't be long now before they tear us to shreds.
we were gathered in las vegas for this very special moment in sport.
- when it comes to a thing like this, they don't fool around.
number 45 riding in the number-four position... is choking as the dust flies !
you'd better wet those bandannas you got stretched over your face !
total control now... tooling along the main drag on a saturday night in vegas.
two good old boys in a fire-apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted.
after a lot of bad noise he let us in for nothing... provided we would stand quietly in the back and not smoke.

not in any mean or military sense, we didn't need that.
we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave.
so now, less than 6 years later, you can go up a steep hill in las vegas and look west and with the right kind of eyes, you can almost see the high-water mark, that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back.
few people understand the psychology of dealing with a highway traffic cop.
your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.
but he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right.
this is to let him know you're pulling off for a proper place to talk.
what i put in my book, as of noon, is that i apprehended you for driving too fast.
(humming) i advised you to proceed to the next rest area...
i welcome you to the third national d.a.'s convention on narcotics and dangerous drugs.

you know, it was just all i could do to get myself dressed and then feed the baby this morning.
yes, well, next time, maybe you should try feeding first and dressing second.
and you haven't had a date in i don't know how long.
i know how long, and this isn't the way to cheer me up.
anyway, i haven't figured out how to have a normal relationship with her.
you know, we're all striving to have what we call "normal" relationships.
and just as this hunter catches up to me and is about to kill me,
i wake up on the cot in my dad's oak-panelled rumpus room.
you get to cook your own food on this little grill that's right in the centre of the table.
it splatters a little bit, but, you know, that's what makes it fun.
eddie still greets me in a carnivorous frenzy every time i wear it.
yes, well, the next time marie and i go out for dinner,
oh, god, i've just discovered that she absolutely refuses to touch a doorknob with her bare hand.
thanks to my natural chivalry, i missed that for a whole week.
there's not a problem, unless she's falling in love with you and you're only interested in her as a case study.
i assure you, i am interested in all aspects of marie, not just her psyche.
the hunter represents your feelings of anger and abandonment that you've been running from ever since your parents' divorce.
until now, you've been able to avoid those painful arrows, sometimes seeking refuge in the forest of repression.
you see, you are a beautiful young woman and i have really enjoyed tackling some of these issues with you.
it's that i don't think that's the basis for a relationship.
more than 50 years have past, since the end of the modern world and savage rerules the land.
death is a way of life and that life has become a living hell of pain, coward and fear
work hard and we'll feed you food and water fail to work and you'll starve.
give us any trouble at all and it will be worse than death.
you've could killed me a thousand time by now if you wanna it.
i've pursuing one need is a weapon the one of those passes the guards over around their neck.
so, why don't you use all these knowledge to fight over with this man ?
i fight by staing alive, if i die any knowledge i possesed, goes with me.
just march up to the front gate, knock on and demand entry ?
no house has a single door... a forever the strength there is weakness.
so the code and the disk in exchange both your lives.
what kind of guarantee do i have that you won't go back on your bargain ?
i'm sure would like to, but somebody has to stay behind help to the village back together.
you two go ahead you have a new day before you.
the probe is entering the giant's upper atmosphere and the malon vessel is following it in.
the probe's stuck in a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and methane about 10,000 kilometers below the outer atmosphere.
if we worked around the clock, we could have it up and running inside a week.
i'm willing to put in as much overtime as it takes.
huh. l-l-l don't think i ever heard of banana pancakes before.
my grandmother used to make them for me when i was a kid.
we've stepped up the pace of construction in order to finish our shuttle before the malon finish theirs.
according to seven's most recent intelligence, we've gained some ground over the last 24 hours, putting us in a virtual dead heat with our competitors.

well, we've got to come up with something or we'll never get this thing off the ground.
according to the holodeck logs, you've been spending a lot of time there over the last few months.
if i were to check... would i find that you've been running other programs without safety protocols?
what do you say you and i pay a little visit to the holodeck?
you can show me some of the programs you've been running.
the logs show you only ran this program for 47 seconds-- the day after i gave you the news about the massacre.
then you shut it down and started running the most dangerous programs you could find with the safeties off.
i don't feel anything-- not about my dead friends, not about tom... you, my job.
maybe you're afraid if you let yourself start to feel something, you might not be able to stop.
and just when i start to feel safe, you tell me that all of our old friends have been slaughtered.
the way i figure it, i've lost every family i've ever had.
we could replicate the alloys and the new design components, use spare parts from storage.
if we worked around the clock, we could have it up and running inside a week.
if we make this thing look mean enough, other ships are going to think twice before taking us on.
i suggest we return our attention to the matter of structural integrity.
you are the person responsible for the destruction of one of our freighters and the deaths of nine malon citizens.
i'm very sorry that lives were lost, but you're leaving out an important detail.
according to my projections, they will finish construction of their vessel at least 36 hours before we finish ours.
well, then... i'd say we've got an old-fashioned space race on our hands.
according to seven's most recent intelligence, we've gained some ground over the last 24 hours, putting us in a virtual dead heat with our competitors.
i keep telling you we've got to reinforce the hull with kellinite.
mr. paris, that is perhaps the most illogical statement you've ever made.
unless we find a way to reconfigure the structural integrity field, the hull will incur microfractures during descent.
and if we do, i suppose these useless design elements from your "captain proton" scenario will compensate for the problem.
hey, every one of these knobs and levers is fully functional.
we each know the other is building a vessel to retrieve the probe.
what you don't know is that my vessel will be ready to launch in less than two days.
if i were to check... would i find that you've been running other programs without safety protocols?
would you like to look at my personal logs as well?
it's almost as if she's been intentionally trying to hurt herself.
you think all these injuries have been happening on the holodeck?
losing people is inevitable, and sometimes it happens sooner than we expect... but i can promise you that the people on this ship aren't about to let you stop living your life or break your neck on the holodeck.
you're going to have to find another way to deal with this.
i believe they're attempting to distract us, commander, while they launch their new shuttlecraft.
the malon vessel is 42,000 kilometers from the probe and closing.
the probe is entering the giant's upper atmosphere and the malon vessel is following it in.
the probe's stuck in a deep layer of liquid hydrogen and methane about 10,000 kilometers below the outer atmosphere.
if we worked around the clock, we could have it up and running inside a week.
i'm willing to put in as much overtime as it takes.
huh. l-l-l don't think i ever heard of banana pancakes before.
my grandmother used to make them for me when i was a kid.
we've stepped up the pace of construction in order to finish our shuttle before the malon finish theirs.
according to seven's most recent intelligence, we've gained some ground over the last 24 hours, putting us in a virtual dead heat with our competitors.
proposing the same flawed strategy over and over again will not make it more effective, ensign.
well, we've got to come up with something or we'll never get this thing off the ground.
according to the holodeck logs, you've been spending a lot of time there over the last few months.
if i were to check... would i find that you've been running other programs without safety protocols?
what do you say you and i pay a little visit to the holodeck?
you can show me some of the programs you've been running.
the logs show you only ran this program for 47 seconds-- the day after i gave you the news about the massacre.
then you shut it down and started running the most dangerous programs you could find with the safeties off.
i don't feel anything-- not about my dead friends, not about tom... you, my job.
maybe you're afraid if you let yourself start to feel something, you might not be able to stop.
and just when i start to feel safe, you tell me that all of our old friends have been slaughtered.
the way i figure it, i've lost every family i've ever had.
[ male narrating ] some people say i have a problem.
i see a beautiful vintage car, and i just have to steal it.
but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to get by in this world.
[ luke narrating ] and then i saw her, and i knew i just had to have her.
[ luke narrating ] nice seemed like a nice town, if you like trouble.
and trouble that looked like that had my name written all over it.
just being in the same town with that much beauty... was worth almost any amount of trouble.
and as it turned out, that was a good attitude to have, because that's what was coming.' trouble, in spades.
i've got 67 fucking tankers floating out to sea full of gasoline.
if that engine sees the light of day, it might as well be horseshit!
[ luke narrating ] claudia was good, and she knew it.
- but she didn't care about cars like me and max.
maybe he's trying to tie the police in knots while he moves in on what he really wants.
and you are going to tell me what it is, i suppose.
those men who worked for chiarkos, the ones in the ditch--
according to police reports, they were last seen at biggerman's test track.
[ luke narrating ] claudia had got herself a new recruit.
now she was gonna see if he could pass the oil test.
maybe i ought to get you out of this lovely little dress.
i've got to get you out of those nasty little pants.
[ luke narrating ] i'll confess, i was a little nervous.
this was the first time i've tried out my gizmo under such severe conditions.
why do you think ethan had such a strong sense of duty?
you must cite some examples from your text when constructing your response.
you keep saying how this is wrong, and maybe tonight it is.
but just to set the record straight i'm a firm believer that sometimes it's right to do the wrong thing.
i guess if i were seeing somebody, i'd want them to give off the same vibe.
how would you feel if she sailed to a deserted beach with some mystery man?
i know what you do with your students so he's in for one heck of a ride.
look, you have got to stop with this before it gets out of hand.

we did have some cooking magazines, but it looks like we're all sold-out.
do you know how to cook an entire thanksgiving dinner for ten people?

i was there-- right after i got off the night shift.
i waited...and i waited and i called you on the com.
that's the only place any of us have seen him, right?
so, if we want to communicate with him-- find out what he wants-- we'll have to do it on his terms.
what happened to you by accident is something some people can do by design.
i've been able to have a lucid dream by using the same technology i use for a vision quest.
once i see it, i can wake myself by tapping the back of my hand three times.
perhaps you are capable of doing this under normal circumstances, but these were hardly conventional dreams we experienced.
they believed the dream world was no more or less real than the waking world.
in fact, their creation mythology says their ancestors actually dreamed the universe into existence.
a neurogenic field created by heightened electrical activity in the brain.
it's been occurring in all the sleeping crew members-- and that's not all.
they're experiencing the same images, each from his or her own point of view.
yes. i saw the rest of the crew-- interacted with them.
we'll never defeat them in their dream reality, but if we can find them, find where they're sleeping, we'll have the advantage.
but we've been scanning for life- forms since this started and we haven't found anything.
our proximity to the neurogenic field is making it more difficult to stay conscious.
i need to get down there and find a way to neutralize it.
it's safe to assume that chakotay and the doctor are making every effort to wake us from our sleep.
we have to let the rest of the crew know what's happening-- that as long as they know they're in a dream, they can't be harmed.
with the neurogenic field neutralized, i've been successful in reviving the entire crew.
unfortunately, the experience has produced a troubling side effect for many of them-- acute insomnia.

i, uh, reviewed the tape of the session as you requested.
i have to say i wasn't prepared for what i heard on this.
and i don't have a clear recollection of what i hear myself saying,
but i also don't see any reason why i'd be saying it.
there is a war raging, and unless you pull your head out of the sand,
you and i and about five billion other people are gonna go the way of the dinosaur.
i wasn't aware that any special authorization was needed to enter.
due to the nature of our facility and the hazardous chemicals on site,
but it appears she was unaware of the consequences of her deception.
you were clever. lnfect the boy to ensure infection of anyone who tried to learn what he knows, who would cheat you.
victim of another mysterious holocaust, unable now to tell what he knew or saw.
- so you've got no choice but to deal with me.
that would explain how you were directed to the site and why you can't remember.
that would explain the sensation cassandra spender described and skyland mountain.
l didn't believe you, but i followed you on nothing more than your faith that the truth was out there.
based not on fact, not on science, but on your memories that your sister had been taken from you.
not unlike the one i described on my regression tape of the false memory of my sister's abduction.
agent scully? i've listened to the tape several times, and i don't have a clear recollection of what i hear myself saying.
over the past five years i've doubted you, only to be persuaded by the power of your belief in extraterrestrial phenomena.
l'm doubting you now, not because of that belief, but because extraterrestrial phenomena is frankly the more plausible explanation.
and then i feel my feet, and they aren't on the ground. i'm floating up.
seen enough? ls that what you're afraid people will find out?
for the fact that my dad had left his family and it drove my mom insane.
- only i was 11 years old and i didn't know it.
l think he's dangerous and his methods are unsound. lf you went through it, i hope you'd question the results.
l appreciate your opinion, but i don't have a mother feeding me abduction stories.
kazakhstan, skyland mountain, the site in pennsylvania, they're alien lighthouses where the colonization will begin, but where now a battle's being raged.
a struggle for heaven and earth, where there is one law: fight or die.
the inextricable relationships in our lives that are neither accidental nor somehow in our control either.
i've just taken a long walk, and i've reconsidered that i may have been wrong about what i believed happened to me.
the nature of our facility and the hazardous chemicals here mean i can only allow pre-cleared personnel on base.
are you aware that there's been a leak in contamination in a lab, and the personnel inside need immediate medical attention?
i want you to open your eyes, dana, and come on back.
dana, i want you to open your eyes and come back to us.
i think he's dangerous, and i think his methods are unsound.
if you went through it, i hope you'd question what came out of it.
listen very carefully, because what i'm telling you is deadly serious.

based not on fact, not on science, but on your memories that your sister had been taken from you.
i'm going to ask you to go back to the place we talked about on the phone.
just close your eyes and take long, deep breaths, relaxing all parts of your body.
i want you to open your eyes, dana, and come on back.
dana, i want you to open your eyes and come on back to us.

zeus doesn't care about me, so why should i spend my time thinking about him?
because i know you long to take your place as his son.
yeah, mine was there for about... three weeks out of every year.
the rest of the time he was off fighting some war.
yeah, you're just the one, two, six guys i wanted to see!
now, uh..., you two... can come join me for a drink!
i can understand you must be hurting..., but what about my loss?
not being near my beloved brother for all this time just to have him cruelly snatched away from me?
why is it that you always think you know what i think about?
you know, somebody told me before that... once in a while...
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
hercules is the one whose coming was foretold in my dream.
how can a son of odin let himself be frightened by nightmares?
for our son's sake, husband..., ...if you love me, stay your wrath.
odin may rule asgard..., ...but it is frigga who rules odin.
you know, ever since i got here..., ...you all made me feel real welcome.
so to thank you for the hospitality, i've brought you gods a little present.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
you know, ever since i got here, you all made me feel real welcome.

in an age long gone, the gods of the north received a prophesy.
we were warned to beware three tragedies... whose coming would precede the day of ragnarok, the final war of the gods.
so i shall be quite beneath the notice of fine gentlemen like yourself and mr. sedley.
i say, now- deuce take it- that's not on, i mean...
lord knows how, but somehow the poor girl's fallen madly in love with me.
damn me, i shouldn't be surprised if i pop the question tonight.
well, it may make him incapable of the other sort of folly.
he'll be incapable of anything at all in half an hour.
i'll wager you're a quick reader and write a tolerable hand, eh?
i ama good reader, sir, and i write a very fair hand, i say so myself.
that's him on the wall there, next to his brother, pitt.
well, then he married an ironmonger's daughter- had two girls by her.
the first lady crawley was such a quarrelsome, high-bred jade, that when she died i said,
"i'll have a nice pretty girl with no airs and graces."
she's not as cheery as i hoped she'd be, but by and large, i don't regret it.
and pitt here's me elder son by the first lady crawley.
grant us, o blessed redeemer, that strength that we may resist temptation.
for as a drunken man will impoverish his family and often lead them to ruin...
and you were engaged to, uh, talk french to the girls, am i right?
yes, sir, quite right, and soon, i'm to leave all my friends behind me to become a governess.
i wager she'd be a sensation at the calcutta ball and you, you can see for yourself-
lord knows how, but somehow the poor girl's fallen madly in love with me.
whoever went to vauxhall and never had a bowl of rack punch?
well, it may make him incapable of the other sort of folly.

i ama good reader, sir, and i write a very fair hand, i say so myself.
i should like to see the governess who could handle rawdon crawley.

lady crawley don't say much, miss sharp, and that suits me well enough.

it's like that paddle with the ball and the rubber band.
you know, my friend bob saccamano made a fortune off of those.
see, he came up with the idea for the rubber band.
before that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.
they should make a movie about all the hindenburg flights that made it.
anyway, right in the middle-- the ship blows up-- burning debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles over the airfield,
see, he came up with the idea for the rubber band.
before that, people would just hit the ball and it would fly away.
the thing is i had this little zinger of my own i wanted to try.
it's right in the explosion scene so if you could just leave me a little window...
you know, my friend bob saccamano made a fortune off of those.
see, he came up with the idea for the rubber band.
before that, people would just hit the ball and it would fly away.
i can't believe you made me leave before the end of the game.
it's right in the explosion scene so if you could just leave me a little window....
you know, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser.
you know, my friend bob saccamano made a fortune off of those.
see, he came up with the idea for the rubber band.

i can't believe you made me leave before the end of the game.
it's right in the explosion scene so if you could just leave me a little window....
you know, my aunt had a thing removed with a laser.
but you can't turn me into an angel because i already am one.
i came here looking for god, who is not in heaven.
but i have never seen an angel, archangel or saint... who dares speak from god's place.
what happens is that maria de las estrellas was not aware of the changes in heaven.
you should know... that i've been in every room... to inform you that this afternoon... the adopting parents will be coming.
i want each and every one of you... to be impeccable.
saint wichon has been in charge ever since... but you have seen that he wants to take the lord's place... and he spends all his time provoking him.
heaven is almost over, it is disappearing, maria de las estrellas... and there is nothing we can do.
"i have to leave, and it hurts me for many reasons.
"i must leave because the guys from the gang i used to hang out with...
that is very nice... but how can you be a good person with so much suffering?
tell me... if someone gave you a second chance... what would you ask?
dear friends... sometimes we feel that we are doing everything wrong... that there is no easy solution for the problems we have.
but when our problems are finally solved... we think an angel came from heaven... and just fixed everything magically.
in the next half-hour, i am going to tell you... how this film was made and some other interesting things.
you will experience the magic of filmmaking... while watching the making of angelito mio.
angelito mio is a story that will take you to heaven.
the story found its sources of inspiration... in other cinematographic products... like the book princess... and even the wizard of oz.
at first, it was a little angel... inspired by the idea of a guardian angel... which is a myth for all children.
they have it in their prayers, so angelito mio finds it sources there... in the prayer where at the end they say, "my little angel...
"pray to god for me." so that's where the idea comes from.
the little angel coming down on earth... was finally conceived as a mission.
i had found prestigious performers... basically from tv programs... which is the case for daniela luján...
leticia calderón... and lucho bonavides... who are all three well-known actors... who have worked in mexican soap operas.
he is the man... who adopts this little girl from an orphanage... hoping that she will bring them some joy, since they cannot have children.
milagros is a young woman... who has been married for some years now.
i feel this approach is coherent... with the idea of god i always had.
san wichón is a character who undergoes... a positive transformation over the course of the film.
as for the structure... we split the film into different sections.
at the beginning, we are in heaven... then we see the orphanage, then a house... and finally we are back in heaven.
now, that is going to be edited within the scene where we see them... entering the frame from here to there.
and we are going to place it higher so we can see through the hole.
you will see what a magic touch his songs are in this movie!
in a film like this... the music is very important, as well as the songs... written by luis rojas... and the score... composed by pedro rivera toledo, that creates the atmosphere.
i create a certain atmosphere... and rewrite the story with images.
to do so, i take into account the director's needs... and the available production resources.
i am maria de las estrellas, just an ordinary girl... except that i'm an angel!
an angel pursuing just one single goal, something that everyone wants:
we are tired of watching gratuitous violence... and meaningless special effects... that do not encourage at all... the betterment of human beings.
i think this film has some very particular elements... that families are going to like.
and i certainly believe... that children should be considered part of the family... when it comes to entertainment.
it's a simple story that can be easily assimilated... by all children.
it intends to convey a social message... that is addressed to families and children.
it's a very important film... because we are certain that all children... will be deeply touched.
a girl fighting to reestablish order in a chaotic heaven... and in the world she is about to discover.
what does it feel like to have a mother and father?
look, if i'm gonna take her, i'll have to go now.
i've gotta get the bus all the way to your house, then i've got to get the bus all the way back if i wanna go the feathers.
he had a roof over his head, got all his flu shots, had all his fingers and toes.
and aside from being stuck with the name fox, which probably taught him how to fight -- or not -- he pretty much led a normal life.
none of that hard work made up for his sister, though.
it was just a way of putting her out of his mind.
finally, the way i figure it, he went out of his mind, and he's been that way ever since.
fox mulder pissed away a brilliant career, lost the respect of supervisors and friends... and now lives his life shaking his fist at the sky... and muttering about conspiracies to anyone who'll listen.

two kids who'd probably kill me in my sleep for the insurance money.

four years, two months, 1 1 days-- that's precisely how long
i didn't want to spoil the festivities until i was sure.
tom, if it'll make you feel better, we'll go to the holodeck right now, run a few more simulations.
now, the hard part-- we need to know when to send it.
can you access seven's chronometric node and pinpoint the exact moment her cybernetic implants disengaged from her organic systems?
our slipstream flight may have been brief, but it took nearly ten years off our journey.
i've given the order to dismantle the quantum drive until the technology can be perfected.
my advice in making sense of temporal paradoxes is simple-- don't even try.
to me... all that matters is that somewhere somehow... sometime, you'll come through for us.
well, if you won't take it from me, take it from you.
seven found a log entry encoded in the telemetry... from harry kim to harry kim.
15 years ago, i made a mistake and 150 people died.
i've spent every day since then regretting that mistake, but if you're watching this right now, that means all of that's changed.
if we try to take that flight in the morning, we'll be in escape pods by afternoon.
it would appear we have no choice but to cancel it.
this could be our only chance to use the quantum drive.
true, but if you showed this data to any starfleet engineer, they'd think we were out of our minds.
you've been buried inside a glacier for the past 15 years.
you two were here, on the delta flyer ahead of voyager.
but i've had a long time to rethink my mistake, and now i know how to fix it.
so... we're going to send voyager a new set of phase corrections.
we stole the delta flyer, too... right out of a federation shipyard.
we're wanted on two counts of high treason and conspiracy to violate the temporal prime directive.
uh-huh... and how did you get involved with bonnie and clyde here?
oh, i've had an interest in voyager for a long time.
i signed on to the first deep space vessel i could find.
we tried to calculate where voyager might have fallen out of the slipstream.
i could send a phase correction which would disperse the slipstream entirely.
if we can't get the crew home, at least we can save their lives!
if i sent a message from the future and changed the past, then that future would no longer exist, right?
so... how could i have sent the message in the first place?
to me... all that matters is that somewhere somehow... sometime, you'll come through for us.
well, if you won't take it from me, take it from you.
it was hercules and you know how zeus feels about little bro.
daddy's put his protection on him preventing us gods from killing him.
anyone who takes it from its rightful place is condemned to death.
then by zeus' own words his protection of hercules is off.
i promise you, strife, you put one innocent person in danger--
you know, i wouldn't have thought of alcmene as being all that innocent.
if the gods had wanted to hurt me, they would have done it long ago.
but if what ares says is true your father can no longer protect you from them.
¶ i know that the queen will rise up to the top of the list
¶ displays of wit and finesse we have lacked, i confess
many years ago, after being banished for developing the forbidden arts, rothbart came to the castle at swan lake.
vanquished and powerless, he lived in despair until i found him.
i could never be married and give up my days of living on the edge.
excuse me, big silly braggart, but i was talking to derek.
brigitte, take this poor creature inside and give her anything she needs.
you'll see we're a lot nicer than those old chut 'n' chut 'n' do dangians, any old day.
but he seems to take his time when it comes to really important matters, such as destroying rothbart's notes.
well, he can have you back as soon as he brings the little piece he stole.
well, if you won't act like you've got a spine, rogers, then i'll give you one myself.
and that goes for all the rest of the bones in your body, too.
so she kidnapped her with the fireball, so he would give her the missing section.
so he's probably on his way to meet her right now.
you just stick in your beak and crack it in two...
sometimes it's hard cos the shells are tough and i'm gonna give it up
it's true when we say it doesn't get any better than this...
all the best in the land are here showing their hand and we're sure
we're gonna save a life the way a man and wife are supposed to do.
all the clouds have banished now that fear is banished from the kingdom.
but now, that the final victory is ours, i think it's time we celebrate it.
now there is nothing that can spoil the fun of festival days.
at least it's done and i can go back to my regular calm life.
although, i'll probably gonna have nightmares the rest of my life of this little masquerade.
we hunt, we fish, we want sporting events and we apologize.
i could never be married and give up my days of living on the edge.
i'm more than sure that i can't endure without her love for me.
because i love her, i need her, like i need to breathe.
she's gone and with her the greatest love the world has ever known has suffered a dagger right through the heart and lies as cold as tomb.
the passion of romeo and juliet, josephine and napoleon should have bowed to the love of rogers and zelda.
it's something so wicked i should often think of the descipable deeds that i'll do.
creating such chaos as you've never seen and misery like you never knew.
if your feathers are quivering, if you're shaking in yur shell, then it's confidence you're wanting that's for sure.
it'll all come from knowing that your actions will tell thatyourintentions are noble, good and pure... so gather courage from your comrades, take the promise of your pals that whatever comes we'll take it and destroy.
so she doesn't have what she really wants which is the power to destroy.
so she kidnapped her with a fireball, so he would give here the missing section.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
iolaus, you are my friend..., ...but i've got a country to run.
then as a friend, will you do one thing for me?
what i have is a solution, and it's out there in the bay.
highness, you can't believe that sending men out to the rock for imaginary offenses is a solution to anything.
and you'll provide a line of defense against any encroachment by the parthians.
i hope you will accept this from the grateful people of corinth..., ...and from a very... grateful king.
hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.

"not even the king of corinth can beat us." isn't that what you said?
and you'll provide a line of defense against any encroachment by the parthians.
i hope you will accept this from the grateful people of corinth, and from a very grateful king.

i'd walk back to london for another frosty one of those bad boys.

it's not so much an underpant as a feat of engineering.
it's amazing how much they can do with so little material.
now, chandler, dear just because we're getting a divorce doesn't mean we don't love you.
it just means he would rather sleep with the houseboy than with me.
might want to rethink the iyrics to "she feels weird since i've been gone."
i cannot believe chip dumped me for that slut nancy branson!
all this stuff about nancy being a slut was all a rumor.
chip dumped her, and he wants to come over to my house!
i didn't work this hard and lose weight just so i could give my flower to someone like him.
first of all, if you keep calling it that, no one will take it.
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moistmaker?
do you, perhaps, remember seeing a note on top of it?
if it happened once, how come we found your underwear in our apartment?
that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london.
i have to write five pages to stick to his schedule.
so play for 30 minutes, then write until he gets home.
maybe your resolution should be not to make fun of your friends.
especially the ones who might fly you to europe for free.
she has a better chance of flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us.
i'll bet $50 you can't go the year without making fun of us.
i wouldn't know, because i got so freaked out i hung up the phone.
well, if you had kept listening you would have heard me call him mister bigot.
i wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else.
i hope this isn't too weird, but i had a thing with janice.
she's on a new spiritual plain and she'll come to the coffeehouse.
i just saw two people having sex in a car right outside!
no, i will not join you in the lawsuit against him.

but sir, i think you've missed the most important application of the project
the cia induces a lot of enemy agents to turn double agents and steal enemy items they have access to
many times these moles cannot deliver simply because they are not skilled fighters
and now they can easily take a week off and we can turn them into james bonds
cia special operations acts only when the national security of our country is threatened
you may not be aware but at least one cia agent gets kidnapped every week
three days ago, a stock of pn7et was also stolen from a hospital in kowloon
both drugs are regularly used to treat mental patients suffering from illusionary problems
we inserted nauseating subliminals during its broadcast of an ethnic concert
it worked brilliantly because unlike that japanese cartoon incident we were untraceable by the region's broadcast monitoring

you think they'll sit by with your chaotic empire next to their perfect order?
if you watch us go under, you're signing your death warrant.
i have to believe that a man like you still has a few contacts at home.
a colleague from the obsidian order, an old friend, a reliable informant.
he is one of the most ardently pro-dominion voices in the senate.
if we convince him that the dominion is a threat, the entire senate will follow.
you will tell the senator that this information was obtained at great cost to the federation.
ten good men lost their lives bringing it across the line.
you will hand him a genuine data rod, but it will contain the most perfect forgery ever fashioned.
i'm working on the data rod, but i have the man to create the recording.
a brief struggle ensued and quark, in an uncharacteristic display of chivalry, attempted to intervene, so tolar stabbed him.
he'd be sitting in a cell, but he claims he's a friend of yours.
- l wouldn't relay this request if he'd take something else.
biomimetic gel is strictly controlled and not for sale at any price.
i was the one who had to look senator vreenak in his eye and convince him that a lie was the truth.
while you're entertaining the senator, i'll make a quick search of his ship's database for any information he may have picked up on the dominion.
then the founders will control cardassia, the klingon empire and the federation.
instead of facing three opponents with three separate agendas, you'll be facing the same opponent on every side.
i almost forgot it wasn't the real thing, but only for a moment.
you make some very good points, captain, but it's still speculation and theory, nothing that would warrant plunging the empire into war.
with the cardassians protecting their flank, the jem'hadar will begin their thrust across the glintara sector.
they should begin the invasion of romulus on the following day.
but this time the cost of failure was so high i found it difficult to take his advice.
if vreenak discovered that the data rod was a forgery, it could push the romulans even farther into the enemy camp.
if worst came to worst, they could join the war against us.
i felt that victory or defeat would be decided in the next few minutes.
after telling me that he would expose this deception to the entire quadrant, he got back in his shuttle and headed home.
there didn't seem to be more to do, so i went back to work.
you just wanted to get him on the station to plant a bomb on his shuttle!
i did have hopes that the rod would pass inspection, but i suspected tolar may not have been up to the task.
when they finish examining the wreckage of vreenak's shuttle, they'll find the burnt remnants of a data rod which somehow survived the explosion.
after forensic examination, they'll discover that it contains a recording of a dominion meeting at which the invasion of romulus was being planned.
any imperfections will appear to be a result of the explosion.
so, with a seemingly legitimate rod in one hand and a dead senator in the other, i ask you, captain.
because you knew i could do those things that you weren't capable of doing.
you'll get what you want: war between the romulans and the dominion.
soothe your conscience with the knowledge that you may have saved the entire alpha quadrant and all it cost was the life of one romulan senator, one criminal, and the self-respect of one starfleet officer.
i don't know about you, but i'd call that a bargain.
i can see where it all went wrong... where i went wrong.
i suppose it started two weeks ago while i was posting the weekly casualty list in the wardroom.
the romulans have a treaty of nonaggression and friendship with the dominion.
so they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything in the name of friendship.
what we need to do is bring the romulans into the war on our side.
with the combined forces of the federation, the klingons and the romulans we could finally go on the offensive.
if you watch us go under, then what you're really doing is signing your own death warrant.
but before i plunge my people into a conflict that will kill millions of loyal romulan citizens
your faith in my ability to retrieve classified information from my former homeland is most gratifying.
mr. garak, let's dispense with the usual repartee and concentrate on the issue at hand.
and the only way i can see to end it is to bring the romulans into the war.
i am prepared to do whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, but i can't do it alone.
after all, the stakes are much higher than a few dead operatives.
the fate of the entire quadrant hangs in the balance... or at least that's the case you made to me.
senator vreenak will be making a trip to soukara for a diplomatic meeting with weyoun.
i am certain that he can be persuaded to make a secret detour to ds9 if he were invited by one captain benjamin sisko.
when senator vreenak arrives, you will show him a holographic recording of a secret meeting held at the highest level of the dominion in which the planned invasion of romulus is being discussed.
you will tell the senator that this information was obtained through various covert means at great cost to the federation.
at least ten good men lost their lives bringing it across the line-- that sort of thing.
he will immediately suspect it's a forgery but you will assure him that such a thing would be impossible.
i'm still working on obtaining the data rod but i have found the man who will create the holo-recording.
you realize i can't authorize a thing like this on my own.
15 minutes later, he ordered a second bottle and then a third.
halfway through his fourth bottle he decided to dance with m'pella.
a brief struggle ensued, and quark in an uncharacteristic display of chivalry attempted to intervene, so tolar stabbed him.
normally, he'd be sitting in a holding cell, but he claims he's a friend of yours.
that was my first moment of real doubt... when i started to wonder... if this whole thing was a mistake.
so then i went back to my office... and there... was a new casualty list waiting for me.
believe me, i wouldn't be relaying this request if i thought he'd take something else.
biomimetic gel is strictly controlled by the federation and not for sale at any price.
captain, biomimetic gel is an extremely dangerous compound, as you know.
i can't release it without at least some idea of where it's going.
the bulk of the romulan fleet is still deployed along the neutral zone with the federation.
the founders estimate we could be on romulus itself in less than three weeks.
but i was the one who had to make it happen.
i was the one who had to look senator vreenak in his eye... and convince him that a lie... was the truth.
i doubt the senator will be traveling with more than four bodyguards at the most.
two will stand watch outside the wardroom and two will stay in the landing bay.
so, you're the commander of deep space 9... and the emissary to the prophets decorated combat officer, widower, father, mentor.
and, oh, yes-- the man who started the war with the dominion.
to be honest my opinion of starfleet officers is so low you'd have to work very hard indeed to disappoint me.
if you'll come with me, i'll show you to your quarters.
i look forward to seeing your station-- while it's still here, that is.
the way the war's going with the federation it may not be around much longer.
you and i both know the federation has already put out peace feelers.
now, in all candor if you were in my position, which side would you choose?
for a moment there, i almost forgot it wasn't the real thing but only for a moment.
you make some very good points, captain but it's still all speculation and theory-- nothing that would warrant abrogating our treaty and plunging the empire into war.
they should begin the invasion of romulus on the following day.
once we've taken the homeworld organized resistance will crumble when outlying systems and colonies begin looking out for themselves.
if worse came to worst they could actually join the war against us.
i had the distinct feeling that victory or defeat would be decided in the next few minutes.
after telling me in no uncertain terms that he would expose this "vile deception"
to the entire alpha quadrant he got back in his shuttle and headed home.
oh, i don't think they will because any imperfections in the forgery will appear to be a result of the explosion.
so, with a seemingly legitimate rod in one hand and a dead senator in the other...
i could do those things that you weren't capable of doing.
well, it worked, and you'll get what you want-- a war between the romulans and the dominion and if your conscience is bothering you you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved
the entire alpha quadrant, and all it cost was the life of one romulan senator one criminal... and the self-respect of one starfleet officer.
i don't know about you but i'd call that a bargain.
maybe if i just lay it all out in my log, it'll finally make sense.
i can see where it all went wrong... where i went wrong.
so they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything in the name of friendship.
what we need to do is bring the romulans into the war on our side.
the founders see it as their sacred duty to bring order to the galaxy- their order.
do you think they'll sit idly by while you keep your chaotic empire right next to their perfect order?
but before i plunge my people into a conflict that will kill millions of loyal romulan citizens
i need something more concrete than the self-serving argument of a starfleet officer.
i had no idea you held such a lofty opinion of me.
your faith in my ability to retrieve classified information from my former homeland is most gratifying.
the tenth fleet was supposed to be protecting betazed and its outlying colonies.
but it was caught out of position on a training exercise.
i made a few discreet inquiries among my former associates still living on cardassia.
as i anticipated they shared my loathing for the current government and were willing to take on any assignment aimed at its destruction.
vice chairman of the tal shiar and one of the most trusted advisors to proconsul neral.
he's also the man that negotiated the nonaggression pact with the dominion.
what's important is that he continues to be one of the most ardently pro-dominion voices in the senate.
if we can convince him that the dominion is a threat the rest of the senate will follow.
you will tell the senator that this information was obtained through various covert means at great cost to the federation.
at least ten good men lost their lives bringing it across the line- that sort of thing.
you will have handed him a genuine optolythic data rod but it will contain one of the most perfect forgeries ever fashioned.
i'm still working on obtaining the data rod but i have found the man who will create the holo-recording.
as i understand it, mr. tolar over there came in about two hours ago ordered a bottle of whelan bitters.
15 minutes later, he ordered a second bottle and then a third.
halfway through his fourth bottle he decided to dance with m'pella.
she was otherwise engaged, running the dabo wheel, declined his invitation.
normally, he'd be sitting in a holding cell, but he claims he's a friend of yours.
he's no friend of mine... but he is working for me.
in any case, we have far more important matters to discuss.
i've located a gentleman willing to sell us a genuine optolythic data rod.
i wasn't exaggerating when i told you about the near impossibility of obtaining a genuine cardassian data rod.
it's something of a minor miracle that i was able to locate this one source.
i can't release it without at least some idea of where it's going.
in the wrong hands, it could be used to make biogenic weapons, or for illegal replication experiments or to develop organic explosives-
you should know that i shall note this in my log and file an official protest with starfleet medical.
that is your right, but i want the gel by the end of the day.
starfleet command had given the plan their blessing and i thought that would make things easier.
but i was the one who had to make it happen.
two will stand watch outside the wardroom and two will stay in the landing bay.
i assure you, they'll never know i was even near their ship.
if you'll come with me, i'll show you to your quarters.
i look forward to seeing your station- while it's still here, that is.
but most important... the dominion is resolved to win the war at any cost.
you and i both know the federation has already put out peace feelers.
now, in all candor if you were in my position, which side would you choose?
i'd pick the side most likely to leave us in peace when the dust settles.
then the founders will control what we now call cardassia the klingon empire and the federation.
so, instead of facing three separate opponents with three separate agendas, you'll find yourselves facing the same opponent on every side.
you make some very good points, captain but it's still all speculation and theory- nothing that would warrant abrogating our treaty and plunging the empire into war.
what if i told you that the dominion is planning a sneak attack on the romulan empire at this very moment?
and with the cardassian fourth order protecting their flank the 23rd jem'hadar division will begin its thrust across the glintara sector.
they should begin the invasion of romulus on the following day.
once we've taken the homeworld organized resistance will crumble when outlying systems and colonies begin looking out for themselves.
consolidation of the entire empire will take three months at most.
well, i know it sounds a bit strange but i'd say we're off to a pretty good start today.
captain, we just received word from starfleet intelligence that a romulan shuttlecraft carrying a high-ranking senator has just been destroyed.
he was returning to romulus from a diplomatic mission to soukara when his shuttle exploded.
the tal shiar are investigating but preliminary reports point to sabotage.
you see, when the tal shiar finishes examining the wreckage of vreenak's shuttle they'll find the burnt remnants of a cardassian optolythic data rod which somehow miraculously survived the explosion.
after painstaking forensic examination they'll discover that the rod contains a recording of a high-level dominion meeting at which the invasion of romulus was being planned.
well, it worked, and you'll get what you want- a war between the romulans and the dominion and if your conscience is bothering you you should soothe it with the knowledge that you may have just saved
the entire alpha quadrant, and all it cost was the life of one romulan senator one criminal... and the self-respect of one starfleet officer.
i don't know about you but i'd call that a bargain.
at 0800 hours, station time... the romulan empire formally declared war against the dominion.
this may even be the turning point of the entire war.
there is even a "welcome to the fight" party tonight in the wardroom.
i can see where it all went wrong... where i went wrong.
i suppose it started two weeks ago while i was posting the weekly casualty list in the wardroom.
the romulans have a treaty of nonaggression and friendship with the dominion.
so they're willing to turn a blind eye to almost anything in the name of friendship.

congressman, i talked with a corporal ethington from the 185th... who knew a man named duke.
as you know, my father wrote a letter about a g.i. named duke... who was helping him to catch a traitor, not act as one.
sir, if this is the same duke, i believe he can help me clear my father's name.
miss clements, we've talked about this letter many times... but it's circumstantial evidence, regardless of what this duke person has to say.
mark clements was the last man you'd have thought would turn out to be a traitor.

you still owe me for gettin' you to chin ahead of xena.
when i'm finished with you, you will get your reward as promised.
the pantheon of gods will fall once you enter the world, dahok.
we'll save more people if we get to the source of the problem and snuff it out.
you're gonna try using me again to betray my god, aren't you?
you sold out your fellow gods so that you could sire a new race...
our child will be the first of what dahok calls "the six destroyers".
the bloodletting ceremony will be the window into the world for dahok.
even if you manage to somehow kill hope you still lose.
but i want you to know that i still think you are the best thing that ever happened to me.
you gave my life meaning and joy and you will be a part of me forever.
[ man narrating ] in a time of ancient gods -- [ xena yells ] warlords and kings, a land in turmoil cried out for a hero.
she was xena, a mighty princess forged in the heat of battle.
and then, it would be so simple to just turn it on me.
because i like the idea of you living with your suffering.
our child will be the first of what dahak calls "the six destroyers."
insidious creatures with no souls, who will eat of the living and the righteous... and lay waste to all gods!
the bloodletting ceremony will be the window into the world for dahak.
even if you manage to somehow kill hope, you still lose.
a lot's happened to us over the past year, and there were times when we were both very confused.
i want you to know that i still think you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
we'd get all hot and sweaty and then cool off in the lake.

because i don't like hassling with assholes, you know what i'm saying?
the same thing happens to your family if you don't get there first.
when i was a kid, my mom was kind of a weak woman.
i've never made one for someone i didn't want to see leave.
this was a lot easier when they were shooting at us.
you're gonna need a visa, a birth certificate, a driver's license, and a passport.

the only way money isn't a problem is if i see it upfront.

you have to be a man before you become a waiter!
otherwise, you are half a chef, half a man, half a citizen!
i love your husband, and i've given everything up for him.
we all have the right to be happy, that's in the american constitution.
there are good people at the monastery, sisters and mothers i love.

that's when sadness moves in, and then, i don't expect it to be true.
the inquisitor shuts up and stops provoking jesus to defend himself.
jesus gets up and slowly, in silence... goes to him and kisses him.

a guy who should pay the state 500 million liras a year.
as soon as he gets the notice he writes a check for the amount... and deposits it at the bank of kioto in a tax-account.
in ten years he has accumulated almost 8000 million in back taxes.

(gandhi) i feel like the mother in the "judgement of solomon".
give the child to the other woman, but don't cut it in two.
these are, by any measure, difficult times, with difficult decisions ahead.
may i take this informal occasion to make a very serious proposal?
there is no god but allah and muhammad is his prophet.
our beloved daughter rattanbai, we welcome you to the faith of islam.
hindus and muslims, for an india free from imperial british rule.
the second is that we must act in a constitutional way.
i am even happier to see that you have, as your chief spokesman, of hindu-muslim unity, the distinguished mr jinnah, from the minority community.
i wish to lend my support to everything mr jinnah says.
a force of spiritual strength which has been suppressed for too long.
but when it is released, this shining light of truth of ahimsa, which is non-violence, and satyagraha, which is the ancient path of truth... no force on earth, no constitutional gain, will be able to suppress it.
if we go down this road, we will turn hindu against muslim, in the end.
if we do not win our freedom together, we will turn brother against brother.
either mr birtwhistle is a citizen of britain and a subject of the king emperor, or he is not.
and either india is part of the british empire, or it is not, and the king emperor is its king and emperor, or he is not.
bournemouth, shall we say, may be told that he is to repair to scotland and scotland alone.
since magna carta, the right to free movement throughout the realm has been established.
such as man has to lead the struggle for pakistan and then be an inspiration to a country, at its birth.
how can i even dare think of myself as such a man?
the will of the people has put pakistan within our grasp.
the muslim league has proved, in the eyes of the world, our right to represent the muslims of india.
miss jinnah, why have you invited an englishwoman to be our guest, when they have only contempt for us?
why should we have to shake the hand of the enemy?
if they split the congress, the muslim league will be the strongest party in india.
unless i give jinnah his pakistan, and split the country first.
surely, it'll be a great symbol of friendship between the two countries.
if we were at war, lord mountbatten, you couldn't possibly order one side to attack and the other to defend.
free to go to your mosques, 'free to go to your temples, 'or any other place of worship in the state of pakistan.'
my guiding principle will be justice and fair play, without any prejudice or ill will, without any partiality or favouritism.
'tired of their leaders' temporising, 'fired by religious zeal, they attack.
'at the end of the assault, only rubble would be left of...'
it looks close enough to touch but it's a million miles away.
- it's actually only 240,000 miles away, dawson, and it won't be completely full until tomorrow night.
look, i'm not very good at this so please bear with me.
i have been at sea for the last 18 days with a bunch of ill-mannered, drunken idiots, and i would really love to reacquaint my brain with the simple pleasures of life.
men will come and go, but you and i are kindred spirits.
we're rebels bound together by the common need to break out of this small town abyss.
- okay, well, with the entrance here, and this area has excellent ventilation,
i think that would be a good place for the kitchen.
- that's good because i'm getting tired of indulging in the dreams of a man who can hardly look me in the eye.
- well, i am sorry that i have been such a burden to you.
it seems like unlike her spoiled, rich society girl of a daughter,
i'm actually worthy in her eyes of meeting the country club father and the ivy league brother.
you stand behind them, and you encourage them, and you believe in them.
you don't turn your back on them and jump into somebody else's bed!
i mean, it's just a natural satellite that reflects the sun's light.
- well, casting it's peaceful and silent glow over a chaotic world.
- well, conversations that don't offend my mother's virtue with 4-letter words and an exotic cup of ground roast coffee.
so, please, if you have any compassion for the working man, say you'll show me the gentler side of capeside.
at what other time in your life are you ever going to be exposed to so many different walks of life, so many different people that just randomly cross your path, each with a different story, different set of hopes, different set of dreams...
- ways to blame you for their food being cold, there are not enough clams in the chowder..
- well, i am sorry that i have been such a burden to you.
while you've been in there playing with gary or bobby or whoever it is this evening,
then i remembered that we were supposed to meet here, but now he's not here either.
so that must mean he's either totally blowing me off or...
i guess me and your drag queen friend have got something in common.
- i hope that's the only thing you two have in common.
- well, you can make it sound clever so she'd believe you.
just, um, tell her that you and joey have decided to have an open relationship and that you and i have hooked up.
- she just invited me into this normal rockweel painting, better known aw your home, and politely invited me to dinner.
it seems like unlike her spoiled, rich society girl of a daughter,
- i think he just doesn't have any other place to go.
or, you know, maybe he doesn't have a family or, um, you know maybe he did, but they're gone now.
she's been trying to get you to forgive her and you won't let her off the hook!
you've got to...you've got to get beyond your own ego and just forgive her.
he taught me... how to drive a car... save money...build a house, even.
but, you know, he never... told me what to do if my wife cheated on me.
dad kind of bailed and, um, he checks in once a week.
he lives in providence with the business, which is going under, so he's hurting, too.

i was thinking we could both wear cigarette trousers, and i'll wear a halter top and you could wear more the nehru jacket thing.
and remember, mom, cute is not a look, it's not an attitude, it's a way of being.
she's going to be my mother and i'm going to be her daughter in a fashion show.
actually, she is my mother and i'm her daughter in real life, too.
you are alive now because my guards have been watching you.
there are those from many realms who want you dead for what you did today.
kung lao, look, shang tsung will have too great an advantage at night.
if we don't find him, we meet back here at dusk, okay?
if i killed shang tsung when i had the chance, none of this would be happening.
even if you find him, you may not be able to do anything.
one man stands in my way of conquering earth realm... yet he escapes death from every assassin.
alone even the very best are not good enough, but together as allies...
the world is about to drop in on your head... and you're going off to meet mummy and daddy.
you think they'll convince their son not to turn you into an ice ball?
it was an act of treachery, and his death will be avenged.
the murderer is sub-zero who is now and forever a mortal enemy of the lin kuei.
like you, we simply want to insure that kreeya doesn't get this realm.
i'd think the two of you, of all people, would find a world run by women...
- i don't trust them either, but... we can use the help tracking the hives.
we've seen shao kahn's wrath... other realms left as barren wastelands.
zaterra wasn't destroyed because the emperor realised we'd make strong allies.
but if we go against him now, he will obliterate us.
and in all that time, have you ever thought what it would be like..
if you had joined me... if we had stood side by side.
we need fighters that will dedicate, that have the will to win.
well, it's not your fault none of these guys have what you're looking for.
the sorcerer released your soul only to see you defeated and humiliated.
it was i who was able to retrieve you from netherrealm.
i know you have a brother and there's something wrong with him.
and if you don't help him and her now, you're never gonna forgive yourself.
and he'll help you if you can get through to him.
he just needs time to deal with seeing you again, that's all.
hanna risked her life to go after you, after you deserted her.
now she may want you, but i sure as hell don't.
i'd like to see how many other little details our thief left out.
couldn't we have just left the dagger in the trading post?
well, then let's be respectful and have a good time, all right?
doesn't it bother you that that guy said that others have been here before... but no one's ever come out with any stories.
okay, this is starting to sound like the worst idea in the century.
look, whatever it is, shao kahn is not going to show up.
according to the rules of mortal kombat ... their victory preserved the safety of the earth ... for one more generation.
our chosen ones were returned to liu kang's home on earth ... only to enjoy a brief period of peace.
the earth was created in six days ... so too shall it be destroyed.
and on the seventh day, mankind will rest ... in peace!
as long as i have the power khan, you will never rule this world.
as long as the portal remains open, ... your world becomes my world!
- the two of you will travel to the hopi mesa.
you did great last time liu, but this time you will need help in what you are about to face.
what happened here, she proved you alone are not ready for what's ahead.
you'll take the same track back and turn where l showed you.
by now, you'd be behind bars on display in a zoo.
if those bars could keep me away from you, sheeva... i would welcome them!
you are all far too impetuous for such an important work.
you ... are my new general, queen sindel ... unless anyone else has a different point of view.
you are correct .... in believing kitana is the key to closing kahn's portals.
but if i reunite her with sindel ... how can i be sure kahn's portals will stay closed until the next turnament?
how could you believe the ruination of the elders' temple ... would not put our plan in jeopardy?
it was necessary to convince the mortals ... that their only hope lie in outworld.
it is a permanent mark ... that allows safe passage through the portals ... for the bearer and his passengers.
the tatoos you saw, did they flee the fighter upon death?

i beat my brother ... but i could not kill him.
the population of parasitic tree lizards has exploded... and local citizens couldn't be happier.

in all the animal kingdom, no mother is more devoted than the blue jay.
valuing her eggs above even her own life... the mother bird bravely fights off such fearsome predators as the badger and the mongoose.
now, uh, people, there's been some confusion about our bird-sighting rules.
you cannot count birds that you've seen at the zoo, on stamps or in dreams.
it feasts on bird eggs and lays its own eggs in the nest.
the unsuspecting mother bird cares for them until the babies hatch... and... devour her too.

mark, i know this sounds rather morbid but i haven't had as much trauma experience as i had hoped.
i was wondering if you might be able to advise me on the times that a surgeon might sign up for er coverage.
i tried to talk to you and you blew me off.
you left a sick kid here to undercut me in front of the pediatrics staff.

he doesn't want to open himself up to malpractice without getting paid.
i have an older gentleman here who has no place to go.

maybe we could just, you know, cut a little bit in that one earlobe.
or maybe settle for poking a little hole in the ear.

the people on the elevator, there was no backing on it...
and the radio starts following me, talking about everything i'm doing.
you're the closest thing i ever had to a brother, truman.

- now in its 30th great year, it's the truman show!
he was two weeks premature, as if he couldn't wait to get started.

coming to you now from seahaven island, enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed, and along with the great wall of china, one of only two manmade structures visible from space, now in its 30th great year,
a rare and exclusive interview with the show's conceiver and creator.
so come with us now as we go live to the lunar room on the 221 st floor of the omni-cam ecosphere.
but let's remind viewers of exactly why dad was written out in the first place.
as truman grew up, we were forced to manufacture ways to keep him on the island.
when kirk read the synopsis for the death at sea episode, he was disappointed, to say the least.
i'm sure that's what caused him to break back onto the set.
it was almost as if he couldn't wait to get started.
and his eagerness to leave his mother's womb was the very reason he was the one who was selected.
the show has generated enormous revenues, now equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
people forget it takes the population of an entire country to keep the show running.
why do you think that truman has never come close to discovering the true nature of his world until now?
we accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.
i have given truman a chance to lead a normal life.
the world, the place you live in, is the sick place.
christof, i can't thank you enough for giving so generously of your time tonight.
i think it's safe to say that now that this crisis is behind us and that truman's back to his old self, we can look forward to some exciting new developments.
i was gonna call you, but halfway through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.
i wanna check on the setups for the insurance convention tomorrow.
you can't get any further away before you start coming back.
there's still islands in fiji where no human being has ever set foot.
the people on the elevator, there was no backing on it ...
and the radio starts following me, talking about everything i'm doing.
you're the closest thing i ever had to a brother, truman.
things haven't worked out for us like we used to dream they would.
you don't want to believe it, so you look for answers somewhere else.
but the point is, i'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

from seahaven, enclosed in the largest studio ever constructed, one of only two man-made structures visible from space, now in its 30th great year, it's the truman show!
the catalyst for the recent dramatic events has been truman's father, kirk, and his attempt at infiltration.
this is not the first time someone has tried to reach truman, is it?
and his eagerness to leave the womb was the reason he was selected.
in competition with five other unwanted pregnancies for a show determined by an air date, only truman arrived on cue.
it takes the population of an entire country to keep it running.
since it's on 24 hours, revenues are generated by product placement.
lfhis was more than a vague ambition, ifhe was determined to discover the truth, there's no way we could prevent him.
i think what distresses you, really, caller, is that, ultimately, truman prefers his cell, as you call it.

he was two weeks premature, as if he couldn't wait to get started.

do you think because you batted your eyes at truman once. -
- flirted with him, stole a few minutes of air time -
you're going to the top of this mountain, broken legs and all.
we find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.
you can't get any further away before you start coming back.
you know, there are still islands in fiji where no human being has ever set foot.
a businessman and a woman with a little dog came out of nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
well, it's about time they cleaned up the trash downtown before we become just like the rest of the country.
you're just feeling bad because of what happened-- you sailing off into that storm.
but i've never blamed you, truman... and i don't blame you now.
tonight, we present the enduring, much-loved classic show me the way to go home.
a hymn of praise to small-town life, where we learn that you don't have to leave home to discover what the world's all about, and that no one is poor who has friends.
and that scene with the bowl of cherries is gonna have you splitting your sides with laughter all over again.
and there'll be tears, too, when david and jennifer are reunited.
we're just going to eat into our savings, is that it?
i'm going to have to call your mother when we get there.

the world stood still for that stolen kiss, and as he grew, so did the technology.
an entire human life recorded on an intricate network of hidden cameras and broadcast live and unedited 24 hours a day,
but tonight, something very special indeed, a rare and exclusive interview with the show's conceiver and creator.
so, come with us now as we go live to the lunar room on the 221st floor of the omni cam echosphere, where we'll find the world's greatest tele-visionary--
the designer and architect of the world within a world that is seahaven island-- christof.

i've been your best friend since we were 7 years old.

my college friend, soma rumi, happens to be in america now.
she asked me to feed her tropical fish, so i have her keys.
this has more to do not so much with the quality of the...
my point is, my son, ben, who is 25-years-old, still very much a child...
i've bought stuff from her, which i think is a good thing...
and, she's great, and she likes me, and i like her...
now i think, i might be in a little trouble here,
i mean, they're dancing around... ♫ sono affamato ♫ and no matter how much you eat...
uh, how the show works is, uh, during the show we're gonna ask our performers to come up and they're gonna totally make up in front of you, ah, scenes based on suggestions that we give them and the audience gives them.
they've never seen, uh, any of the material before, they don't know what's gonna happen to them.
ryan, colin and wayne, you're going to be contestants on a dating-type show hoping to be picked by greg, who is lonely and desperate.
and, ah, ha-ha, each of them has been given a strange characteristic or ability.
ah, i suppose we'd go to a movie, maybe dinner after that, dinner, uh, mashed potatoes, uh, gravy, uh,
i, uh, i guarantee you'll have a great night, i'd have you home by 10, i hear 11, i hear 12!
i think to myself, i feelin' low, and i need some lovin' to get me up.
and i stretch, and i stretch, and i think about you, 'cause there ain't no secret to what you can do!
i've been trapped on a desert island for the past seven years, with a movie star and a professor, and i need it.
i'd like to take you out for a few drinks, but...
welcome back to "whose line is it anyway?", the show where everything is made up and the points don't matter.
uh, i don't know how many points to award because during the commercial i was taking off my pants.
uh, colin and ryan are, uh, tv voice-over people, and you're gonna be talking about the latest compilation album, and wayne, you're gonna sing snippets of the songs.
what we need from the audience is the, uh, uh, a kind of profession you wouldn't normally sing songs about...
this is for greg, you're gonna be hosting a party, and wayne, colin, and ryan, you're gonna be the guests.
each of you has a strange quirk or identity that's written in these envelopes.
this is the first time they've ever seen them, and, uh, what greg has to do is guess... what the quirks are.
ah, so greg, why don't you come over and start the party?
wayne and i are gonna improvise a scene called, uh, foreign film dub.
what's gonna happen is, you guys are gonna suggest a foreign language, we're gonna fake it, and, uh, ryan and greg are gonna interpret for us, and, uh, colin's just gonna sit there?
sometimes, just sometimes, the crow brings the soul back, to right the wrong done.
my soul and will not rest until we will be back together.
my lawyer told me in office should not talk to you.
the two young, webster and draven, did not deserve to die
tell me why you think it was anything more than firing exercises.
i saw someone being miºcându, i thought that was one of them.
a man was thrown through the window of the 16th floor.
are you telling me that you do not know who it was?
i want to understand that yesterday i was in your home, right?
if you have your reminds else, we'll come after your mother.
you'd be surprised what one can find on the internet a search for the word "death".
that says that people think a raven goes dead souls in the next world.
your office is a room full of clippings about 13 unsolved murders.
in each article, there is one item that belong to the victim.
thi-i'd offer you a drink, but you entered a zone free of alcohol.
in fact, i think i must clear my mind, so do not sleep.
i do not want to seem ungrateful, but here we are safe?
if you want an anonymous place, you come the right place.
sorry, uh... your brother was a wonderful man, sir, and a very funny guy.
a very gifted actor who people laughed with and not at.
you know, i didn't know sid that well, but the passing of anyone touches us all.
so why don't we all join together in prayer, saying good-bye to sid?
god, that explains why you weren't makin' a move on that sports illustrated babe.
just replace her with someone who doesn't know anything about my personal life, ok?
i would love for you to come and visit, uh, my house.
i would love to cook for you, and... and, um... why don't we take a break?
my first couple of years in the section, i had the standard reaction.
i went through all the alpha levels... everything from denial through wishing i was dead.
all we have is some random intel from our friends in great britain.
let's pore through it and find this group, who for purposes of identification... will now be referred to as "helix."
that night we had together, did it... happen, or was it just a dream?
we found pontriargan, but we're going to have to move fast.
ten to one, this hack is at a vegas craps table with a bimbo on each arm.
one thing definitely does not make any sense, what in god's name is she doing with the likes of everett?
this is a guy from baltimore who sells used appliances for most of his adult life.
then one day, he writes a novel about spies killing each other on a nuclear aircraft carrier, and ba-da-boom, 600,000 copies fly off the shelves.
yet mrs everett insists that he was gonna fire you and was talking to other agents.
and he told me that he was planning on leaving her, all right?
she gets out of bed in the early hours, she finds a burglar ransacking the place.
if that's the theory, i'd say he scared her to death.
this isn't much of a murder, and buxom barmaids have been my obsession since my teens.
i guess i'm really not used to having a partner who's so quick to dump cases.
you want to be sure our writer hasn't used a passport to leave the country?
rene, ring the new york publisher, make sure everything's in order.
¶ you can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother
¶ you can't judge a book by looking at the cover
whoever shot everett went to a lot of trouble to try and hide it.
we found a hole in the wall where a bullet lodged.
i don't give a damn if it's two in the morning!
the victim's been dead over a week while some son of a bitch plays us for a fool.
hey, kids, that there is mr johnson, maintenance supervisor at the building where everett's office was.
he says the maintenance man assigned to the floor where everett was killed, he quit four days ago.
call in a sketch artist, see how good his memory is.
i'm gonna call in a sketch artist and see how good his memory is.
so, what you're saying is that you didn't you kill him, but if you had killed... excuse me, terminated him, you're such a professional...
if it was my work, you wouldn't find enough of the body to fill a spoon.
you gained employment under a false name with the cleaning crew in everett's office.
and in a manner that would do your former colleagues proud, you disposed of the victim completely.
this is a copy of an invoice for the maintenance company for which you worked.
it shows the delivery of eight 55-gallon barrels of used chemical solvents to atco recovery, a waste disposal firm in curtis bay.
listen, you son of a bitch, with or without a body,
i will find a way to prove and prosecute this murder.
they show cash withdrawals totalling $80,000 in the two months prior to everett's disappearance.
your statements show cash deposits in $9,000 increments, in order to avoid irs reporting guidelines, of about the same amount.
you don't have to be best friends, but we cannot go into court with you at each other's throats.
it would be too easy for the defence to suggest, for example, that claudette killed mr everett for not leaving his wife.
see, i've been a cop for some time and a man for longer and...
to me, the way the world usually works is, twos end up with twos and fours with fours and tens with tens.

i took four bottles of vodka on friday, it was my birthday, you know that
i was having a party and i was running late, so i borrowed some
i have people consider soul mates who don't confide in me this much
and what would he say if he knew you were walking up from the tube in broad daylight ...with a complete stranger?
i come home and catch you up to your nuts in lady shagging godiva
i am working all hours to support you while you are supposedly writing your first novel
er... well i, er i didn't sleep that well last night and then, er... you know when you left i kind of...
i went into a really, er a really, really deep, deep, er, deep, deep sleep
well, look, if it makes you feel any better, you see that bloke over there?
not only does he own a personalised matching set of crocodile skin luggage but his favourite tv programme is'baywatch'
m make and deliver sandwiches in the west end during the day before i come here about six o' clock and finish at midnight
after that, if i've got any energy left, i give my boyfriend a blow job
but i'll be honest... the fact that i find you... moderately attractive just makes the job easier on my part
my intentions are completely honourable i have no desire to overstep the mark, seriously
well, you know, lose the sad eyes, the droopy mouth, i could get you an upgrade
so... having firml y established the ground rules what are you doing two weeks on saturday?
helen, i'm... not sure i like where this conversation is going
i, i told you, i couldn't sleep so i got up in the night... to get a drink to knock myself out it was still there in the afternoon when you got home
but you've asked helen to come on a research trip to dorset with you... knowing that she wouldn't be able to... to cover up the fact... that you're really taking lydia and, and despite the fact that...
lydia gave you an 'out' on the phone, which you didn't take you are having a moral dilemma
i wanted to see what this girl you seem to have no intention of leaving... despite the occasional pre-orgasmic suggestion that you are has that is so unleavable
and i have to say that i ended our brief meeting at a bit of a loss
d'you think he might be hoping you've called and not known that you have?
i mean... did you not check if he has a mobile?
that image of her sitting on top of you, oh god, i i, i really don't know why i agreed to come
please stop, gerry, don't, i, i don't want you to touch me
but well, at the risk of sounding old-fashioned, i'll pick you up at eight
is that a 'will' pick me up, or a 'haven't, not, didn't, might'?
i have wanted to tell you so many times and ...and now you've found out another way i wish i had told y ou
my mother is ill in hospital as you know and claudia agreed to keep up the pretence that we were okay still for my mum
not a lot of use to me when i had nothing to offer the executives who dropped by late friday
off the top of my head, you could have told them you'd run out
come on, everyone is born knowing all the beatles' lyrics instinctively
they're passed into the foetus subconsciously along with all the amniotic stuff
it's funny the way nobody talks on the tubes, isn't it?
i mean, i rarely catch the tube myself but, er... or lifts
well, i got mugged and sacked only not in that order
although it wasn't an actual mugging, it was only an attempted mugging according to the policeman because they didn't...
but you couldn't end it with lydia, 'cause you weren't sure how she'd take it
and i told you that something if you remember my words, something 'ungoverned by you' would happen to bring the situation to a head
you know sometimes it helps to just say whatever it is out loud
of course it also helps if people just mind their own business and leave you alone.
you're still counting how long you've been apart in days and probably hours and minutes
but... the big flashing red light way of telling you're not really over someone ...is when you're still reading their horoscope... in the hope that they're going to get wiped out in some freak napalming incident
last week, when i got the sack and i came back, am i going mad?
but there was a bottle of brandy and two glasses on the dressing table, wasn't there?
i, i told you, i couldn't sleep so i got up in the night... to get a drink to knock myself out it was still there in the afternoon when you got home
i mean you had also, that day if, if you remember had taken a blow to the, the, the, the head
i said i was going to the library so i've come to the library, for god's sake!
of course i can't come now, i mean what if she's still lurking or waiting round the corner or something?
exactly ...sorry, let me just lydia's becoming more and more demanding... and you, you feel bad because helen's working night and day to keep the money coming in
but you've asked helen to come on a research trip to dorset with you... knowing that she wouldn't be able to... to cover up the fact... that you're really taking lydia and, and despite the fact that...

oh shit i stubbed my foot on the side of the shagging bath

i mean they are single-handedly condemning the average red-blooded englishman to a life of terminal monogamy
well, after clive's party i didn't want to just presume that you'd, that we had
you think i just go to bed with all successful oarsmen that i come across?
i didn't tell you before because i don't know why, i...
i have wanted to tell you so many times and ...and now you've found out another way i wish i had told y ou
oh, helen... if we are not gonna be together then let's make sure it's for the right reason
and right now there is no reason, none there is just confusion and it can be erased in a split second

hey, hey, this is johnny latte from the 102.5 wkzn morning zoo!
and we're coming at you live from our billboard in downtown philadelphia, where it's a crisp and clean, no-caffeine 16 degrees out here.
i really thought i had a chance to go to the super bowl, but i guess i never really did, huh?
there's always gonna be an eskimo standing in my way, isn't there, cory?
you see, this is why you'll never end up with any woman worth having.
we finally met two girls that are different than any other girls we've ever dated before.
well, we just went out with you 'cause you were cute.
besides, why would we want to be with someone exactly like ourselves?
i know the assignment was to help him succeed, but, mr. feeny, it was like he didn't need my help on this one, you know?

and clearly you've wasted all your time, as i continue to comprehend nothing.
cory, shawn isn't going to go to college and succeed because you want him to.
but the right thing to do is just step aside and let us live it.
i mean, we learned that because you taught it to us.

you and those of you who have studied here form part of a saga, that, like a blanket from paracas, carries the knowledge, the truth and the ethics that went into its well-weaved yarn.
one mistake, one dishonest act, one error is enough to destroy the age-old, intricately, detailed work of this university.
i don't know who you are, sir, but i assure you, my transactions were all legitimate.
you see, i had no actual knowledge that the items were stolen.

i figure if gordon can have his hero, why can't i have mine?
you knock a few heads, i go home with my hands clean.
i wasn't aware that the police evidence room had a lending policy.
i'm hoping it can provide a clue to the judge's identity.
a personality so separate, he even tried to kill himself without knowing it.
that's how judge knew about the escape hatch in two-face's apartment.
i regret so much that i didn't took care of her when i have the chance.

[man narrating] this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
general, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
mr. stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
mr. truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,
- that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
we can just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it... and kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t. s keep your ass on the ground.
- so that if i were to kick you in the balls,
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
- actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
¤ everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't ¤
¤ kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint ¤
¤ but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl ¤
¤ you say you only love him but you got to have it all ¤
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
[male newscaster #1] a french satellite has tracked an object in space...
[female newscaster #2] sources are estimating that the tidal wave was...
[female newscaster #4] the pentagon is getting involved at this point... with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission...
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation... that there could be a very serious problem.
[truman] we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with russian, japanese... and french space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
i address you tonight, not as the president of the united states,
not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity.
- knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
- through all the chaos that is our history, - [translator on tv]
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there, but we got a hole to dig up there.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
i want you to tell chick... that i couldn't have done it without him, none of it.
i went to see your granddad just before i come up here, grace, and... he told me that god gives us children so that... we could have roses in december.
just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew...
back in 1974, we first got the idea... the possibility that a meteor or an asteroid...
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
and as your boss, i want you on that crew boat tonight and back in the office by monday.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.

mr. stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?

well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,

her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t. s keep your ass on the ground.
- so that if i were to kick you in the balls,
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping that the tail debris will be cleared by the moon's gravity.
you're gonna remote detonate the bomb... before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock... should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.

- so, truman, this is who you found to save the planet.
- ¤ aah ¤ - ¤ leavin' on a jet plane ¤
- ¤ i don't know when i'll be back again ¤
i address you tonight, not as the president of the united states,
not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... traveling into the heavens.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there, but we got a hole to dig up there.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
i want you to tell chick... that i couldn't have done it without him, none of it.
i went to see your granddad just before i come up here, grace, and... he told me that god gives us children so that... we could have roses in december.
this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j. idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew...
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.

you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off- poof- your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr. truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact- which we think it will be- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggressión.
gentlemen, i'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.

* you say you only love him but you got to have it all *
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.

the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.

i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there, ...but we got a hole to dig up there.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.

guys, l-l-l know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
he's the only one in your age bracket, grace. lt's not a choice, it's a lack of options.
i don't know what in the world makes you think that you have the right to tell me what to do any more, harry.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off--
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact-- which we think it will be-- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour... covering california and washing up in denver.
six billion people on the planet-- why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and... i'm very impressed with your work;
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
- l mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, i'm gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow for launch prep in florida... but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle lndependence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping... that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
come on, harry. lt's not like i'm rootin' for a.j. here.
- l'm just sayin', grace is not a little girl any more.
okay, but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
- leavin' on a jet plane i don't know when i'll be back again
i address you tonight... not as the president of the united states... not as the leader of a country... but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history... through all of the wrongs and the discord... through all of the pain and suffering... through all of our times there is one thing...
and elevated our species above its origins... and that is our courage.
the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
listen, once you get up there, you're gonna be on your own.
if anything should happen, i just wanted-- l know, harry. i'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.
maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.
but that's what makes it so intense, is it's so confused.
we have a visual on the russian space station. initiating retro burn.
gentlemen, remember the russian space station has been up there for 11 years.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb... and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
i wish i could be there to walk you down the aisle.
but i'll-- l'll look in on you from time to time, okay, honey?
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
look, i was raised on roughnecks by you... and now you get all shocked and shaken when i fall in love with one.
her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defence... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
- mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
six billion people on the planet... why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and...

if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um...
your triglycerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, i'm gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
- yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.

- and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.

- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin'down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
he's the only one in your age bracket, grace. lt's not a choice, it's a lack of options.
i don't know what in the world makes you think that you have the right to tell me what to do any more, harry.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off--
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact-- which we think it will be-- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour... covering california and washing up in denver.
six billion people on the planet-- why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.

couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.

it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact which we think it will be it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a piss-poor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
gentlemen, i'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission.
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation... that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with russian, japanese... and french space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
i address you tonight, not as the president of the united states,
not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr. president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
- well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j. - idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
uh, b-back in-in- in 1974, we-we first got the idea- the-the possibility that-that a meteor or an asteroid-
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
and as your boss, i want you on that crew boat tonight and back in the office by monday.
with the proximity of the asteroid and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
mr stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact- which we think it will be- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
- no, i said... you did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,
- that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
we can just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it... and kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggressión.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t.s keep your ass on the ground.
- so that if i were to kick you in the balls,
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
- actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the lndependence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.

so while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the nasa missión taking place right now in the vast ocean of space,
- [ speaking russian ] - we're now in the final hours of the missión, as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.

if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.
[ man ] mr president, it's time to make a decisión.
we can remote detonate the bomb for only another five minutes.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
yes, mr president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, l-l-l know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
[ man narrating ] this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.

you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
general, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off-- poof-- your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
[ dan ] so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
- [ man chattering on p.a. ] - [ helicopter blades whirring ]
- did you steal a key to the patent office ?
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.

you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,
oh, good, 'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing... about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's a job... that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts harry stamper... can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle lndependence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.

you're gonna remote detonate the bomb... before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock... should be deflected enough to pass right by us.

mrs. lando, when your husband enrolled mathilda at spencer... he told us she had "problems. '"
as you know, we pride ourselves on turning troubled girls... into healthy, productive young women.
if you saved my life, you must've saved it for a good reason.
if you throw me out now, it's like you never opened your door...
the rifle is the first weapon you learn how to use... because it lets you keep your distance from the client.
the closer you get to being a pro... the closer you can get to the client.
if you really love it, you should plant it in a park so it can have roots.
you should be watering me if you want me to grow.
now i want you to tell me everything you know about italian food.
don't forget the name of the chef who fixed it for me.
a few hours later, a little 12-year-old girl comes into my office... armed to the teeth, with the firm intention of sending me to the morgue.
do you know who came and got her right there in my building?
[ man narrating ] this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.

[ female newscaster #1 ] the death of 50,000 people in shanghai yesterday has rattled...
[ male newscaster #1 ] a french satellite has tracked an object in space...
[ female newscaster #2 ] sources are estimating that the tidal wave was five...
[ male newscaster #2 ] this is cnn, live in florida.
[ female newscaster #3 ] the government has been very tight-lipped throughout this...
[ female newscaster #4 ] the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission...
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
[ truman ] we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
leavin' on a jet plane don't know when i'll be back again
so, truman, this is who you found to save the planet.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time, in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction.
every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls...
that's why i told you, "touch nothing." but you're bunch of cowboys.
so while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space,
- the reason we were shooting for grid 8 is because thermographics indicated that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.
which means that you landed us on a goddamn iron plate.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
[ man ] mr. president, it's time to make a decision.
we can remote detonate the bomb for only another five minutes.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we're getting leaks from several nasa officials, some rushing home to be with their families, that the drilling was unsuccessful.
[ male newscaster #2 ] this could very well be our final hour.
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little
a.j.- idioting mind of yours you want, but as long as it says
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
back in 1974, we first got the idea, the possibility that a, that a meteor or an asteroid...
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddy noonan's tattoos.
look, i was raised on roughnecks by you and now you get all shocked and shaken when i fall in love with one.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off...
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact, which we think it will be, it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting around somewhere right now just thinking shit up and somebody backing them up.
you telling me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're telling me?
we can all just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon coming up behind the asteroid.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
now, here's the key, you're gonna remote detonate the bomb before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
okay, but harry, all we're saying is, we're talking about a kid who's coming into her own right now.
and she's getting curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothing but you got to have it all
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction.
every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space.
all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle.
so while the consciousness of the planet is unified focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space.
we're now in the final hours of the mission as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without them.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, i know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
that allows us to track about three percent of the sky.
- and begging your pardon, sir, but it's a big-ass sky.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
do you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b. b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
look, i was raised on roughnecks by you... and now you get all shocked and shaken when i fall in love with one.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
general, if you consider your target- her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off-
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact- which we think it will be- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1, 000 miles an hour... covering california and washing up in denver.
six billion people on the planet- why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a. j. , i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and... i'm very impressed with your work;
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um-
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22, 500 miles per hour.
when i get back, when we get this job done... i will deal with this in my own way.
come on, harry. lt's not like i'm rootin' for a. j. here.
- yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
- leavin' on a jet plane i don't know when i'll be back again
i address you tonight... not as the president of the united states... not as the leader of a country... but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history... through all of the wrongs and the discord... through all of the pain and suffering... through all of our times there is one thing...
and elevated our species above its origins... and that is our courage.
the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
listen, once you get up there, you're gonna be on your own.
if anything should happen, i just wanted- l know, harry. i'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.

i wish i could be there to walk you down the aisle.
but i'll- l'll look in on you from time to time, okay, honey?
that allows us to track about three percent of the sky.

your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defence... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
- mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.

it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send 'em to the asteroid, they'll land, they'll drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes... take off and detonate if we can fix this equipment problem.
now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
no, i said you did a piss-poor job of putting it together.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
how about just, "a.j., i'm sorry, and-- and i love ya."
you know, a.j., there's not a job on the planet... that i want you to work with me on.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us who actually killed kennedy, would ya?
your triglycerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.

i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind... of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission--
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation... in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies... on the most massive joint space venture in history.
you don't have to apologize at all. l-- l sh-- l shouldn't have dragged you around on all those oil rigs. i just--
i don't think that i did the right thing with you.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.

- l got that excited, scared feelin'-- like 98% excited, 2% scared.
maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
- and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
- my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
and i have never, never missed a depth that i have aimed for.
and by god, i am not gonna miss this one. i will make 800 feet.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
once the asteroid hits zero barrier... it will take about three hours and 57 minutes to impact earth.
well, i guess we do it the president's way. i'll order an evac.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, l-l-l know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
i never told anybody this before, but i hate flying', so it'd be an awful shame to die now.
that's easy for you to say. i owe 100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark... which i spent on a stripper named molly mounds.
while you're far away and dreamin' i just wanna stay with you ln this moment forever
forever and ever i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna fall asleep
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
uh, b-back in, uh, 1974... w- we first got the-the idea, the possibility that a, that a meteor or an asteroid-
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.

the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.

guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
that allows us to track about three percent of the sky.
- and begging your pardon, sir, but it's a big-ass sky.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
do you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.

well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and...
how about just, "a.j., i'm sorry, and- and i love ya. "
you know, a.j., there's not a job on the planet... that i want you to work with me on.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um-
hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us who actually killed kennedy, would ya?
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, i'm gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping... that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
- yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
- well, listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind... of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission-
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation... in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies... on the most massive joint space venture in history.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
- my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 1 50 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
general, if you consider your target-- her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off--
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.
we've been apologized to for the last 1 8 and a half hours.
- mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 1 5 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send 'em to the asteroid, they'll land, they'll drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes... take off and detonate if we can fix this equipment problem.
now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
if you see bear, you tell him harry's lookin' for him.
those guys get off this rig, they scatter.j. otis curlene bear-- probably the only black man on a big hog in kadoka, south dakota.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
your triglycerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
it would normally take 1 8 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow... for launch prep in florida, but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
okay, but, harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.

if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 1 2 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb... and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
i want you to tell chick... that i couldn't have done it without him, none of it.
i went to see your granddad just before i come up here, grace, and... he told me that god gives us children so that we could have roses in december.
this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the goahead from down here when it's in alignment.
well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j.idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew... before we strike oil.
uh, bback inin in 1974, wewe first got the idea thethe possibility thatthat a meteor or an asteroid
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spreadfocus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
with the proximity of the asteroid and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
mr. stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
oh, good, 'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing... about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's a job... that mr. allgonoquitbignuts harry stamper... can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
we can just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it... and kill everything and everybody we know.

this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
so that if i were to kick you in the balls, ooh.
and you don't know how to work them, what happens to you?
then you'll release... and take a 60hour trip toward the moon.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.

* everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't *
* kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint *
* but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl *
* you say you only love him but you got to have it all *
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation... that there could be a very serious problem.

the human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
it could be 2 it could be 98 percent scared, 2 percent excited.
but that's what makes it so intense, is it's so confused.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his socalled advisors.

i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission... has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now... is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
- well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j.-idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
uh, b-back in-in-- in 1974, we-we first got the idea-- the-the possibility that-that a meteor or an asteroid--
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.

th¡s ¡s the earth at a t¡me when the d¡nosaurs roamed... a lush and fert¡le planet.
a p¡ece of rock just s¡x m¡les w¡de changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tact¡cal compar¡ng all the space junk you track ¡n every orb¡t.
i want you to check, recheck and then do ¡t all over aga¡n.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object coll¡s¡on, okay?
any ¡deas, any programs, anyth¡ng you sketched on a p¡zza box or a cockta¡l napk¡n.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he d¡ed that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shoot¡n' h¡m ¡s tak¡n' care of h¡m.
he's the only one ¡n your age bracket, grace. lt's not a cho¡ce, ¡t's a lack of opt¡ons.
i don't know what ¡n the world makes you th¡nk that you have the r¡ght to tell me what to do any more, harry.
i was play¡ng w¡th t¡tan¡um depth gauges when i should've been play¡ng w¡th dolls.
i mean, i learned about the b¡rds and the bees from fredd¡e noonan's tattoos.
you close your f¡st around the same f¡recracker and set ¡t off--
your w¡fe's gonna be open¡ng your ketchup bottles the rest of your l¡fe.
we've been apolog¡zed to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so ¡f you don't m¡nd, how 'bout ¡f we just get on w¡th ¡t... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna f¡nd out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on w¡th ¡t?
so when the rogue comet h¡t the astero¡d belt, ¡t sent shrapnel r¡ght for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's ¡n a shoot¡ng gallery.
even ¡f the astero¡d ¡tself h¡ts the water, ¡t's st¡ll h¡tt¡ng land.
it'll flash-bo¡l m¡ll¡ons of gallons of sea water and slam ¡nto the ocean bedrock.
now, ¡f ¡t's a pac¡f¡c ocean ¡mpact-- wh¡ch we th¡nk ¡t w¡ll be--
we'll send 'em to the astero¡d, they'll land, they'll dr¡ll a hole, they'll drop some nukes... take off and detonate ¡f we can f¡x th¡s equ¡pment problem.
now, the, uh, dr¡ll¡ng un¡t's a prototype we've been bu¡ld¡ng for the mars project.
you sa¡d we d¡d a bad job of putt¡ng ¡t together?
no, i sa¡d you d¡d a p¡ss-poor job of putt¡ng ¡t together.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work w¡th the best.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-qu¡t-b¡g-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by h¡mself... and needs my expert adv¡ce?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... f¡ve words i wanna hear from you r¡ght now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.

you'll then use lunar grav¡ty and burn your thrusters... sl¡ngshott¡ng you around the moon... com¡ng up beh¡nd the astero¡d.

so this flimsy piece of paper is the "top ten future leaders" certificate?
so this flimsy piece of paper is the "top ten future leaders" certificate?
do you know each year the u.n. chooses only 10 people as mankind's future leaders?
i was one of them, and also the first chinese ever selected.
according to the record, mr. anderson weighed about 175 pounds, but his identifiable remains totaled less than 10 pounds.
that includes a portion of the liver, one section of the spine, one complete left foot, and a shoe and sock that were hardly torched.
besides movies, you can also surf the net, do grocery shopping or shop for other things online.
if combined with the use of a smart card, you can even transfer your money from your bank.
we found a large sum of cash and his credit cards.
also, the suit which mr. sato was last seen wearing was scattered all over the place.
if he has really left the place, it must be either voluntary, or he must have been unconscious.
as for the autopsy report on the two ml6 members, the cause of death was heart failure.
normally, when there are multiple bodies in a common crime scene, their cause of death is usually the same.
so why did the japanese dissolve into ashes, but not the other two guys?
if you can break into his system, you'll become a legend overnight.
even the japanese will be running scared when they hear your name.
but they all share the same theme, and that is the religion's prediction for armageddon.
buddhism emphasizes the idea of a beginning and an end, that there must be an end before there is a beginning.
the first sign-the antichrist will appear in the name of satan.
on that day, the fiery mountains will sink into the oceans.
the river will become bitter, and because of that, many will die.
"wormwood" is a kind of herbs, but it's also known by its nickname,
the moon will turn red, and all the stars will fall.
the seventh sign-"who does not believe in me will turn to me when the day comes".
you and the remaining 1,500 people will turn into gods and recreate a perfect world.
by then, the new world will have no war, no starvation, no disease, not even triads.
christmas was the first day in hong kong history where there were no deaths.
they believe it was a miracle that the 4 critically injured survive.
we have reasons to believe that your life is in danger.
so this flimsy piece of paper is the "top ten future leaders" certificate?
the u.s. has recorded cases of spontaneous combustion as early as 1952.
the evidence was very similar to the ones at the tower.
we believe that the murders are all related to brotherhood of technology.
mr. ken, are you sure you haven't receive any solicitation from this group?
we suspect that he is the leader of brotherhood of technology.
i don't think this group is after money, because billy conners is already one of the top ten billionaires.
everything here is firewall protected to prevent our computer systems from hackers breaking in.
just seeing all these rolls of wiring gives me the creeps.
furthermore, with vod movies, you can fast forward, pause, and rewind, just like watching it on videotape.
besides movies, you can also surf the net, do grocery shopping or shop for other things online.
only the top five firms would feel most threatened by mr. ken.
teresa, search the net for the list of top level managers from these firms.
i have to check on those hawkers at the market everyday for fraud.
and i have to make sure that cars won't hit the kids when they cross.
this proves that the probability of a forced abduction was very low.

this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
uh, b-back in, uh, 1974... w-we first got the-the idea, the possibility that a, that a meteor or an asteroid...
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off...
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
we'll send 'em to the asteroid, they'll land, they'll drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes... take off and detonate if we can fix this equipment problem.
now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
no, i said you did a piss-poor job of putting it together.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr. all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and...
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um...
your trigly cerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.

- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.

the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.

but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb... and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without' em.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.

for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact-- which we think it will be-- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.

you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.

i address you tonight, not as the president of the united states,

the reason we were shooting for grid 8 is because... thermographics indicated that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.
which means that you landed us on a goddamn iron plate.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.

see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there, but we got a hole to dig up there.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.

- [ groaning ] - [ rattling ceases ] [ exhales ] we have acquisition of signal from lndependence and freedom. - [ relieved chattering ]
- oh, my god, this is it. - [ blipping ] - [ all screaming ]
- [ translator on radio ] - knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... traveling into the heavens.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
we gotta get that radio back up. [ man ] mr. president, it's time to make a decision.
we can remote detonate the bomb for only another five minutes.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
let's go back to the ship! i'm not leavin' without my men, sharp.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
[ male newscaster #2 ] this could very well be our final hour. [ male newscaster #3 speaking foreign language ]
[ male newscaster #4 ] we're gonna go off the air now.
[ male newscaster #1 ] martial law has been implemented in 42 countries.
[ male newscaster #2 ] once the asteroid hits zero barrier, it will take about three hours and 57 minutes to impact earth.
- it's not over till we get the bomb down that hole.
- watts, they've got 38 minutes. [ sharp ] harry, you've gotta give me that hole.
i want you to take care of a.j. i wish i could be there to walk you down the aisle.
but i'll-- [ sighs ] i'll look in on you from time to time, okay, honey? i love you, grace.
#* well, i just wanna be with you right here #*
#* well, i just wanna be with you right here #* #* with you just like this #*
#*#* [ woman vocalizing ] #* all my bags are packed i'm ready to go #*
#* all my bags are packed i'm ready to go #*
#* i hate to wake you up to say good-bye #*
#* i hate to wake you up to say good-bye #* #* but the dawn is breakin' it's early morn #*
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
do you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
uh, b-back in, uh, 197 4... w-we fiirst got the-the idea, the possibility that a, that a meteor or an asteroid--
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
look, i was raised on roughnecks by you... and now you get all shocked and shaken when i fall in love with one.
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacifiic air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defence... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna fiind out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacifiic ocean impact-- which we think it will be-- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour... covering california and washing up in denver.
six billion people on the planet-- why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
no, i said you did a piss-poor job of putting it together.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and...
how about just, "a.j., i'm sorry, and-- and i love ya."
you know, a.j., there's not a job on the planet... that i want you to work with me on.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
your triglycerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow for launch prep in florida... but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've fiinished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
okay, but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fiighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
but it can't be love iff you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind... of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission--
senior pentagon offiicials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation... in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies... on the most massive joint space venture in history.
and yet, for the fiirst time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history... through all of the wrongs and the discord... through all of the pain and suffering... through all of our times there is one thing...
and elevated our species above its origins... and that is our courage.
the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
so while the consciousness off the planet is uniffied... focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean off space...
we're now in the ffinal hours off the mission... as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional fiive.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fiire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb... and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we fiinish, we leave without 'em.
and what we're trying to do right now is to conffirm that and ffind out exactly what that means.
repeat.we're getting leaks ffrom several nasa offfficials... some rushing home to be with their ffamilies, that the drilling was unsuccessfful.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, l-l-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
- you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
- now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
general, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off-- poof-- your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr. stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense on direct orders from the president of the united states.
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
- so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send 'em to the asteroid, they'll land, they'll drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a piss-poor job of putting it together, is that it?
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope,...
oh, good, 'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts harry stamper can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
- okay, you wanna be all psychological with me, that's fine.
i'll tell you one thing that really drives me nuts is people who think jethro tull is just a person in the band.
- it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
launch prep in florida. but i thought you oughta take a look.
- the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t.s keep your ass on the ground.
- so that if i were to kick you in the balls,...
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
you're gonna remote detonate the bomb before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
- well, listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
* everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't *
* kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint *
* but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl *
* you say you only love him but you got to have it all *
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
[male newscaster #1] a french satellite has tracked an object in space--
[female newscaster #2] sources are estimating that the tidal wave was five--

nasa's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
- * leavin' on a jet plane don't know when i'll be back again *
- so, truman, this is who you found to save the planet.
- * aah * - * leavin' on a jet plane *
- * i don't know when i'll be back again *
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time in the history of the planet, a species has the technology...
- [translator on radio] - ...knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing...
that's why i told you, "touch nothing." but you're bunch of cowboys.
so while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space, we're now in the final hours of the mission, as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.

and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
we're getting leaks from several nasa officials, some rushing home to be with their families, that the drilling was unsuccessful.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
our fiirst feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
general, if you consider your target-- her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fiire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientifiic advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your flist around the same fiirecracker and set it off--
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.

now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all fiigured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
if you see bear, you tell him harry's lookin' for him.
those guys get off this rig, they scatter.j. otis curlene bear-- probably the only black man on a big hog in kadoka, south dakota.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... fiive words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
hey, you guys wouldn't be able to tell us who actually killed kennedy, would ya?
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, i'm gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.

then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.

now, when you've fiinished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping... that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
- yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
- well, listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.

- my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fiire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin'down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
we're getting sketchy infformation that the mission has suffffered massive ffailure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to conffirm that and ffind out exactly what that means.
that allows us to track about three percent of the sky.
- and begging your pardon, sir, but it's a big-ass sky.

- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
when i get back, when we get this job done... i will deal with this in my own way.
come on, harry. lt's not like i'm rootin' for a.j. here.
- yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
- so, in part, we all feel like a bunch of daddies here.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
- well, listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind... of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission--
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation... in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies... on the most massive joint space venture in history.
you don't have to apologize at all. l-- l sh-- l shouldn't have dragged you around on all those oil rigs. i just--
i don't think that i did the right thing with you.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
- l got that excited, scared feelin'-- like 98% excited, 2% scared.
maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
- and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
- my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
and i have never, never missed a depth that i have aimed for.
and by god, i am not gonna miss this one. i will make 800 feet.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
once the asteroid hits zero barrier... it will take about three hours and 57 minutes to impact earth.
well, i guess we do it the president's way. i'll order an evac.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, l-l-l know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
i never told anybody this before, but i hate flying', so it'd be an awful shame to die now.
that's easy for you to say. i owe 100 grand to a bad-ass loan shark... which i spent on a stripper named molly mounds.
while you're far away and dreamin' i just wanna stay with you ln this moment forever
forever and ever i don't wanna close my eyes i don't wanna fall asleep
'cause i'm leaving on a jet plane i don't know when i'll be back again
oh, babe, i hate to go i'm leaving on a jet plane
this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew... before we strike oil.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
and as your boss, i want you on that crew boat tonight and back in the office by monday.
with the proximity of the asteroid and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
mr. stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defense... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
- no, i said... you did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,
- that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
gentlemen, i'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
what if they're too burnt out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you only love him but you got to have it all
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point... with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission--

every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing that has...
and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... traveling into the heavens.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission... has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now... is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
he's the only one in your age bracket, grace. lt's not a choice, it's a lack of options.
i don't know what in the world makes you think that you have the right to tell me what to do any more, harry.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
general, if you consider your target-- her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr stamper, i'm general montgomery, commander of the pacific air forces.
i've been sent here by the secretary of defence... on direct orders from the president of the united states.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
- mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.

now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
no, i said you did a piss-poor job of putting it together.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
how about just, "a.j., i'm sorry, and-- and i love ya."
you know, a.j., there's not a job on the planet... that i want you to work with me on.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow for launch prep in florida... but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle lndependence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.

i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.

we can just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it... and kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t.s keep your ass on the ground.
so that if i were to kick you in the balls, and you don't know how to work them, what happens to you?
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping that the tail debris will be cleared by the moon's gravity.
you're gonna remote detonate the bomb... before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock... should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.

guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
i want you to tell chick... that i couldn't have done it without him, none of it.
i went to see your granddad just before i come up here, grace, and... he told me that god gives us children so that... we could have roses in december.
two, i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
do you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out in an hour?
a.j.- idioting mind of yours you want, but as long as it says
"harry stamper oil" on the rig you will not disobey my rules.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.

i'm a third-generation driller, doing it all my life and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
'cause i kind of wanted to get back to this whole thing about you asking me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr. all-go-no-quit-big-nuts harry stamper can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are, "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving for launch prep in florida, but i thought you ought to take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker will command the shuttle independence.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t.s keep your ass on the ground.
so that if i were to kick you in the balls and you don't know how to work them, what happens to you?
then you'll release and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
okay, so you drill, you drop the nuke, and you leave.
now, here's the key, you're gonna remote detonate the bomb before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
and i know what it feels like to have your hormones pulling you in just, you know, a thousand different directions you don't know which end is up.
yo, harry, no disrespect, man, but we all helped to raise her.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let them spend it with their families.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission...
senior pentagon officials refused comment adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
i address you tonight not as the president of the united states,
not as the leader of a country, but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time in the history of the planet, a species has the technology to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service.
all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history, through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times there is one thing,
...and elevated our species above its origins and that is our courage.
the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight on those 14 brave souls traveling into the heavens.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr. president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be coming home.
now, i don't know what you people are doing down there, but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
repeat, we're getting leaks from several nasa officials, some rushing home to be with their families, that the drilling was unsuccessful.
nobody asked you if you could live with it, all right?
no way i will let you volunteer for this so i can go back to my home country like the man who didn't volunteer.
this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j. idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
just tryin' to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew...
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
general, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off- poof- your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr. truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later, she's gonna find out one way or the other.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact- which we think it will be- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travelling at 1,000 miles an hour covering california and washing up in denver.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here, that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggressión.
gentlemen, i'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
you can walk around, but use your thrusters so you can work easier.
okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
* everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't *
* kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint *
* but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl *
* you say you only love him but you got to have it all *
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point... with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle missión-
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation... that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with russian, japanese... and french space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
- * aah * - * leavin' on a jet plane *
* i don't know when i'll be back again * i'm marrying you.
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb, and we have one chance to save this planet!
i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there, ...but we got a hole to dig up there.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, l-l-l know you guys think i'm crazy right now, but i would really like this responsibility.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
okay, pete, we got that coupling on the board here now.
we'll give you the go-ahead from down here when it's in alignment.
two, i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j. -idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
look, i understand that you are handicapped by natural immaturity, and i forgive you.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
with the proximity of the asteroid and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
mr. truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.

we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
no, i said you did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
oh, good, 'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's a job that mr. all-go-no-quit-big-nuts harry stamper can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
we can just sit here on earth, wait for this big rock to crash into it and kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare, prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
'cause i'm trying to describe to you how these d.a.t. s keep your ass on the ground.

okay, mr. truman, let's say that we actually do land on this.
you're gonna remote detonate the bomb before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
she's gettin' curious about her body, and she's exploring her sexuality.

so while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space,
we're now in the final hours of the mission, as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.
- the reason we were shooting for grid 8 is because thermographics indicated that grid 9 was compressed iron ferrite.
which means that you landed us on a goddamn iron plate.

i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.

if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.

the human thirst for excellence, knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time, you may lose the ability to detonate the nuke... permanently.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.
it's fried two of our drill bits, and now we blew our first transmission.
my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr. president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission... has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now... is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now, i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
he's the only one in your age bracket, grace. lt's not a choice, it's a lack of options.
i don't know what in the world makes you think that you have the right to tell me what to do any more, harry.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off--
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
so if you don't mind, how 'bout if we just get on with it... and you tell us why we're here at the nasa space centre?
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
now, if it's a pacific ocean impact-- which we think it will be-- it'll create a tidal wave three miles high, travel at 1,000 miles an hour... covering california and washing up in denver.
six billion people on the planet-- why'd you guys call me?
- we need you to prep the team we're sending up.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i'm a third-generation driller, doin' it all my life... and i still haven't got it all figured out.
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
you don't trust the men you're working with, you're as good as dead.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now... just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tellin' me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here... that is the world's hope, that's what you're tellin' me?
'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
"you've been a hero of mine for a long time, and... i'm very impressed with your work;
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
i don't mean to be the materialistic weasel of this group, but... you think we'll get hazard pay out of this?
if you're trying to make me feel better about this scenario, give it up.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um--
- l mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, i'm gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow for launch prep in florida... but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle lndependence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping... that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
come on, harry. lt's not like i'm rootin' for a.j. here.
- l'm just sayin', grace is not a little girl any more.
okay, but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
- what if they're too burned out to do the right thing?
what if they get up there, and they forget what they're fighting for?
for all we know, tomorrow night could be the last night they ever see earth.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
- leavin' on a jet plane i don't know when i'll be back again
i address you tonight... not as the president of the united states... not as the leader of a country... but as a citizen of humanity.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history... through all of the wrongs and the discord... through all of the pain and suffering... through all of our times there is one thing...
and elevated our species above its origins... and that is our courage.
the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
listen, once you get up there, you're gonna be on your own.
if anything should happen, i just wanted-- l know, harry. i'll, uh, try not to disappoint you.
maybe it's more. lt could be 2-- lt could be 98% percent scared, 2% excited.
but that's what makes it so intense, is it's so confused.
we have a visual on the russian space station. initiating retro burn.
gentlemen, remember the russian space station has been up there for 11 years.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
we've only got a few minutes left of guaranteed ability to remote detonate that nuke.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
and if you detonate that nuke on the surface, we waste a perfectly good bomb... and we have one chance to save this planet!
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
- we've got two and a half minutes to drop it and get off this rock.
if they're not back by the time we finish, we leave without 'em.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
i wish i could be there to walk you down the aisle.
but i'll-- l'll look in on you from time to time, okay, honey?
just trying to give my man a head start, that's all.
not to mention the fact that i don't think you wanna kill the best man on your crew before we strike oil.
uh, b-back in, uh, 1974... w- we first got the-the idea, the possibility that a, that a meteor or an asteroid-
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
look, i was raised on roughnecks by you... and now you get all shocked and shaken when i fall in love with one.
with the proximity of the asteroid... and no prep time, none of our primary plans can work.
why don't we just send up 150 nuclear warheads and blast that rock apart?
general, if you consider your target- her composition, her dimensions... her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got at her... and she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off-
your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
i don't know if we can take any more apologies, mr truman.
we've been apologized to for the last 18 and a half hours.
- mr truman, i don't keep any secrets from my daughter, grace.
so whether you tell her now or i tell her later she's gonna find out... one way or the other, so why don't we just get on with it?
so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash-boil millions of gallons of sea water and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send 'em to the asteroid, they'll land, they'll drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes... take off and detonate if we can fix this equipment problem.
now, the, uh, drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
does that mean that there's actually a job that mr all-go-no-quit-big-nuts...
harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
we can all just sit here on earth... wait for this big rock to crash into it, kill everything and everybody we know.
the united states government just asked us to save the world.
not sure if that's gonna work, but let's see what else.
chick wants a full week's emperor's package at caesar's palace, um-
your triglycerides are way high... and your bad cholesterol is shockingly bad.
- tell ya to lay off those pork rinds, pooh bear.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me it's not good enough.
and, uh, this is harry telling' me i can't marry his daughter.
it would normally take 18 months to psychologically prepare... prescreen viable subjects for space travel.
- we have seen evidence of a wide variety of territorial aggression.
she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving tomorrow for launch prep in florida... but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest... most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters... slingshotting you around the moon... coming up behind the asteroid.
- well, actually, we have a lot better rockets than the coyote.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
okay, but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.

all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
- and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
- we're drilling through some kind of metal i've never seen before.

i guarantee you, if you do this, you kill us all.
see, i promised my little girl that i'd be comin' home.
now, i don't know what you people are doin' down there... but we got a hole to dig up here.
we just happen to run into the grand canyon on the asteroid?
i told you, you took a wrong way, a wrong road.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
[man narrating] this is the earth at a time... when the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide... changed all that.
i want norad, space command and the 50th tactical, comparing all the space junk you tracked in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
- well, i think they feel... that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
someday, many years from now, when you're all growed up, and you got your own oil company and $8 million of your own money on the contract, you can do whatever comes into that little a.j.-idiotin' mind of yours you want.
but as long as it says "harry stamper oil" on the rig, you will not disobey my rules.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.
now i'm not sure that shooting' him is takin' care of him.
uh, b-back in-in-- in 1974, we-we first got the idea-- the-the possibility that-that a meteor or an asteroid--
i need somebody who's had a little less caffeine this morning.
our first feasibility plan was to use a spread-focus laser generator... to heat the object to the point of fracture.
that's like shooting a b.b. gun at a freight train, doc.
i may be an immature father, but i'm still your employer.
and as your boss, i want you on that crew boat tonight and back in the office by monday.
i was playing with titanium depth gauges when i should've been playing with dolls.
i mean, i learned about the birds and the bees from freddie noonan's tattoos.
general, if you consider your target, her composition, her dimensions, her sheer velocity, you could fire every nuke you've got on her, she'll just smile at you and keep on coming.
you should know that the president's scientific advisors... are suggesting that a nuclear blast could change this asteroid's trajectory.
you close your fist around the same firecracker and set it off-- poof-- your wife's gonna be opening your ketchup bottles the rest of your life.
are you suggesting that we blow this thing up from the inside?
so if you don't mind, how about if we just get on with it?
you tell us why we're here at the nasa space center.
[dan] so when the rogue comet hit the asteroid belt, it sent shrapnel right for us.
for the next 15 days, the earth's in a shooting gallery.
even if the asteroid itself hits the water, it's still hitting land.
it'll flash boil millions of gallons of seawater and slam into the ocean bedrock.
we'll send them to the asteroid, they'll land, drill a hole, they'll drop some nukes, take off and detonate, if we can fix this equipment problem.
the drilling unit's a prototype we've been building for the mars project.
i got pulled off an oil rig, flown halfway around the world because you stole my drill design.
couldn't read the plans right and did a pisspoor job of putting it together.
and we need to know what's wrong with it pretty quick.
- you said we did a bad job of putting it together?
i assume you sent for me because somebody told you i was the best.
well, i'm only the best because i work with the best.
i'm sure you got a team of men sitting' around somewhere right now, just thinkin' shit up and somebody backing' them up.
you tell me you don't have a backup plan, that these eight boy scouts right here,
oh, good, 'cause i kinda wanted to get back to this whole thing... about you askin' me for help.
does that mean that there's a job... that mr. all-go-no-quit-big-nuts harry stamper... can't handle by himself and needs my expert advice?
- i mean, i can handle what i'm, you know, gonna do.
i can handle that, but i don't know if i can handle this room.
her titanium alloy impenetrable skin covers the toughest, meanest, most sophisticated space vehicle man has ever made.
okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
gentlemen, i'll give you 30 seconds to put your helmets on.
then the oxygen will be sucked out of this vacuum, and you will know what it's like to be in space.
now we only have one shot of landing on this rock, and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
you'll then use lunar gravity and burn your thrusters, slingshotting you around the moon, coming up behind the asteroid.
now when you've finished... your road runner thrust move, you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping that the tail debris will be cleared by the moon's gravity.
you're gonna remote detonate the bomb... before the asteroid passes this plane, zero barrier.
you do that, and the remaining pieces of rock... should be deflected enough to pass right by us.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
* everybody talkin' about what it is, what it ain't *
* kiss on the devil and you piss off a saint *
* but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl *

i wanted to be one of those guys with a mission patch on my arm.
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
[male newscaster #1] a french satellite has tracked an object in space--
[female newscaster #2] sources are estimating that the tidal wave was five--
[female newscaster #4] the pentagon is getting involved at this point... with some kind of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission--
senior pentagon officials refused comment, adding fuel to the speculation... that there could be a very serious problem.
[truman] we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation in cooperation with russian, japanese... and french space agencies on the most massive joint space venture in history.
- * leavin' on a jet plane don't know when i'll be back again *
- so, truman, this is who you found to save the planet.
- * aah * - * leavin' on a jet plane *
- * i don't know when i'll be back again *
the bible calls this day armageddon, the end of all things.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology...
- [translator on radio] - knowledge, every step up the ladder of science, every adventurous reach into space, all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations, even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
- through all the chaos that is our history, - [translator on tv] through all of the wrongs and the discord, through all of the pain and suffering, through all of our times, there is one thing that has...
and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our courage.
dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... travelling into the heavens.
so while the consciousness of the planet is unified, focused on the nasa mission taking place right now in the vast ocean of space,
- [speaking russian] - we're now in the final hours of the mission, as the freedom and independence prepare to slingshot around the moon.
all right, let's get the tools unpacked and fire up the armadillo.
- we're not getting a damn thing on the inertial nav system.
radio signal's gonna be cut in half till we get main power back.
we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
and after seven minutes, we may never hear from them again.
but we're trying to bounce a signal... off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.

[male newscaster #1] we're getting sketchy information that the mission... has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now... is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
[male newscaster #1] martial law has been implemented in 42 countries.
[male newscaster #2] once the asteroid hits zero barrier, it will take about three hours and 57 minutes to impact earth.
this is the earth at a time when the dinosaurs roamed... a lush and fertile planet.
a piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that.
i want norad space command and the 50th tactical comparing all the space junk you track in every orbit.
i want you to check, recheck and then do it all over again.
that allows us to track about three percent of the sky.
- and begging your pardon, sir, but it's a big-ass sky.
well, i think they feel that drilling for oil is an evil thing.
do you know how much diesel that clunker boat pumps out an hour?
i want every strategy we've got on near-earth object collision, okay?
any ideas, any programs, anything you sketched on a pizza box or a cocktail napkin.
you told a.j.'s dad just before he died that you would take care of the boy.

harry stamper can't handle by himself... and needs my expert advice?
you know, harry, there are only, uh... five words i wanna hear from you right now.
and those words are: "you know, a.j., i really look up to you.
how about just, "a.j., i'm sorry, and... and i love ya."

she and her sister ship at vandenberg are leaving for launch prep in florida, but i thought you oughta take a look.
the two shuttles going up are the freedom and the independence.

okay, air force colonel davis, nasa pilot tucker... will command the shuttle independence.
this is about the sorriest group of people i've seen in all my entire military career.
your space flight's gonna be a brutal assault on your senses.
then you'll release... and take a 60-hour trip toward the moon.
now, we only have one shot of landing on this rock... and that's precisely when the asteroid passes by the moon.
now, when you've finished your road runner thrust move... you'll be moving at 22,500 miles per hour.
coming around behind the asteroid, where we're hoping... that the tail debris'll be cleared by the moon's gravity.
okay, but harry, all we're sayin' is, we're talkin' about a kid who's comin' into her own right now.
and she's gettin' curious about her body and she's exploring her sexuality.
a.j.'ll be running the drill team with oscar, bear and noonan on the independence.
i'll run the drill team on freedom with chick, rockhound and max.
once we land, we'll have eight hours to get the job done.
in order to split this rock on the fault line, we're gonna have to drill to 800 feet.
i don't think it's too much to ask to let 'em spend it with their families.
- well, listen, there's no possible way we can do that.
but it can't be love if you don't have to crawl
you say you don't need nothin' but you got to have it all
i tell you, i'd be on that shuttle with you, harry, if i could.
you don't want to be up in that shuttle any more than i do.
the pentagon is getting involved at this point with some kind... of a project involving nasa and perhaps a shuttle mission...
senior pentagon officials refused comment... adding fuel to the speculation that there could be a very serious problem.
we have a special team of astronauts that arrived in florida this evening.
nasa's in emergency launch preparation... in cooperation with russian, japanese and french space agencies... on the most massive joint space venture in history.
and yet, for the first time... in the history of the planet, a species has the technology... to prevent its own extinction.
all of you praying with us need to know... that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster... is being called into service.
the human thirst for excellence... and knowledge... every step up the ladder of science... every adventurous reach into space... all of our combined modern technologies and imaginations... even the wars that we've fought, have provided us the tools... to wage this terrible battle.
through all the chaos that is our history... through all of the wrongs and the discord... through all of the pain and suffering... through all of our times there is one thing...

the dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight... on those 14 brave souls... traveling into the heavens.

we're in segment 202, lateral grid 9, site 15h-32, give or take a few yards.
but we're trying to bounce a signal off a russian military satellite, reestablish contact that way.
if we lose the shuttle com, when do we lose the ability to remote detonate that nuke?
if we've got the shuttle for seven minutes, we can remote detonate for an additional five.
what he's trying to say, general, is that, uh, in 12 minutes' time you may lose the ability... to detonate the nuke permanently.
my men and i will go and get this hole dug!
you and your men are the biggest mistake in the history of nasa.
if we don't do it now we could lose control, and we may never get it back.
well, you tell the president that he better fire his so-called advisors.
yes, mr. president, i understand that completely, but my point is very, very simple.
and i think you need to trust me on this because i know something about it.
we're getting sketchy information that the mission has suffered massive failure.
and what we're trying to do right now is to confirm that and find out exactly what that means.
hey, man, let's draw, and let's see who's gonna stay up here and dance.
guys, i-i-i know you guys think i'm crazy right now... but i would really like this responsibility.
i'm madly in love with her and she left me 8 months ago.
you ever do something so terrible that you'd give anything in the world to put it right?
are you drinking from a guilty conscience or because you still love her?
you don't drink on a guilty conscience after, like, 8 months.
if there's one thing on the planet that i absolutely hate, it's the notting hill carnival.
because, i mean, if you live there, for 3 days it's just mayhem.
freddy gave me this, and was wondering whether or not it might be yours.
maybe you dropped it the last time you were over there.
because he'd already asked his girlfriend, and she said no, it wasn't hers.
and so he was wondering whether or not it might be yours.
i think he's just someone she's seen a couple of times.
i'm gonna have to take him into the toilet and tell him all about her.
but i know there was an important reason for me to come back.
why did you decide to go to india in the first place?
i got tired of building golf courses for rich people in scotland.
i thought i could do something more useful with my life.
once you start treating someone you can't leave them till they're cured.
yeah, sometimes i wonder whether some of them will ever be cured.
you still haven't told me about that beautiful red-haired woman you are looking for.
i can't actually tell you about her, because if i do, then i'll break the spell.
i admit he's not so bad, but it's obvious that's as far as he's going to get with his career.
did you see that episode when he caught his dad high on ecstasy?
i thought that i was stuck, but i know now that i'm not stuck anymore.
i've come ever such a long way without even realizing it.
good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the 19th bafta awards which are given to the most outstanding features in british television over the past year.
with these awards, we're not only placing bookmarks on the most memorable pages of a year's television, but we're also paying tribute to those faces we most wanted to meet and have as company when we switch on our television sets,
no, i don't, but i really need to see someone who's in there.
i'm sorry, but i really can't let you in without an invitation.
i had an affair and... and then i lied to you.
and then i left you for that person just like that.
you ever do something so terrible that you'd give anything in the world to put it right?
are you drinking from a guilty conscience or because you still love her?
i was thinking what to tell sylvia in case she asked me.
when all of a sudden, i thought i heard freddy giving me one of his usual pieces of advice.
freddy gave me this, and was wondering whether or not it might be yours.
maybe you dropped it the last time you were over there.
because he'd already asked his girlfriend, and she said no, it wasn't hers.
and so he was wondering whether or not it might be yours.
"and a pack of condoms fell out of your jacket pocket."
if vic is guilty, he'll get all nervous and betray himself.
no, really, i think that not only is psychology interesting, but it's also very important.
i mean, you know, as an actor, how else could i get into the hearts and minds of, you know, the characters that i play in and understand their wee foibles and... leave it, vic.
i think he's just someone she's seen a couple of times.
i'm gonna have to take him into the toilet and tell him all about her.
although it will probably take me a while to find out what it is.
but i know there was an important reason for me to come back.
why did you decide to go to india in the first place?
oh, i got tired of building golf courses for rich people in scotland.
you still haven't told me about that beautiful red-haired woman you are looking for.
i can't actually tell you about her, because if i do, then i'll break the spell.
i thought that i was stuck, but i know now that i'm not stuck anymore.

listen, don't ask me how, no why but i managed to get you some work.
it's a sci-fi film, it's called the return of killing silhouettes.
i'm madly in love with her and she left me eight months ago.
you ever do something so terrible that you'd give anything in the world to put it right?
are you drinking from a guilty conscience or because you still love her?
you don't drink on a guilty conscience after, like, eight months.
i was in a strange mood, and then to make matters ten times worse, it was carnival.
now, if there's one thing on the planet that i absolutely hate, it's the notting hill carnival.
i was thinking what to tell sylvia in case she asked me.
when all of a sudden, i thought i heard freddy giving me one of his usual pieces of advice.

maybe you dropped it the last time you were over there, something like that,
because he'd already asked his girlfriend, and she said no, it wasn't hers.
and so he was wondering whether or not it wouldn't be yours.
i just don't really see it going anywhere in the next kinda eight months.
so i'm a bit kinda confused as to, you know, what i'm supposed to be doing.
but i know there was an important reason for me to come back.
why did you decide to go to india in the first place?
oh, i got tired of building golf courses for rich people in scotland.

now apparently the school board thinks that i don't teach you anything about current events.
so tomorrow they're gonna have you do presentations for the whole board.
that's what chet everet thought when the new female intern joined the cast of medical center.
he thought who is this woman with her gozungas and high heels?
you have to give your reports to the town committee tomorrow!
and if it doesn't kick ass and you make me look bad,
you see when my father opened this store thirty years ago, he cared about only one thing making a great cup of coffee.
sure we may take a little longer to brew a cup, we may not call it fancy names.
the people of south park count on you to give them that first cup of coffee everyday.
i know, but if they open a harbucks right next door we might go out of business.
maybe it'll help us figure out what to do our report on.
we have to present it to the entire south park town committee tomorrow.
now make sure that sign is really bright and flashy now.
my goodness, that's going to be a really big coffee house, honey.
that smooth aroma and mild taste is what makes tweek coffee so very special.
special, like an arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew.
boys could i have a quick this and that with you?
boys i don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you better stick with it.
why don't you go back to the hole you crawled out from lady?
uh, mr. poston i think you've got a lot to learn about making coffee.
either your coffee or a fresh warm cup of tweek's coffee.
like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on tweek's coffee to start your day.
alright and now before we all vote yes on prop ten, here to remind us why are the loveable innocent children.
since we are so concerned with the corporate takeovers, we went and asked our friends the underpants gnomes and they told us all about big corporations.
ow i want you all to read a news paper or better yet watch television and come up with something current in south park to do a report on.
now this will be a group project so i'm gonna place you all into groups of five.
and that's why tweek coffee is still home brewed with the finest beans we can muster.
yes tweek coffee is a simpler coffee for a simpler america.
these boys should learn how the corporate machine is ruining america.
you see, i own a coffee shop and now some great, big multimillion-dollar company is going to move in and try to take all my business, which means i may have to shut down and sell my son tweek into slavery.
honestly richard, i don't see why you have to preach to some eight-year-olds.
actually honey, i think those little tikes are just what we need.
sometimes a hot cup of french roast almerato is just what a man needs to get him through the day.
that smooth aroma and mild taste is what makes tweek coffee so very special.
special, like an arizona sunrise or a juniper wet with dew.
a lite rain in the middle of a dusty afternoon or a hug from your dear old aunt...
don't worry mr. tweek, this committee is not going to let you run out of business by these bastards.
you hear that you're not gonna get away with this you whore!
and we would have never even known this was happening if it wasn't for these boys' excellent report.
you're telling me that students from mr. garrison's class actually did something that had some kind of relevance to the world?
i don't want to sound like a dick hole but i...
mayor, these boys want that harbucks coffee shut down right now.
boys i don't know who wrote that report, but now that you've convinced everybody, you better stick with it.
because if these people find out that you didn't really write that paper and i actually do get fired, then mr. hat is gonna do horrible things to you.
like an old sweater that keeps getting warmer with age, you can count on tweek's coffee to start your day.
tomorrow for the prop ten vote we'll set up ballot booths... here.
- i hope we're not wasting our time with this little pecker.
well, it looks like harbucks will never make it in this town.
you keep protesting and complaining, but did any of you even bother to taste harbucks coffee?
harbucks coffee got to where it is by being the best.
i bet they'd do anything to wake up from that nightmare.
you know, it's refreshing to hear someone even more cynical than i am.
is it possible to tell if these victims were subjected to the elements just once, or many times before they died?
it's hard to say, but if you look at the extremities here...
go back to school, get your bachelor's, master's, phd two times over.
14 years is enough time to watch a boy grow into a man.
the sea often takes you to where she wants you to go.
it was late at night, which will make what happened next even more impossible.
when we go to sleep he would tell me "we have to get out."
when i wake up, the door is still lock, but ming is gone.
nobody knows what - or if - it's an actual language.
but the funny thing is, even though i couldn't understand her,
if you want me to be, if that makes you comfortable, yes, you can call me that.
if who you are is not important, then what are you?
you have a wife and daughter who love and adore you.
you own a successful private investigative consulting firm with fortune 500 clients.
look, i don't know what's going on here, but i think i have a good idea.
somehow, whatever killed those men on that ship is affecting you.
well, i was just reading about employee validation in business week, and, dennis...
"your hard work and individuality has made a big difference here at microsoft."
i have an acute sense of knowing when people are threatening me.
i get it from my mother's side, along with a fear of owls.
dennis, sorry if i've given you the impression i don't like you.
i just want us all to do the best job we can.
kenny, i've been smoke-free for seven hours, so i need a man right now.
now, either it's gonna be you, or christmas comes early to jerry the mail boy.
now, remember, no calls during my nude mediation hour... 3:00 to 4:00.
heh heh... uh, kenny, you had me going there for a minute.
because that's what i do when someone's trying to kill me.
in eighth grade, i once spent an entire day hiding in my locker... ironically, reading the red badge of courage.
kenny, i've been smoke-free for seven hours, so i need a man right now.
now, either it's gonna be you, or christmas comes early to jerry the mail boy.
marching down the champs elysees, officers and men believed that berlin was within their reach.
and the word was that they would be home in time for christmas.
battalion wipes its ass clean with company, and we're left to lick the shit off of them!
mark my words, they're gonna keep sendin' us in until the whole fuckin' division is gone!
the longer it takes to obtain them, the more dead we'll be stockpilin' at the side of the road.
now it's my job to obtain those objectives, and i will utilize anybody at my disposal to do so.
whole platoon fingers its way into the factory and... one guy makes it out to talk about it.
you got twenty-five or thirty guys dead or dyin' and you walk out without a scratch on ya.
because in this fog, you might not see the guy nearest you.
the krauts are gonna hear us moving into position, and they know that you're replacements.
they know we're hurtin' bad, and they know that we have to try to bring in replacements today.
the only reason they're not makin' a push, is because they're hurtin' too.
they'll call out to you in english, they'll try to spook ya.
the main thing you need to do is keep your shit together.
you got a machine gun nest protecting you on your right flank, twenty-five yards away.
you got another rifleman protecting you on your left flank, a little closer, maybe fifteen, twenty yards, okay?
you don't think about it, you don't hesitate, you just do it, you understand?
otherwise, you're gonna go home to your mama in a box, all right?
to get there, we have got to secure the river crossing on the kall trail.
now we'll approach the river through this part of the forest.
captain pritchett, if you feel you're unable to carry out your orders, you let me know.
and i'll relieve you of your command and find somebody who can.
our company is to try to take the bridge on the kall trail again and hold it.
kraut 88's on the ridge are gonna have us right on the chopping block.
that puts you in charge over this, sergeant, now listen up, you gotta pull your platoon back to this side of the river!
you expect me to get these guys to leave cover in this shit?
his ability to react to aggressive situations is unmatched by anybody in the company.
his disrespect for authority is unable to hide his ability to lead.
you got a glob of greenies lookin' at you to keep 'em alive,
and if i find out that one of them answers the last muster
to get there, we have got to secure the river crossing on the kall trail.
now, we'll approach the river through this part of the forest.
and the word was that they would be home in time for christmas.
but when the soldiers left paris for the german border their hopes began to fade.
i'm fucked up, i can't do this, i, i, i'm no good.
listen to me, soldier, a week ago, i had a company of almost 200 men.
you know, it's amazing really, when you stop to think about it.
whole platoon fingers its way into the factory and... one guy makes it out to talk about it.
now g-2 said it'll be clear sailing up to the bridge but once you get there... it's gonna get pretty hot.
with all due respect, sir, did g-2 forget about the tanks the jerries have been clobbering us with?
and i'll relieve you of your command and find somebody who can.
now the jumpingoff point's the siegfried line here, here and here.
you find yourself out there in the middle of a fire fight... with your guts hanging' out, screamin' for a medic.
if i can help you in any way without endangering my own life,
there's a road leading' up the the ridge from the north side.
i figure a single squad with a couple of flame throwers might have a shot at takin' 'em out.
krauts are holding their manpower back about a mile behind the bridge.
apparently they're havin' truble finding replacements, so they're relying on their 88s to wipe us out.

said he'd been kidnapped by two men who had warned him about staying away from his assistant's girlfriend.
he didn't wanna report it officially, but he sounded shook up, so i had the unit response.
mr wade says the van was a late-model ford windstar, red.
he was forced into the van through a side door on the driver's side.
i checked with the parks and recreation, and i found there was no permit issued for the park that day.
we're looking for a van which does not exist, carrying kidnappers who never lived, who didn't abscond with a congressman, and then didn't drop him off here?
to qualify for admission to this hospital, a patient has to be, at least, clinging to life.

he set me up in baltimore to be closer to his constituents.
it was great helping him come up with ideas, legislation, breaking bread at the weekly caucus with the most powerful politicians in our government.
all i know is article 27, section 150 of the annotated code says wade owes the public
$500 and six months in jail for the filing a false report.
the way i see it is, if congressman wade is charged, the media will probably pull his private life out of the closet, and we will lose a very important ally in congress.
if wade goes, we'll have more dead cops on the street.
i want you to tell congressman wade there will be no investigation.
that we understand that this is just a trivial episode of poor judgment, and we will take care of it.
the club president, benny reston, has been working for some wise guys in miami, doing some odd hits, distributing coke, amphetamines here in baltimore.
i got the two acts of racketeering i need to indict, but i gotta get my contact out.
well, then, if a crime has been committed, we will investigate... fully.
however, if no crime was committed, well, then that puts an end to it.
detective pembleton, i was making french toast for my kids when i got a call from maria delgado.
she was about to go on air about congressman wade being kidnapped and then after a formal investigation, he recanted, which implied that instead of wade being charged with filing a false report, you covered it up.
i'm glad you're happy watching my pain, burning crop circles on my soul's waves of grain.
we had no love scene but you've cut to the chase, you're chopping off my nose to spite my face.
sure, but... will you promise not to tell kevin about terry or jerry or whoever?
in the unlikely event that, through some bizarre set of circumstances,
treat yourself to a nice root beer... in a frosty cold can.
frosty cold can... you know, i wouldn't mind a root beer!
no one's been in to see her yet, but dr. davidson doesn't think it's drugs.
no one's been in to see her, and you're going out for sodas?
i promised i wouldn't say anything about the hospital because i made a deal with daria and she kept her part and i kept my part but then i made another deal with jane and i didn't even know i was making it until it was made
and now i didn't keep my part because i told about the hospital so now jane's going to tell about the deal and i didn't mean anything by it
i'm sorry about all this blood work, daria, but so far, all signs are good.
other than my having turned into ms. tomato head, you mean.
well, brittany said you had some brain fever or something, but you weren't in the hospital.
so i kept asking jane, and she finally admitted you had a rash and you were in the hospital.
thanks for lending us the bus fare! what're you talking about? if we don't come with you, we can't do our job! i'll hate you! i'll haunt you all the way to your grandchildren! ...and i knew it was a mistake, but i couldn't take all that wailing! i appreciate it! fine, fine!
shower me with all the appreciation you want... ...only pay me back when we hit town.
you know, those little rooms they had... ...in the churches at home?
this is the portable version! don't you have something to confess?
- i'm hungry too! once we reach the city, i'll give you plenty to eat.
be patient for mommy, okay? but, momma... don't be that way.
- mr. priest! what are you doing? don't ask stupid questions.
i'm going to save the child! with your bare hands? oh, shit! you'd go anyways, wouldn't you? of course.
! who knows what's inside the belly of the monster whale? now i know why the short-haired girl is so pissed off at you all the time! things always manage to get worse when you're around! my brain's about to explode! it's your fault!
take responsibility! you fell in without any help! you're the outlaw! what's that gotta do with it?
! there's more of them! are you two down there? we're here to save you! if you're there, please respond! they're disgustingly... ...late.
you can get out of the worst situations... ...just like they say, vash the stampede.
you can get out of the worst situations just like they say, vash the stampede.
i'd much rather lead an uneventful life if it were up to me.
the beauty of voluntary acts can foster goodwill in the hearts of others.
love which doesn't ask for collateral gives us respect as people.
look, i know the matriarch's been a handful lately but she's due next week.
once the baby comes she'll be back to her old self again.
who i took to sunday school when she would visit me each summer?
and who once showed respect for the church and its teachings?
she's considered possible scenarios detailing a god-like source and she's found them unconvincing.
while she respects those who choose to believe in a higher being she herself does not.
she gave me that "i really want to, pacey, but i just can't" look.
the way i figure, once i get my learner's permit this woman's gonna cave completely.
let's just say that for a student and teacher they have an exceptionally close relationship.
so close, in fact, it's considered illegal in about 35 states.
my only consolation is the faint hope that this does not reach tamara.
so you know, if you would just allow me a moment to drop my chin into my chest and feel really sorry for myself it'd be much appreciated.
if you walk out that door doing the whole "woe is me" thing it's admitting it's all true.
but if you go through those halls like you couldn't care less like this is the most ridiculous thing then this whole thing could be dead and buried by sixth period.
gram's way of dealing with my point of view is to pretend that it doesn't exist, which, of course, infuriates me.
it causes me to speak emotionally rather than rationally and i become rude and defensive, and give her more of a reason to dismiss my viewpoints.
dawson's house may be the closest, but it's not the most convenient.
i mean, there's really only one way to get there from here.
i don't have a whole lot of faith in man these days.
look, i know you don't like me or approve of my family and you can think of 80 reasons why bessie and bodie are sinners but my sister is next door in dawson's house giving birth and of those 80 reasons, i can't think of any the baby's responsible for.
so i say to myself, "well, if it involves sex it couldn't possibly be my brother, pacey."
then the guy says, "word is, kid made it all up.
this is going to be a big day, and as your attending nurse you may feel an outpouring of gratitude towards me when we're done.
but i promise i will not take advantage of your postpartum bliss and i will resist any urge to bond over the shared experience if you will do me one small favor in return.
i must ask you to refrain from communicating directly with my client.
should you feel the need to speak with her at any future date contact me, and i'll pass along any pertinent information.
there have been allegations of a sexual relationship between yourself and mr. witter.
please forgive my candor, miss jacobs, when i ask you are these allegations true?
a c-plus student who sits in the back of miss jacobs' english class daydreaming about the same thing:
what it would be like to be a little bit better-iooking a little more sophisticated and about 1 5 years older, because then, and only then could miss jacobs possibly look at me as anything other than just another one of her students.
there are times the resemblance is merely a passing one, and then there are others when bessie says or does something and it's like my mom never died, you know?
when she got sick when she had chemo every month it left her in this terrible pain.
and i would come home, and i would sit with her.
she'd let out these cries that i'd never heard before and i prayed to every available higher source that i would never hear them again from anyone or anything.
but i'm 36 years old and i want to have children before it's too late.
i mean, i want to be their mother, not their girlfriend.
after what you experienced today can you honestly tell me you still hold no belief in god?
well, i don't know about god but i think i may have come around a little on man.
look, i know the matriarch's been a handful lately but she's due next week.
once the baby comes she'll be back to her old self again.

the only thing worse than a rumor is a substantiated rumor.
if you walk out that door doing the whole "woe is me" thing it's admitting it's all true.
look, despite first impressions, i'm not here to bust on you.
i don't know if the rumors are true or exaggerated or if this is one of your attempts to appear more attractive to the girls but i just wanted to say i know what you must be going through.
you pray like hell for a better story to come along.
gram's way of dealing with my point of view is to pretend that it doesn't exist, which, of course, infuriates me.
which means the nearest phone belongs to your friend dawson and i need you to get me there asap.
dawson's house may be the closest, but it's not the most convenient.
the lce house said he caught the bus for hyannis already.
they're gonna get here as soon as they can but they just can't make any guarantees.
maybe i'm not in the tax bracket that guarantees a prompt response but i have a shoe full of amniotic fluid my pelvis is beating like a rumba band and i'm in danger of having my child delivered by high school students!
so stop making excuses, get off your oversized backside and get us an ambulance before my fetus enters college!
to people who respect my privacy and the right i have to my own beliefs.
and i know that atheism is about the least desirable trait any granddaughter of yours could ever possess but it's nothing you should take personally.
look, i know you don't like me or approve of my family and you can think of 80 reasons why bessie and bodie are sinners but my sister is next door in dawson's house giving birth and of those 80 reasons, i can't think of any the baby's responsible for.
so if you remember that as a nurse, you took an oath to help others it'd be really nice.
i'm over at carlton's getting a haircut when the guy next to me starts talking about a rumor that's making the rounds at the high school about some punk kid sleeping with a teacher.
so i say to myself, "well, if it involves sex it couldn't possibly be my brother, pacey."
i thought it was up to me to let this town know that at least one person in our family was having heterosexual sex.
and you know, just as a matter of curiosity did it ever occur to you, just for a brief moment to defend and support me in this conversation?
well, it seems your lies have made it all the way up the food chain.
superintendent stevens is calling an emergency board meeting to discuss whether charges should be laid against miss jacobs.
this is going to be a big day, and as your attending nurse you may feel an outpouring of gratitude towards me when we're done.
but i promise i will not take advantage of your postpartum bliss and i will resist any urge to bond over the shared experience if you will do me one small favor in return.
what it would be like to be a little bit better-looking a little more sophisticated and about 1 5 years older, because then, and only then could miss jacobs possibly look at me as anything other than just another one of her students.
and only then could this rumor stand any chance of being true.
correct me if i'm wrong, but for the record are you saying you deny the aforementioned allegations?
yeah, for the record, sir, and for anywhere else you want to put it.
what jennifer doesn't know is a bloody show is a natural part of the birthing process.
the last thing we can have you doing is worrying yourself.

well, i don't know about god but i think i may have come around a little on man.
i'm talking about the obvious which i know we've tried to ignore.
but it's easy to see that i've intruded on a very personal ritual here and clearly my presence is making you uncomfortable.
you and i have decided to slow things down so i'm sure that a few hours apart won't kill us.
besides, grams has been on the warpath, meaning once joey leaves there's no way she's going to trust you and i alone.
and you can't stay if she leaves because you've driven her away.
and you can't stay if she's here because it ruins movie night for you.
and who once showed respect for the church and its teachings?
she's considered possible scenarios detailing a god-like source and she's found them unconvincing.
we first invent some school-related reason why i need to come over on a friday night and then we lock the doors and close the blinds so that none of the townsfolk could see us together.
you're having trouble acknowledging the fact that we have a relationship but you have to admit, there's something going on here.
well, she didn't say yes, but she didn't say no, either.
she gave me that "i really want to, pacey, but i just can't" look.
this is one of those milestone events that separates the first half of your life from everything that follows.

i know what you must be feeling towards pacey right about now what with all the trouble he's caused you but i'd hate for the whole family to be tarred with the same brush.
i'll tell you, that boy has been nothing but a bane since he was a child.
i think i'd have to disagree with you there, miss jacobs.
never in a million years would i have predicted rochester to be a plot point in our little saga.
i mean, i want to be their mother, not their girlfriend.
you know just because i'm older and arguably more mature doesn't mean that i know what to say in these situations.
i have captured the mighty zordon and am draining him of his powers.
as his strength drains, the lava will rise, extinguishing the power forever.
hit me with a fast ball so hard right on my left cheek.
i think i still have a mark there, but you don't want to see that.
well, why don't you make it up to me by seeing the van gogh exhibit together?
oh, i think i should go check out that painting over there, entitled, "go with him, he's cute."
it's like these swirling divine lights from god that say, "i will always protect you."
well, it says here that van gogh found religion around the time he painted this.
we can keep talking about starry night or the real stars if you want.
ricky, look, i've had a really great time talking to you.
if you don't want it to be a date, don't look up.
but if you do look up, i'll be looking back at you.
maybe one day you won't be telling people that you met the guy you love on the monkey bars, but you met him in front of a masterpiece and he told you how he felt about it, and he swept you off your feet.
i'm not leaving my feet for anybody until i give cory a chance.
i thought i had the only parents like that in the world.
see, my mom got this job in pittsburgh and we were all set to move and at the last minute,
okay, if i went out with another girl tonight, that wouldn't mean that i don't love you and we wouldn't be broken up tomorrow.
oh, yeah, well, you go out with another girl tonight and you'll be plenty broken tomorrow because i will break you.

(boy #4) sir, why does the old clock not have a second hand?
but at 32, duran is the first briton to reach this stage of the championship since 1 993.
(david) he apparently goes on the town with danny baker, chris evans and gazza.
i've said it twice already, i know, but it was top. i really enjoyed it.
well, you know, like i say, it was a good night, it was a good night, it was a very good night.
and if i get a fact pack, i can just read that, and i'm off.
the other thing i was gonna ask is, when are you on next?
starting on the left-hand side here, you can see a lady, and she has very thin hair.
it is so thin, you can see the head through it, like a skull.
also she has had to draw on her eyebrows with a black pencil, because she has no real hairs on her face.
i think if you shone a bright light behind her, you would see through her head.
and then, a little further back, also on the left is a lady.
her head is so red and puffed up, she looks like she will explode.
at the back, these two, surely in terms of unfortunate deformity, they are twins.
this one, on the left, he's got a big fat head with a little tiny face, and on the other side the guy has a big face, but just one ear.
if alexander comes in here and peter's wearing the bra and pants and he's dancing and so on,
alexander's going to be hugely distracted and confused and may not even talk about zurich at all.
the only stumbling block for me, with respect, is that peter's not a professional dancer.
that's the whole point about the dance - that it's spontaneous!
as for this, my baser imaginations lead me to surmise that it could be an illustration of a lady's lower venusian furrowed plough.
- find a picture of a little girl on a swing.
(man) so, as i say, i'll try not to keep you too long.
but what we want is as clear as possible a description of this man who attacked you.
today, we'll discuss the mysterious land paintings that suddenly appeared in what was south america.
as usual, we have commentaries by a researcher of supernatural phenomena...
however, the land paintings were drawn by lasers coming from satellites...
the police think it was a prank pulled by a hacker who got into the satellite.
the bounty of 8 million is a conspiracy of the government.
even if it was drawn by a laser, there is the possibility that aliens put a message into the brain of that hacker.
and back then on earth, there were many pictures like this, and i always looked at them...
i remembered those times and i tried to recreate at least the pictures...
break the antennae that it uses to communicate with the other satellites.
then make a direct connection to the satellite, and download mpu.
last week, you let ajiz, a bounty on mars worth 1.5 million, get away...
and in pyortle before that, the police got to them first...
according to government sources from back then, it supposedly would continue activity on its own even without commands from earth.
well, it was the perfect excuse for the cops to go on a hacker hunt.
are you going to shoot me again? are you really going to shoot me again... ...vash?
! eriks? how long are you going to to stay in bed?
get up! eriks! let me on! at least take me to the next town! i have money!
let me on! he might try to take the town while we stand here arguing! but you need a ticket to ride... don't you get it yet?
the man who incinerated two of the seven cities... ...designated as mankind's first localized act of god.
some even say he put that hole in the moon... ...but you'd have to be crazy to believe that.
let go of me, eriks! what's the big hurry, lina? i'm sorry, bartender...
will you hide me? what did you do? she doesn't know when to quit! he was just poking a little fun... that pedophile had it coming to him! i mean, just because he fondled her butt... keep your mouth shut! does that mean...?
my fragmentary visions, but more than anything... ...something inside tells me i'm the one.
i'm the one who put that hole in the 5th moon.
and you're so afraid of what you can do... ...you're living in easy retirement? i only wanted to live quietly... ...with a different name, and a different way of life.
why are you here? are you here to laugh at me? i came to take you away.
if you want it bad enough to give up everything else... ...then go for it.
say... ...are you familiar with a town called carcases? it's a tiny town in southern cornelia.
everything in the town looked completely normal... ...only, the people had vanished.
the cavalry went in and combed the place over... ...but didn't find a soul.
you're sounding like your old self! eriks! slaughter 'em! let's do it.
i must have been out of my mind... ...to talk to someone so filthy-looking.
i think i will go... ... although i hate to do this to you and lina.
isn't there anything we can do? tell me all about it.
not only that they say vash the stampede is running the show.
the sheriff went to negotiate, but came back doubled his weight in lead.
the man who incinerated two of the seven cities designated as mankind's first localized act of god.
some even say he put that hole in the moon but you'd have to be crazy to believe that.
if you had to choose between your life and your pride, which would you choose?
i'd never be able to strip and bark like a dog.
my fragmentary visions, but more than anything something inside tells me i'm the one.
i'm the one who put that hole in the 5th moon.
and you're so afraid of what you can do you're living in easy retirement?
i only wanted to live quietly with a different name, and a different way of life.
the cavalry went in and combed the place over but didn't find a soul.
one cavalryman, however, did discover something odd a man's name painted on the monument in the town square.
hey, did the two of them take care of all these thugs by themselves?
i've never seen anyone kick so much ass in my life.
and to think, all this time we thought pig-man here was vash!
hey, do you think he plans to stay on in this town?
lina and i realized somewhere in our hearts we knew that eriks would probably leave us someday.
but that doesn't change the fact that we're losing a member of the family.
i didn't get any cleaning done because of this nightmare i had at the supermarket.
i'm there with the kids and they're just taking stuff off the shelves.
do you know how embarrassing that is to hear over the p.a.,
"mrs. barone, would you please remove your children from ethnic foods?"
i did not get to the bank, ray, no, because the kids were a little too picante, you know.
you know, it's just impossible to get things done when i'm with them.
well, you know, to tell you the truth, she's... she's really good with young kids, 'cause she's an early education major, and i-i just thought she'd give us a little more flexibility.
you know, of course, marie, we would call you first, but we just... we didn't want keep taking advantage of the fact that you live across the street, because...
your mom told me that you were here babysitting for the parkers and i thought i'd bring you by a pizza.
you know i know they're into that healthy stuff here and that's got to blow.
i didn't get any cleaning done because of this nightmare i had at the supermarket.

you know, it's just impossible to get things done when i'm with them.
i just couldn't stand how much the kids wanted to be with lisa.
so i got your mom to babysit, so it£­£­ wouldn't go as well.
and then they pulled down the salsa display, you know, and they're swimming in it.
do you know how embarrassing that is to hear over the p.a.,
she used to work for the mccormicks, but they put katie in daycare.
i knew i had to move really fast because the parkers were eyeing her.
well, you know, to tell you the truth, she's-- she's really good with young kids, 'cause she's an early education major, and l-l just thought she'd give us a little more flexibility.
you know, of course, marie, we would call you first, but we just-- we didn't want keep taking advantage of the fact that you live across the street, because-
we will not spend my life asking for the car loan for my brother.
one day he will say: "it's over, boys drop, discharge and fall off!
and i felt a new happiness by not be responsible for anything more.
there were more words in my head, only eyes, a mouth and the dream of a sleeping dog.
i was not sad for real, but who was always confused as around and suddenly was gone.
and i felt guilty because fogies tobe had left because of me.
and of course i asked myself many, many times, and still wonder.
if he had loved even more, and another way, he would not have died.

i am pleased to inform you that your captain has been assigned to a top surgeon, the very eminent -
you and me, zev, are meant to be partners in greatness.
your home will not be a hut on some swampy outback planet -
we suspect the key can be released as an act of will.
we know it can be released at the point of death.
you've got all the help you need with our dr kazan.
they are releasing me tomorrow, but i do not want to leave without thanking you again.
i used to believe that the doctor thing was selfless and noble.
i would say "what would we be, if we didn't try?".
let me add my voice to the criticism of your rude welcome.
i promise you that the quality of surgery here on medsat is better than the administration.
we know it can be released at the point of death.
and as doctors, we know that the will can be broken at the point of death.
it seems clear that you will be able to rematerialise unless we break you down into subatomic particles.
our satellite drive is powered by a plasma beam from the ion furnace.
i would say "what would we be, if we didn't try?".
and actually mean it - then it just became a line.
certain low priority areas were designated... including a sector in turkey which had been dormant for months.
eight hours later, a nato base in that sector was bombed.
could you at least get me a knife or a pin so i can get out of the handcuffs?
if you don't help me, something very bad might happen to me.
this is one of the purposes for which i was built.
we are prepared to link you up to the dod mainframe.

i went into the rooms which are kept secret and i leaned and lay on their beds.
i went into the rooms which are kept secret which they consider it shameful even to name.
the selfishness my work demands leaves no room for an emotional self.
can tenderness ultimately only manifest itself in the motion of a brush?
to violate, desecrate, to examine a person from the inside, eroticising the white shirt cuff glimpsed beneath a dark suit.
the girth, the solids, the sack of flesh, just offal bags.

he said the thing he really loved about your paintings was he could smell the balls.
do you think it's possible for a poof to be a great artist?
let's not be so tiresome as to run down the list.
mr francis bacon, i have a warrant to search your abode.
we have reason to believe you're in possession of controlled or illegal substances.
i think i can already tell you who most probably placed that substance here.
it's more than likely the same person who suggested that you pay me a visit.
i'd just like to make one picture that would annihilate all the rest.
a violent fusion - all the past, all the present, concentrated into a single, raw, sliced-open nerve.
i once saw a bad car accident on a large road, and the bodies were strewn about with broken glass from the car and the blood and the various possessions, and it was, in fact, very beautiful.
i think the beauty in it is terribly elusive, but it just happened to be the disposition of the bodies, the way they lay in the blood.
when i saw him in the french pub he could hardly stand up.
and between deakin and two rent boys he was being divested of quite a sum of money.
i'd miss the stubble dried round the bathroom sink when i go to shave.
i'd miss the sound of his key as it turns in the lock.

i agree, you don't treat women like that but now we can't go back to wickes town.
i really think that emily and i could have had something.
this girl's beating is typical of the kind of behavior prostitution incites.

perhaps i could interest you in a hayride later this evening.
she's in possession of my premier collection... of victorian erotica in the western hemisphere.
i intend for it to be my legacy to the world.
well, then legally, natalie is entitled to a significant portion of the collection.
shirley, my family's money and affairs... has been connected to this firm since you opened your doors.
if you spent a little less time with the collection, we might not be here dividing it up now.
before you met me, you'd never even heard of the lusty turk.
if not for me, row circus would be hanging over someone else's fireplace!
natalie, clifford, if neither of you can budge on this... then we will end up in court and adjudge will decide your collection's future.
they sniff around hospital corridors... hunting for senior citizens with no family ties.
when they corner one, the conservator goes before adjudge with an emergency motion.
the judge, overburdened with caseloads... quickly grants them a power of attorney... and suddenly they sink their teeth into that senior's life.
they seize their assets, strip away all their decision-making powers... then run up charges, feeding off the estates... until the bones have been picked clean.
invented by the power elite to keep the hoi polloi from enjoying themselves.
as for the wife, either she won't find out and you'll be fine... or she will and she'll learn.
t just want to warn you, don't be fooled by his silly, cherubic face.
he fools judges, hospital administrators, anyone he needs to... so he can get his hands on folk like adele and her pocketbook.
i'm sure you had no idea i'd be capable of killing a man with a flying pan.
catherine, when i met you, i was sure you could accomplish anything you set your mind to... and you've yet to disappoint.
as your attorney and as someone who's been there... divorce can play some very nasty tricks on your psyche.
so you're asking, is it conceivable i can't let natalie go?
it's an actual window into our history... a look at how we perceive ourselves and our society... through a lens of our most primacy urges.
i even had this artist's rendering done for a museum i'd like to start.
i'm beginning to get the idea, and i think adjudge might as well.
however, i still feel if you don't give a little... you'll stand to lose a lot.
and while she may have had trouble when she first arrived at the hospital... she's since recovered and is ready to move on with her life.
and as her attorneys, we'd like to help you move on with certain things as well.
we've gotten rid of the court nonsense- notary publics, standing in line at the post office.
you have only to sign this release... and we will relieve you of one of the burdens of your already overburdened workload.
so we understand what we're talking about, perhaps i could read a passage.
- ivan, that wouldn't- - "i poured into her ears a tale of burning love.
to pay her $90 electric bill, he charged the estate $1 so.
he charged $170 to bring her less than $50 worth of groceries.
i have an am davit from the admitting nurse at the hospital where adele was first taken.
she says adele was confused, disoriented... and apparently hadn't eaten in several days.
a state any of us might be in after the death of our last surviving family member.
i have an am davit from the cottonwood assisted living home which states...
your honor, if that's a concern, i can arrange for her to live with a friend.
a friend, especially a motor_ friend... is not the same as a family member or a legal conservator.
in the meantime, professor cabot... could you tell us how the hysteria machine works?
women frequently complained of symptoms such as nervousness... uh, heaviness in the abdomen, vaginal lubrication, insomnia and so on.
doctors referred to these symptoms as hysteria... but of course, they're actually signs of sexual arousal.
before the invention of this machine, a doctor would, uh, massage a woman... until she reached a climactic paroxysm, as they called it.
i'll eventually stop battling you once all the money's run out.
professor cabot, don't you intend eventually... to donate this collection, including the hysteria machine... to a museum, a place where everyone could... get some pleasure from it?
apparently, this isn't the first time mr. wharton has done this.
according to a title search... he has sold 11 houses belonging to his wards.
if you give a false statement to the police or, worse these days, the insurance company... you will be charged with fraud and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
and often pushes for jail time where you'll be able to do lots of women's studies.
god forbid, the guy who stole this feels remorse... and returns it to my client... she could end up going to jail.
it's a tribute to the risks one is willing to take for some momentary pleasure.
my mind and my priorities are exactly where they should be right now.
when rachel gets out, i will be back here full-time, or maybe i won't.

three and a half million berliners lived in a city 110 miles behind the russian lines.
berlin was linked to the west by a highway and a railway which ran through the soviet zone.
berlin and germany were the only places where the two sides came into contact, that is soviet troops and troops from the allied countries.
in other places we didn't have direct contact between our two armed forces.
he didn't like the germans, but believed that european recovery depended on them.
we have to try and recreate germany on a democratic basis, give her a chance to live, at the same time make sure that the security of the rest of europe is preserved and that aggression cannot take place again.
he gathered all of us together and read out an intelligence report.
the report stated that a secret conference about germany was held in london.
instead, he had 20 cups of coffee and two packs of cigarettes a day.
what impressed me particularly was his fantastic ability to absorb difficult questions that were quite outside of the framework of his experience.
he spoke in a very tactful and polite fashion, in a very restrained way.
he said, "could you please fill us in, tell us what happened at the meeting in london."
for the demonstrators, the real target was the city council, the magistrat, which wanted to run all berlin on western lines.
the majority of the berlin city council, supported by the social democrats and the christian democrats, believed that with currency reform there would be an immediate upturn in the economy.
generally to all those whom the socialist unity party blamed for supporting hitler in 1933.
the stage was set for confrontation between the socialist unity party and their pro-western opponents.
these were led by ernst reuter, whose family had once been forced to flee from hitler.
his election as mayor of all berlin had been vetoed by the russians.
it was a very tense atmosphere again full of possibilities that the russians would try to enforce their power in that part of the country, in the city of berlin, of course, that maybe the family again would have to flee from dictatorship.
west germans lined up for their new money -- the deutsch mark.
and therefore it was so important that the western currency, the d-mark, had to be introduced into west berlin and not the eastern german currency.
general clay and the western allies were persuaded by ernst reuter to issue the new deutsch mark in west berlin.
east marks and west marks, if you can call them that, were usually one to seven or one to five.
that is, we got seven or five east german marks for one west mark.
and, as we found out later, it was a sell-out, at least around berlin.
the introduction of the new western currency in berlin infuriated the soviets, who debated what to do next.
molotov replied, "you're not planning to bring tanks out into the streets, are you?"
sokolovsky said, "no, not in the streets, but i'll move them closer to berlin."
the soviets blocked all major road, rail and canal links between west berlin and western germany.
they made no concerted effort to seal every route, but delivery of the 12,000 tons of food and coal normally supplied by the west to berlin every day was now impossible.
in 1945, the western allies had made a written agreement with the soviets.
planes could fly along three air corridors 20 miles wide to two berlin airfields,
general clay, the american commander, didn't believe an airlift would work.
he had wanted to test soviet resolve by running an armed convoy through the blockade.
reluctantly, he agreed to pursue the airlift idea with ernst reuter.
clay had said that this would mean extreme hardship and how little we could bring in at first.
they dropped so many bombs on berlin, they should be able to drop potatoes!"
thousands of berliners found jobs -- and one hot meal a day -- working for the airlift.
we were divided into work gangs supervised by an american overseer.
each gang was ordered one by one to the planes as they came in.
but, remember, we all thought that the berlin airlift was only gonna last two or three weeks or there would have been a war.
america now raised the stakes by sending b-29 bombers, capable of carrying atom bombs to britain.
so grave is the crisis that general clay is recalled to washington to report on the situation.
he is greeted by secretary of the army, royall and then is welcomed by chief of staff, omar bradley.
on his shoulders may rest the responsibility for peace or war and the commander-in-chief at the white house awaits his appraisal of the most explosive situation yet in the struggle between east and west.
clay argued once again that he be allowed to confront the soviets with an armed convoy.
now if the soviets stepped aside and the convoy went through, then peace would continue.
if they chose not to let the convoy through, then it meant war.
i have been assured of an additional supply of c-54$, which carry 10 tons, to replace the c-47s.
and this will enable us to build our airlift up to 4,500 tons a day.
what is more important are the decisions you have taken in london.
we insist that you should revoke these decisions or at least postpone their implementation until we get together again to discuss the question of germany.
in berlin, the western allies and the soviets returned to the negotiating table.
the russians demanded the withdrawal of the western deutsch mark from the city.
they used to carry out aerial maneuvers in the corridor or right alongside it.
they'd be above you because we had a maximum altitude and they'd go off firing military equipment.
if you wanted to go out, you had to go into the eastern sector.
there were dance halls, there was music, there was electric lighting.
they came into the station and either demanded our identity papers, or searched our bags and rucksacks.
you had the feeling that if a russian didn't like the look of a german he would take him away.
councillors driven out of the city hall met in the safety of west berlin.
with them was ernst reuter, who now appealed to all berliners to gather at the reichstag to protest.
rias - radio in the american sector - spread the news.
because of the lack of electrical power, we had loud speaker wagons going through the streets giving the news several times a day.
there was nothing else in our heads but the thought -- "we stand united, we are against the russians, and we support the western allies."
nearly 300,000 berliners, many from the east, assembled at the reichstag.
the view of the berlin politicians, there was a possibility that western allies might be ready to come to a compromise with the russians which would be a detrimental compromise for germany.
they rallied that meeting to demonstrate that the population of berlin was decided to stand for their freedom and for democracy.
rhein-main field was busier than ever this week as airlift traffic was suddenly bolstered by fresh squadrons.
here, a group of valiant young pilots talk over the day's operations.
the coal dust would seep in under the floors and control cables and make it difficult to control the airplane so we flew with our escape hatches out at the back to suck out the dust.
big easy six-four, i have you in contact over the tempelhof range.
and so we were looking -- historical materialism better than we?
"yeah, they understand that you have to have a basis of food and help before you can begin party education.
just don't give up on us when the weather gets bad.
we'll have enough but if we lose our freedom, we may never get it back."
halvorsen promised the children that we would return with chewing gum and chocolate dropped from tiny parachutes.
it was amazing all the things they brought over in their planes.
and then he reached under the counter, pulled out a newspaper and there on the front page was an airplane with parachutes coming out of it.
he said, "you almost hit a german newspaperman on the head with a candy bar in berlin yesterday.
radio in the american sector- rias -- was run by william heimlich.
i introduced american broadcasting techniques on the theory that if the audience isn't there, you can't convince them of anything.
you give them good entertaining programs, solid news that they could depend on.
a young berlin dancer called christina ohlsen became a popular rias performer -- and later mrs. heimlich.
which means, "i am too little to understand all these happenings but the public could certainly get it."
and it became a very famous slogan in berlin and so i became the voice of berlin.
as midnight nears, tension mounts at the british frontier control post.
familiar with the old russian habit of changing their minds when it suits them, seasoned campaigners could not quite grasp this new mood of co-operation.
as on the stoke of 12:00 the barrier goes up and a british jeep leads the race into berlin.
many people thought the ending of the berlin blockade meant an end to the cold war.
i returned home after midnight, having taken the s-bahn from ostkreuz to neukolln.
when we crossed the boundary between the two sectors everything was bathed in light.
so then he asked me to go with him to the final farewell ceremony at city hall.
and adenauer and all the top german officials had been flown in.
the cold war period in berlin was really the core, the root of post-war democracy in germany.
there was a growing feeling that the germans after all can be satisfied to accept democracy as their own ways of living and to become part of the western world.
the berlin crisis, on reflection, resulted in a division of europe.
the government in west germany was created and two weeks later on our side, the german democratic republic was born.
british foreign secretary bevin's dream of a strategic alliance between western europe and north america came true with the signing of the north atlantic treaty.
the overall success of the berlin airlift was first of all, it persuaded a lot of very frightened people throughout europe that they had to come into the atlantic alliance, which provided the security or the general feeling that we are safe,

life is a very long movie and everyone is stuck in the second act.
this is what i want to know, why can't we cut to the climax?
maybe if you told me the kind of thing you're looking for..
i'm looking to be inspired, to be moved, to be enlightened.
hate to rain on your cloud, but i don't think it's all that bad out there.
depends on your stake in making things better, mine is pretty high.
boy meets girl, boy invites girl back to his house to watch him drink himself to death
boy meets ex-wife, they dump pingpongballs into a funnel cloud almost get crushed by a flying cow..
well, you gotta choose something that's actually supposed to be a romance.
my point is this: movies, life, there's too many blocks on the road to love.
-i'm trevor, i live down the hall, sure i can't help you?
i hate to see you kill these little fellows before you get a chance to splatter them all over your frying pan.
you're talking about the woman that lives just a few doors down, right?
the one who acts like she's on the witness protection programme?
when i met dan, met susan and bam that feeling came back.
that undeniable feeling that two complete strangers are absolutely destined to be one.
i hooked you up, you have to admit, i know something about what makes you guys tick.
i suppose you might accidentally stumble into the vicinity of an insight.
you two were supposed to get me one match closer to magic 100.
don't count on it, i'm beginnin to think commonality's a bit overrated.
two people don't get together just because you wave your wand.
it takes time, and hard work, and luck, and even then..
thanks, though i'm not sure what thay says about the rest of my life.
hang in there, there could be a lot of surprises tonight.
but what do i do with the apology i've been preparing?
well, if it includes a glowing tribute to my irrepressible personality you can assume i've already made it to myself.
listen, trevor, thanks for asking me to come like i said, i don't go out much but i thought it might be nice to be around people for a change.
and besides, i needed some place to show off this really cool tshirt.
you might wanna soak that head, seems to be swelling again.
for instance, i know you're trying to hide what you're writing there.
you saw his name because i am writing him a letter.
a letter to tell him that i'm breaking up with him.
you get shut down in the first period you usually knock 'em out in the second?
i drove her home, by that i mean a minute and a half conversation with me drove her right out of the bar and back to her home.
the failure to agree, the argumentative banter, could only mean one thing; we're becoming romantically involved
alright, look, i talked to her, she wanted me to apologize she said she had a bad night, you're definitely someone she could get to know better.

i was wrong not to tell you, i was wrong about you and alex
i was wrong to ever believe that i could ever know who belongs..
granddaughter of the director of the stantal federal bureau and a guest at my home.
the truth is, someone attempted to break in here 5 days ago.
but i can't let the water be stolen by thoughtless people.
they may call me a coward, but i intend to protect the water.
thoughts of home are proof of a journey of the heart.
i actually wanted to travel by myself here and there but i couldn't persuade my father.
thanks to your monopolization of the water the land in this area is all dead!
do you know how many people have suffered because of you?
i was thinking of home even though none of the thoughts were pleasant.
thoughts of home are proof of a journey of the heart.
the townspeople have all fled so there will be no witnesses.
i was right to spread the rumor of vash the stampede.
he has to be stopped! ma'am, i don't see a soul.
no one told me this town had become a ghost town.
excuse me, is this the schezar residence? i'm meryl stryfe, disaster investigator for the bernardelli insurance society.
i'm milly thompson! i'm very thirsty! don't say that! we heard that vash the stampede was staying here.
merciless slayer of all that is good! doer of the evil, evil deeds a man with $$60 billion on his head does! that's me! he's such a nice, dependable guy.
now the people in this mansion will feel safe! this may sound rude, but you need your eyes checked! hear me out.
granddaughter of the director of the stantal federal bureau... ...and a guest at my home.
the truth is, someone attempted to break in here 5 days ago.
does that man look like the legendary gunman, vash the stampede?
! that droopy-eyed, weak-looking, bristle-headed... ...promiscuous-looking donut freak of a man?
it's a huge inconvenience, but your plan is very clear to me now.
originally, i didn't want it to go this far... ...but the man after me is a blond packing a silver weapon... ...and he's quite the ace! did you hear, milly? yes, every word! this is an unbelievable windfall! they really are delightful.
if you don't mind, please let us be your bodyguards too! naturally, we won't demand a fee like that greedy faker over there! that's fine by me.
thank you, sir! is this what bodyguards do? every great journey must begin with a single enormous step.
is water that profitable? we've had a drought for the past several years.
i'm able to enjoy a few luxuries because my father... ...who was a plant engineer, purchased land with a water supply.
may i come in? just a minute! come in! excuse me.
is something wrong? er, no! were you gazing at the stars? y-yes.
i was thinking of home... ...even though none of the thoughts were pleasant.
thoughts of home are proof of a journey of the heart.
i actually wanted to travel by myself here and there... ...but i couldn't persuade my father.
so, i go from house to house, staying with his friends.
an attempted break-in 5 days ago... a discarded dress and bloody bandages... miss marianne entering mr. cliff's study... that's more than enough circumstantial evidence.
you're wrong! marianne isn't that kind of girl! how can you be so sure? ahem.
...you know... hey! yes, ma'am! what were you doing peeking into a lady's room?
! wait, time out! whatever you've done, you won't get away with it! time out, i said!
so they've started recruiting kids? thanks to your monopolization of the water... ...the land in this area is all dead! do you know how many people have suffered because of you?
! and so you came to get proof? cheap sense of justice.
wasting more of my time! run, quickly! thank goodness! you're the girl i thought you were! very brave. yeek! damn.
what, is he predicting my shots through gun movements and timing? no, you're a bad shot.
was that bullet-dodging also luck, or did you plan it that way? it was more like a fluke.
if you knew what you were doing, i'd be convinced... ...that you are vash the stampede.
i bet you right now meldrick's lying on some beach in belize, happy as a scallop.
the last time a detective from this unit was missing, we fished his body out of the harbour.
he was stabbed to death in the rectory of his own church, somewhere between the hours of 9:00 and 11:00 last night.
father juneaux was pastor of st raphael's and chairman of the peace and justice committee of the priests' council, and as of last june, central city vicar of the diocese of baltimore.
'i am contacting your organisation 'following the sudden and unfortunate murder of father michael juneaux.
'one year ago, father juneaux came to me in search of counselling.
just because he's booted out doesn't mean we don't have a bar to run.
if he thinks i'll cover his shifts, he's got another thing coming.
in fact, he was expelled after one year for what the seminary reported as mental difficulties.
we spoke to each of the boys named on the tape.
'cardinal gerald mcgilvery prayed for a speedy resolution 'of the investigation into father juneaux's murder, 'and called for the release of two guatemalan refugees in police custody.
'the refugees, who shall remain nameless, 'are being retained as material witnesses 'to yesterday's fatal stabbing.
in this work, be it a mutilated priest or an overdosed drug addict, faith only gets in your way.
if you don't have the almighty to reckon with, you're fortunate, detective.
kids: * ooh, hey, wow, the mouse is in the white house *

some kind of deeper unease which just took root and festered.
then she turned up with this vietnamese character, pan duc lao.
she was older now and wiser - this was the story.
during her travels, she'd been converted to the wonders of eastern mysticism, which had been largely ignored by the west.
the night before last, i watched it happen in front of me.
he put his fingers inside my father's chest, pulled out some kind of tissue... and after, it was like he hadn't touched him - not a mark on the skin.
she said how pleased she was to have helped my father, but now they had important work to do, so...
i'd hoped that would be an end to the horror... but it was the beginning.
when i got back, at about 2.30... the weather seemed to be easing up finally.
although, by that time, we'd had a good four or five inches of snow.
a mystic who removes organs without leaving a mark on the body.
sleight of hand with a blood pellet and some pig's liver?
marella carney had already departed this world by noon - four hours before she shot herself.
if you can come up with a better trick than that, i'd like to see it.
so the kids came to play in their den and found him inside, gnawing on a bone.
he took one look at them and bolted down the lane.
her moral probity and purity of spirit have won my heart.
which prompts me to ask about how your reunion with miss carney went.
well... obviously she was in a bit of a state with everything that had happened.
and highly vulnerable, so i hope you were there for her when she needed it.
enough to suggest that someone's done something amazingly clever but, at the same time, unutterably stupid.
mr bellinitus, the man you saw in the garden, when he ran away, which leg did he limp on?
whether this whole thing isn't just a pack of lies dreamed up by mr bellinitus.
can you take the word of a man named after an inflammation of the foreskin?
as a sounding board - in case you want to discuss stuff.
i suppose you'd have got into bed and been eaten alive!
if you stop and think about the footprints - there was only one set going up to the body.
but what's to stop someone carefully walking back the same way?
i stuck it in a matchbox and i thought i'd put it in my pocket.
when the guy broke in, he must have taken that and then found there were no matches in it.
in death, at least, i think i have a right to reclaim my own mother.
if you'd like to come and wait, i think he's upstairs.
there's a lot for people to come to terms with here.
a woman who for 15 years took on her sister's role as wife and mother.
evidently, to one person in this room, it mattered enough to murder.
but how do you kill someone so it looks as if they'd done it themself?
he was just some bloke living rough, with a nervous disposition and a dodgy leg.
a man who had nothing to do with anything, but without whom we'd never have solved this case.
no one can put a gun in their mouth when they're already dead.
and no one can run through four inches of snow without leaving any marks.
that trick with the car, performed for the benefit of a journalist and his readers, had an echo of something.
the way he described it, she sat him in the conservatory, roller outside the window, flipped some blinds about, it's turned into a porsche.
there's two or three ways to do that, but for speed only one that made any sense.
once you've got the key to it - that you're not looking through a pane of glass but at a mirror, reflecting a different part of the garden entirely - all things are possible.
the observer has to be carefully placed for the eye line, hence the hastily moved chair and table and the lamp that didn't reach the socket.
that could have been sorted, but the killer had only dreamed it up the night before.
at four, when jerry wakes up, what he'll see is a distant hooded figure - yourself... clearly taking her own life with a rifle.

as a schoolteacher in jamestown, he led protests against the white majority.
his legs wer e broken, and the doctor said he'd never walk without a cane.
he's 4 1 years old, and guess what he's doing tonight.
but can't we find a good-looking 22-year-old american who might actually win?
well, if you find him, send him over to my place, but in the meantime --
look, i have a ratings book on my desk that's very instructive.
now, it says that our key demographics, including 11 - to 17-year-olds who watch your morning r erun over br eakf ast, do not want to see f eatur es about 41-year-old, politically oppressed third world distance runners.

yeah, but the point i'm making is that i can't --
- yeah, i could tell by the way you didn't laugh at all when i said it.
that's 'cause i'm mad at you and also, it wasn't that f unny.
yes, you do, and whether you'r e right or whether you'r e wrong,

better to be tortured and getting laid than comfortable and not.
i can't seem to hook up with anyone down here in l.a., but it seems every guitarist in los angeles but it seems every guitarist in los angeles seems to want to play bass.
well, people are more apt to compromise their dreams in this city, and they do.
so one day i'm over at his house, and he drags me down to the basement and he drags me down to the basement to show me his dad's collection of dirty magazines.
sex at this age is nothing more than a dirty word, so i didn't have any problem telling kent,
like my whole sexual destiny had been encoded in my subconscious.
i certainly didn't know what it meant to like naked men, and i don't think kent knew, either, but we soon found out.
he wouldn't talk to me or sit next to me on the bus.
one friday, he came on the bus with all of his friends, and they were all going to his ninth birthday party.
i ran home so fucking fast so nobody would see me cry.
and when i got home, my mom was there, and she asked what was wrong, and i told her.
and she immediately picked up the phone and she immediately picked up the phone and just fucking railed into kent's mom for not inviting me to the party.
and when she hung up the phone, she was in tears, too.
i'd need to meet him before i dare subject him to my gay-dar.
he says he's got this girl in san francisco, but every time he brings her up, he doesn't want to talk about her.
i mean, billy, this is a classic case of karmic repetition compulsion.
any way you look at it with this kid, you're screwed.
he's taking a bunch of models over to catalina to do an underwear ad for guess?
or something like that, and, uh, he might want me to come.
or at least it doesn't go both ways all the time.
you can have a great time with someone, you can start a great relationship, but...
gays are special spiritual beings sent here by some mighty deity to essentially change society.
i mean, you've got to admit our fashion is ages ahead of what everyone else is wearing.
i just--i don't think this straight kid is gonna make you happy.
you know, i've gotta make my move now, 'cause if i don't do it now,
i swore to myself that if i could ever be there for somebody, i would, so that that person wouldn't have to go through all the shit i went through.
what i'm trying to say is, what i'm trying to say is, if you're having problems figuring out where you stand, even if you're not sure of what you're supposed to want...
the men in my life keep disappearing to voices in the night.
i would gladly give up the thrill of a one-night stand with catalina's sole homosexual if you want to be with someone right now.
well, just open the door and let me see if it's working out.
well, just open the door and let me see if it's working out.
you think it'd be all right if i stayed here tonight?
you think it'd be all right if i stayed here tonight?
contrary to popular belief, all homosexuals don't get laid all the time.
some of us, in fact, long for true love, kids, a house in the country with a white picket fence...
most of the world's population simply does not have good taste.
you can't expect a person like that to appreciate something this--
you're just gonna go on in this shitty relationship just to torture yourself.
better to be tortured and getting laid than comfortable and not.
i can't seem to hook up with anyone down here in l.a.
it seems every guitarist in los angeles seems to want to play bass.
she'll be deborah kerr, and you'll be the perfect burt lancaster.
we'll put you in one of those tight little-- hold on.
he lived just down the street from me, and about the only thing we had in common was that we both liked books a lot.
so one day i'm over at his house, and he drags me down to the basement to show me his dad's collection of dirty magazines.
and at some point in my life this was gonna be an issue.
like my whole sexual destiny had been encoded in my subconscious.
he wouldn't talk to me or sit next to me on the bus.
one friday, he came on the bus with all of his friends, and they were all going to his ninth birthday party.

he travels a lot selling insurance, but my mom... she's a great woman.
of course, she's turning out more and more like my grandmother these days.
one-- he's mostly or at least somewhat gay, and he does actually want to screw around with you;
2-- he's gay and not attracted to you, and you're merely projecting;
and 3-- he's straight, enjoys the attention, and you're merely projecting.
and may i remind you, you have a history of merely projecting.
his name was chris jungblut, very deutsche, and he moved to indiana from the west coast, and we hooked up 'cause we liked the same kind of music.
you know, the cure, the clash, xtc-- kind of like my cd collection.
so i'm sitting there, and i slide over next to him, and he was, like, drifting off to sleep.
and i, you know, kind of put my arm... touching his, and...
i mean, billy, this is a classic case of karmic repetition compulsion.
any way you look at it with this kid, you're screwed.
i don't suppose this has anything to do with that bitch from the set today.
her name's connie, and i think she's dating a married couple from silver lake.
gays are special spiritual beings sent here by some mighty deity to essentially change society.
i mean, you've got to admit our fashion is ages ahead of what everyone else is wearing.
because i turned out this way, there must be something else wrong with me.
but... you've been one of the few people who haven't done that to me.
billy, what you need to do now is leave him alone for a while.
he wants you, he'll come to you when he gets back.
i swore to myself that if i could ever be there for somebody, i would, so that that person wouldn't have to go through all the shit i went through.
what i'm trying to say is, if you're having problems figuring out where you stand, even if you're not sure of what you're supposed to want...
gimme another 10 minutes, and then really get on my case.
you gotta get up and go to work you've got a family to support.
i hate to put a fire under your fat ass but, get up and go to work and make money and take care of me.
maybe the truth is i am slowing down and you're gonna have to pick up the slack.
people in the midwest are definitely friendly where i'm from, you'd wave to a stranger.
and i've heard that the further you get from a big city the nicer people are.
so this is just a guy who's a fixture in your neighborhood and you're not sure if he's "all there"?
i was talking to him recently and halfway through the conversation
if you're drinking gravy you're probably not a big health nut.
wouldn't you love to be at the doctor's office with this guy?
george washington was a brave man and he risked a lot and...
and i know that he'd be proud to know that we celebrate his birthday every year with used car dealers.
"i'm bill duncan from bill duncan dodge and i've got a george washington's birthday sale that'll knock your socks off, right, george?"
"that's right, bill" - and this poor actor schmagegie getting 90 bucks for the rubber hatchet and the bad wig - that's right, bill,
i was thinking bout what kind of old man you're gonna be.
i think i'll be the kind who can kick your ass until the day i die.
we've even gotten to the point where we're interviewing the models.
dr. katz, what do we expect to learn from a model?
and when he got off stage napoleon came up to him and said
"hey, you know that bit you do about taking over the world?
"if we're ever working in the same town we won't both do the "taking over the world" bit."
gilbert, i'm glad you're sharing this with me but i feel like we're just postponing the very thing that you wanna talk to me about.
it will be the property of mexico unless i hand them over to you.
santa anna will respect the claims of you and the dons.
i am sorry that i could not protect this country from the peasants.
i am sorry that i will have to leave you without a husband.
you are not happy to see me, so let us all stop pretending.
i know that you have been paid, even threatened, to greet me.
i can see we are not going to spend much time talking.
montero has some design for california, otherwise he would not have hired captain love.
i have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
i thought i could do it here, but i was wrong.
i heard you were back in california, and the queen speaks highly of you.
i thought i fell out of favour with the court when california was lost.
santa anna is waging an expensive war with the united states.
even if we combined our fortunes we could not buy this country.
and why don't we all live in the same dream together?
meet me here tomorrow for a journey that will lay your doubts to rest.
my ninera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
when i was young i sneaked out at night and rode across andalusia.
all the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
to smile in the face of a killer while you make your own plans?
i want you to live with the knowledge that you have lost everything.
i want you to suffer knowing that your child should have been mine.
i am tired of waiting for you to tell me i am ready.
i have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
i've heard of don bartolo, but i've never had the pleasure of meeting him.
i arrived last week from spain by way of paris, lisbon and san francisco.
her majesty knows those unfortunate events were no fault of yours.
she told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision.
santa anna is waging an expensive war with the united states.

when i was young i used to sneak out at night and ride across andalusia.
i would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.
santa anna has agreed to the transfer the day after tomorrow.
he insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.
all the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
to smile in the face of a killer while you make your own plans?
they came from far and wide to say farewell to the brave champion.
but, little joaquin, whenever great deeds are remembered your grandfather will live on.
he will realize that the dons will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.
the rest of alta california i have divided equally among the other dons.
i want you to live with the knowledge that you have lost everything that you hold dear.
i want you to suffer as i have suffered knowing that your child should have been mine.
ain't i the one that figured to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?
i tell you, i am the holy guts of this gang.
as your skill improves you will progress to a smaller circle.
each new circle brings you that much closer to your adversary.
i have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
i thought i could do it here, but i was wrong.
i have heard of him, but never had the pleasure of meeting him.
i arrived last week from spain by way of paris, lisbon and san francisco.
i would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.
all that playing swords, shooting guns, racing around on horses gives me a frightful headache.
santa anna is waging an expensive war with the united states and is increasingly short of money.
even if we all combined our fortunes we could not come up with enough to buy this country from santa anna.
and why don't we all live in the same dream together?
meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.
my niñera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
when i was young i sneaked out at night and rode across andalusia.
heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers must strike you as odd, i suppose.
well, for one thing, i think you ought to fire your housekeeper.
santa anna has agreed to the transfer at noon the day after tomorrow.
he insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.
all the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
to smile in the face of my brother's killer while you make your own plans?
but there are many who would proudly wear the mask of zorro.
either way, events have been set in motion that you cannot stop.
the rest of alta california i have divided up equally among the other dons.
i trust that you will make sure that all of them receive their grants.
and then, looking very handsome and dashing in the late afternoon sun... he leapt onto the balcony... and thrust his enchanted sword under the king's chin.
"you would kill three innocent men," he demanded, "just to capture me?"
people of california... the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands... not as spaniards, not as mexicans... but as californians!
i stand here before you today with no mask... only a pledge... a solemn pledge that i will never abandon you.
as your skill with a sword improves... you will progress to a smaller circle.
with each new circle, your world contracts... bringing you that much closer to your adversary, to retribution.
don diego, the people will be speaking the name of zorro again.
stealing horses and marking walls makes you worthy enough to wear that mask?
i didn't ask for your help in the cantina... but i came here to iearn how to fight like you... to have your strength, your courage.
now, when i try to use them, you slap me down?
i am tired of waiting for you to tell me i am ready.
i have my own scores to settle... a new life to find.
i have heard of don bartolo, but i've never met him.
i arrived last week ffom spain... by way of paris, lisbon and san francisco.
her majesty knows those unfortunate events were clearly no fault of yours.
she also told me this province is still a land of opportunity... for a man of vision.
i think... sheep will always need a shepherd... but certainly not this zorro creature.
he probably wears the mask to hide his bald head and unsightly features.
and whaf are you doing now if not "playing to the crowd"?
now you're inciting us to raise arms against santa anna... when you know perfectly well we could never defeat his army.
santa anna is qaging a very expensive war with thhe united states... and is increasingly short of money.
even if we all combined our fortunes... we could not come up with enough money to buy this country from santa anna.
and why don't we all live in the same dream together?
meet me here tomorrow morning, gentlemen... for a journey that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.
technically, of course, all this gold belongs to santa anna... but fortunately, for us, he's completely unaware of its existence.
for the deception to work, all these bars... have been marked with the spanish seal so he'll think they've come from spain.
my ninera once told me... that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
so when i was young i used to sneak out at night... and ride my horse across andalusia... and wave at the sky so she would know it was me.
when i see you i remember what it felt like to be a father.
i'm sure your mother would be very proud of you, senorita.
heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers... must strike you as odd, i suppose.
well, for one thing, i think you ought to fire your housekeeper.

you think i don't know that you have been paid even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me?
only a pledge, a solemn pledge that i will never abandon you.
and you have my word, the word of rafael montero that i will do everything within my power to help you fight for a free and independent california!

the rest of alta california i have divided up equally among the other dons.
then suddenly, lightning flashed and a mighty thunder shocked the wasted land.
and the evil king glared at the good prince and said--
i want you to live with the knowledge you have lost everything you hold dear.
i want you to suffer as i have suffered... knowing that yuur child should have been mine.
and ain't i the one that figured to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse?

i can teach you how, how to move, how to think... how to take your revenge with honor and live to celebrate it.
i have my own scores to settle... a new life to find.
i thought i could do it here... but i was wrong.
montero has invited every don in california... to a banquet at his hacienda.
if you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy.
myself, i would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.
aii that playing with swords... shooting guns, racing around with horses... gives me a frighfful headache.
but her beauty is beyond compare... and she has her father's commanding presence.
as an advisor to her royal highness in matters of finance... it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court.
fellow dons of california... all of us here can recall the golden years when we ruled this country.
we commanded respect as noblemen, and we amassed a great deal of wealth... but there was something we never achieved.
you must go to montero's house tonight... break into his study, find anything that will tell us what his plans are.
people at the mine are dying... and all i can think of is...
i know you are not really happy to see me so let us all stop pretending, shall we?

- murrieta's brother or not you are more than you pretend to be.
maybe someday i will see what i look like through your eyes captain love.
a people's rebellion, led by general santa anna, spread from the arid mountains of the south to the rich and fertile northern province known as california.
peasants gathered in the streets, calling for the blood of the last spanish governor, don rafael montero.
he will realize that the dons will be dutiful taxpayers... and he will respect your claims.
the rest of alta california i have divided up equally among the other dons.

santa anna is waging an expensive war with the united states.
even if we combined our fortunes we could not buy this country.
and why don't we all live in the same dream together?
meet me here tomorrow for a journey that will lay your doubts to rest.
my niñera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight.
when i was young i sneaked out at night and rode across andalusia.
all the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?
to smile in the face of a killer while you make your own plans?
it will be the property of mexico unless i hand them over to you.
santa anna will respect the claims of you and the dons.
i am sorry that i could not protect this country from the peasants.
i am sorry that i will have to leave you without a husband.
i am tired of waiting for you to tell me i am ready.
i have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.
her majesty knows those unfortunate events were no fault of yours.
she told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision.
when i was young i sneaked out at night and rode across andalusia.
i would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.

santa anna has agreed to the transfer the day after tomorrow.

a guy in a weird suit with two polar bears can't be hard to spot.
i want my daughter found, and i want her found now.
well, it's not exactly my specialty, but i've done some reading on it.
when would a person who's cryogenically frozen need a blood transfusion?
nora was the only good thing in my life, and they took her from me.
i don't care what i have to do to get her back.
in a case that could herald a new era in cryogenic medicine nora fries has been revived from her frozen state and has undergone a vital organ transplant.
nora fries is the wife of victor fries, who was killed two weeks ago when an offshore drilling platform exploded and collapsed into the ocean.
you asked for the hawaiian mahi mahi and i told you that we only serve it on the west to east flights.
i thought there might be one piece of mahi mahi making the return trip.
why didn't you eat when we stopped at el pollo loco?
because it wasn't time to eat, it was time to pee.
don't you know how many pesticides they have in the local water?
lower your voice, people in here don't know they'll be dead in a week.
well, i had them on my lap so i could read them.
i lit my cigar, the hot ashes fell on my crotch, the map caught fire.
i'm going to try to stay calm while i say the next sentence.
if it isn't in there, where in the hell is my goddamn suitcase?
in that suitcase was my black formal afternoon suit that i bought to wear to give my daughter away in marriage.
and a $6,000 tiffany silver tray, which i bought as a wedding present.
and in that suitcase was $10,000 in cash, which i intended to give to my son-in-law on his wedding day.
in your suitcase, the police will find your broken, smashed, mutilated and dissected body in the event that you don't go back and find my fucking suitcase!
you've crisscrossed california more than the covered wagons did 100 years ago!
and tell them to follow the burnt pieces of directions on the freeway?
you're not the only one who lost everything in his suitcase.
what did you lose, an old mets t-shirt and a corned beef sandwich?
you stand here, i'm going to stand on the other side.
so we can catch all the heavy traffic at five o'clock at los pecos.
which is what i should have done in the first place, muchacho.
why don't you use a handkerchief so you don't get peach juice all over me?
what are two wide awake girls going to do with one hunky, funny guy?
why don't we all write a suggestion on a piece of paper?
it takes a few minutes to warm up and then we ride like the wind.
it's been a half hour and the wind is going faster than us.
doing that, i made it back once in an hour and 20 minutes.
excuse me, the scent of the trees and flowers always intoxicate me.
no matter what i say you two still end up in here.
would it be possible to find out the results of the second race at santa anita?
when you pick the three winning horses in the exact order of finish.
we have a wedding that we cannot get to and all he's got in his mind is a trifecta.
the same two men have been arrested three times for three different crimes and all three times by my men!
you know what the odds are of that happening at any police station?
if you say "trifecta" one more time, i'm going to choke you until you are dead!
then that man can arrest me one more time for one more crime, one more time in his office and he's gonna have a "fourfecta"!
if those guys commit a triple murder, or rob a bank just let them go.
if some travel agent booked this trip, we could have sued them for a fortune.
- that you wanted to meet me and couldn't think of a reason to sit down next to me.
i said, "tell him to come over, i'd like to meet him as well."
if you'd asked me that four hours ago, i would've said "the pits".
but something happened on the plane and everything's coming up roses.
i told you we only serve the mahi mahi... on the west-east flights, not the east-west flights.
i just thought there might be one piece... of mahi mahi making the return trip.
don't tell me when it hurts, 'cause it's gonna hurt anyway.
so when i count to three, we do it all in one big move.
what the hell made you do a stupid thing like that?
well, i had them on my lap so i could read them.
i lit my cigar, the hot ashes fell on my crotch... the map caught fire.
i had the choice of either finding the house... or burning up one of the most important parts of my body.
it takes a second and a half to look in there.
your 1927 piece of cardboard is there... but my suitcase isn't.
i'm going to try to stay very calm... while i say the next sentence.
if it isn't in there... where in the hell is my goddamn suitcase?
in that suitcase was my black formal afternoon suit... that i bought to wear to give my daughter away in marriage.
and in that suitcase was a $6,000 tiffany silver tray... which i bought as a wedding present.
oh, and in that suitcase was $10,000 in cash... which i intended to give to my son-in-law on his wedding day.
now, in your suitcase, the police are going to find... your broken, smashed, mutilated, and dissected body... in the event you don't go back and find my fucking suitcase!
or, "you may not like this, but i'm gonna say it anyway."
why don't you just say it and get it over with?
do you know i feel younger now than i have in years?
why didn't you say this last night... when we could have used it?
'cause it's better than you going into the john... and banging on the walls again.
are you going, or do i have to get a food trolley... and wheel you over there?
i know i haven't been there enough for you, brucie... but this is the best advice i'll ever give you.
not getting married today is the right thing for you to do.
if you swim with that rug, they'll think you're building a dam.
who gets the lemon loaf cake, no cholesterol, no fat, no taste?
it's about two hours north of l.a. we'll send you the address.
if i'm not being too nosey, who the hell are you marrying?
she's not going to clean up after the reception, is she?
my daughter is wonderful, and your son is damn lucky to get her.
i have this low sugar condition, i have to eat every four hours.
why didn't you eat when we stopped at el pollo loco?
because it wasn't time to eat, it was time to pee.
make out a timetable, when you're going to eat, pee, fart, cry and sleep.
what the hell made you do a stupid thing like that?
well, i had them on my lap so i could read them.
i lit my cigar, the hot ashes fell on my crotch, the map caught fire.
i had the choice of finding the house or burning one of most important parts of my body.

and tell them to follow the burnt pieces of directions on the freeway?
we drive to the first town we see and then we'll call budget.
why don't you use a handkerchief so you don't get peach juice all over me?
you think we're pulling in to the pebble beach country club?
and it would take two years for you and me to climb into their van.
and the last thing i want them to see is our underwear.
what are two wide awake girls going to do with one hunky, funny guy?
why don't we all write a suggestion on a piece of paper?
it takes a few minutes to warm up and then we ride like the wind.
it's been a half hour and the wind is going faster than us.

the same two men have been arrested three times for three different crimes and all three times by my men!
you know what the odds are of that happening at any police station?
if you say '"trifecta'" one more time, i'm going to choke you until you are dead!
then that man can arrest me one more time for one more crime, one more time in his office and he's gonna have a '"fourfecta'"!
if those guys commit a triple murder, or rob a bank just let them go.
if some travel agent booked this trip, we could have sued them for a fortune.
it's better than you going in to the john and banging on the walls again.
are you going, or do i have to get a food trolley and wheel you over there?
i said, '"tell him to come over, i'd like to meet him as well.'"
'ladies and gentlemen, we should be arriving 'at rockport's '"barbra streisand airport'" in 20 minutes.'
if he's looking, i've got a spare bedroom i don't use.
ladies, it's possible that in five weeks you'll all be moving out of sarasota.
you asked for the hawaiian mahi mahi and i told you that we only serve it on the west to east flights.
i thought there might be one piece of mahi mahi making the return trip.

why don't you use a handkerchief so you don't get peach juice all over me?
excuse me, the scent of the trees and flowers always intoxicate me.
if you're intoxicated, i'd be glad to be the designated driver.
you mean whenever you try to pull a dead body back in?
get out and push his head back in, i can't move.
of all the times i've wanted to choke you throat, this is the worst!
if you say '"trifecta'" one more time, i'm going to choke you until you are dead!
i told her you were writing an article for '"new york sunday times'"
about widowed women and womanless men and that you would like to ask her a few questions.
- that you wanted to meet me and couldn't think of a reason to sit down next to me.
i said, '"tell him to come over, i'd like to meet him as well.'"
if you'd asked me that four hours ago, i would've said '"the pits'".
but something happened on the plane and everything's coming up roses.
it's five past the hour, and that means a quick look at today's weather.
this morning, san fernando valley residents got a surprise... when they found frost on their windshields.
i have a friend... and she got herself in a bit of a situation.
and i was wondering if maybe she might've been in to see you?
i can't think of a better night to do it, julian.
if it's the only way i can have you, then i won't have it any other way.

but we traced him to you through that patient i.d. number.
according to him, some angels became jealous that god was giving too much attention to mankind.
so they tried to wipe humans out... under the archangel gabriel.
sir, did you notice any unusual activity in the neighborhood tonight?
- i got a wrecked car in the alley back there.
maybe on his first morning of school, you'd put him on a bus and he wouldn't come back.
or maybe as a teen, he'd dive into a pond and he wouldn't come up.
if that were the case, this war would have been over a long time ago.
are you telling me that i've come all this way for nothing?
floaters, crispy critters, bunk bait; bodies you wouldn't even know were bodies if it wasn't for a driver's license.
- yes, well, i don't see what that has to do...
so much so that he claimed to have had visions about them.

this fine quality linen, cotton and silk dress... will surely become a family heirloom...
probably all wear white and you probably have a web site somewhere.
and you probably bake brownies on the weekend... and you sell them to raise money for your cause or your cult...
lord, blind my eyes to these visions... and deafen my ears to the screams.
for i have seen legions of god's army fall... and heard the dying cries of 10,000 angels.

he worked very hard to build that little house for her.
when that daughter came, you needed a mop to wipe the smile off his face.
and after 28 years, i found a former kgb officer who told me my dad was transferred to siberia as a pow.
he said he had proof that my father was still alive.
maybe if harm found his father, the russians don't want us to know it.
don't sail into those waters, a.j. you could scuttle your career.
going public with rabb's fantasies would only raise false hopes among mia families who have suffered far too much.
you don't have to worry about me going public, mr. secretary.
they're dragging for the bodies, but they may never recover them.
webb, harm and mac are the closest things to friends you've got.
admiral, the russians have heard rumours as to why commander rabb was here.
so far, their enquiries have been unofficial, and my job is to keep them that way.
i have secured the silence of everyone involved in the shoot down and put out a cover story.
lieutenant commander rabb and major mackenzie were killed in a tragic accident while flying a mig-29.
i don't mind lying to the americans, but lying to our superiors is inviting a firing squad.
not if we root out this colonel zatkoff, who is trying to destroy perestroika.
but if it was a vision, then all you have to do is stay out of the water until we get to perm.
it was from this military airfield outside of moscow that two american naval airmen took off in a mig-29 on what proved to be a fatal demonstration flight.
russian military officers have privately expressed surprise at an american naval aviator being allowed to fly a state-of-the-art russian fighter.
but with the russian economy in chaos and the u.s. backing their imf loans, no one in the russian government would even speculate that this may not have been an authorised flight.
and get some b-roll of the helos going in and out.
i wanna do the story on the search effort next, okay?
rusza and i will buy your tickets with our identity papers.
won't they check our papers when we get on the train?
we're in the middle of russia with parlovsky or falcon trying to stop us.
we don't have identification papers, you don't know the language, and you have no plan other than to get us to beloyka.
what is your plan other than to take a train to beloyka?
you're being driven by emotions and those emotions are gonna get us killed.
well, i guess i always knew it would come down to this.
and that you'd need me to come up with a dispassionate plan.
one of them is procuring six nuclear-tipped missiles for the mafia to sell to the highest bidder.
alexei couldn't stop rabb from stealing that mig-29 without blowing his cover with the mafia, parlovsky and sokol.
i found him in the barn, nearly frozen to death and nursed him back to life.
for two years, he worked the farm with me and my brother.
and after 28 years, i found a former kgb officer who told me my dad was transferred to siberia as a pow.
he said he had proof that my father was still alive.
the russian air defence command announced this afternoon that a mig-29, flown by two american naval aviators,
collided with a migrating flock of geese and disintegrated in midair.
evidently, he met a major nikolai, who took him for a check ride in a mig-29, then let him take major mackenzie up.
major nikolai was flying their wing when he saw the mig strike a flock of migrating geese and disintegrate in midair.
mr. secretary, with all due respect, sir, you don't wanna try to stop me.
that's what you get when you make an admiral out of a seal.
they're not cheap like the british or the germans or the french who are the worst of all.
they give you these petite tips and insult you while they do it.
has anybody from the embassy interviewed this major nikolai who witnessed the accident?
i did, in lubyanka prison where he's under military arrest for permitting an unauthorised flight.
so far, their enquiries have been unofficial, and my job is to keep them that way.
your conducting an investigation, no matter how unofficial, makes that near impossible.
some of us escaped to england, the rest east to siberia.
now that the soviet union is gone, my sister and i are going to join the romany wandering there.
can their men dance on eggs and their women see the future?
well, i think if the navajo men danced on eggs, they'd be scrambled.
can't be more than a couple days' ride on the trans-siberian railway.
we'll pay you if you'll take us to a railway station.
a colonel zatkoff alerted air defence command that a mig-29 had been hijacked by chechnyan rebels.
they had interceptors up and waiting before commander rabb took off.
it is in everybody's interest to believe it, including the americans.
i don't mind lying to the americans, but lying to our superiors is inviting a firing squad.
not if we root out this colonel zatkoff, who is trying to destroy perestroika.
what do we do if rabb and mackenzie are still alive?
- and also, it's this major nikolai, the one that was flying the wing with them when they went down, has disappeared.
my sources tell me that he's being questioned in lubyanka prison by the federal security service.
they have alexei keeping tabs on colonel parlovsky and major sokol.
one of them is procuring six nuclear-tipped missiles for the mafia to sell to the highest bidder.
we know the one stealing missiles for the mafia is the same kgb rogue who ran the pow shuttle that brought harm's father to russia.
quit talking like a cheap spy novel, webb, and tell me who it is.
that was the name i gave the one who looked like you.
i found him in the barn, nearly frozen to death and nursed him back to life.
he never told us who he was or where he came from.
but i knew it was from far away because he seemed always to be looking to the horizon.
have to say truth for jennifer, don that he would do like this.
don always bill truth can hurt, but it had lied he/she is able bringing to appear faster.
i don't make this to throw the fault in conditions of whole proper name.
my race is absorbed and i didn't have for us for a long time, but when i saw him/it of different me waked upward the one that i lost.
he/she seems me that when you will see these numbers wake up upward of this inside as our department is good models and in next semester...
i with my allergies won't be able to anything ruins here.
i don't make this wants interrupting dinner i will sit down with jennifer that here and we will go caressed.
me i do doesn't acquire the idea anything making what you count.
then i told allergic reaction, that i don't can anything eats there.
you didn't make this coma any thing, you only drank water.
if you promise that you will find for me tenser i will tear immediately out with jennifer.
in spite of that i will squeeze woman's heart, which is already to the edge nervous collapse.
delta is in geometry the strongest illustration there now somehow loving delta collapses.
i tried this to you this was said was, you have to be sincere.
she was, in fact, renowned throughout the land for her wisdom and legions of followers doted on her every word.
anyone could see that this was a woman on her way to the top.
she said if she was ever stupid enough to come back, i should shoot her.
ah, the smell of the desperate, the roar of the cowed.
take it past the fantasy, because reality could never measure up.
you see, fantasies, by definition, are self-centred constructs and anyone who invests too much in them, are setting themselves up for disappointment.
the longer you hold on to this impossible dream, the longer you're gonna be distracted from the real goal, which is to find a viable, down to earth relationship.
all right, remember this friday is cancelled, i am off to the lake for a well deserved vacation, but next tuesday's session is still on, all right?
i like to save the paper for when i'm actually awake.
i promised this woman that i would hunt down this guy on a billboard.
immune to any distractions that might take her from her chosen course.
the stars were aligned in her life and as all the other great scientists of her era were well aware, once the stars are aligned they continue on course for eternity.
i'm picking up some files, which covers my reason for being here.
i heard that your trip to the lake dried up, i wanted to see what happened.
are you saying that there is no possible way these two will ever hit it off?
i'm saying the odds of a man she's only seen in a billboard having everything she wants in a relationship are roughly similar to the odds of being dragged from your living room by a pack of wild dogs.
oh well, far be it for me to argue fraud with you.
excuse me, but whatever crawled up your butt is unusually large today.
this is not a scheduled session, so i don't have to listen.
i'll have you know there just happens to be someone who's... never mind.
you might not want to ruin it by actually meeting him.
champ terrace is fetching in a fall ensemble that includes laundry shrunk jeans that give the buttocks an alluring lift.
they came to play, went the full three sets and the score is tied at love-love
enjoy it while it lasts, which given whose idea it was, should be about another twenty minutes.
well, they found me eighteen hours later hanging on to a ledge.
yeah, i'd wandered around in the dark and fallen off a cliff.
i mean, the call of the wild doesn't really call to me.
the closest that i get to the outdoors is a john denver album.
you know, that someone cared enough to get me something that personal.
every time i looked in my desk, boom, there they were.
i'm just saying any guy that's kept himself this hidden, did not just step off a billboard.
oops, i'm sorry, that's not a subject you care to talk about.
i can't do this by myself, so you just stand here so i can check the focus.
you know what, you think that you always have the last word on this, well you don't, okay.
something that would be even more striking if we had some champagne!
we'd like to feature you in a series of khaki nation commercials.
on going primetime spots revolving around you in any number of khaki nation outfits and there's more.
we'll be filming them in fifteen different cities over the next three months.
no, valerie, i'm not calling to scold you, i mean, really
i was just wondering how things were working out, you know?
i think i might have been a little too quick to try to stop you, like i did.
and i'm thinking, you know, what's the big deal, what's wrong with having an image of someone and wanting to meet him, see if he lives up to it, you know?
suddenly she was excited by life in a way she hadn't been in years, and of all the gifts he had given her that feeling was the most magical of all.
well, you know, i just thought maybe as her assistant, you had the inside-inside.
classic facial lines, perfect symmetry, but she couldn't spell cat if i spotted her the "c" and the "t".
by the way, did i mention the client's decision to go with a new approach.
if you can't be the face of khaki nation, you're welcome to be the... shoulder.
i have to say, scott, i was a little surprised when you suggested this.
i know this wasn't a normal day out on the range.
but this whole rugged, outdoorsy thing and the stuff from the billboard, that isn't who i am.
this is a coast guard law enforcement officer aboard the navy frigate bancroft.
requesting approval to use non-deadly force to stop the suspect vessel.
there, with fellow jag lawyer major sarah mackenzie, he now fights in and out of the courtroom with the same daring and tenacity that made him a top gun in the air.
new allegations have surfaced in yesterday's sinking of a luxury yacht off the florida coast.
witnesses aboard the yacht say the uss bancroft, a navy frigate taking part in a joint drug-interdiction operation
with the coast guard, reportedly opened fire on them without provocation.
there are many reasons that boat could have blown up, webb.
then i suggest he finds the one that exonerates the navy and satisfies minister mendoza.
acid would corrode the wire releasing the striker, the striker would detonate the percussion cap and, kaboom.
the concussion from a shell exploding nearby could have set a mine off prematurely.
branco mendoza is a princeton graduate with a degree in chemical engineering.
he brings the raw materials in from colombia and spends his days trying to create new designer drugs.
i'm required by law to take the detonation caps out of every one of them babies.
so if somebody were to reinsert them, they'd have themselves a fully functioning pencil fuse?
look, chief, in two minutes, i am calling the police, and i'm gonna hand you over to them.
now, i'm trying to give you a break here, one sailor to another.
you entered without a warrant, which makes this an illegal search.
i don't think you realise the seriousness of the situation you've created for yourself, mr. sullivan.
- next time, he could get hurt, or hurt someone else like you, or an innocent bystander.
if you don't help us stop him, you'll be just as responsible as he is.
guys like artemus and me, we've been through some serious business.
and we're still here because we don't back down from a fight.
all right, have the golden boys apprehended before you're charged with withholding evidence.
artemus sullivan wouldn't have been pushed to this extreme if washington would send branco mendoza back home where he belongs.
notify the local authorities and get them involved as soon as possible.
and mr. webb, if i were you, i would take the commander's advice.
look, harriet, i fell in love with a cute ensign that made me feel like i could do anything.
wherever your parents live, whether it's a mansion or a trailer park, really doesn't matter to me.
because it doesn't feel any different than being 50 or 30 or 20.
some things don't go as fast or as strong, but up here, where it counts, you still feel like that same active young man you were at 18.
enrique mendoza has asked the state department to keep this as quiet as possible.
which means, the chances of charges being filed against chief sullivan and the others is highly unlikely.
i know thor, my oldest son..., ...is in exile for his disobedience.
and i know, because he is nowhere to be found in our darkest hour..., ...that my middle son, loki, is a coward.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
-well, then my big brother has a nasty choice to make.
a little something i found in the norn book of fate.
he journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
but wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
he's never understood that kind of weakness could be a strength.
my mother once said the same thing to me about my father.
[ grunts ] well, looks like a half-god from greece can.
let loki's wolves eat my liver, if that's what odin wants.
last night my friend miranda got invited to a dinner party... by a man she hardly knew.
she was the date of nick waxler... a fairly successful sports agent who once told her she had nice legs.
you were on a date with a modelizer... and you didn't even know it?
if men like nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have?
they're a step beyond womanizers... who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt.
modelizers are obsessed not with women, but with models... who in most cities are safely confined to billboards and magazines... but in manhattan, actually run wild on the streets... turning the city into a virtual model country safari... where men can pet the creatures in their natural habitat.
there are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women.
either they're slime-balls that are just out to get laid... or they fall in love with you instantly.
i believe there is a curse put on the head of anybody... who tries to fix up their friends.
where better to find modelizers in their natural habitat than a fashion show?
luckily, my friend stanford blatch had a client in the hottest show in town.
"the bone" is like the human equivalent of the sable coat.
and i said, "you should get the bulge in your pants.
that way when women ask how big you are, you can say, 'fourteen feet'."
well, i'm discovering that... some of them treat it as a competitive sport... and others i think just need the validation.
and probably others just have a thing for exceptionally beautiful women.
i'd like to move back to iowa and have kids and be a cop.
i felt like i was in my bedroom when i was 16... and i used to hang out with this guy who was really beautiful... and my parents thought i was helping him with his chemistry homework.

"the bone" is like the human equivalent of the sable coat.
so what have you discovered about these men... who are dating models?
well, i'm discovering that... some of them treat it as a competitive sport... and others i think just need the validation.
it was hard to imagine that anyone so beautiful... could ever be lonely.
meanwhile, somewhere below 14th street... two ordinary joes were doing their own lonely late-night thing.
i began to realize that being beautiful... is like having a rent-controlled apartment overlooking the park:
completely unfair and usually bestowed... upon those who deserve it least.
if men like nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have?
do you have to be a supermodel to get a date in new york?
no matter how good i feel about myself... if i see christy turlington, i just wanna give up.
i wanna force-feed her lard, but that's the difference between you and me.
if models could cause otherwise rational individuals... to crumble in their presence, exactly how powerful was beauty?
there are two types of guys that fall for beautiful women.
the trick is, you gotta treat them like they're regular girls.
you gotta be able to roll into a place, walk up to the hottest thing there.
but seriously, i hope you call me back and... did i mention this was skipper?

he's so beautiful that i find that sometimes i have to look away.

nick waxler was a successful sports agent who'd said she had nice legs.
you were on a date with a modeliser and you didn't even know it?
if men like nick are dating models, what chance do ordinary women have?
they're a step beyond womanisers, who will sleep with just about anything in a skirt.
modelisers are obsessed, not with women, but with models, who in most cities are safely confined to billboards and magazines, but in manhattan run wild on the streets, turning the city into a model safari,
they're stupid and lazy and they should be shot on sight.
i've dated guys who say i am just as beautiful as a model, but i work for a living.
you gotta arrive and walk up to the hottest thing there; otherwise, you're finished.
it's kind of like being around dogs - you gotta show no fear.
where better to find modelisers in their natural habitat than a fashion show?

the other day, derek and i were walking past his billboard and he told me he wanted a piece of it for his apartment, like maybe his nose.
i said, "get the bulge in your pants, so when women ask how big you are,

later that night we all went downtown f or a party.
i was beginning to float away on a sea of sweet potato puffs... with smoked salmon and sour cream when--

you got your fucking signals crossed soldier, i'm in charge here.
major keller told us to sit quiet and not to mess around.
now his wife will not buy it for them, for sure.
you think that i'm a coward, since i didn't go with you.
savannah had lost his father, his mother, his brother and sisters, all murdered by the pol pot regime.
all he has left in the world is his uncle, whom he hopes to find in phnom penh.
maly won't be going back to his village, he's been fighting the war too long.
his wife sold their land in order... to feed the children, and finally nothing remained.
savannah, from his childhood on, knew nothing but war, the camps, famines, massacres.
when he was old enough, they sent him to the front.
neither poeuv nor my child... are going to go back living on that dump.
i know you're rotten, so can't you come up with something?
you know that lady from the temp agency who's saying i have a bad attitude?
i can't wait to tell that bean-counting fathead where she can put her time sheet.
there's this vicious blue jay on the terrace who keeps teasing him.
then eddie goes chasing after him and slams into that glass door.
i am so soaked, my dress is pasted right onto me.
it's a good thing i had this coat in the trunk.
well, not when you stack it up against a man who uses neck cream.
before you mock this product, you might recall you went to that spa.
i just keep picturing myself standing over some drain being hosed down like some old circus animal.
but, dad, i can't afford this sort of thing for myself anymore.
oh, i'm just musing about the timeless moments that bind a father to son.
a game of catch, a trip to a little fishing hole, a shared rainforest mud facial.
i was invited to a housewarming party for a new arrival, stewey.
i hadn't been there two minutes when i heard a pop.
well, at this rate she's gonna go through that loan in no time.
i'm just wondering if i should have a talk with her.
i walked by the serenity room just as olga and sergei were giving him a full-body sudsing.
i never felt so clean and so dirty at the same time.
wearing socks and underpants and carrying a wallet into a mudbath is not a generational issue.
if you ever hear me offer to take dad to a spa again, wash out my mouth with jug wine.
niles, i don't want to talk to her about it, i have to.
for god's sake, at the rate she's spending, she's gonna be out of money before we're back to work.
i've been meaning to ring you ever since i arrived but, um, well, i've been rather busy.
you realize we have not seen each other since the night of that u2 concert?
so i plugged in things in all four outlets that make noise.
that way, when i turn it on, i just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
when you said all you were gonna be doing between now and the time you leave is packing you really didn't leave me much choice.
well, i thought i did, but i guess i did not.
but what i'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
uh, sir, a ticket to yemen is $2100, and we don't take library cards.
which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch.
so, i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is.
all right, y'know what, she's gonna think that i'm handing you a credit card, but what i'm really gonna do is hand you a library card.
ah, sir a ticket to yemen is $2,100 and we don't take library cards.

well, being a movie star you would need to receive orders
a prostitute gets orders, mailmen get orders, even i have to get orders to go to work
if you know... what kind of business cat's in, if you can, just pick up the phone and call me
anyway cat, tell me if i'm wrong, the places that you deliver to, must be some homes of the rich and famous?
it gets old fast i think that is a large misconception
these people i deliver to may or may not be rich
if you weren't spending so much time with the guys in the academy, you'd be just like me listening to the weirdoes
at first, i thought we were just doing it for the fun of it
but weren't there any witnesses and didn't the murder leave any trails of evidence?
a janitor saw a man in his late 20's to early 30's leaving the scene
their faces were so messed up... even their mothers couldn't recognise them
this guy must have black belts all the up to his neck
i would like to know if we have any further information on the case
according to our data analysis, the man we're looking for... is between 25-35 years old chinese male
at the scene of the crime, it clearly indicated that, the suspect not only specialized in hand to hand combat, but also an expert in weaponry
one of the weapons that the suspect used... was an .25 caliber derringer
a while back, he was in hiding and all of a sudden... when he resurfaced, he had his hands on a lot of cash
even though the police and the icac have a file on him that is higher than the china bank building
but they tried to screw him with whole bottle of vaseline and they still can't get him
then, there comes this lucky sperm who took a shit load of his money to start a company
la boy, he's in his 30's his hobby is screwing anything that moves on the silver screen that has ass and tits
he's going to sign an actress at his office tomorrow and mr. tsoi would like you to send him a delivery
looks like you're gonna be in jail for a long time
you know now what you're going to do when i quit the force?
you know, ten years on the force, working the back end of the city
guy makes a lot of enemies, but i've been back in hong kong for a while and if anyone wanted me, they would have done so
why would he wait this long and chose to do it in public.
i know you were a cop in new york and solved some tough cases
with your experience, don't tell me you were scared shitless in front of just one man... who is trying to hurt you
i'm sure you know conroy's boys were no flakes, but they still ended up on their backs in just a few minutes
even if you guys were there, you guys would end up on your backs too.
anyway, i haven't been a cop for years and all i wanted was to make some money in hong kong
or do you want me to bring you a dozen more?
if you think pussy will make you rich then i won't stop you
i know what i'm doing, i'll take care of it, you know
i won't do anything to mess up our business in jamaica
of course it's for money, is there anything else besides money in hong kong?
now if someone gives you ten million to kill me, would you do it?
well, i was going to have a chat with your lover boy
but i guess he's just not in the mood for talking
tried to get a piece of ass and fell into the toilet?
come on, don't make fun of me in front of all these beautiful girls
yes, and i have to look at you every night before i sleep... and dream as if you were my angel.
well, then do you know what my boyfriend does for a living?
let me tell you some of the things these people do
you don't have to tell me, i know what they do
have you thought it over that... what exactly are you going to do next?
i really don't know what i'm going to do at this point
he would hang me and give me a beating everytime when he came home drunk
i remember he came home and broke two of my ribs
but if you really look at each home, each window and look inside those ordinary lives,
sons stealing from mothers, wives betraying husbands, the rape of children, women being beaten...
all of these you accept, because you never have to confront it we hide it away and call it innocence
innocent or not is set by society standard, there is no good or bad in this world, just weak and strong
you guys heard it, he wanted me to send his message to his angel
if you think you look like an angel or simply have long hair, give me a call
he said he'd go to the temple, it must have been the one we just went to
then he'll see his father, but his father is already dead
but this triangular area is so huge... which exact spot did he go?
sir, around this area is there anything associated with a church, mirrors or a glass company?
don't worry, there's not going be much of a problem when i'm here
this is a favor to you, i won't tell my boss
well, being a movie star you would need to receive orders
a prostitute gets orders, maiimen get orders, even i have to get orders to go to work
if you know... what kind of business cat's in, if you can, just pick up the phone and call me
anyway cat, tell me if i'm wrong, the places that you deliver to, must be some homes of the rich and famous?
it gets old fast i think that is a iarge misconception
these people i deliver to may or may not be rich
if you weren't spending so much time with the guys in the academy, you'd be just like me listening to the weirdoes
at first, i thought we were just doing it for the fun of it
but weren't there any witnesses and didn't the murder leave any trails of evidence?
a janitor saw a man in his late 20's to early 30's leaving the scene
their faces were so messed up... even their mothers couldn't recognise them
this guy must have black belts all the up to his neck
i would iike to know if we have any further information on the case
according to our data analysis, the man we're looking for... is between 25-35 years old chinese male
at the scene of the crime, it clearly indicated that, the suspect not only specialized in hand to hand combat, but also an expert in weaponry
one of the weapons that the suspect used... was an .25 caliber derringer
a while back, he was in hiding and all of a sudden... when he resurfaced, he had his hands on a iot of cash
even though the police and the icac have a file on him that is higher than the china bank building
but they tried to screw him with whole bottle of vaseline and they still can't get him
then, there comes this lucky sperm who took a shit load of his money to start a company
la boy, he's in his 30's his hobby is screwing anything that moves on the silver screen that has ass and tits
he's going to sign an actress at his office tomorrow and mr. tsoi would iike you to send him a delivery
looks like you're gonna be in jail for a iong time
you know now what you're going to do when i quit the force?
you know, ten years on the force, working the back end of the city
guy makes a iot of enemies, but i've been back in hong kong for a while and if anyone wanted me, they would have done so

aii of these you accept, because you never have to confront it we hide it away and call it innocence
but in life, you'd find other things as well, good things
wesley knows that you couldn't kill me, that's why what he said on the phone was a message to me
sir, around this area is there anything associated with a church, mirrors or a glass company?
carrie, here... this used to be an old glass souvenir factory
don't worry, there's not going be much of a problem when i'm here
this is a favor to you, i won't tell my boss
landeene... you ever not go to your mother's for thanksgiving dinner?
well only once and i'll tell you what she's never let me forget it for a fuckin second.
well i painted that last night.this morning i was walking by same church.
and the stone angel fell right off the top, and landed on this woman's head
and he sent her a couple of them love birds in a box.
and i'm gonna tell you what she took him back just, just right like that.
do i leave them in or do i take them out?
do i leave them in or do i take them out?
my arms and my legs, they all feel kind of light and spongy.
i was up there watching you and rosie look for a cork, and.
for god's sake, we have to get him out of here.
we gotta get this thing in the back of the truck.
well that's exactly why i should count more than anybody else, because i know how good you really are.
but i, i don't think it works that way at all.
loving you is every bit as... fine as coming over a hill into the sun at ninety miles an hour.
darling, when it's dawn you can hear the stars unlocking themselves from the designs of god.
this is so exciting that the pope is coming to city hall.
i don't know what it is about having a powerful man around
well, can you look me in the eye and tell me that's the truth?
joe, i can look you in the eye and tell you that's the truth.
and i yelled at you, and i said you weren't a team player?
well, there's no way i can give you back christmas with your family...
some guy you might have met at a gallery opening last week
who gave you his number which you stare at night after night,
if it hadn't have been for the hedge, she would've died.
i spent the rest of my life trying to regain her trust.
he wants to be interviewed with the city in the background.
you want to be the one to tell him to come inside
it's amazing how fast people can bond when they have a common enemy.
i'm thinking i might be able to go back to work.
when he saw the condition of the body, he backed out of the scene, stepping in his own footprints.
anyway,we've been beating the bush looking for her personal effects,but so far nothing.
well,he was hired to staff the new day shift,but... since we're one shy with grissom away,
ecklie wanted us to break him in for a few weeks.
a through f is pretty bad-- homeless,junkies, scumbags, the hookers we chase off the strip.
i mean,if you're down and out in vegas, sooner or later, you're gonna end up here.
no visible skin under the fingernails, so she probably didn't fight back.
there were no defensive wounds on her forearms, no ligature marks on her wrists or ankles.
in other news,local las vegas police officers are still trying to identify the body of a nude woman found off highway 51 early yesterday morning.
the police say they received a call at 3:32 a.m. from a truck driver who happened to be driving down highway 51 when he spotted the young woman's body just off the road.
based on the level of decomp, she'd been lying there about two days before they found her.
only thing about this one is, she had her clothes on.
there were no traces of anything like that found in veronica sorensen.
which means if our guy still sedates his victims before sexually asphyxiating them, whatever he's using now isn't leaving a trace.
yeah,most of these guys tend to operate out of one place.
in theory, as the killer gets more and more comfortable with each act, the locations of the bodies should spiral outward from one central point.
the crime center sure seems to move around pretty quickly here,huh?
well,in vegas, new is old in five years, old is history in ten, and nothing ever seems to leave a mark.
the only lab in the country that was doing that stuff was the fbi,and my supervisor-- he wouldn't have called them in on a case like this.
i used to bust my ass to keep a crime scene pristine, and then some uniform would wobble over, stuffing his face, drop a hamburger wrapper right at my feet.
sir,i spent half the day at central property going through their records.
now,according to the case logs, it was transferred to this crt in late 1989 and never returned.
jane doe '99 had traces of chloral hydrate in her system.
i read that dentists used to use it to sedate pediatric patients.
i can't imagine that you didn't feel something for these girls at some point.
we're just asking you to help us return them to their families.
i feel disappointed that i've been caught, but i tend to take the long view of things.
i've had a wonderful life, and i know that all things human eventually must end.
the message warned of further attacks... but there were no accompanying demands.
was there anything on site that would help identify the group?
based on what you gave me, i've got 65 with a high correlation.
if none of them work out, we'll have to loosen it up.
officially, nearly 3,000 extra riot police turned out to meet them... but some said the number was double.
at any rate, they and the students ha ve played this game before.
a national one called to protest against government plans... to reform the universities.
but the government has handled it so clumsily... that although the plans are still deliberately vague... everyone, left and right, feels threatened.
he had no reasons to do it except out of kindness.
didn't you tell me once... that you can't separate the man from his actions?
initiate a lockup, then go to level 4 and bring everybody in.
link up with the dod satellite, see what data it has.
we received an anonymous internet transmission... two hours before the bombing.
the message warned of further attacks... but there were no accompanying demands.
i can protect you, but you have to do exactly as i say.
you mean, sell out everything i believe in so i can save myself?
it was the biggest so far of the recent student demonstrations.
a national one called to protest against government plans... to reform the universities.
even after he thought i was dead, he kept providing for her.
he had no reasons to do it except out of kindness.
the one between loyalty to a friend... and duty to the section.
it's a common mistake for an operative to believe... that he or she can elude the eyes of the section.
since the last south park you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of eric cartman is
now, finally, the shocking truth about cartman's lineage will not be seen tonight so we can bring you the following special presentation
on the night in question, this monster entered the home of dr. jeffrey o'dwyer and struck him repeatedly in the head with this hammer
that monster is sitting right over there, and his name is terrance
all of these things link terrance to the murder hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt
a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled a haiku called "time to kill dr. jeffrey o'dwyer."
"dr. o'dwyer, time to have your head smashed in, with my new hammer."
terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not god
we have your honor; we have found terrance, in the above-entitled action of murder against dr. jeffrey o'dwyer...
you're going to have to repeat that verdict since we had some flatulence issues
yes, it's been a long day, and only kroff dinner can calm my nerves
say phillip, why does scott always try to convict me of murder
oh phillip, how will i ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place?
we don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers and we have no idea where to being.
he saddam, you helped me get rid of terrance and phillip, and i appreciate that.
but why are framed pictures of you going up all over canada?
hey, relax fella, i'm just making it so that terrance and phillip can never come back to canada again.
i just need a couple of days, then i'm gonna head back to iran.
remember the plan; first we take over canada, then we'll have the best of the female pop vocalists.
after that we'll take over the u.s., then europe, then china, then newfoundland, then the world!
and in other news, it appears that saddam hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the u.s. inspect his military operations.
when asked if he would uphold his side of the agreement,
hussein replied quote "hey, relax fella, you need a rest guy."
hey phillip, isn't that the smelly gentleman we've seen in pictures all over town?
the two of you are the most annoying dicks in canada.
you give other canadians a bad name, and if i had my way....
there's a candian football game tomorrow; the ottawa rough-riders against the vancouver roughriders.
it's at that game that i will officialy turn the candian flag over to my iranian one.
who is cartman's father, find out on an all new south park, in just a few weeks.
since the last south park you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of eric cartman is.
on the night in question, this monster entered the home of dr. jeffrey o'dwyer, and struck him repeatedly in the head with this hammer.
that monster is sitting right over there, and his name is terrance.
"dr. o'dwyer, time to have your head smashed in, with my new hammer."
terrance, you may be a famous surgeon, but you're not god.
they think that farts are a sophisticated form of comedy, but they're not.
well, what if i were to help you get rid of them once and for all?
why don't you put this paper bag over your head ugly bob?
yes, if people can't see your face, they won't know how wretchedly ugly you are.
i must take my bastard daughter back to celine dion and see what she has to say.
celine, i brought our daughter sally back, and i want to tell you that...
hey saddam, you helped me get rid of terrance and phillip, and i appreciate that.
but why are framed pictures of you going up all over canada?
hey, relax fella, i'm just making it so that terrance and phillip an never come back to canada again.
- i just need a couple of days, then i'm gonna head back to iran.

hussein replied quote "hey, relax fella, you need a rest guy."
the two of you are the most annoying dicks in canada.
you give other canadians a bad name, and if i had my way....
canada will be rid of both the iraqis and your immature fart humor.
well, phillip, i'm very sad that we have to die for canada.
since the last south park you've waited four long weeks to find out who the father of eric cartman is.
now, finally, the shocking truth about cartman's lineage will not be seen tonight so we can bring you the following special presentation
hair fibers, blood samples, nail clippings, a piece of his shirt.
a watch with his initials on it, a day planner with the murder scheduled.
- good people of the jury, my client terrance is an innocent man.
- oh ho, phillip, now you farted during the closing argument.
we have found terrance, in the above-entitled action of murder against dr. jeffrey o'dwyer...
you're going to have to repeat that verdict since we had some flatulence issues.
yes, it's been a long day, and only kroff dinner can calm my nerves.
say phillip, why does scott always try to convict me of murder?
now, you promised that when terrance and phillip arrive they'll be ripped into pieces and shot several times.
hey, relax guy, i'm gonna keep my side of the bargain.
oh phillip, how will i ever find my fugitive daughter in this daunting place?
we don't speak the language, we are unwelcome strangers and we have no idea where to begin.
and in other news, it appears that saddam hussein has finally signed an agreement to let the u.s. inspect his military operations.

- oh, i'm sorry scott, can you hold on a minute?
tomorrow, saddam will try to finalize his takeover of canada at the rough-riders rough-riders football game.
- it will be your only shot at wiping them all out.
and the rough-riders are really giving the roughriders a run for their money.
all else aside, i must say that the rough-riders are simply outmatched by these roughriders.
those of you who acquiesce to my demands will be treated fairly.
oppose me, and you face a dire fate indeed as my slaves in the mines of mercury.
but i saw you fall into the fiery mouth of that volcano.
it takes more than a little lava to stop captain proton.
now, i want you to call off your invasion and give me back my rocket ship.
there is one force in this universe that even you cannot defeat.
you don't want to start a fight with me right now-- not at 3:00 a.m.
3:00 in the morning, 4:00 in the afternoon-- what's the difference?
i've been saving up my holodeck rations and i've got three full hours coming.
any chance i might persuade you to join me for a few rounds of velocity?
strange as it sounds... i almost long for the days when we were under constant attack.
no time to stop and think about how we got stranded in the delta quadrant.
it was shortsighted and it was selfish and now all of us are paying for my mistake.
so if you don't mind, commander, i'll pass on that little game.
now, when we last saw our heroes, they had just retaken their rocket ship.
dr. chaotica had escaped, but he left behind his trusty robot to foil captain proton.
give me the creature and i'll take you to the vortex.
well, my apologies, mr. emck, but i'd like to know what's going on here.
their shuttle was damaged by a magma eruption and three crew members were severely injured.
the next day, she returned to the moon, alone, to complete the survey.
we have lived here for millions of years undisturbed, until the malon came.
captain, every one of them appears to be suffering from theta radiation exposure.
once we're on the other side, we contact the malon authorities and blow the whistle on emck.
we give them the reclamation technology and continue on our way home.
it takes more than a little lava to stop captain proton.
now, i want you to call off your invasion and give me back my rocket ship.
if it weren't for sensors, we wouldn't even know we were at warp.
we've only been crossing this expanse for two months and we're already feeling the strain.
if we want to continue our course toward home, we have no choice but to cross it.
we won't have an opportunity to take on fresh supplies or fuel, so i've ordered all departments to create an energy reserve.
i go into a void every time i'm deactivated-- emptiness, complete and utter oblivion.
i'll admit, it was unsettling at first-- the existential horror of it all...
oh, what i wouldn't give for a few borg cubes about now-- anything for a little distraction.
strange as it sounds... i almost long for the days when we were under constant attack.
very same words i've been telling myself for the past four years.
but then we hit this void, and i started to realize how empty those words sound.
as you may have noticed, she's isolated herself from the crew.
she believes that she made an error in judgment four years ago-- that she's responsible for stranding voyager in the delta quadrant.
the next day, she returned to the moon, alone, to complete the survey.
she wanted the crew to know that their suffering had not been in vain.
you're looking at several months of retrofitting, depending on the size of your fleet.
all the schematics are here and we'd be willing to work with you-- get you started.
we fight our way past them-- navigate the vortex on our own.
once we're on the other side, we contact the malon authorities and blow the whistle on emck.
even if we did get through the vortex, there's no guarantee the malon will do the right thing-- if mr. emck is any indication.
as long as this vortex exists, the inhabitants of this region are at risk.

the land value has skyrocketed so high, it's worth 300 yarz of ship!
maybe, but it wouldn't have gotten this far on its own.
listen, my father's and my little brother's bail money is riding on this.
if you try to take it out of our pay, you're as good as squished!
this is coming from an old man who raised an idiot son but everyone feels differently.

to captain benjamin lafayette sisko in recognition of your remarkable leadership and meritorious conduct against the enemy and in particular, for personal acts of bravery displayed during the battle to retake deep space 9
starfleet command is proud to present you the christopher pike medal of valor.
starfleet command has decided we've been waging a defensive war long enough.
they figure we're never going to win this thing unless we take the fight into dominion territory.
no, i know, i know you've been saying that since the romulans opened a second front with the dominion.
well, it took a while but your message finally got through.
uh, look, um, i-i-i don't want to dampen your spirits, jadzia but i told you before you were married that from a medical point of view it wouldn't be easy for a trill and a klingon to have a child.
and i'm worried the kid'll end up looking like his father.
heroes get welcomed home, dukat, not failures or have you forgotten that under your leadership the dominion nearly lost this war?
as i recall, weyoun you were standing right by my side agreeing with every decision i made.
you may have fired the phaser but it was benjamin sisko who forced your hand and that's why i'm here.
the time has come for me to take my revenge against the good captain.
to give you what you desire above all else- the alpha quadrant.
all i need is a certain bajoran artifact- one of the many the cardassians appropriated during the occupation.
leave it to a romulan to run at the first sign of trouble.
and leave it to a klingon to leap to the wrong conclusion.
and with it, any chance of getting reinforcements from the gamma quadrant.
i'm well aware things didn't turn out quite the way i planned but i assure you, we still achieved a great victory.
the funeral service is due to begin in a few minutes, jadzia but i need to talk to you one last time.
when i first met you you told me that my relationship with jadzia dax wouldn't be any different than the one i had with curzon dax.

the funeral service is due to begin in a few minutes, jadzia but i need to talk to you one last time.
when i first met you you told me that my relationship with jadzia dax wouldn't be any different than the one i had with curzon dax.
to captain benjamin lafayette sisko in recognition of your remarkable leadership and meritorious conduct against the enemy and in particular, for personal acts of bravery displayed during the battle to retake deep space 9
starfleet command is proud to present you the christopher pike medal of valor.
starfleet command has decided we've been waging a defensive war long enough.
they figure we're never going to win this thing unless we take the fight into dominion territory.
no, i know, i know you've been saying that since the romulans opened a second front with the dominion.
well, it took a while but your message finally got through.
uh, look, um, l-l-i don't want to dampen your spirits, jadzia but i told you before you were married that from a medical point of view it wouldn't be easy for a trill and a klingon to have a child.
and i'm worried the kid'll end up looking like his father.
heroes get welcomed home, dukat, not failures or have you forgotten that under your leadership the dominion nearly lost this war?
as i recall, weyoun you were standing right by my side agreeing with every decision i made.
you may have fired the phaser but it was benjamin sisko who forced your hand and that's why i'm here.
the time has come for me to take my revenge against the good captain.
to give you what you desire above all else-- the alpha quadrant.
all i need is a certain bajoran artifact-- one of the many the cardassians appropriated during the occupation.
leave it to a romulan to run at the first sign of trouble.
and leave it to a klingon to leap to the wrong conclusion.
and with it, any chance of getting reinforcements from the gamma quadrant.
i'm well aware things didn't turn out quite the way i planned but i assure you, we still achieved a great victory.
the funeral service is due to begin in a few minutes, jadzia but i need to talk to you one last time.
when i first met you you told me that my relationship with jadzia dax wouldn't be any different than the one i had with curzon dax.
it appears you've found the weak spot we've been looking for.
all we have to do is to convince the romulans to join us.
until we have gamma quadrant reinforcements, we have to make do.
we needed new ships on the romulan front, so i sent them.
the time has come to take my revenge against the good captain.
we're in the middle of a struggle for the control of the entire alpha quadrant and all you care about is quenching your petty thirst for revenge.
leave it to a romulan to run at the first sign of trouble.
and leave it to a klingon to leap to the wrong conclusion.
the romulan empire has agreed to join the invasion of cardassia and we live up to our agreements.
but can the invasion be launched before the defensive grid is activated?
according to dr bashir we need all the help we can get.
just remember when you get back, we have a lot of work to do.
now you tell me the wormhole is gone, and with it, any chance of gamma quadrant reinforcements.
i'm well aware things didn't turn out quite the way i'd planned, but i assure you we still achieved a great victory.
i don't know what to do about it, how to make it right again.
i've failed as the emissary and for the first time in my life i've failed in my duty as a starfleet officer.
maya dear, before you get too caught up in all of this--
oh, nina, this is perfect, because really, between you and me,
i just didn't know what angle i was going to take on this story.
you know, if you want something really juicy from the world of rock, listen to this--
no, i'm sure that nick has, like, totally gotten over me by now, you know, and i don't want to spoil my one perfect memory, and this way, i'll always have mazatlan...
and a tattoo that appears to be a chihuahua rolling a joint.
nick, before we go down that road, there's something i want to tell you.
in a few minutes, someone is going to be joining us, someone very special.
you want to pop back to the hotel and run a little mic check?
no, no, that's not what i had in mind at all.
well, before you go, could you just give me a hug, you know, like you used to?
darling, it's the only thing i can do like i used to.
what, have you fried so many brain cells that you can't remember the most romantic, the most beautiful experience of my entire life?
good god, have you forgotten how we made love outside in a hammock, and we didn't care if the whole world saw us?
you said it was the most beautiful weekend of your life.
that's when he was a lead singer, not a bass player.
annie's a first-rate photographer, even if her work isn't all that avant-garde.
i mean, i worked with body paints for years, but nobody noticed.
of course, now i can't even use my own idea, because people will think i'm ripping her off.
i'm always two steps ahead of her breakthroughs, and yet people think,
i had fallen asleep on the bar, and some lousy drunk thought i was a telephone.
after two glorious days, we parted ways and never saw each other again, but six months later,
i mean, okay, how long were you and nick actually together?
maya dear, before you get too caught up in all of this-
oh, nina, this is perfect, because really, between you and me,
i just didn't know what angle i was going to take on this story.
nick hewitt and i, well... we had more than just a casual fling.
when you get right down to it, that was probably the single most perfect weekend of my life.
it wasn't until months later when i heard the song that i learned how much i meant to nick, but by then, i was already engaged, and by the time i was divorced, he was married,
and then when he got a divorce, i was in est, and by the time i got deprogrammed-
oh, no, no, no, no, i don't want you to mention my name to him.
no, i'm sure that nick has, like, totally gotten over me by now, you know, and i don't want to spoil my one perfect memory, and this way, i'll always have mazatlan...
i can't tell you what an honor it is to meet you.
and i can't tell you what an honor it would be to see you thrashing around in my bed.
"if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?"
um, well, that was just in case the interview was in real trouble.
what is so clever about paul newman in a giant bowl of salad?
you have a right to be mad, and you know what i do when i'm mad?
nick, before we go down that road, there's something i want to tell you.
in a few minutes, someone is going to be joining us, someone very special.
you want to pop back to the hotel and run a little mic check?
no, no, that's not what i had in mind at all.

a tour of the office, but since when does the official tour
of city hall end in a hot tub at the four seasons?
so if you see a rat covered in caramel wearing one of those cool fake tattoos, say congratulations, and then smash him with a brick.
nikki, stacy, i think it's great that you offered to give the italian water polo team a tour of the office, but since when does the official tour of city hall end in a hot tub at the four seasons?
okay, this one... this one's going to be on the next record.
i don't know when the fuck it's going to be out...
okay, this one... this one's going to be on the next record.
i don't know when the fuck it's going to be out--

from the time of birth all jaffa are taught to be strong.

teal'c, you originally withheld information about your family because you feared it would make you vulnerable.
teal'c, on my word as a warrior, i did not know.

after that is done, i will never lay eyes on you again.
how dare you judge me and dishonour fro'tak in his own house after what you have done?

if you've got a price on your head you're doing your job!

it's like a wet rope, like the time we made that trailer hitch and it's wrapped around the baby's neck.
i want you to uncurl it so the baby can be born.

i'm only mentioning money because at one time or another he's kept every member of my family financially afloat and asked for nothing in return.
you're filling her head with shit about love and manifesting your own destiny.
she's talking about going back to that half-wit marriage counselor again.
thanks to you, we've got nina cruising the barrio at night with a dishwasher named jesus.
yes, she is, and she's probably having fun for the first time in her life.
why do i always feel like i have to prove something to you all the time?
i have more passion in me than you'd know what to do with.
i'm not gonna put it down, because i need you to tell me the truth.
i need you to tell me if you're sleeping with her.
just make sure to tell irene that i'll baby-sit lily tonight.
and make sure mother takes her medicine at 2:00 and 4:00.
you know how when you listen to music playing from another room and you're singing, because it's a tune that you really love when a door closes or a train passes, so you can't hear the music anymore but you sing along anyway.
then, no matter how much time passes when you hear the music again, you're still in exact same time with it.
he has an affair, i stop eating for a while and then we have a huge fight, and our relationship is over and we break up.
but while we're doing that all the passion that seeped out of our relationship...
will you please stop talking about me like i'm not here?
i am perfectly capable of deciding for myself who i'm going to go with.
danny's love for you is so enormous, it spilled over onto everyone else.
he's changed you, too only you're the last one to notice it.
she said it was my turn to do something extraordinary and i'm doing it.
i'm here at a train station in the middle of the night like a character in a russian novel, and i'm begging you.

café snooty was booked, but they got us a table at the pompous room.

as soon as this woman gets here, give me five minutes and call me on my cell phone.
if i am miserable, i will simply say it's an emergency and excuse myself.
i guess someone wanted to rack up a few more frequent frasier miles.
you don't ever actually say those things to the woman, do you?
but, as long as frasier's happy, why should my feelings matter?

there's never enough time in the day for me to do everything i want to do.
bottom line-- i wish there were a way i could get more done.
see, no matter what we wish for, it's just gonna become... the big daddy of all miseries, so--
we're gonna do the clever thing and wash our hands of the whole mess.

hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
he journeyed the earth battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.

i mean, for me, stealing treasure beats having it handed to you any day.

you tricked us so none of us could exercise our third wish.
and according to the official rules of geniedom..., ...which you're sworn to uphold, each of us has one legitimate wish left.
we could all band together and wish you out of existence.
but we're willing to cut you a little slack and even give you something in return as long as you're willing to grant us our final wish.
"caravan of the moon" will be announced through the speaker and the tourists will take their pictures with their mouths wide open.
and the voice will say that the caravan will only be seen once every raining season.
these people here, they've translated "nuclear family" with "family in the era of atomic threats."
this isn't a translation, this is fraud against the reader, the author and the text.

half of men make love to their wives thinking about the babysitter.
the guy doing the sitter, thinking about his wife, has nature problems.
when she shakes hands, she won't stick hers out very far.
she wants the other person to meet her more than halfway.
what laura jewell did, caused her to commit an insane act.

now we must stop to think... about a fundamental aspect of our decision
the child of our dreams... can never correspond to a real child
she could have been something else - a poetess, a writer a musician...
but unfortunately for us she took it into her head to be a painter with the deplorable results we can all see
however, the immediate result that i can see is a vertical drop in the style and image of our gallery the only gallery in this city with international prestige
so i wonder, dear alina, why on earth... you want us to make such a bad impression?
she's no guttuso, we all know that but i found many interesting aspects in her recent work
now that is a brilliant example... of pitifully groping for arguments!
i've listened to your bullshit all morning which is more than you did with us
i'm in charge here anyway, so i'm telling you officially that
i won't go into the logic of that, it's none of my business
my job is to prescribe a diet consisting of 200 grams of red meat per day
i'm not here in my usual capacity, as an art critic but as a father - a shamelessly excited one at that
i know very well the problems my daughter had to overcome to be here today, because of my... bad temper
that is why i intend to embrace the manageress, mrs. regis both physically and metaphorically for overlooking our past and recent disagreements and for assessing giulia's work dispassionately
i want to thank you all for your enthusiasm and interest in this exhibition
listen, alina, i think we we can keep one another at arm's length but to get the best out of ourselves
i think we should start to i don't know... see each other...
i wanted to inform you personally that your adoption application has been accepted
i also wanted to say that we were pleasantly surprised by the fact that a busy couple like you made this difficult decision
i see from your meetings with the psychologist that you're completely amenable
you made no issue of sex or age and that does you great credit
she loves the child very much, but robertina is nearly six
she'll have to go to school, and her granny isn't reliable
like that it was your idea originally and i was against it
no, better not - we ought to be a bit more diplomatic
i'd rather be honest and say it was your idea originally
that doesn't mean you don't go along with it, does it?
but since love isn't measured in aesthetic terms do you think... you would agree to adopt and love a child who is not particularly attractive?
well, sure... when you want a child you can hardly go to a supermarket and pick one
miss alparti is one of the many well-connected young people... her father is a university baron and powerful art critic who wake up one fine morning and conceive a whim to be an artist
she could have been something else - a poetess, a writer a musician...
but unfortunately for us she took it into her head to be a painter with the deplorable results we can all see
i appreciate that an exhibition of her work in our gallery could be of some...
so i wonder, dear alina, why on earth... you want us to make such a bad impression?
lorenzo, why do you turn everything you say into an ideological statement?
plus this vitamin complex to be taken twice a day before meals
your problems... of conscience, let's say, are your business but you should know that your usual diet seems poor to me and totally inadequate

i want to thank you all for your enthusiasm and interest in this exhibition
which i hope will be the first of a long, successful series
i mean, one hen with ambitions to be a hen-cock and one cock who rightly aspires to be a cock couldn't have stayed together
it's wrong to think that two people... can work well together just because they're friends
your husband's on tour it was in the paper but i asked to meet you anyway to exchange first impressions between women
yes, we have a very sensitive case we want to submit to you

i thought at first that they were from a parallel culture ... but it looks like they might be way ahead of us.
we've determined humans on other planets originated here on earth, right?
umm... we'd be colonising space right now if it hadn't been for the dark ages.
there was a period of over eight hundred years where science was heresy and anathema.
it might benefit everyone ... if your people and ours could be friends.
i demand you return everything that you have taken from us and allow us to go home.
ours were reported to be quite beautiful... and, when i saw you... well... you seemed to fit the description.
and then i learned from doctor jackson that you're also a brilliant scientist.
if they don't want to be here, we've got to relocate them somewhere.
you know, general, we have done some fairly good deeds out there.
- you don't need to know how ... only that we did ... and we can do it again any time we need to.
colonel, general hammond would like to see you and your team right away, sir.
i don't believe the president meant ... to release these people until they have been through quarantine.
we don't have any idea what kinds of diseases they might be carrying.
i think it'll be kind of tough to find a civilian law to cover this.
i'll have you removed from this program for ever if you do this.
we've determined humans on other planets originated here on earth, right?
then given our present state of technology, could they be ahead of us?
i demand you return everything that you have taken from us and allow us to go home.
well, it could take a while for those volcanoes to quiet down.
our final task was to close the gate... so that no- one could return and be harmed.
well, wherever you were going, we can recalibrate the co- ordinates from here.
well, the bottom line here is your survivors have become refugees.
if they don't want to be here, we've got to relocate them somewhere.
maybe go pay a visit to some of our old friends.
captain carter, i want you and doctor jackson... to get the multi- purpose room on 5c readied as a refugee housing centre.
i read about your conflict with colonel kennedy in his report.
i assure you, such an attitude will not prevail with me, in either direction.
we don't have any idea what kinds of diseases they might be carrying.
you're playing in my ballpark now... and i have the full authority of the president.
they...called us very young, which i suppose is a hair more polite than calling us primitive, but, same idea.
anyway, they sealed their stargate,... and i don't know how to communicate with them to get it open.
we'd be colonising space now if it hadn't been for the dark ages.
for a period of over 800 years, science was heresy and anathema.
i only meant it might benefit everyone if your people and ours could be friends.
i demand you return everything you've taken from us and allow us to go home.

captain carter and dr. jackson, get the multipurpose room on 5-c readied as a refugee housing centre.
and i think it'd be kinda tough to find a civilian law to cover this.
i'll have you removed from this programme for ever if you do this!
if you are right, he will be put through cor- ai.
but we do not take revenge like this, or we are no better than the jaffa.
i mean all they said was they want to put him through cor- ai.
now near as i can figure, that is like a simple trial.
now see, it's that near as i can figure part that's got me a little worried.
what if their idea of a simple trial is a simple beheading?
has it occurred to anyone that he might not be guilty?
if he were not guilty, there would be no cor- ai.
when i first saw you, i let my anger control me, and i threatened your life.
this is counter to byrsa mandates,... and by doing it i shamed myself and my whole clan.
it doesn't make it easier, it certainly doesn't make it right.
but it does put some of the responsibility on the guy giving those orders.
worse yet is the face of the victims whom i selected... as they realize they are about to take their final human breath.
hanno's father is not the first nor the last... of those whose lives i've taken.
so to draw a parallel to an american trial,... we have to look at this as sort of like the sentencing phase.
we need to prove to these people that he doesn't deserve to die.
and how did she get to be one of the victims?
the leader of the serpent guards picked her out of a crowd of other women, at random, really.
it was difficult for me at first, i wanted to hate him.
but now i know that it was a different teal'c that chose sha'uri... and i know that if there were any way for him to help me get my wife back,... this teal'c would do it gladly.
apophis ordered me to kill one of the villagers so the rest would obey.
okay, well i think we've all heard the reader's digest version of the story,... but there's more to it, isn't there?
you have defended this jaffa repeatedly by saying he is a changed man.
and for proof you have given many examples of his firing upon his former comrades.
